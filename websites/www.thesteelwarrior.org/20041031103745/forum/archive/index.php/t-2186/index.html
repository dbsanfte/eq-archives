<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Haven't seen a thread on this.. Im seriously leaning toward the Featherwood even though the warrior mantra seems to be Stonewood.  Anyone have any serious opinions/comparisons for me?<br />
<br />
Stats:<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~rbuck33/clip.jpg<br />
<br />
I really want the Agility and Magic Resist..  AoB is nice, but *shrug*  Problem I have with the Featherwood is the proc is a Aggro reducer if I am reading correctly, which is strange since its a stun..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Featherwood=P Only because it's like 60k+ cheaper. Aura of Battle is the big thing on Stonewood, and it's insanely over-rated. So, unless your DR is very poor and you fight a lot of stuff where you'd need it, go Featherwood absolutely. It's a hell of a lot more common too. 1 run through 2-3 Avatars in Air will yield components for a few bow attempts at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Featherwood is the way to go unless you've got ridiculous amounts of plat to throw around, altho the stonewood is now under 100k on CT...difference is closing fast.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about a proc on a bow..I've got a bow of the huntsman and i've seen the thing proc probably less than 50 times in all the use it's got (I was in my 40's when I got it too).  Not something to be concerned with unless you're dumping thousands of arrows into something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Featherwood is less common on 7th, I've seen one for 100k.  Stonewood is more common to see for sale, but hovers in the 120k range.</div></div><hr />

Noticing a lot more damage from that 14atk huh? <br />
<br />
Noticing a lot more misses from that agility huh?<br />
<br />
Noticing a lot more resists from that MR huh? <br />
<br />
I understand mitigation/avoidance only comes into play AFTER dodge, parry and riposte calculations are made, so unless you're tanking AND have failed those, the agility won't matter. The resists don't matter unless you're being cast upon. The atk effects dps (if only in a small way) constantly and the regen is always on. Unless of course you're capped in worn atk or regen, in which case you're probably capped in agi too. As you approach the point where one-rounding becomes a danger, you should also be capping out agility. If you've got the cash for one, get Stonewood. If you've got the cash for both, get both and swap. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is there some reason you prattled on about agility? I kinda thought I covered the basics of the arguments 2 sentences into the 1st reply of the thread.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because it's like 60k+ cheaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
 But here, I'll be the 20th person this thread to say it. Stonewood costs a lot more, buy it if you can afford it. Otherwise get Featherwood. OMG what a worthy addition!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmmm.... One sentence about agi is 'prattling' when the OP specifically mentioned it as a feature he was interested in, yet comments about AoB and DR are worthy discussion topics? Must've missed that memo.<br />
<br />
If you're hurting on cash, get a fire bow, which *should* be much cheaper than either of the above. If you're *really* hurting on cash, just wait a month and the Stonewood prices will have halved again. If he's only considering the stats, I'm guessing the price difference is immaterial to him /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">4 sentences on agility, directly following a quote from me. As if I made some crand &quot;GOGO Agi!&quot; statement=P<br />
<br />
 Even if I had an extra 35-60k to spend on 14atk, I wouldn't. It's retarded. If you do 100dps every single fight, it will get you to right around 101-102dps. Atk effects are completely overblown on droppable gear. feh, just a minor thing that bugs me. Dun mean to de-rail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sure stonewood is nice, but seriously over rated. The fact is that if you have to buy one of these bows, then chances are you are you are better off getting the cheapest one you can find (Obsidianwood compound bow). The reason to get one of these bows is to get a range item with 100hp and some AC so you don't have to keep swapping range items when you need a bow. Not only that, if you are in a position that you have to buy an elem bow, getting a 100hp range item is easier said than done.<br />
<br />
For the difference in price from the cheapest elem bow to a stonewood, you could buy all kinds of other upgrades like a Copper hammer or some piece of ornate. It's all about bang for the buck, and you can get a lot more use out of that 40k buying something else and sacrificing 1.5% increase in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I had a featherwood bow months ago before I was in an Elemental guild and it cost me 130k. When I realized I was not a ranger and didn't need a machine gun bow I sold it (for 40k loss) and bought a stonewood.<br />
<br />
Stonewood bow is a solid bow you shouldn't need to replace but if money is an issue go with what you can afford.<br />
<br />
Just remember in another month you may not want the Featherwood and end up wasting more time and plat to sell it and buy a stonewood than just waiting on what you want.<br />
<br />
Both bows do good damage but warriors are not bow damage classes so the damge means little. What you should ask yourself is what is more usefull to you as a warrior. A worn regen/atk effect or some 75 point DD proc with 200 agro reducer...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that separates the Featherwood/Stonewood from Obsidian is the fact that the first 2 both have 10 stamina too, and that's a big consideration.  Why bother with a 100hp bow when you can get a 10 sta/100hp bow for just a little more.  Even if you're stamina capped, it's still a good idea because it gives you room to swap elsewhere when you're able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why bother with a 100hp bow when you can get a 10 sta/100hp bow for just a little more I suppose that is something to consider, but I would expect someone who has this kind of plat to spend on a bow should probably be capped on STA pretty easily. I had a featherwood, which I sold since I couldn't equip it yet anyway. As soon as I get another fiend gut, I will bank an Obsidianwood for later use. STA is too easy to come by to blow 20K+ to get 10 more. In another couple of weeks, even plate ornate will be cheap enough to get a piece for 20k. Again the question becomes, upgrade one slot and have some marginally useful effect/stat or upgrade a second slot and pick up some HP and AC? Choice is yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saw a few ideas about giving Bow hate thingies, so you can get aggro on pull..<br />
<br />
well here it is, your aggro bow....<br />
<br />
not only is it a machine gun, but it can proc a nice hate giver...<br />
yes, it GIVES hate. The way the spell is described is odd...<br />
Even enraging blow is considered a hate reducer if taken literally from spell info....<br />
<br />
Anyhow...<br />
<br />
who cares about the ratio?... youre no ranger, your damage from a bow is going to suck anyhow....<br />
<br />
between str and agi... well str is pretty easy to max, agi is always a problem though (granted it's a worthless skill :p )...<br />
<br />
the effect... THAT is what is important between the two...<br />
<br />
and frankly, i wouldnt mind at all giving up in a crappy AoB for something that could give me good aggro on inc..<br />
<br />
here we are, a possible good aggro on inc, but people want a ridiculous regen/attk... bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I suppose that is something to consider, but I would expect someone who has this kind of plat to spend on a bow should probably be capped on STA pretty easily <br />
<br />
/shrug.  I'm at 275....capped on stamina, and I usually have that kinda plat to throw around.  The biggest thing is that it would replace my Idol of the Thorned range, so if I switched to a 100hp bow, i'd end up losing all the Stamina HP.  Even if I was capped without the Idol, I'd still want 10 sta so that I can get stamina off of some other slot and replace it with more HP...IE, that shitty valorium ring that only has 65hp on it.  <br />
<br />
In another couple of weeks, even plate ornate will be cheap enough to get a piece for 20k <br />
<br />
Ornate is definitely less of an upgrade over Fierce to justify 20k than getting a 100hp bow with 10 stamina on it.  While the non RZ tanks may consider that piece of wisdom, i'm looking at my 80hp greaves and wondering what exactly I'd want to spend on a 5hp upgrade.  Same for taking a 5hp cut on my boots to get 15atk, and taking a 10hp cut on each bracers to get 10atk.  So for a lot of us, it's not really a case of 10 sta, vs some HP and AC.  It's 10 stamina vs a HP cut and some Vengeance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enraging blow is shown to increase hate.<br />
<br />
Ethereal Strike is shown to decrease hate.<br />
<br />
It is clear to me which makes your hate higher, and which does not.<br />
<br />
If you look at the spell Jolt, it says decrease hate, are you telling me that rangers are adding taunt with Jolt? Surely you jest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'd definately suggest the Featherwood hands down for a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
First, lets ignore the cost factor, because although that's a big factor for many people, we'll assume anyone having a hard time choosing would spend the extra money for the Stonewood if they decided it was a big enough benefit.<br />
<br />
That said, the simple fact of the matter is Featherwood's stats have a much larger impact over the Stonewood for Warriors.<br />
<br />
The Featherwood has 15 AGI, which while many warriors may have it maxxed, not many that haven't gotten a 'raid awarded' piece of loot equal or better than an elemental bow (I.E. non-elemental flagged Warriors) are going to have maxxed AGI.<br />
<br />
Stonewood, on the otherhand, has 15 STR, which is arguably the easiest stat for a warrior to max out given all the buffs available and the commonality of it on our equipment.<br />
<br />
They both have 10 STA, so that's a moot point.<br />
<br />
No one cares about the INT/WIS/MANA so that's moot as well.<br />
<br />
The 35 SV Magic or Disease is a huge factor in my eyes.  If you look at the mobs you fight over the course of a week, for example (both raid and exp mobs), you'll find the VAST majority require SV Magic over SV Disease.  Only a few select mobs/zones have mobs that use many SV Disease attacks (remember, slow has Disease counters but saves to Magic), so the 35 SV Magic, added onto your already gained artificial SV Magic as a Warrior, will shoot you up a great deal and give you a fair chance at resisting many Sv Magic spells without buffs or with very few buffs (Save Magic from a priest or ENC.)  This definately points towards the Featherwood.<br />
<br />
The effects on the bows, which seems to be the biggest factor for most people arguing for the Stonewood, is really not that much of a factor for either.  As pointed out, the 10 Atk will give you *hardly* any actual damage increase (remember, your STR is likely to be maxed in most cases if you're at all decently equipped or buffed), and the 2 HP regen is certainly not going to offset anything nowadays; it won't make the difference between that CH landing or not landing when you're getting hit for 500+, nor will it negate ANY AE spells that you'll be taking in the 60+ game.  The only thing it's good for is farming greens with your Fungi or what not on as well, and regenning (slowly) after a res.<br />
<br />
The effect on the Featherwood, honestly, doesn't really matter either.  Who cares if it lowers your agro, how often do you use a bow to 'increase' agro anyway, other than initial agro in which case you're the only one on the hate list to begin with?  Never.  And if it does happen to proc, which is very rarely as it is, you'll do 75 damage from it assuming no resist, which is fine and dandy.  Certainly doesn't hurt.  <br />
<br />
I don't know about most Warriors, but I assume it's similar to me, and when I pull 95% of the time I use my Featherwood and the best range arrows I can, and I generally have to shoot a few (2 - 4) arrows to actually land one/get the mob's attention, due to pathing the arrow, geometry of the area vs. where the mob is, etc.  This brings up the other factor, is that the Featherwood has a significantly lower delay, which means you can shoot arrows in sequence much faster than with the Stonewood.  Since you aren't going for damage just to gain agro/pull, you'll want the fastest thing you can to spit out 3 or 4 arrows and grab the mob as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
I think that covers most everything.  Really, the only factor in my eyes are the SVs and delay; if you can afford both and swap them out then great, otherwise I'd strongly suggest the Featherwood.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Everyone has their own opinion on the bows but I stand by the stonewood being more useful for warriors. The speed you can shoot means little since most warriors only use for pulling. The damage over time is greater on Featherwood but per shot Stonewood blows it away if that means anything to you.<br />
The effect is at least useful 24/7 on the stonewood where as the proc on the featherwood means nothing when it rarely does go off.<br />
<br />
I sold my featherwood for a huge loss to buy a stonewood and would do it again if I had the choice but get the bow you want and can afford is the best advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Basically for me the stonewood is better.<br />
<br />
Yes a small increase in atk may not seem like a big deal but consider this...<br />
<br />
If you could upgrade your AC by 14 in a slot you would do it (even if you had 1400 AC).  True it's not a huge percent .01 but every bit helps. <br />
<br />
I'd rather have DR then MR as my MR is pretty good but my poison/diease isn't.<br />
<br />
On pulls I can get agro with one hit from a stonewood (usually hit's for 80-120 with my skill of 165 in archery)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Good point Haass, it is situational. If you are an RZ warrior with full FH, it doesn't hurt to spend an extra 20k to get a featherwood. If you are not an RZ warrior or you do not have full FH, then I would buy the cheapest bow you can get and buy some ornate/FH with the plats you save.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Got my Featherwood yesterday.  Wanted to say, a couple of things weren't mentioned in this thread.  <br />
<br />
1. (very important) the Featherwood bow is needed for completion of the Signet of Might/Signet of the Arcane quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2429) which means the Featherwood will always maintain a certain level of value.<br />
<br />
2. Some seem to think the Featherwood is common and I don't understand this.  Speaking from my server, nobody exp's in Air, as I'm told its a very annoying zone.  So the only time components turn up for Featherwood bows is on a rare Avatar clearing, and usually those components will go back into Featherwood bows for the guild.  Featherwoods are very rare on 7th, Stonewoods are common.</div></div><hr />

The same INGEDIENTS as a featherwood go into making the Signet bow, you just add the quest piece to the combine. You cannot make a signet bow out of a featherwood bow.<br />

Featherwoods are very rare on 7th, Stonewoods are common.They are common on servers where Xegony is killed a lot. We get enough for several bows every time we do Xegony. I would imagine servers with a PoTimer rotation or 3+ EP guilds probably have an abundance of bows since everything gets killed as soon as it spawns. None of the featherwood parts are rare, unlike the other 3 that have at least 1 hard to get component.<br />
<br />
FYI Featherwood is down to 55k on my server, down from 80k a week ago, stonewood still 100-120k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">He's partially correct, we h8 Xeg~  whore of air.  Still kill her all the same but she has a longer life span than say Fennin does.  Keep also in mind that on 7th our ritalin infected masses have yet to pwn Coirnav or Rathe (nope no PoTime enabled guilds... YET).<br />
<br />
So, not a lot of PoA clearings although since we went from 2 guilds ele flagged to 5 in like a couple weeks with another hot on the heels of RZ... I think we can expect to see more items out of air.<br />
<br />
All that said, my guild furnished all melee with whatever bow they desired out of the 4.  Vast majority of us went Stonewood (I think we doled out 20-30 of em).  I believe we sell them on the open market, not sure their price tho.</div></div><hr />

most ppl in guild have stonewood because it is farmable with xp groups and everyone wants to xp there anyways. never seen anyone xp in air, easily the nastiest ep zone to xp in.<br />

personally ive found DR and CR to be more useful than MR, not that it really matters, most things require 500 to resist what u need with any consistency.<br />

if i had to buy one it would be the 60k cheaper one. personally i still get by on summon fangs and charm of defense in range. all range slots should have 300 range bolt click = p</div></div><hr />
