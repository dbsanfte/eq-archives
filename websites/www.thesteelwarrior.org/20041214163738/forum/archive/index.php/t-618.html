<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all know melee damage is out of whack in PoP in proportion to caster damage.<br />
<br />
I posted this on The Safehouse and wanted to see what warriors though of it as well:<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I think they had the right idea when they nerfed paladins for, like what, a day.<br />
<br />
Somehow, ramp up the damage done by melee (through diciplines, AAs, SOMETHING) but make it so that as the damage is being used to its full capacity, defensive abilities are not.<br />
<br />
Casters might do an incredibly unbalanced amount of damage in PoP, but they do so with a bit more risk. Insane amounts of damage in no time can draw aggro quite easily (ask any overnuking wizard/druid/mage/necro) and these classes have much less defensive capabilities. Even with raid buffs, a 7k druid is going to go down much faster than a 7k ranger, for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
My idea: <br />
Either have a toggle, where you set a command at how offensive you wish to be along a sliding scale (/offensive 25 = 25% offensive, 75% defensive) or just a toggle (/offensive on) that turns on increased melee damage at greater risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know how easy that would all be to code, but seeing as how they already do something similar with warrior /discs and they did have something like that written into the Paladin Slay Undead AA for about 5 minutes, it couldn't be too hard to code, right?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know it doesn't really increase the damage output of the tank, as he'd want to mitigate as much damage to him/her as possible, but it seems fair enough. I wouldn't want a warrior that's concentrating on getting hit by the big bad mob doing as much damage as any other melee (including warriors) doing damage from behind the big bad mob. It even makes role play sense!<br />
<br />
(btw, don't freak out Paladins, I'm not suggesting they re-nerf SU, just that the idea was a possible tool for the implentation for accross the board melee damage upgrades)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see two areas of dmg that need to be looked at and both are lopsided towards casters IMO.<br />
<br />
1.  Sustained damage.  Most high level casters are able to sustain a safe, continuous flow of dmg through spells that is still WAY more than what most melee can do.  Some melee come closer than others, but all pretty much lag behind the casters in this area.<br />
<br />
2.  Burst damage.  Casters do even more damage at higher risk if they throw caution to the wind and fire away -- the amount of dmg they can do is awesome when you factor in their AA skills, focus effects and such.  Melees rely on disciplines primarily for this (at least non-tanking warriors do) -- fire off an offensive disc and you get a nice burst of damage, but again, this still lags behind what casters can dish out through spells.<br />
<br />
So really both of these need to be looked at separately.  <br />
<br />
Sustained damage they can fix by changing damage tables (my personal preference), skill caps, damage bonuses or something like that.  Since this is for regular damage you do all the time there should be no added defensive risks associated with this type of change.  <br />
<br />
For burst damage they could fix that with discipline or AA changes, but for this there should be greater risk added to be able to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are so unbalanced, fucked up, and useless it can only make things worse.<br />
Your idea is nice but i dont like because it can be very very hard to balance.<br />
Plus i dont want negative side-effects. They just suck.<br />
<br />
The current Life Expentensy Under Fire is quite balanced.<br />
<br />
Casters die insanely fast.<br />
Priests last a bit longer.<br />
Chains got a shot at living.<br />
Plate actually survive.<br />
<br />
If u want to boost warriors :<br />
* Increase taunt success rate (specially on blue stuff)<br />
* Add a 20-80 hate points per taunt<br />
<br />
And last : Add some dps (i dont care how,  just give us 100atk).<br />
<br />
What everyone forgets is that casters, have a HUGE advantage in DPS.<br />
They can do BURST dps, while we cant. <br />
And their DPS isnt as limited to 1 spell as hours (haste)</div></div><hr />

I'll bet you get a 2.5 to 1 ratio.<br />
<br />
Compare wizard DPS buffless &amp; full buffed.<br />
I'll bet you'll get a 4.5 to 1 ratio (not to say higher).<br />
<br />
Not only melees need help do to decent DPS.<br />
But they get less gain from that help. And they cant burst.<br />
<br />
Just give wars a bit more dmg, and a LOT of easy xp agro.<br />
And our class will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Sustained damage. Most high level casters are able to sustain a safe, continuous flow of dmg.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem with touching this issue, is that most lower level casters are -not- able to sustain a continuous flow of damage.  Mana pools on the average casual player are much smaller and mana regen is equally lagging behind.  Giving melee more sustained damage would need to be handled VERY carefully because screwing it up would make casual casters undesirable in group exp situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus i dont want negative side-effects. They just suck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noone should have their cake and eat it too.  Tanks tank, damage dealers do damage.  I, personally, don't think tanks should do more damage unless they aren't tanking.  Especially considering the possibility of damage that can be done through damage shields these days.<br />
<br />
<br />
The biggest issue my idea doesn't address is AE liability.  Casters can avoid the AE spells of many of the boss mobs, as far back as Velious (I don't remember being able to hide from Naggy/Vox/Kunark dragons).  Melee, on the other hand, need to be in range of the AE generally and are much more exposed.  They do, of course, have more hitpoints, but it is still out of balance.  In PoP, some of the rampage/AEs are so intense that melee are prefered to stay out of AE range as well, reducing them to throwing or archery do to damage, which except for rangers is nowhere near as effective as the already underpowered straight melee.</div></div><hr />

If the next expansion is made up of inside zones, the casters DPS will drop like a rock, so how can they make it that melee dps only goes up in outside zones to match the increase dps casters have in outside zones.<br />
<br />
Maybe have melee be allowed to buy warhogs that they ride into battle and do the extra damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious how you got this figure. It seems to me that it's a good deal less than that, unless they have to remain standing and off of a mount most of the time.<br />
<br />
Damage caster damage may be a bit out of whack now, hard to say, I'm not a damage caster, and I'm not high end by any means. But I'm not sure that it's much more out of whack than how melees had it good in Velious, and to a lesser extent Luclin. I know several people that quit their wizards/mages to make melee in that era because they simply couldn't keep up with the melees for sustained DPS. Being the master of burst DPS doesn't mean much in 10+ minute fights.<br />
<br />
Melees are lagging right now, but I'm not sure it's just a matter of a shortage of melee DPS.</div></div><hr />

LOL! That would be interesting to say the least. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its really simple!<br />
<br />
Take those offensive AA's like raging flurry, PB, fury of the ages and increase the percentage on them 25+ % for the dps.  Have them actually put out twice as much additional damage as they are doing now.  Even that won't come close to other classes all powerful damage.  But it will help and would give us around 25% more additional damage.  Please do not give us ANYMORE AA SKILLS TO LEARN AGAIN.  Try improving on ones you gave us all ready.<br />
<br />
For the aggro throw out every freaking disc V ever gave us outside of evasive and defensive and give us INNATE built in hate aggro according to our levels we don't need to push a freaking button for.  Its on us all the time when we attack any mob.<br />
<br />
An example:<br />
Level 40 Warrior raise 100 points on Hate List<br />
Level 50 Warrior raise 500 points on Hate List<br />
Level 60 Warrior raise 1000 points on Hate List<br />
Level 65 Warrior raise 1500 points on Hate List<br />
<br />
Ok..the amounts are a bit high but ya get the idea.<br />
<br />
To me then you solve the dps and the aggro issues.<br />
<br />
I would fall over backwards if they did either of these suggestions btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think all they need to do is take the timer off of defensive , evasive and agressive , have them all on a simple toggle button ,ready whenever wanted.<br />
<br />
This would allow warriors to tank the hole mob instead of 3 mins . It would allow non MT warriors to crank out some good dps. And it would allow the warrior to use some of his other disciplines without haveing to panic that defensive/evasive wont be available.<br />
<br />
 Each of these disciplines has a negative side effect , so really i dont see a need to have a timer on them . I mean realistically these 3 should be available any time , if your getting beat on hard u should be able to decide your gonna lay off the offensive and concentrate on defence , and any time u decide to change out you should be able to, then maybe switch to aggressive when the mob is fleeing or attacking someone else.<br />

Bonus DPS (as FT) = 454%<br />
<br />
A wizard with all his buffs (self &amp; other) can multiply by 5 his DPS.<br />
(Thats under the right condition)<br />
<br />
Now i dare ask, How can u mutliply by 5 the DPS of a warrior ?<br />
Hell even by 2 or 3.  You cant. And we dont have burst dps either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps: Focus + Spells + FT15 = Weapon + Haste + Vengeance</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I know playing a FT15 decently focus'd wizard I can stand and nuke pretty much non-stop for a good 4-5 minutes depending on my spell loadout. Horse has nothing to do with DPS. Half the time I don't even sit between fights. Between all the mana regen stuff there's not much need unless it's a really big pull I'm coming out of. Then maybe I med for 1 minute.<br />
<br />
 Basically though, lotta misconceptions about wizards here=P<br />
<br />
1: Nuking isn't hard=P If you think it's tough to manage agro as a burner you just aren't good at it.<br />
<br />
2: More mana does not mean more DPS in general. Focus effects = more dps. Blessing of Reverence, Iceflame, Rizlona's = more DPS.<br />
<br />
 Now, take the caster crap to Graffe's =P<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
 Anyone remember VI saying months ago, like pre-PoP they were going to give warriors something to make them more fun/desirable? A &quot;gimmick&quot; in their words. We got /shield. So tell me, how much fun are you all having with /shield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, EmiliaEQ I see why your numbers seemed high, you are assuming the wizard never sits. Seems a little skewed, but ok, I suppose it will be the case in PoP  boss mob fights. But of course in those fights mana regen isn't nearly as much of an issue as mana pool size, so thier effectiveness is not multiplied by the amounts you give. Those numbers are for sustained damage only.<br />
<br />
The fact that DPS casters recieve more from buffs doesn't necessarily mean things are horribly skewed. That assumes that the classes are balanced while unbuffed. I did some quick calculations that are a bit rough, but I ended up with a wizard with FT15 as his only mana regen casting Strike of Solusek having a sustained DPS of about 20, though his burst damage would be much higher. But the figures that you gave were for sustained DPS, so I figued this was a fair comparison. I'd be willing the bet that the DPS of a comparably geared warrior would be a good deal higher than that unbuffed. Primarily it just shows that wizards are more buff dependent than melees for sustained damage.<br />
<br />
Calculations were as follows:<br />
Spell is 2740 damage for 640 mana.<br />
Actual mana cost = ~(0.8)640 = 512 because of specialization and SCM3<br />
512 mana / 15 mana per tick = ~34 ticks to regen the mana used, or about 204 seconds.<br />
2740 damage / 204 secs = 13.4 dps<br />
Multply that by 1.4 or so for focus effects and AAs = 18.8 DPS<br />
Very rough calculations, I admit.</div></div><hr />
