<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this is in the right forum but i was looking at the thread about single group gear in GoD and i saw a few items i'd like to get. Namely the Befouled Neckguard, the Stonemite Carapace Mask, and the polished garnet loop. <br />
<br />
Looks like it would involve Vxed, and the sewers of Nihilia<br />
<br />
My question is, based on my Magelo can I tank there or would I get my ass kicked? <br />
<br />
I'm working my defensive and Hp AA's along with Ae taunt.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to do the sewers with a well rounded group. Vxed/tipt is a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mithlani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you would have trouble with the named at the end of Sewer 1.<br />
<br />
The other three would be okay so long as you had two healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sewers 1 would be tough, 2 &amp; 3 would be OK, not sure about 4 since I've not done that one.<br />
<br />
Vxed would be a no go unless you are just a tag along with a group that uses a charm pet. I can barely tank there, mobs have very high dps, especially before they get slowed. I haven't tried Tipt and won't until I can break 10k buffed (700 to go!). :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wasnt the rule of thumb that if you can tank hard ldons you are ready to start tanking teh first trials? <br />
<br />
in god trials what you basically have is mobs that CAN hit for about 800 - 1300 or so but USUALLY hit for a good deal less. its spikes that kill in GoD, those lucky rounds where the mob suddenly full quads you for full damage. its difficult to plan for it as a healer and usually dumping fast heals works better than complete heal. so you are tied to the mana pool/mana regen of your cleric and essentially you are only as good as your healer.<br />
<br />
if you want some inspiration to keep trying; check my magelo, both earrings, both wrists,legs, one ring, range slot and several augs are all from one group mobs in either the first 6 trials, or in KT/ikkinz which is where you can go once you beat the trials ( i used to have the  garnet loop but replaced it in KT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends where in GoD you go. Many mobs still have asanine dps spikes with hit ranges from 350~ish to 1500, not to mention chaos series procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My hp and ac are right in your neighborhood. My regular group is currently going through the sewers. We've won the first one and have been rocking around the others in an attempt to farm nameds.<br />
<br />
So, yes, you can do it. BUT ---  so much depends on your group mates. If they don't manage aggro, they'll get kia'd real fast, then it doesn't matter what your ac and hps are.<br />
<br />
Good luck with them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have 2 top-quality healers you can probably tank in vxed / tipt but it will be slow going.<br />
<br />
I would recommend focusing on LDON to build up some of your big pieces like greaves and add some 40hp augs.</div></div><hr />
