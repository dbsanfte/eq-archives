<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can tell you ... as I somehow made up this group (and won):<br />
<br />
Me, 65 warrior<br />
<br />
Healer, 65 druid.<br />
<br />
DPS 65 Wizzard, 63 mage<br />
<br />
Other: 62 Pally, 62 Ranger.<br />
<br />
Now I have 50+ LDoN wins and usually lead. I have no idea what I was thinking when I put this group together, though I have to admit I was low blood sugar. (That's my excuse, I am sticking with it.)<br />
<br />
I did not htink you could do a regular LDoN without any of hte stuff we are used to having in groups. I am used to making due without a lot of them but all the support classes? I would have said its impossible without puller, cleric, haste, slow, clerity, etc being in group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL I would have swapped nearly anyone in the group for someone who could slow (as ranger did not have main hand epic). <br />
<br />
Quite possibly the stupidest group possible with the comeplete lack of suport  classes. THere is a very nice spread of DPS though, that I will admit to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need any of the *normal* group settings for 'easy' Ldon adventures. Almost any 3+ classes can do a Ldon Advent and win it, as long as you have some type of healer. Maybe even that not needed... a group consisting of 3+ mages or 3+ necro's can most likely win too. As long as you have DPS you win the advent, CC, slows, haste, pulling.. all that is way less important.<br />
<br />
They're a heck of a lot more fun to do like that anyway... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, almost any 6 can win a normal LDoN if they can play.  I did one with 5 tanks and a cleric.  Easy!  The group above looks good, especially in Tak where the mage can mez many of the mobs.<br />
<br />
I love BSTs in my group, and Pallies too.  That group heal is the win.  Rangers are always appreciated.<br />
<br />
I did one in Tak last night with me, cleric, druid, pally, mage, monk.  Complete destruction, won with tons of time left.  Some lame ass SK dropped the group when he saw we had no slower, and were &quot;doomed to fail&quot;.  Wanker.  Mage took his place - and we were better for it in more ways than one :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we did Three rogues the other day with BST and war and cleric.<br />
<br />
We just tanked 4 mobs at once and won in about 22 minutes. it was really fun.<br />
<br />
Last funky group I had was 4 melee and a cleric. The bard went LD and never came back.<br />
<br />
No CC no slow, just fight fight fight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did an EF adventure with me, a cleric, and 4 necros. We finished with 5 minutes left due to a major wipe where 10+ mobs somehow agroed, but it was cake most of the time. I would pull, each of the necros would solo any adds and the cleric would keep just me alive since the necros could tap the mobs, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">arf arf<br />
<br />
3 bards, 1 ranger, 1 cleric, and myself.  Cleric meleed and nuked the whole time as he wasn't healing.  Big stupid fun.  As Ahz said  - any 6 can win if they can play.  Heck, up to around 40 any trio can, if they're paying attention and quick off the mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">collections/slaughters can easily be done in less then a hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a Mistmoore once with Cleric, Chanter, Necro, Beast, Mage and my warrior. Tried a collection. The fun started when the cleric went LD 10 minutes in and never came back. We still managed to get all but 2 drops in the time alloted and easily got the 13 point bonus, with a beast and Necro doing healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only requirement for LDoN normals seems to be a priest class to heal, though there have probably been a couple of successful groups to go through without even that.<br />
<br />
Some of the less vanilla groups I have been in <br />
- 3 bards, warrior, druid, rogue <br />
- war, pal, enc, shm, nec, wiz <br />
- 3 mages, enc(me), cleric, monk<br />
<br />
Lower DPS on the mobs means that you can get by without a plate class to tank, without a cleric or druid to heal, and without a slower.  Those things will make a group more likely safer and more able to handle every situation, but other group combinations can be much more fun and often have more DPS and finish adventures faster.  <br />
<br />
Its getting back to the state we had a few months before the release of PoP when the best groups were grab any 6 people and head to Seb or Velks or Chardok and have a ball.  I remember a ME group consisting of 4 warriors a bard and a paladin which was perfectly successful, and another group, a trio of warrior, ranger, chanter which I XP'd in Seb with for hours.<br />
<br />
How long till 6 warriors with earthshaker and rampage AE an entire LDoN dungeon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shaman, warrior, shadow knight, paladin, monk, necro = 25 minutes adventures. <br />
<br />
Funny thing is that when we traded the paladin with a time geared wizard we slowed down to 30-35 minutes.</div></div><hr />
