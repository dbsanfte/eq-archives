<br />
Last night I joined the MT-Alliance called &quot;George&quot; which is a pop flagging alliance of 10 guilds. I am in a small guild that is Tradeskill Oriented. <br />
<br />
I just made 65 last week and am now pushing for AA's. <br />
<br />
I did a Hedge Raid last night and was MA. (it went well but could have been better)<br />
<br />
Should I push for Area Taunt for MA on these flagging events or push Defensive and HP aa's. <br />
<br />
My magelo is posted in my signature and also on the side of my posts and I am working LDoN's for armor upgrades while i get flags so we can hit some zones. <br />
<br />
ANY help is appriciated in gear and AA choices so I can be a better MA for this group when they need me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you DO have to get 12 archetype AAs before you can get AE taunt. I'd suggest finishing up ND, then getting CA1 and CS1 then PE. AE taunt is very nice, for sure, but it isn't as constantly useful as more hp and taking less damage.<br />
<br />
 Also, with the number of procs you have I'd suggest spending 2 AA in WA1 very soon. It's a great return for 2 AAs... It should add approximately .6 procs per minute, which would increase your aggro very nicely.<br />
<br />
  As for gear, you seem to have the idea in general, though your ac seems low to me. I suggest using a 1ac = 1sta = 6hp formula, until you're capped on stamina. For specifics, I'd try to replace that helm, hopefully with ornate.</div></div><hr />

(I now only really use it for AEing multiple mobs)<br />
<br />
I would go defensive first.<br />
If ye just hit 65 and are looking to start MTing raids, odds be ye going to need all the defensive AA ye can get till ye get 65ish gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would use this order<br />
<br />
hit lv 65<br />
cap off defensives<br />
work on a lv or 2 of WA<br />
get ae taunt<br />
work on all hp aas other that 100% sturd<br />
finish WA<br />
stalwart endurance 3 (for non ogres)<br />
finish GoD hps<br />
<br />
after that the world is your playground ... go get run5 or work on your offensives.<br />
<br />

AE taunt is nice to have but by no means a must.  It's great for tank transitioning and for saving casters.  The other day in tipt the damn bard pulled 8 mobs on us ... AE taunt + fortitude and we survived ... it bought us just enough time for the ench and bard to lock it all down ... 0 deaths.   That would have been impossible w/out ae taunt .. but its situationally usefull pretty much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As nice as adding &quot;free&quot; HP is via AAs, I'd recommend getting Defensive(ID/LR) first. AE Taunt is a definate check off in the DO list, but not at the top of it, you have a crappy version called Taunt which supposedly works too(Anyone confirm this?) but be a better tank before trying to be the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'd get WA1 right away. The added aggro is huge for such a low cost. Remember: defensive AAs do you no good if the mob isn't hitting you.</div></div><hr />

Thats a what, 10 mod to the proc? meaning You just added like 40 more hate per min on a droga weapon for 2 AAs, sorry i'd say thats a waste when you could be doing 2% better mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's .6 more procs per minute with a double augmented DW setup. (2 procs mainhand stun + 2 procs mainhand anger + 1 proc offhand stun + 1 proc offhand anger) X 10% increased procs. That's an additional 240 hate per minute, and just as importantly increases the chances of an earlier proc. For 2 AAs, that's a steal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WA is amazing ... and the first 2 levels are so cheap that i'd agree with fite on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with the old defensive stuff first.Ca3 then Cs3,ND3,PE,LR,ID,PD etc.Then I'd mix in ae taunt with a few levels of WA and Sturdiness.It worked well for me then.I found imho the defensive stuff payed off more getting them maxed one by one rather than spreading them out.If you find yourself playing sa more often than ma ae taunt will be more of an advantage.</div></div><hr />
