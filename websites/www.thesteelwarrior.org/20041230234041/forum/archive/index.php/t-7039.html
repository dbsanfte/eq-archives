<br />
examples: <br />
<br />
Cold dmg: 1 <br />
Magic dmg: 4<br />
<br />
When calculating Bane damage, I always just add the number in to the damage for calculations (which may or may not be the right thing to do).<br />
<br />
Obviously in the above examples, dps is gonna be more than if you ignored the bonus damage totally, but on a practical level how do you figure it? I'd be surprised if a sparkling shortsword: <br />
<br />
14/18 <br />
Magic dmg:  4<br />
<br />
was exactly the same as an 18/18 weapon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts, <br />

Therefore, in the case of a non-magic immune mob, I'd treat that particular sword like a 16/18  - and sidegrade immediately upon getting a 'real' 16/18.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Closer to 25-30% of the extra damage, I believe. Varies depending on NPC resists, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My parsing generally gave me ~50% of the bonus damage also on these sort of weapons.  Of course this all depends on the mobs resistance to that damage. If you have +4 fire damage you aren't going to land any of that damage in Sol Ro Tower, while on a regular raid boss that has been fully fire debuffed you might land 80% + of  that damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always looked at it like this, a 14/18 weapon with +4 magic damage is just that. but the damage still makes it a 18/18 weapon. Just remember the normal damage is mitigated my ac, the magic damage is mitigated by resist.<br />
<br />
Mitigation for your attacks is about 40%, or 60% success rate. Most people average the elemental damage as 50% success rate which is why anyone would prefer normal damage to elemental damage.<br />
<br />
Take HoH (most mobs have high MR), a 14/18 weapon, with +4 magic damage is going to have about 40% of the normal damage mitigated while about 75% of the magic damage mitigated. But if you take the same mobs in HoH, and say the weapon was 14/18 +4 fire damage. (average fire resists on HoH mobs). Then add in that a druid is in your group always casting hand of ro (-72 fire resist). Then your weapon with still have the normal 40% mitigation on your melee damage, but almost no mitigation on your fire damage. <br />
<br />
So in some cases it can me nice to have the elemental damage, but most of the time the consistency of normal melee damage is more dependable.</div></div><hr />

I think 19 in ideal situations would be stretching it a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember talking in game to Dinian who was parsing his DoD, and he said he was getting a 19 base damage more than anything else...although I don't remember what he was parsing on.<br />
<br />
The way you can tell what a weapon's damage is on average is simply by parsing your weapon wherever you fight, then looking at the hit range between its base damage and its base damage + elements damage (if you're parsing from the main hand, you need to factor in damage bonus).  The number you see the most is going to be the acting &quot;mode&quot; damage (i didn't use average is because you'd have to do some multiplication and division, and I dont feel mathy today).<br />
<br />
So---to parse your Sparkling Short Sword:<br />
stick it in your offhand, put a non-slash weapon in your main hand, and spend a day parsing (it can be in various ldons, Earth, GoD, wherever).  Then see how many slashes you get for 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.  There's your damage curve.</div></div><hr />

I've parse the +1 fire and +3 cold on GRMK and DoD and both show bane firing 21% and 24% of the time on the lvl 61 rooted parse mob.<br />
<br />
If the mob was debuffed with malos or ro, these figures would increase but the above numbers are rough figures for a non-debuffed mob with low resists.</div></div><hr />
