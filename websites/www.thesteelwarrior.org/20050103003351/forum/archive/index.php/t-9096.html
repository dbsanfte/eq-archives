Step 1- Obtaining the Quest.<br />
You say, 'Hail, Korbuk Brimblade'<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/korbuk.jpg<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Well now, aren't you a meager one? Da name is Korbuk Brimblade. Have you felt anything strange lately?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I have felt something strange'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Aha, you have sensed it as well. For a while, I believed it was just me dat noticed it. Now dat you've confirmed my suspicions, I'm sure I can move forward with my [work].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what work?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Yeah, ok. You look like da respectable type. I wish it was an easy story to tell, but me thinks it's not so easy. I'm uncertain if you know da story of da red scabbard. I was named after my ancestor by da same name. In a great war, Rallos Zek bestowed to my ancestor da fabled red scabbard after Suteng was slain. It had been his charge and dat of my family to hold da scabbard until a [true warrior] would step forward to claim it as theirs once more.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am a true warrior'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Time passed and no warrior came forth. Then da terrible scourge took hold of da ogres and we began to lose ourselves. It was then dat another ancestor of mine, Grivnok Brimblade, asked a human to take charge of da scabbard until da scourge had waned. He would know dat time when a descendant of Korbuk with da same name would come forth. It was then dat da Redblade family, led by Thegrek, took over da charge of da scabbard until I would return to [reclaim da charge] in da name of da Brimblade family.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'reclaim da charge'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'It was I who returned to da Redblades, who spoke with da descendant of Thegrek. But I could not reclaim da charge. I felt a greater power, something more amazing and powerful than even da red scabbard contained. What draw I felt from da scabbard I felt ten fold from this [new source], and I was unable to explain where it was coming from. I just know dat it has drawn me here, to this place, so that I might find da answers I seek here.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what new source?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I can't express who or what it is dat is drawing me here. I only know dat this is where I must be. I feel as though this is something like da scabbard, but more powerful. Perhaps it is a new weapon? If so, I must be da one to lead da charge to protect its power until da right warrior comes along to claim it. Just as my family led da charge so long ago to protect da red scabbard, so shall I continue it with this new journey. Are you [willing to help] knowing all dat?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am willing to help'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I had hoped so. Let's get started then. It seems the powerful lure is greatest when I am at this point, so I must remain here to ensure dat I can keep a grasp on where it resides. I'm hoping dat after you return with whatever you can find, I'll be able to uncover more information. From time to time, I get flashes of da things dat we need to find, like da picture of a place or a [thing]...''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what thing'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Just now I had a flash of a book, or pages of a book. Just as quickly as the book was there, it split into da cover and three pages and then fell to da ground. I wonder if dat's going to happen often... In any case, maybe you should have a look around to see if you can find any pages from a book that are on da ground. Return to me if you find them.'<br />
<br />
Step 2- Finding Pages, book and ore.<br />
<br />
These are the known locations of the ground spawns, but there might be others.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ore<br />
+1600, +200<br />
-1068, +156<br />
<br />
The spawns are bugged right now as acknowledged by SoE. Hopefuly will be fixed in next patch.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Those... those are da pages and da cover I saw. You don't suppose dat da two are linked, do you? What if they are, what could dat mean? I don't even know what these say! I think you should take these to a linguist to decipher them. I knew one in da abysmal sea, aboard da hulking boat, but I forget his name. I do recall dat it was a funny name, though.'<br />
<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
Step 3- Rewina Jalmoy<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/rewina.jpg<br />
The NPC's name in Abysmal Sea is Rewina Jalmoy at loc -312, 252. <br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/abysmalmap.jpg<br />
He gave me &quot;Recounted History of War&quot; when I handed him the decomposing pages and cover from Dranik's Scar. The book mentions Kratak Drom and war over life in Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Rewina Jalmoy'<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Hello Vendak. What's that I see? Are you [smirking] at me? That's not very nice of you.'<br />
You say, 'smirking'<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Well, I don't think it's very nice to laugh at someone just because of his name. I didn't pick it, you know. Go laugh at my parents.'<br />
<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Oh my, what is this? Someone looking to interact with me who isn't making fun of my name?! I'm shocked! So what have you brought me, hmm? Ooo, what a collection of fine specimens! Where on Norrath did you find these? Did you find them on Norrath? Oh wordy me! I always seem to get sidetracked, but I did manage to decipher what these pages say for you. Don't be a stranger, come back and see me any time you like!<br />
<br />
(Page 1)<br />
Dranik's Vengeance<br />
<br />
The time of turmoil is at an end. We must strike back at the infidels who try to thin our numbers. From the west, we find the power of the ancients, and from the north we find refuge in our heritage.<br />
<br />
We have fought long and<br />
<br />
(Page 2)<br />
hard to ensure our way of life. We do not fear death, nor do we fear them. We live for the hunt and will make them pay, even if it means our own deaths. We call him Kratak Drom, the Broken One. He is a myth to our people, but clearly the myth is real.<br />
<br />
The pain he feels will be<br />
<br />
(Page 3)<br />
surreal, though. I find myself carving his name into my table at night, hoping for a chance at his neck, hoping to rinse my blade of his blood. His denial of our people will be his downfall and we will see to it that we bring him and his minions mercilessly to their knees.<br />
<br />
(Page 4)<br />
The war will be ours.<br />
Victory over life in Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
Item Lore: An interesting story regarding the dragorn<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade grimaces in pain for a moment before opening his eyes. 'Things are getting stranger by da moment. I just had a vision of a creature dat wanders about da area below, then it went dark. I'm not sure if this creature is part of everything else, but it certainly is something we should check out. I know it seems silly, but you should have this [rock].'<br />
<br />
You receive: Energy Receptor<br />
<br />
Energy Receptor<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP NO RENT<br />
WT: 0.1 Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Identifies as: Korbuk's vision now resides within<br />
<br />
You say, 'rock'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I was holding da rock when I had dat vision. Whatever happened to me was passed into da rock as well and I can sense some power within da rock now. Maybe holding da rock will lead you to da creature or maybe it will lead you to something near da creature, I don't really know. You have to keep a tight grip on it though, else I don't think you'll feel da power drawing you as I did. If you do find da beast, be careful. There's no telling what dangers lay in this place.'<br />
<br />
Step 4- Obtaining the ore and Blackfall Borer<br />
Put the energy receptor on your cursor. Eventually your energy receptor will point you to Blackfall Borer, a mob who is immune to all spells, has a ton of hp, light blue to a 67 and hits 150-614. There is no need to kill him. You are just after the Blackfall Ore. Blackfall Borer’s corpse will not have anything on it if you do kill him. Blackfall Borer spawns fairly often so it should not take too long. If you have already picked up Blackfall Ore from your page searching time then you can skip this portion of the quest.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/blackfalore.jpg<br />
<br />
Identifies as: A strange ore left by an even stranger creature<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'And you say you found this in a pile dat da creature left behind? I wonder what da story behind dat is... In any case, touching this gave me a brief glimpse of something sharp. It almost seemed like it was a blade. You should probably take this to get it looked at by a skill [smith].'<br />
<br />
Step 5- Blacksmith in Nedaria’s Landing.<br />
You say, 'smith'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Blacksmith, yes. She's dealt with some of da more interesting things I've needed worked on lately and I know she'll be able to help with dat ore as well. She's in Nedaria's Landing, so you shouldn't have a lot of trouble finding her. Give her da ore and these smelting plans, she should know what to do wit them from there.'<br />
<br />
Smelting Plans<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
WT: 0.1 Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Identifies as: Instructions on how to properly smelt the blackfall ore.<br />
<br />
Now head to Nedaria’s Landing and find A blacksmith.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/blacksmith.jpg<br />
A blacksmith turns to Korezna Orecleaver when you hail. Korenza Orecleaver says she is thirsty. Give her 4 water flasks (un-stacked of course). Then she asks if she can help. Give the plans and ore to her and you get back Blackfall Blade (no stats).<br />
<br />
Give Blade to Korbuk, he gives blade back and the next step of Quest.<br />
<br />
Step 6- Borer in Vxed.<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says, ‘Somehow da creature dat left da ore has made its way back to Norrath and is tearing through da mountainsides! You have to head it off in da crumbling caverns of Vxed before it can get any further! Be careful, though. I had a vision of some of its spawn with it so you may have to take care of more than just da one creature when you get there. Now Hurry!’<br />
<br />
This is an invisible flag. Make a group and head to Vxed. You will need to kill 3 Blackfall Borelings and the Blackfall Borer.<br />
<br />
The first Blackfall Boreling is spawned almost at the zone-in (-3250, -750). It is at the first cement patio, and will be the first mob you see. Appears to have LOS agro.<br />
<br />
The second Blackfall Boreling is located if you take the left path from the zone-in. Keep on that path. You will have the option to break left of keep going straight, continue straight. Then, take the straight path until it ends and you can go left or right. To the left is a large room with a bunch of mobs, this is where the second Blackfall Boreling is located.<br />
<br />
The third Blackfall Boreling is located down the path to the right side from the zone-in. He is just before crossing the bridge as if you were heading towards the NPC to win the Vxed trial.<br />
<br />
Killing all three Borelings results in a zone-wide message stating that the beast is awaiting you up the hill. You then cross the bridge and head up the hill. Soon you’ll get the option to break left, take the left road. After a few mobs you will meet the Borer. There is nothing special about him at all. He is partially slowable, max hit is around 1100 damage and has slightly more hp than the normal mobs. Kill him and loot his A Vial of Blood. Now, go back to Korbuk Brimblade. Give him the blood and he will seal the blood. Now he sends you on two errands.<br />
<br />
Step 7- Kimber whitefoot in Everfrost.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Dat was too close! You did a good job though and stopped dat beast before it could get too far on Norrath. We don't know what it might have been capable of otherwise. I've sealed da blood of da beast in a vial for you for da [journey]. I also got another [vision] when I took hold of da vial.'<br />
<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
You say, 'journey?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I noticed dat da blood gave me some kind of feeling. I'm not sure whether it was da same magic dat's been giving me visions or something new, but I'd like you to take it to a shaman I knew briefly growing up. He's a friend of da Redblade family and I'm sure he'd be willing to help. Just tell him I sent you. His name is Kimber Whitefoot and you shouldn't have trouble finding him, he's a very large barbarian.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Kimber Whitefoot spawns in Everfrost at 7am game time at the zone line to Halas and begins his run to Permafrost. Turn in the Sealed Vial of Blood.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/kimber.jpg<br />
<br />
Kimber Whitefoot says 'Great, wait out here for a while. I've got to make a trip into the frozen mountain of Permafrost, but I'll be out some time this evening. I should have enough time on my trek to examine the vial. I'll be back soon!'<br />
<br />
He kept running out into the tundra at this point and all the way to permafrost where he stood for a second or two and despawned. At 7pm game time he repopped and headed back to Halas. Hail him.<br />
<br />
Kimber Whitefoot says 'Yes, yes, you again. I had a chance to examine the vial you gave me. Quite an interesting substance, I must say. Scary though. Where did you say you found it? Nevermind, it's not important. I made a potion out of the vial, but I can feel an evil presence within. I want to be rid of it, so you can have it back. Please don't come to me with anything like that again. I'm really not into dealing with spirits of such heinous design. Good luck.'<br />
<br />
You now receive a Potion of Blackfall Spirit. Take this back to Korbuk Brimblade and hand it to him.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade gags as he takes hold of the potion, then quickly returns it to you. 'I had no idea such a strong presence would be coming from this after Kimber worked with it. I hope he's ok. Now dat we've taken care of dat, we can focus on the last [vision] I had.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'vision'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Da vision I had showed me an impish creature. It was dark and twisted and seemed to devour energy from da chaos surrounding us. I don't know what part it plays in this, but like everything else, I'm sure it's important. Perhaps there is another portal around dat was destroyed, like it was in Taelosia. See if you can find it and look for da creature there, then return to me whatever it may have in its possession dat we can use.'<br />
<br />
Step 7B- Girplan Devourer in Bloodfields.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/griplan.jpg<br />
Girplan Devourer is level 70 and doable with 3 groups easily. He does a DoT.<br />
The DoT has a resist check of 150 against disease. it does a 500/tick hp reduction and also does a minor AC reduction. just keep your first slot cleared before fight and his knockback will keep dispelling his DoT.<br />
<br />
he hits really low compared to what his max hit is, i maybe got hit for max 3 times the entire fight. also, he can be slowed. he does rampage and occassionally flurries. hes not a hard fight, but he has a decent amount of hit points. the max hit i got while defensive was maybe 1200s, wasnt watching too much because there was really no danger. even without defensive though, his usual hit seemed to be in the 600 range.<br />
<br />
Loot the Hilt and turn it in to Korbuk Grimblade.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Grimblade says, 'What a worthless specimen this is. I don't understand why my vision would show me dat creature if all it had was this mediocre quality hilt. I also don't understand why there's energy emanating from da hilt when it cannot be used to wield a blade in its current state. I think we're going to have to look into [cleaning up da hilt].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'cleaning up da hilt?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Grimblade says, 'Right now it would fall apart if you tried to attach a blade to it. We're going to put some luster back into da hilt and I think I may know someone who can do it. I don't remember her name or even where I found her, but I do remember running into a [shady jeweler] on da outskirts of one of the larger cities of kunark.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what shady jeweler?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Grimblade says, 'She worked on da outskirts to sell to less reputable individuals, like myself. She didn't live on the outskirts though, only worked there. I want to say she was part of da port authority, but I can't quite remember. I also don't remember her name, or if I even ever knew it, but I do remember dat she was one of da best I ever dealt with. Take da hilt to her, if you can find her, and see what she can do with it. One more thing, she's a fan of her own tongues, so be prepared for dat when you speak with her.'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 8- Corfia Nultethen in Firiona Vie.<br />
She is a high elf located at -3820, +1400. This location is on the large dock that leads to the Translocator, shes located on a small room on the left. To talk to her, you must speak Elder Elvish.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/corfia.jpg<br />
<br />
The language can be easily PLed by getting spammed random sentences by someone who is fluent in Elder Elvish in about 10 mins.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Corfia Nultethen'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Yes, what can I do for you?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Korbuk sent me'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'That's really quite fascinating, but doesn't mean a whole lot to me. I really don't care who sent you. You don't have any [items of value] to me, so be gone.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What items of value?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Well... if you must know, I'm in need of a platinum bar so I can continue my work.'<br />
<br />
At this point you go and buy a platinum bar for roughly 105pp, can be bought a few hundrd yards away in FV.<br />
<br />
Hand platinum bar to Corfia.<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Aha, something worth my time. But I've changed my mind. I'd prefer if you made me something that really showed me how interested you are in my craft. We jewelers are hard to please, but if you can present me with a [Nocturnal Mask of Acuity], I'd be more than willing to atleast speak with you.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What Nocturnal Mask of Acuity?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'The mask is an interesting blend that will allow me to see much better in the darkness, where we elves can sometimes have trouble. To make it, you'll need an enchanted electrum bar and two darkened star rose quartz. Show it to me when you've made it.'<br />
<br />
The items needed to make this mask can be bought off of her really cheap, maybe 5pp at the most for each of the three items.<br />
<br />
I had my friend with a 231 skill in jewel craft make the item. She enchanted the electrum bar, then combined it with the two darkened star rose quartz successfully on first try. The result was the mask:<br />
<br />
Nocturnal Mask of Actuity<br />
Slot: Face<br />
CHA +2 INT +2 HP +2 MANA +2<br />
WT. 0.1 Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Hand mask to Corfia.<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Well done, but not great. It doesn't have the sight properties I'd hoped for, but it looks nice nonetheless. I half thought you'd shy away from creating such a lustrous piece of jeweled metal. You didn't though, so now you have my attention. What is it that you have for me to look at?'<br />
<br />
Hand in hilt to her.<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'What a filthy piece of rubbish! This will need a good deal of work, I can guarantee you that. I have a small repository of supplies that I only rarely use, and one of the things I have is a cleaning solution. I don't often use it for most mundane things, but I'd be willing to part with some if you're willing to do me a [favor].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What favor?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Yes indeed. I've been spending such a long time in the city lately that I just haven't had time to go on the expeditions I used to. Such a strong and capable person as you would be able to fill in nicely. You see, I've always wanted to explore the depths of [Veksar] to find out what treasures are hidden down there.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Veksar?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'I've heard plenty of stories and read a number of tales about artifacts of great wealth down there. In fact, I was able to get a sneak peak into the ruins some time ago, but not enough to find what I needed. One of the most interesting things I've read about is a tome of bones made for a necromancer named [Galuk Drek].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Galuk Drek?'<br />
<br />
Corfia Nultethen says, 'Oh, he was a beast, to be sure. One of the nastier creatures down there, but also one of the most brilliant, from what I've read. Drek kept the tome full of information on various crafts, and one of them just happens to be jewelcraft. I'd love to set my hands on that tome, and if you can find it, I'd be more than willing to finish up this hilt for you in no time!'<br />
<br />
Step 9 - Galuk Drek in Veksar.<br />
Pops in Veksar near shop area. Pullable to Zonein. <br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/galuk.jpg<br />
<br />
From the Decaying Slavemaster, take the north tunnel, it's the first room on the left. There's a hand in the room static. Around (+280, -450)<br />
<br />
he doubles for 1800, without defensive, and can be slowed.<br />
<br />
he casts an AE that takes 72 counters to remove, and the recast on it is 120 seconds. i believe it has a resist check of 350 disease. the AE does a minor hp dot it seemed and lowered all stats by 200 or so. he wasnt hard because sinec hes a caster, pretty much the first half of the fight he kept trying to cast until he went oom, thats when he started meleeing. its a good idea to fight him near his bind point, because at low health he will try gating.<br />
<br />
when he died he only dropped - Bone Tome of Galuk Drek.<br />
<br />
<br />
Skeletal Tome of Galuk Drek <br />
Magic Item Lore Item No Drop <br />
size= small <br />
all/all race/class <br />
<br />
Hand in the tome to Corfia Nultethen and you will get Glistening Hilt<br />
<br />
Run back to Korbuk Brimblade and turn in the Glistening Hilt and he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;ahhh yes her name was Carfia, i remember now. it seems shes turned this hilt back into shape. ah take it back! when i touched it i had another [glimpse] into a vision.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 10 - <br />
<br />
You say, 'what glimpse'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'It was a series of images, really. One was of a [young combatant] within da Muramite ranks. One was of a [gorge] somewhere. Da third was a [maze] of some sort, and da final one was in a [field of blood]. At da end, I saw four eyes dat appeared in da center of da hilt. I'm guessing da eyes go in those four holes on each side of da hilt and dat one each can be found in those four places.'<br />

Korbuk Brimblade says 'I noticed a creature dat walked like a man but looked like a dragon and was near a fortress.
