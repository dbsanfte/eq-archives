<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild has 110 on the roster total, about 60 active mains... I know spring break has just started for some students, and hasn't yet for others... This gm event crap is taking up time aswell (the fabled camps/loot people want for their alts) but I was wondering if anyone else was noticing a BIG decrease in raid numbers from march 15th till now heh. One week were kicking ass, killing shei, clearing ntov/st, aow, tallon zek, and other mobs of the calibur. This week we can barely get 20 people to raid (though we did manage cursed cycle last night with 28 after another guild wiped with 60'ish the night before. Arch Lich wipe at 3%  the day before with 16)   <br />
<br />
     After all this whining and bickering, I ask - Has anyone else seen a difference in their raid outcomes as of recent?</div></div><hr />

Run through DSP getting as many mobs as you can.  Shout &quot;Greenies to Neth&quot;.  Wait until someone asks what are those.  Find him wait for all mobs to catch up then zone.  Fun for all!  Even better to do it in ME.  DA training from AR to DSP grabbing all the mobs you can is fun.</div></div><hr />

you joking?  lol, you see your group turn white when you come running from a tunnel going &quot;OMFG GET THEM OFF ME&quot; is priceless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">True Shikarii oh so true.  The best I have had so far was doing Sol ro mini's yesterday.  All but one monk went afk so they told me to pull :D .  3 pulls later we were 1/2 way to Jiva and I am pretty sure they arent going to let me pull any more any time soon 8D.  It was good though.  They needed the wake up as it was getting near to midnight in the states and peeps were starting to feel sleepy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How the hell can someone wipe on cursed with 60 folks ? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">30 people actual; all clerics and shammys boxed; reeeeeeal easy :D<br />
<br />
been there; CR'ed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wrathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea Frog, my guild is in your position, no one wants to raid right now. Oh well, gives me a chance to get to 65 and get some AAs under my belt. But i've lost out on a BoC 2x now cuz our guild cant do him with the numbers we have right now :( Im just waiting for that moment the guild motd says Leader - Get to Kael now for AoW!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe if you can do aow, try xtc/cursed, Bloodfrenzy / Hategiver are better.   We had 42 on last night, did Shei for the fist time... guess it was just a fluke and people were on vacation for the past week or two.</div></div><hr />

Sir, why must you fabricate the truth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i dont consider the kill an actual kill if we dont do it alone, very first time wasn't alone.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda like you dont say &quot; we finally killed rztw for our first time! &quot; when you had a  joint raid and 20 misc people helping with the script.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
----and since the problem was resolved the post no longer has use---<br />
<br />
Requried raiding is going to be implemented soon for certian days of the week hehe. =P</div></div><hr />

No I'm just like:<br />
<br />
Me: Chanter get ready a few mobs inc<br />
Enc: Okay!<br />
<br />
*10 mobs incoming*<br />
<br />
Enc: HOLY FUCK I THOUGHT YOU SAID A FEW<br />
Me: Oh...whoops?! At least I snared a few!<br />
<br />
You'd be surprised how many mobs you can pull with a AoE!<br />
<br />
(Note: I don't usually pull with AoE, but if my group sucks, I will. Which happens a lot. Most of the time I carefully pull. 3rd Wave Go does not tolerate training.  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Best way to pull.<br />
<br />
&quot; inc 1 or 2 &quot;' <br />
&lt;10-20mobs start rushing toward your group, you use furious and let the chanter ae stun/mez, then let the rest of the group ae them...(you aswell if you have rampage/earthshaker.)</div></div><hr />

Nice idea.  I did a slaughter 60 in about 30 minutes sort of like that.  3 tanks (me, pal, war), shaman, druid, and a mage.  You cna subistute any decent AE casting class for the mage.  Pulled a room, all tanks grabbed agro like crazy, stacked the mobs up and mage went to town.</div></div><hr />

That is the funniest thing I have read yet today!  I'm going to set that up as a macro and use it! haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, my guild is having the same issue.  We were farming AoW/HP/XtC/AL and this week all the sudden we can barely manage a BoT Tower raid.  Not really sure what the deal is.  I'm hoping things pick up again really soon.</div></div><hr />
