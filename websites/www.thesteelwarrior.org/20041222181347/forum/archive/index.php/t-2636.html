Except for the Terror line for SK ;)<br />
<br />
But seriously.. what range are we talking about here? Can a paladin smack 2000 hate on a mob with stun or is it more like 100-200?</div></div><hr />

BTW, Valde, you missed the entire point of my sarcasm.  You just can't test taunt values on something with no set taunt value.<br />
<br />
There was no difference in my post then in yours except yours had EQ terms, mine have food terms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enraging blow is 700 agro... how much is a regular stun? Is there a complete list of hate somewhere ?<br />
<br />
You ask what is the numeric quantity of hate generated by stun spells and I tell you that it is a variable.<br />
<br />
It is modified, in part ( meaning this is only one of multiple factors that can modify it ), by the total hit points of the mob it is being used against. This means that the hate can be 10 or 100 or maybe even 1000 depending on what mob it is used against. Not only that, but different stuns have different amounts of aggro. <br />
It is the same way for every other spell in the game that does not have +x hate or -y hate as the spells function. In short Virginia, we can't tell you that stun = 100 aggro.<br />
<br />
Now must have beer....</div></div><hr />

<br />
well you can tell us that stun = this muych hate in relation to spells IE if we use tash as the baseline it always requires 2 non damaging stuns to overcome tash aggro. so a mob type will react to the baseline all times in reguards to spells. because it always takes 2 non damaging stuns to get aggro back from tash (well in my experience I haven't tried all the zones since i am not in a guild)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cease seems to have next to no aggro; I can chain up cease and desist several times to get the aggro of ONE Stun. I can hit Cease and Desist 3 times if the ranger pulls aggro with Call of Fire and not get aggro, but one Holy Might does it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raznor</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on experience stun agro does not seem to vary much from our lower stuns (cease and desist) to our higher ones.  For instance I've agro kited with a SK friend in Potact and could use cease and desist to maintain agro on the mob we we're kiting, wether I used these lower stuns or my higher stuns didn't seem to make a significant difference in the agro control (though it sure did in mana).  In experience groups one stun seems to be more hate generated than one slow, however if a tash is used another stun is typically required, three stuns are the norm that I use per fight and in most cases enough to give me control through the course of the fight. (some high nuking wizards being the exception)  Does that give you a hard, numerical number on how much hate a stun is?  Nope, but I think you get the general idea.   <br />

<br />
i do know tha stuns generate serious agro but 6000? planar stun 1000 some would prolly say yep others nope. planar strike -75 try telling people weilding SotB that, holy might so is all your agro realy comming from the CHoS and not the SotB? slows only 80 90 no way. humm if it was say 80x9 720 maybe. 90x16 1440 possible. <br />
<br />
