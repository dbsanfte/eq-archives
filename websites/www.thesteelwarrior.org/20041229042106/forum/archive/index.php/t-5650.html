<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i was thinking...is tribute system worth using? I mean...an extra 150 hp or 150 endurance sure won't do ya much good, unless you wanna get higher hp for showing off. Haste doesn't stack with haste item so that's no good. The resists are not very big, and stats are usually maxed anyway. Sure, it's easy to get favor points, but is it even worth the trouble?</div></div><hr />

I didn't see graveyards in the zones I visited last night, so I'll definitely be getting the faerune (see invis/EB/UV) effect just for the see invis bit... gonna be hard getting used to naked CR runs again after PoP. ;)<br />
<br />
I'm also thinking regen 10 and vengence 10 are winners, the AC/HP ones are cake too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far it seems like tribute points are easy to amass. Why wouldn't you want additional HP, END, AC, Veng, and regen? Even at an astronomical 200 TP per 10 minutes, 50k TP would last you over 41 hours of play time. It's really not that hard to come up with 50k TP, I have already seen plenty of people with well over 1,000,000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kragrock</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 1 million tribute points days have probably come to an end, being corrected/nerfed as I speak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think they will knock off a number of them (ie the Animated Bait and foraged bits) but we'll likely still see Fine Steel and bazaar-trash weapons at least providing a fair amount of FPs.<br />
<br />
They've painted themselves in a corner now though, it's either free VengX/Regen/resists/Faerune for all or they'll need to reset a ton of folk's points.  That would produce a substantial outcry but what else are they going to do?  No one is going to use these as situational buffs when it means running to Qeynos to fire them up.  And if costs are cheap enough (as in, free like they are at present) then viola, everyone gets a massive upgrade for no effort.  That's an odd way to run a railroad.<br />
<br />
The system is screwed regardless though, simply looking at the benefits to casters/hybrids versus melee would make that clear.  I honestly don't know what they plan on doing but the situation as it stands is pretty revealing.  How in GoD's name did this get through Beta (ah yes, I know that answer)?  Hell, I still don't know why they added the Tribute system to begin with, other than perhaps to remove all the old bazaar rotting items.  If that alone was the reason, congrats I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mithlani</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they added the tribute thinking folks would use more plat than items.  How they didn't thoroughly test the item values is beyond me.  <br />
<br />
I got mine in yesterday I just feel bad for all the folks that didn't get theirs.  <br />
<br />
SoE is trying to get all this duped plat out of the game with the casino and the tribute system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For anyone pre-elemental, the tributes offer a lot of value.  Attack, regen, ac, hitpoints, and faerune (if it's not bugged).  Even once they fix some of the easily accessible items and their high favor points, there is always going to be gear you can turn in for decent points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
For whatever reason the pre-removal tribute guys LOVED piercing weapons; slarlug spears, for instance, went for big points.  Some trash weapons from newbie zones did also, I didn't see any rhyme or reason to it beyond that.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, got enough points done from those + bazaar dumpster diving to keep faerune, regen10, veng10, 50ish AC and 150hp going for a couple months unless the existing points get cleared/nerfed... not a bad deal at all.  Like the freebie charm idol from PoP, on steroids.<br />

Sorry if this has been asked in another thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tribute item is definitely meant to get items out of the economy not plats.  For plat there is the Casino.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stat food/drink is similar (although on a smaller scale), so that's what I liken it to.  Is +5 sta/agi/dex +50hp (halas meat pie) worth forcefeeding cheap food / buying more pies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sowy</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that money will become harder to earn as more pp leaves the economy.  :-) Suddenly people will start caring to loot pp gems again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruges</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">THe 150HP acually adds 175HP if you have AA's.  AC is 47 I believe, attk is 67, no way to check endurance but emagine it would still be 150. Not parsed but haste is rumerd to add anouther 5 or was it 6 percent. so with 41 percent it should take you to 47percent worn haste. <br />
<br />
5 tributes is the max you can have. I forwent the regen one and went with haste instead. The above setup costs me 153 trib points every 10mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wudgurorm</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went with the HP and AC buffs, been tempted to get Faerune but guild is sticking to PoP content mostly so passing on it for now.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem is find a good source of easy to get items to keep the points up.</div></div><hr />
