<br />
Leveled from 65 to 70 and done about 50 AA on mobs that give faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Started doing faction work at apprehensively, killed green con mobs in Dranik's Scar, focusing on Noc, Ukun and Kyv and just killed as many as I could. Spend about 5-6 afternoons doing this, tied in with some xp groups in WoS and MPG and I'm now max ally to Dragorn Loyalists.<br />
<br />
Didn't do any faction raising quests, since I was never lucky enought to actually see any of the stuff needed for the quests drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, the faction level between kindly and warmly is shorter than amiably and kindly. Going from Indifferent to Amiably happens in a breeze, while others might take hell and back.<br />
<br />
Im still amiably and I do faction work in DS, along with some groups in RCoD an DS Hollows.<br />
<br />
Quoting from another thread:<br />
<br />
Ally = +4 1450 to 2500<br />
Warmly = +3 1100 to 1450<br />
Kindly = +2 750 to 1100<br />
Amiable = +1 150 to 750<br />
Indifferent = 0 0 to 150<br />
Apprehensive = -1 0 to -150<br />
Dubious = -2 -150 to -750<br />
Threateningly = -3 -750 to -1100<br />
Ready to Attack = -4 -1100 to -2500</div></div><hr />

Prolly killing 60ish mobs an hour(1 golem, 8-9 dragorns, 2 Ukun, 8-9 kyvs, 20mins repop or so, clearing all of them).  Kinda wondering why my faction is STILL dubious(Rarely kill -Dranik Loyalist faction). So, could just take forever /shrug.,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spikela</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do we know that 1 kill = 1 faction point? It's completely possible that 1 faction point equates to 3 or 4 kills... assuming that the chart listed above (and in a different thread in the Keep) refers to all factions and not just loyalist (sp). This chart could be a reference referring simply to the mass differences between the different stances, not specifically kills/quests needed. Way back my Halfy went from Indifferent to Ally with teh RV guards in just over 6 hours (and he was just 23!). My best guess is 1 faction = multiple kills, but feel free to correct me on this.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand... has anyone seen -Dragorn Loyalist faction anywhere? I've lowered Children of Dranik all over, but don't believe I've ever taken a negative loyalist hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The theory of several kills per faction point may be true, that would explain the buttload of kills I have in my pocket still in amiably :p</div></div><hr />

Do we have links to any of the armor or rewards for quests from them yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcast12</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">346 kills or so from dinging kindly and I hit warmly. Amiable was a pain but the 600 kills in amiable feels about right, I was averaging 40 faction mobs per hour and it took me around 15-20 hours. (this was in RCoD)<br />
<br />
remember: NOTHING reduces draniks loyalist faction, except killing the quest givers which is impossible. This is from searching the net and killing non stop in OOW, I have NEVER seen a - draniks loyalist hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can kill A.W. (forgive me for not knowing the real name!) in Noble's Causeway.  lvl 70 dragorn on loyalist faction.  I think that's the only one that you can attack.  Not sure if there are any *good* quest givers in NC, but you could use faction spells like the velium pendant thing (or if you're an enchanter!) to get that extra nudge $$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinson</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had logging on and parsed my faction hits, i'm somewhere in kindly at the moment. Total faction hits: 1536. It took 1298ish to get from base faction to kindly. I had just left a PG grind and was fighting draniks scar, killed 7 mobs and hit kindly. Total for amiably to kindly was 360ish(including 7 kyv heart turn ins, 2 or 3 seeping murkglider fluid turn ins, 1 dragorn insignia turn in). Right now I'm 238 faction hits into kindly, 89 of the hits being in dranik's scar. The rest of them have been in RCoD and PG. Turned in one murkglider fluid while in kindly so far.</div></div><hr />

I tried that...&quot;Your target does not look affected&quot; with the velium pendant</div></div><hr />
