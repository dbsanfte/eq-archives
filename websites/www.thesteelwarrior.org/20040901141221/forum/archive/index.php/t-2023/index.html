<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please select no more than FIVE options. They would all be nice - but we need some way to narrow things down.<br />
<br />
Remember that a few of these are fairly broad. &quot;New AA skills&quot; for instance. Should it happen to get the most votes, then a discussion can be started about what the specific aa skills should be.<br />
<br />
Don't take this as a final draft. It's easier to work towards a solution if we narrow it down bit by bit.<br />
<br />
Improve Taunt - This would include any changes to Taunt or AE taunt. Including: pass/fail messages, increased effectiveness,shorter re-use, larger ranges, etc.<br />
<br />
Increased innate Hp/AC/Mitigation/Avoidance - Includes changes to defensive tables. Assumes these changes would not be gear dependant, but a class change.<br />
<br />
Itemization - Includes anything to do with items. More weapons/armor, different stats, better placement of items, etc.<br />
<br />
Discipline Changes - Includes releasing timers, Giving us new disciplines, lowering/increasing timers, or totally reworking existing disciplines.<br />
<br />
Using 2hs with a shield - Giving warriors the ability to do this. Via aa, a new skill, or any means.<br />
<br />
Melee Focus Effects  - Deals with the introduction of effects which &quot;glow&quot; like caster focus effects, yet give positive effects to melee classes. <br />
<br />
+Hate on Hits / Crits / Procs - Via AA or not, increased hate on crits procs or hits for warriors.<br />
<br />
New Attacks  - Includes any new attacks (much like the arsenal of monk attacks) which have different effects on the mob being attacked. Via AA or not.<br />
<br />
Change buffs to increase %'s instead of hard caps - Gives warriors an advantage with buffs since they have a higher base hp than other classes.<br />
<br />
Permanent/Semi-permanent Shield/Protect skill - The ability to permanently shield a person, range dependant.<br />
<br />
Increased &quot;stacking&quot; of plate tanks - Something to make plate tanks stack better in groups as well as on raids.<br />
<br />
Skills/Auras (via AA or not) which increase an entire groups effectiveness - Think about the warcries from diablo 2. Very similar.<br />
<br />
New AA skills - Self Explanatory.<br />
<br />
Increase proximity agro for warriors - Allow warriors to gain more agro from being close to a mob/<br />
<br />
New Class only Skills - Summon, Double bash, any new ability given to our class.<br />
<br />
Armor / Weapon specialization - The ability to increase skill caps on certain weapon skills, or to better utilize your armor dependant on specialization.<br />
<br />
Increase Skillcaps on important warrior skills - yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Woot! I got to vote first!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't wanna narrow things down. If bards can ask for snap aggro, and druids can ask for slows and rez, then by God we can ask for all this stuff and still not be able to solo worth a damn. :)  At least we'll be able to do our jobs as well as a class that is supposed to be a watered down version of us and something else.  It took me a while to decide what I thought was most important, and it turned out that the percentages indicate that most of us are voting along similar lines.  Given all the debate we've had on the topic I'm glad to see we're finally agreeing on SOMETHING. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would like to throw in a few words here!<br />
<br />
Change some of our aas:<br />
<br />
Make TM ignore ripostes half the time (depending on level, could be 15, 25 and 50 percent) but let it work the other ripostes (work as it is now)<br />
<br />
Make TM a monk skill also, but make it innate, not a AA skill. It makes sense for these godly fast light fighters.<br />
<br />
Make warcry last longer (15 30 and 45 secs per level) and make it refresh FASTER for the initial 3/6/9 aas.<br />
<br />
Make a PoP warcry skill. Make it 3 levels, 3/3/3 aa cost. Make it last longer, recycle quicker. Make level 3 let the warcry be AE, not group only.<br />
<br />
Give us a secondary taunt. Make it like AE taunt, but with normal taunt check. Maybe make it an aa.<br />
<br />
Change rampage! The pop aa for rampage needs to be atleast 5 levels, each cost 1 or 2 points and reduce the time with 10 percent (optimal would be 8 levels, making the cost no more then 12 aas and the reuse time on rampage 2 mins, much better now)<br />
<br />
Make Raex BP atleast 6% percent shielding (50% better then what the other plate classes can get from the CT greaves)<br />
<br />
Nerf BoWar to 32dly 44dam (43 dam maybe)<br />
<br />
Add a BoWar like weapon in the EPs, make it BoWs old ratio, with 200hp and make it WARRIOR ONLY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aegamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What a fantastic thread.  I put in my 5.  I hope someone higher up (ie: SOE) sees this.  We need to be balanced.  Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It was hard as heck to pick just 5 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Raaj this is really hard to only pick 5. You could have gotten rid of half the list if we could have picked the top 10. 10 is a good round number. 5 is just damn hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah there is no Nerf Knight aggro selection! well I vote for that so thoes of you keeping track at home on your paper, pencil in a 1 for nerf Knight aggro. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah aveen - but what happens after we have 10? Then we have to pick 5 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wan't slows and 90% rezzes to give my class more utility. :)<br />
<br />
Sorry, I couldn't resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One other thing Raaj, you might want to let folks that aren't reading this forum regularly know that the poll is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice casual brush off without reading the thread there Beorn.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who says we can only have 5 suggestions to send to the devs?<br />
<br />
If they are good suggestions and what we want I see no reason to unnecessarily eliminate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Because the entire point is to get focused on a few key issues instead of having everyone pulling ideas out of left field.<br />
<br />
If you really have to vote for more - go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've read the thread every day since it was first started Val.  I contributed a few of the ideas that are in the current poll.  It wasn't a brush off, it was a joke.  Lighten up a little, the lower stress will add years to your life.  And I still think we should email the whole list to SoE, 'cause if the already overpowered druids can ask for slows and rez, we should be able to ask for all this stuff too.  They're probably just going to ignore us anyway. :)<br />
Maybe if we cull out some of it they'll be more inclined to listen to us, or maybe if we send them a broader list to choose from (all of the above)  they'll pick one or two from column A and one or two from column B and  make us a more well rounded, useful, effective class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But it will only let me vote once for five Raaj. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ah sorry Beorn i see where you were coming from with that quote now - I read it as dissing my thread on tank utility :p<br />
<br />
/bonk self <br />
<br />
I'm in agreement with you btw, making 5 choices from 19 kinda forces things a bit - tank utility or other idea's to spice up the class that don't directly address Aggro are gonna be sidelined somewhat but /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So when this is all done, make a laundry list of all the ideas suggested, then mention the poll, and the 5 big topics in detail.  That way things like tank utility get brought up, and devs have something more to look at, but we still emphasize the 5 main points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nah, when this is all done, select the Top 5, and write a whiny hate-filled e-mail to the dev staff saying basically &quot;We've dealt with your bullshit on agro for 5 years, and being underpowered compared to knights since right before SoL. 3 weeks to fix this shit or you'll see an ass-load of canceled accounts.&quot; <br />
<br />
The above is the lone way to get their attention, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Seems like as good a thread as any for a first post.  While I definitely agree that warriors need an upgrade, bad, I also hope that if SOE makes any meaningful changes to the warrior class it won't just be improvments on taunt or increasing hp.  I love playing my warr, have for a while, but I can't help but think that a class that is supposed to be the master of weapons and combat should be a little more versatile.<br />
<br />
Well, maybe versatile isn't the correct word for this.  I'm not suggesting that warriors should have spells, or be able to solo or anything, but should bring more to a group then a bit of dps and a body for the mob to constantly mangle.  Hence why I liked this post and some of the options, ie, the skill/aura idea.  Yes, it reeks of D2, I know, but the idea is not bad as it gives something extra that a warrior can bring to a group or raid.  Same with the taunt/dot idea, as long as it's not too powerful that also adds a new element to a warriors capabilities and a good warrior will be able to utilize it for aggro control, possibly on multiple mobs, with great effect.<br />
<br />
I guess what this lengthy post is getting at is, yes, warriors need an upgrade.  But it doesn't have to be something like increasing taunt or dps necessarily, but something that makes warriors useful and unique, and not just someone who stands in front of a mob, with auto on, and hitting taunt, kick, bash or whatever for the whole fight.  Perhaps something new in our repetoire that will add a new element of strategy and intrigue to the class.<br />
<br />
Anywho, just a little food for thought I've been stewing around in my head, as I'm sure almost everyone else has too.  Just felt like putting it into words and posting it.  Heck, maybe a Dev will read it or something, you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think the % numbers are kind of misleading.  15% on the top one doesn't look like much, but since we voted on 5, the most any one could get (if *everybody* picked it) is 20%.  If you want the real % of people that voted on each one, multiply the displayed % by 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I dont know why people are so keen on improved taunt.. taunt only works when we already lost agro, and thats the problem groups have with us atm, dont they? We lose the agro while a knight never does.<br />
I voted for <br />
Taunt/Damage DoT's <br />
Increase proximity agro for warriors (As I watch my own positioning alot, I want to get more from it)<br />
Increase Skillcaps on important warrior skills(piercing TWO FIVE ZERO!)</div></div><hr />

Here's the possibility of getting exciting new things to make us loved by group and possibly stack in raids.... but no<br />
most of you want more hp/ac and better taunt... sigh<br />
<br />
more years of hitting the same button I guess.. sheesh<br />
<br />
and hp/ac isnt going to be changed before next expansion... and its going to be changed with next expansion anyhow... so why bother? :p<br />

<br />
PS.<br />
<br />
Shouldn't the Aggro DoT and Grapple idea be the same option as &quot;New Class Skills&quot;?<br />
Dont get why we would have to choose between the 3... when theyre all a New Class skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Fantastic, the two obvious first choices I voted for along with Furors idea, +Hate to Crits, and 2hs with a Shield.<br />
<br />
All the people voting for Itemization I would like to slam their heads in the car door a few times...WAKE UP!<br />
<br />
<br />
Buun<br />
65 Overlord <br />
Karana<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. My thought on itemization...an example of an aggro increasing fix is putting a BoC on an AoW...it tends to help the ones who don't need it...YOU SERIOUS?...You want wars to just get some better items/weps?...Gah, lets get an innate skill or ability, not get helped by farming a pop for a certain drop.<br />
<br />
~sorry, this isn't the place to discuss but I would hate to see what I consider a good top 5 lose out to more Bloodfrenzies dropping...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">shield with 2hs :<br />
this will utterly DESTROY dual wield. Dual wield will become completely useless crap.. and so will all the 1handers in the process...<br />
think soe gonna allow that?<br />
boc, bf, hg, etc etc... all may as well get taken out of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
hate to crits:<br />
just a boring fix :p...<br />
and not much a fix either.... <br />
Yay.. more &quot;procs&quot; to rely on their randomness...<br />
If we're looking for a fix, its to ensure warriors RELIABLE means of aggro... hate on crits is not such a thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aggro Dot:<br />
Nice idea, <br />
but I dont understand why its seperated from New Class Specific Skills.<br />
If you want an aggro dot, vote for class specific skills, and we could discuss and submit such an idea, Along with other potentially appealing ideas.<br />
<br />
You'de prefer having ONLY Aggro dot skill..<br />
rather then Aggro dot skill and Possibly other skills? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think the improve category and class-specific skills can be addressed by making EB an innate ability with no more than 30 sec refresh. In doing so however, the procs on enraging blow weapons would need to altered, because their proc would become much less necessary, and warriors who have worked hard at attaining theirs would receive a rather unjust shaft. Something along the lines of 200dd, 0.0 or 0.5 sec stun, both components unresistable should do. <br />
<br />
Otherwise; Innate HP/Mitigation: absolutely here, stop narrowing the gap. Furor's Taunt/DoT's idea seems to very promising. Skills/taunt, see above, maybe add a small +hate component on taunt itself, irregardless of success or fail. <br />

&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fun&quot; improvements are generally flawed, for the simple reason that Sony can just add a bunch of features to make warriors more &quot;fun&quot; while doing nothing to alter our utility (see Rampage skill, warcry for that matter as well, and /shield, although the later is useful on occasion). If we ask for fun and exciting fixes for warriors, Sony'll give warriors some innate firework show that allows you to shoot a blue flame at a mob once every 20 minutes for like 100 damage and call this &quot;fun and exciting,&quot; except that it's of course utterly useless. And, while we can certainly propose fixes that are fun and useful, considering SOny's previous track record of actually listening to warrior concerns, they will mis-construe the statement and give us another useless ability.<br />
<br />
The other reason &quot;fun&quot; fixes aren't a good idea is they likely require more work. Any proposed changes should really be KISS, since I doubt Sony, or anyone for that matter would prefer to introduce a change that's longer and harder to implement. Putting a hate component on taunt, innate EB, improving innate mitigation/HP/AC, hell even the DoT feature since it's relatively well-defined already are simple and easy to implement. More &quot;fun&quot; changes, intriguing new skills, re-structuring taunt and the warrior agro system, hell, even itemization is difficult. Logic dictates, easy &gt; difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">furor's idea is fun,<br />
any new skill would be fun.<br />
<br />
What I consider not fun is heightening caps, and giving us more hp/ac.<br />
<br />
<br />
If items were to be upgraded...<br />
would you prefer their HP and other stats to be heightened?<br />
or would you prefer new effects and focuses on them?<br />
the first isnt fun, the second is.<br />
Both are usefull and upgrades.<br />
<br />
Same here...<br />
would you prefer taunt's success rate to be heightened?<br />
or rather get a couple new skills to make up for when Taunt fails?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">please re-read my post, because you entirely mis-understood my points. let me sum up:<br />
<br />
1) Sony will mis-construe a desire for fun and use that to give warriors useless abilities that makes them &quot;fun&quot;<br />
<br />
2) Fun changes are harder and take longer to test/implement than simpler non-fun changes. Sony is reluctant to do anything that requires anything more than minimal effort. <br />
<br />
Sure, I wouldn't mind interesting abilities to the warrior class, but it's unrealistic. KISS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Who said we were suppose to tell soe to implement fun abilities?<br />
no one in their right mind would send soe an official letter going &quot;I speak for the warrior community, when I ask that you give us fun and cool abilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
and you said this<br />
hell even the DoT feature since it's relatively well-defined already are simple and easy to implement <br />
and the DoT ability is &quot;fun&quot;. Yet you're saying its easy to implement :p<br />
<br />
Re-read my post carefully please.<br />
<br />
I'll say it in a different tone:<br />
<br />
Active upgrades are better then Passive upgrades.<br />
<br />
1)passive upgrades are permanently there, giving a lot of room for imbalance.<br />
Whereas active upgrades can be finetuned... limiting the imbalance factors.<br />
<br />
2)passive upgrades dont make the warrior DO anything, they continue playing as they have played the last 5 years.. and absolutely no skill is required to make benefit of these upgrades.<br />
Active ones will demand skill and knowledge to be activated at the right times. And it brings more excitement to a warrior's life.<br />
<br />
And dont say active upgrades are harder to put in game the passive :), because it's the other way around.<br />
Just look at the love SOE has for spells.. it proves the point.<br />
Spells are all active, and soe ADORES implementing them.<br />
<br />
Yet when it comes to melee's passive skills, they are very reluctant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Bunnie have you ever had a friend who had an old car and wanted to fix it up/restore it?<br />
<br />
Well if he were smart he would fix the friggen engine before he worried about the fancy paint job. <br />
<br />
You want fancy, fun skills...I want the correct balancing value for Taunt and HP/AC/Mitigation where it is supposed to be in relation to the other tank classes.  Until the Base value is where it is supposed to be I don't care about getting an Aggro-inducing, fly my troll ass around in a circle, Roundhouse Thunder Kick.  I don't really care if you find it boring, that is our engine and without it all we will have is a pretty car that won't do a damn thing.<br />
<br />
Also, the purpose here is to try and &quot;NARROW DOWN&quot; some ideas.  Voting for real general stuff like new AA or skills I don't think is going to do anything but give us an entirely new, start from scratch, AGAIN, brain-storming thread if it makes the top five.  If you want new skills, well, damn, where were ya a month or so ago when we started posting and brain-storming?  It's not too late so if ya got ideas get them out, but lets move from General to Specific.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is not the thread to discuss or debate ideas and I shouldn't have commented earlier, I should have waitied til there was a top 5 and then gave my input.  My bad.  It just irked me that we were gonna vote for Itemization, the easiest (for SoE - heh, throw a couple more EB swords in the game and a war only pair of pants in PoT with 5 % taunt and 5 % shielding) and by far most unsatisfactory for the warrior majority.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry for diverting...VOTE ON!<br />

im not asking for anything fansy... where did you fetch that idea?<br />
last time, im not replying any longer after this, already posted too much :p :<br />
<br />
ACTIVE abilities = abilities which you CONTROL = fun abilities.<br />
Kick is an ACTIVE ability, do you find it fansy?<br />
Aoe Taunt is an ACTIVE ability, do you find it fansy?<br />

stop confusing Fansy things and Fun things, they arent the same thing at all..<br />

Improve Taunt - This would include any changes to Taunt or AE taunt. Including: pass/fail messages, increased effectiveness,shorter re-use, larger ranges, etc.<br />
<br />
I like this idea, would be nice to see something like. XXX mob failed to repsond to your attempt to taunt. <br />
<br />

Discipline Changes - Includes releasing timers, Giving us new disciplines, lowering/increasing timers, or totally reworking existing disciplines.<br />
<br />
I think these two changes should go hand in hand. What I would like to see is the removal of the defensive and evasive disciplines and for warriors to be placed on a seperate mitigation and avoidance tables that in effect would be a full time defensive/evasive discplines equating to a 40% full time boost in mitigation and avoidance.<br />
<br />
Originally posted by raaj <br />
Itemization - Includes anything to do with items. More weapons/armor, different stats, better placement of items, etc.<br />
<br />
Poor itemization has been the bane to warriors since the advent of velious. All/All items are a sign of lazy coding, gave rise to the overpowered monk and susequent monk mitigation nerf. All items need to be reworked and the complete removal of every single All/All item and they need to be replaced by class specific items and then ofcourse up the drop rate of said items so a mob that drops 3 all/all items would drop 5 class specific items. Please tell me why I need to have 1k mana on my items in order to get the best items for my character? This would also have the advantage of widening the HP gap that has closed to virtually nothing between knights and warriors. <br />
<br />
Or give warriors an AA ability or innate ability to convert mana on items to HP in some form. Certainly not 1:1 ratio but a 3:1 ratio would be adequate.</div></div><hr />
