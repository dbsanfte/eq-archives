<br />
Every time we level up, we see an number of our stats going up. At least for Stm and Int, they do not have the expected effect of more HP/Mana. <br />
<br />
I figured that maybe they act as buffer stats, so that when debuffs land, less is lost. THat is not true either. <br />
<br />
Then add to that the base stamina you have--the first 20 points--do nothing for you. <br />
<br />
So the stat ups we get have NO visible benefit, or desernable benefit to the player. Your high stats--particularly stamina--means nothing. <br />
<br />
To me its a fundimental breach of trust--the numbers Blizzard give you don't mean squat. The are placebo or a rope-a-dope. And we are the dopes.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this info is simply not true. After seeing it bandied about a few times I have had my regular group ( who are all the same level ) remove all their gear and compare stamina and base hp, and the hp difference fits pretty well into the stamina differences ( i.e. someone with 30 higher base stamina will have ~300 more hp )<br />
<br />
I think the confusion has just come about because the hp gains per level are calculated off of a fractional stamina value rather than the real one.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, as I said this is what I believe has caused the confusion. Lets say that rogues get 1 stamina every 2 levels. Each level they will get the hp for 1/2 a stamina, even though the stamina stat itself only goes up by whole numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felwin</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to consider is that Blessing of the Kings adds 10% to your base stats.  I also know that I gain HP's based on blessings of the king being cast on me.  So maybe those stats that we get as we level are increasing the effectiveness of spells like blessing of the kings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I leveled a mage, rogue, paladin, and warrior to see what difference I could find. Each one gained a set amount of hitpoints whne they leveled. I leveled each to 5, which is about as far as I was willing to commit my time. I can see what you're talking about, Kailyn. I guess sta from leveling up is all just for show. My rogue is about to levled, I'll see if I gain the same amount of hitpoints as I did at 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, as I said this is what I believe has caused the confusion.

 Don't know about other classes, but rogues get 10 hitpoints per sta point. So your theory would have to be 1.7 sta per level in this case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So your theory would have to be 1.7 sta per level in this case.<br />
<br />
Well, if you're calculating off of 2 levels, then maybe.  But I would imagine that any fractional gain would be divided amongst 60 levels..and those are numbers we don't have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point was that you wouldn't get 1 sta every other level if this was the case.<br />
<br />
I'm saying, and I think Kaiyn is say, that the sta seems irrelevant, hence the speak about sta debuffs, which you took part in. *que side track about stat buffers*<br />
<br />
I can't see anywhere where the sta is anything but for show, unless it comes from gear or buffs. I haven't checked this, but I'm pretty sure you get the same hitpoint increase at level 2 as you do at level 60.<br />
<br />
If I gain 17 hitpoints every level, then that is the same as 1.7 (buff) sta every level. If I'm showing a sta increase every other level then saying that sta having a fractional gain doesn't solve the problem. If it was a fractional gain, and only whole number gains are being reported, then you would be getting sta increases every other level. there would be a slight variance. If you can call it slight, since sta gains for even 17 hitpoints would be like so:<br />
<br />
1.7 - 1 sta @ level 1<br />
3.4 - 2 sta @ level 2<br />
5.1 - 2 sta @ level 3<br />
6.8 - 1 sta @ level 4<br />
8.5 - 2 sta @ level 5<br />
<br />
For a 1 sta increase every other level, you would have to gain 5 hitponts. no more, no less.<br />
<br />
Unless we can find another use for sta beside hitpoints, then the sta increases on leveling aren't doing anything. Just like Kailyn said.<br />
<br />
For reference, I have a 27 human rogue with 575 natural hitpoints @ 40 sta. Minus the initial 55 hitpoints @ 21 sta, that gives me 19.259~ hitpoints per level. However, when you ding level 2 you get 17 hitpoints<br />
<br />
That leaves me with the inclination that 10 sta = roughly 1 natural hitpoints per level, but I'm very sleepy and whatever thought I had going through my head has long since passed. The jist is that natural sta effrects how many hitpoints you get per level. Please pardon, if I'm stating the obvious or repeating, I haven't had the time to fully review the this thread since it started.<br />
<br />
Assuming this pounding headache isn't clouding my judgement and I read you correctly, Haass, sta gains couldn't be fractional, however hitpoints per level can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but I'm pretty sure you get the same hitpoint increase at level 2 as you do at level 60. <br />
<br />
Yeah, that would be where you're wrong and that's where your entire hypothesis falls apart.<br />
<br />
I gained 62 hp at level 46, and I damned sure didn't get that at level 2, so lets stop with the nonsense until we've got some facts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">grrrrrrrr I went looking on the WoW forums for the mod's comments on this topic but the damn thing is gone (I guess their crashing has lost some data).  The HP you get per level gets bigger with each level.  The stats you get have no bearing on the HP you get for leveling.  One of the mods posted that the stats you get at level are not completely useless, they have a very small impact.<br />
<br />
Wish that thread was still there =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But from what I am seeing from other forums there is a soft cap at 300. So, its quite possible we get screwed on HP, because we get free stamina buffs.</div></div><hr />

free sta buff meaning the stats we get at level up?<br />
<br />
If there is a stats cap, you'd have a point except this is true of all classes.  Everybody gets stats increases at level up.  So suppose there is a cap, everyones getting it in the pooper.  <br />
<br />
Seems like they are using this and the hit/miss rate as balancing tools.  I imagine we'll see a lot of tweaks to stuff like that in the coming months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's called inflation... I thought you would have guessed earlier that there is nothing good when sta and HP increase separatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except that we get much more stamina than anyone  else for leveling. <br />
<br />
And I think the fractional stm theory is wrong. Just dinged 48th. <br />
<br />
47th 195 stm 2705 HP<br />
48th 197 stm 2771 HP (level up message was 2 stm and 66 HP).<br />
49th 199 stm 2839 HP (level up message was 2 stm and 68 HP).<br />
50th  --  (level up message was 2 strength, 2 stamina, 1 agility, 70 HP).<br />
51st -- (level up message was 2 str/stm/agi 1 spirit, 72 HP)<br />
52nd -- (level up message was 2str/stm 1 agi, 74 HP)<br />
<br />
That does not fit the math of parcial stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-22-2005, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still REALLY fail to see the fucking complaint here.<br />
<br />
When you level up, you gain HP's.  Okay, everything in working order here.<br />
<br />
When you replace a piece of gear with 6 stamina with a piece of gear with 15 stamina, you gain 90hp.  Okay, everything in working order here.<br />
<br />
SO WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT THE NUMBER SAYS?<br />
<br />
If either of the above circumstances were false, then I'd say there was a reason to bitch, but there's not, so I don't see what the fucking problem is.</div></div><hr />
