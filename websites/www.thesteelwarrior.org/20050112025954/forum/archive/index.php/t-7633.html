<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing some thinking about the supposed 3 tank classes....<br />
And surprisingly came up with a rather weird conclusion :<br />
<br />
The only &quot;Balanced&quot; 1 group content tank is the SK ! <br />
Ands because they are actually the WORSE tank <br />
<br />
Assuming Tanking is composed of 2 things :<br />
- Getting to the Named (a long crawl)<br />
- Killing the Named (a short burst fight)<br />
<br />
SK :<br />
Can not stun trash, so cant mitigate dmg <br />
Can not defensive, so zero burst DPS mitigation<br />
<br />
Pal :<br />
Can stun trash, and reduce mob DPS to pathetic level<br />
Can not defensive, so zero burst DPS mitigatoin<br />
<br />
War<br />
Can not stun trash, so cant mitigate dmg<br />
Can defensive, which has an enourmous impact on DPS mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you look closely, you will see that Paladins are overpowered on stunnable content.<br />
While warriors are overpowered on high DI mobs (notice i said DI).<br />
SK .... well as the name implies SucK<br />
<br />
There is a Tank balance issue. Or actually 2 tank balance issues.<br />
Because you have 2 specialists (Trash &amp; Bosses).<br />
And one lesser tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
To fix the balance issue on Trash :<br />
- Yellow Trash (balances Paladins  vs War/SK) this has no side effects<br />
<br />
To fix the balance issue on Bosses :<br />
- Disc Immune Named (balances Warrior vs Pal/SK) but GIMPS content, see BST/RNG tanking<br />
- MiniDisc (Balances Warrior vs Pal/SK) but gives out our core disc and still doesnt scale.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stun mitigation has been &quot;fixed&quot; by raising mob levels.<br />
<br />
I dont like the road SoE took with &quot;Disc Immune&quot; fix defensive mitigation.<br />
And to be honest i dont really see a &quot;reasonable solution&quot; to the problem.<br />
<br />
What i do find funny, is that in this flame &amp; post frenzy between War &amp; Paladin for tanking.<br />
The shittiest tank (SK) , is often forgotten !<br />
While they are tanking wise, by far the worse of the 3 tanks</div></div><hr />

Changed to be less sarcastic and insulting i apologise. SK are a great &amp; flexible class.<br />
<br />
But I never imagined there would be such a huge CHASM between the 3 of us.<br />
Comparing Pal vs SK and War vs SK in every day life (Trash or Boss) makes SK look like gimps.<br />
<br />
Cant Chain stun , Cant Defensive... &quot;The Lesser Tank&quot; at best.<br />
<br />
Notice: Lesser Tank , not Lesser Class. I didnt mix up class overall power with pure tanking.<br />
<br />
I looked at some old Parses on PoN and was Shocked :<br />
http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2729.topic<br />
<br />
As overpowered as defensive was/is in Tipt &amp; Ikkinz .... Stun is INSANE.<br />
<br />
I dont have any parses but no way in hell i took 250DPS on Blue Tipt Mobs.<br />
Even with the 2200ac 15% Shielding i had during the KT Reflags before the LVL change.<br />
<br />
Its basically reduced to &quot;Warrior Defensive VS Paladin Stuns&quot;<br />
While poor SK got none of these ....<br />
<br />
SK should be screaming out so loud, you could hear them even on Jupiter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always knew defensive was overpowered (3+ years as a warrior does that).<br />
And stuns were insane (never had any numbers to illustrate that now i do).<br />
<br />
But i never imagined the sad position of SK that have neither....<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Balance is a bit more complicated than we seem to think or see on the 1st glance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defensive is only overpowered because only one tank class has a form of it.  If all tanks had a defensive-style disc, it would serve the useful function of distancing the tanks from the DPS classes.  The ability to tailor it specifically to the needs of each class is also more beneficial than no defensive disc's existitng - knights' disc can be designed more toward offtanking, while warrior defensive would remain ideal for tanking boss mobs; both would fit the bill for one-group bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I agree. <br />
<br />
Odd to think I have been playing EQ since rangers were the best tanks in the game now ands its only now that we have a term like &quot;Burst Mitigation.&quot; But put that way its very easy to see the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you that they are the 2 major things but to be more true to the way things are you need to take the SK's main advantage as well as the difficulty of the mobs and zone in to consideration.<br />
<br />
While an SK can not do either of the things a warrior or a paladin can they have a tap that returns mana and hp, while the hp heal for the entire group is minor the mana refresh is a very powerful spell. By itself it returns 100 mana to every member of a group giving an effective FT of 10 over and above what casters have to start, that means all group casters regen up to 40% more mana over the same time. So while a SK cannot reduce damage taken they can add 40% more healing over time AND 40% caster DPS. With there agro spells controlling the mob would not be a problem either.<br />
<br />
<br />
40% more healing and 40% more caster DPS gives SK’s the advantage unless they are in danger of dieing on the content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And pallys have excellent group heals...<br />
<br />
To say that SK's are balanced because of Zevfeer's is rediculous - we're one of many classes who can contribute manaregen (though ours has more limitations) but beyond that are pretty much useless; someone else can do all of our jobs better.  We're supposed to be a tank class, but we're not effective in that role - our secondary abilities do not justify our inibility to perform our primary function.  <br />
<br />
Warriors should have better raw tanking power than SK's/pallys, but knights should be valuable as tanks as well; our secondary abilities should compensate for the disparity.  <br />
<br />
As it is, (variables represent progression) a warrior at X is able to tank content that a knight at X+n cannot.  This should never be the case.  A knight and warrior and knight at an equal level of progression should be able to tank the same set of mobs.  In doing so, a warrior should take less damage and be at less risk of something going wrong, however.  From a raw tanking standpoint, a warrior should be best, but a knight should be able to get the job done, and the disparity should be compensated by the knight's secondary abilities.  <br />
<br />
It's a little different with regards to raid bosses, because (unless they're already trivial to you) nobody can generally tank them entirely reliably, hence MT rotations, regular occurances of 1-rounding, etc.  Also, when tanking on a raid, the value of the knights' secondary abilities is nil compared to one's ability to take the punishment from the mob.  Because of this, warriors will invariably remain the superior tank; they should not be the superior offtank too, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally, I would say the only requirement for tanking is that Warriors, Shadowknights and Paladins all reach a minimium level to be viable tanks for all appropriate content.  After that, equality need not be reached.  The flavor after that is what is required to seperate the three classes a bit.  Everyone has different ideas of what their strengths should be and where they should line up, so its hard to get a general consensus.  Personally, I would go out on a limb and say its not wrong for Paladins to tank a bit better then shadowknights by virtue of how their spellbooks are setup; one is decidely defensive and one is decidedly offensive.  Between the hybrids you are essentially picking between better defense of better offense.  For the most part, that is reflected well.  <br />
<br />
Warriors can be a bit more problematice to fit in.  Personally, I would put them in between Paladins and Shadowknights in terms of dps and make them the best at absorbing damage.  I would make warriors good enough that paladins using *one* stun to mitigate damage would at best equal them (albiet, with much spikier, dangerous damage), but preferably still be lower by a bit.  Mind you, that gap must never be so large as to remove SK's from the status of viable tanks.<br />
<br />
What I am interested in knowing is, do you guys/anyone have actual parses comparing warrior mitigating to that of a paladin against the same mobs (ones that are stunnable by FoA and that alone)?  It would be interesting to see how much of a difference the stuns actually make.  I would run them myself but I don't know any warriors who would be interested in sitting down to do some kind of controlled test with me.</div></div><hr />

Well, honestly, it's not so much that we're ineffective as tanks, as it is the other two options are much more effective(due to reasons mentioned above).  I know I've tanked some mobs that could generally be considered &quot;warrior&quot; turf, due almost entirely to fantastic healers, sufficient gear, and a healthy portion of luck.<br />
<br />
Your statement could be more accurately written as &quot;We are a tank class, though not as effective as we should or could be - and our secondary abilities do not adequately justify the gap between ourselves and the other plate tank classes at performing our primary functions.&quot;<br />
<br />
I really do not think shadowknights(or knights in general) need defensive.  Yes it would help, of course, but that's not the best solution.</div></div><hr />

SKs also are the only tank class to offer a reasonable dps burst in the form of HT, where applicable.  They have decent survivability from lifetapping and related spells and can also perform some utility in terms of FD/pet splitting and group taps.  A good tradeoff for Pally rezzes and group heals?

<br />
Again the problem with sk's is scaleability. Pulling is something that scale's(kinda). However we could use some help in that department. The last pullin upgrade we got was Death peace... from velious. That was implemented because normal feign death just didn't cut it when gettin beat on by the new harder mobs.<br />
<br />
Back to scaleability: we have a 470 lifetap that has a 10 second refresh after bein cast. Our next best one is 330, also with a 10 second refresh. These taps own if your doin a normal ldon or tankin in BoT but really don't do anything when your tankin somethin that could be called remotely challenging.<br />
<br />
I have gotten some tipt groups as a puller and I do well there, and am to the point where I can tank these provided I have the proper group:<br />
Me, cleric, shaman(malosinia for pet), ranger(WS for jhiru), chanter(pooka), puller(monk/bard, sk can but not really preferable)<br />
<br />
Also HT is nice, but it's in no way somethin that a class can be balanced around. I'm not gonna bitch and whine and say that we are completely useless at the moment we have 2 things goin for us:<br />
400 range pulls(requires a seru bow) + Harmshield + FD has its uses, can tack on pet pullin here<br />
HT does help somewhat w/GoD content. IE: 30% of jhiru's life.<br />
<br />
There are a few things that could be done, spreadin defensive around is one of em. I'd almost rather prefer for defensive to be removed from the game and warriors to be moved to somethin like -X DI, knights at -(X-n) DI, etc... would cause more differentiation between tanks and non-tanks in my opinion.<br />
<br />
To summarize: Emilia, I wanna have like 10,000 of your babies. To see a post like that coming from a warrior makes me feel that there is some hope for class balance.</div></div><hr />

A monkey banging it's paws on the keyboard could pull Tipt.  It certainly doesn't require feign or pacify to do, just a basic understanding of mob aggro ranges and pathing.  The rare time you get more than one mob, the add can(9 times out of 10) be rooted, mezzed, or both.</div></div><hr />

========================================================<br />
<br />
Sk's are strongest XP tanks ? - even tho' with their rock bottom low mitigation they are manasinks for healers and our aggro advantage has been eroded away to nil.<br />
<br />
HT burst DPS ? Once an hour. &quot;big whooptie&quot;<br />
Even if an SK has invested all their AA's too reduce their HT timer to 30min refresh - that only works on the OLD Harm touch - no where near the fat nuke you may see an SK pop on a raid once an hour and way less than your average wizard with continuously let rip with.<br />
<br />
Lifetapping survivability ?<br />
Doesn't scale with content and with the long recast times we get horrible interrupt rates when tanking. Did NOTHING for us in relation to the Tipt/Ikkins/offtanking in GoD problems knights have been having.<br />
<br />
FD'ing and pet splitting utility ?<br />
Our FD is not immune too casting like monks. With the masses of casting mobs ingame now that can break a successful SK Feign Death, SK's are not efficient FD pullers by any stretch of the imagination. I honestly can't remember the last time I was asked to split-pull on a raid or even an XP group. Monks, Bards, etc all do it faster and better now.<br />
<br />
&quot;group taps.&quot; and spells ?<br />
Yeah the group tap is better than a slap in the face with a wet fish - when it's not resisted, which goes double for our DD spells that were suppose to give us some DPS, they get resisted so often that many times they're just not worth memorizing.<br />
<br />
SK's are currently not just the only plate tank (of the three) that doesn't have any form or ability to mitigate damage - we're the only MELEE CLASS that doesn't have some form of mitigation ability burst or otherwise.<br />
<br />
Throw in all the untold aggro-nerfs the ShadowKnight class has had over the last few years and you'll begin to understand why we've been grizzling so long ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say taps are pitiful.  If you're talking large raid mobs, yeah they're not gonna do much... but if you're talking run of the mill trash exp mobs, like normal LDoN for example, it was those very same lifetaps you say are useless that let my SK friend tank &quot;without a single healing class present&quot;.<br />
<br />
2 mobs and I was done, not enough HPs left on my warrior to survive a 3rd mob (our cleric crashed to desktop on zone in, and was stuck in the world for 15 minutes).  So the SK started to tank then since he was full.  I was expecting him to need to sit and wait for the cleric to get back after spending his HPs on the up coming next 2 mobs as well.  But instead, I found he could have done the entire LDoN tanking without a single heal, assuming perfect single mob pulls the entire time... which the class is also capable of doing.  We pulled for 15 minutes till the cleric was able to log back in, and he remained full health after every mob cause of those lifetaps.<br />
<br />
This was tested on Rumblecrush the other day too.  Upon trying to see if he can 3-box the mob, he lost his shaman not realizing the mob rampaged.  No healer now.  He was obviously toast.  But he lasted what he told me must have been 30 seconds cause he kept tapping (the mob was slowed of course).  Called me up to bring my 3-box crew over and help him take the mob.  My warrior and his SK are pretty closely equiped.  Complete heals, with the 10 second cast time, &quot;with stonewall up&quot;, were landing at just the right time chained back to back (one cleric).  Now, it might not have been a full 30 seconds that he was tapping Rumblecrush, as perception in a time like that can sometimes make things seem longer than they actually are...  but the point is, cause of his taps, he lasted longer than I did against the mob while using stonewall.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps don't scale, so of course they become less and less useful as you get closer to end game mobs.  But I feel that if there are any SK upgrades, they need to come in such a way that they only effect these closer to end game SKs that are having the troubles.  You boost SKs across the board however, and you've created a shitload of tank mages at earlier stages of the game.  The stages of the game where they were already suppose to have been balanced, and are already very powerful as it is.  People asking for upgrades have to realize that if they're at a certain stage of the game, that doesn't mean that every SK Norrath over is at that same progression level with them.  Any *across the board* change that makes the end game SKs more powerful will overpower the SKs at earlier stages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Zenogias</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I as an Shadowknight, also agree that across the board SKs should not receive enormous lifetap enchancements.<br />
<br />
However....<br />
<br />
The Lifetap spells that are to come out of OOW should at minimum be doing 1000 damage, aswell as being nearly unresistable with a resist rating of -500 or even something beyond.<br />
<br />
Lower the cast time even further then it is now. Recast time change is questionable, we can &quot;barely&quot; handle something if we chain cast our top PoP tap and any new tap considering that it is MINIMUM 1000, and that should not even be our level 70 tap<br />
<br />
Level 70 is a demi-god title, and the powers that go with being a demi-god should be granted to those who can earn the power.<br />
<br />
A lifetap for SKs of roughly 1500 or more would be perfect at 70. That is more balancing then the shit SKs can see on Lucy currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about adding in lifetaps that have a greater healing than DD portion? For example, a 500 point lifetap that returns 1500hp. That would be a way to increase SK self healing via lifetaps and thus increasing their ability to tank without increasing the DPS portion. Tuning each portion of a life tap independently could be useful, at very least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, killed RC last night as a matter of fact...lifetaps buy around 22 seconds ( using just ToI - got about 2 casts in before 'having' to have the big heal land ). ;)<br />
<br />
The lifetaps are great utilities in XP grinds or LDoNs, where their damage is appropriate. But as pointed out previously in this thread, replace that SK with a Pally, and the Pally does it better - better mana to heal ratios, faster cast times, not to mention stuns. If cast / reuse times and heal to mana ratios were improved, it'd do a lot for the SK class, and this is something IMO that can be scaled throughout the spells at different levels, getting better at the higher levels.<br />
<br />
On challenging content, however, if something can one-round you, or come close to it, no amount of lifetap healing is going to save you. As an SK, I support the popular push in the SK community for the 1.5 minutes, 4.5 reuse, 30% mitigation disc. Numbers aside, the point is something short enough and low enough to not jeopardize infringing on Warriors, yet useful enough to avoid being one-rounded on 'current content' nameds, as well as offtanking, if needed.<br />

Btw...its nice to see these discussions on boards like TSW; really appreciate it. :)</div></div><hr />

If I was ever to get a 700/1400 1 sec cast lifetap I'd be the happiest sk youve ever seen.  Not to mention if they moved a zeefers up to 600 hp/300 mana to go along with it.</div></div><hr />

     I have to agree with the example regarding SK's in normal LDON's.  My SK  never needs a heal in normal adventures if we dont pull more than 2 at a time.  With a touch of slow or a druid debuff, i can keep myself topped off with lifetaps and procs.  In addition, i can provide my group with free FT10.  My group rarely goes oom, i barely need a heal, and i still maintain a significant aggro advantage.  (Im sure a paladin can do as well in the same situation with self-healing.) <br />
When i play my druid, i usually group with my sister, who plays a warrior.  Though we twinked her quite a bit and she can mitigate damage pretty well, Playing a warrior, she needs a healer no matter where she goes.  In an mindless XP group such as normal LDON's, War's provide nothing to the group except a resevoir of HP that you have to fill every once in a while.  I do have to say that the warrior's ability to absorb damage is sufficient enough to do the job in such groups.<br />
     However, when you move onto harder content, you really need that warrior mitigation advantage, and that is the only think that will get you through the fight.  All my lifetaps and procs and zevfeer's bite means nothing at that point.  The tables are turned when guilds or groups have to go against big mobs with big time melee DPS.  <br />
     I think balance for tanks involves increasing Warrior utility in XP group, giving them more skills and ability, and increasing a Knight's ability to mitigate large damage spikes with the use of spells and/or disciplines.    Sounds simple enough, but it doesnt seem like anyone is willing to compromise their monopoly over a particular aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

So its more like 15% extra mana regen. <br />
An amazing boost, better than Quarm shawl.<br />

Would be really interesting to see :<br />
- how much DPSec similary geared Pal/SK take during a KT / Tipt xp session.<br />
- how much DPMob similary geared Pal/SK take during a KT / Tipt xp session.<br />
<br />
SK end up beeing &quot;Offensive Light Tank&quot;<br />
Paladins end up beeing &quot;The Trash Anihilator&quot;<br />
Warriors end up beeing &quot;Boss Specialist&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem with tanking is that when something goes wrong ou need instant tanking boost :<br />
PAL = GHeal / LoH / GLoH / Spot Heal (all of which are group friendly)<br />
War = Shield / AE taunt / Defensive / Fortitude  (some of which are group friendly)<br />
SK = Taps / Diamond skin ? (no comment)<br />
<br />
Give them a : 2000DD Tap , 2000 mana , 2.0 Sec Casting, 2000 Hp group heal.<br />
For &quot;Oh shit&quot; situation flexibility.<br />
<br />
<br />
On trash parses should look kinda like :<br />
<br />
SK : 330 DPS Taken ,   30 Sec Mob Duration : 9900 DMG Taken<br />
War : 300 DPS Taken , 32 Sec Mob Duration : 9600 DMG Taken <br />
Pal : 270-330 DPS Taken, 34 Sec Mob Duration :  9180-11220 DMG Taken<br />
<br />
That should balance up things between :<br />
- The Heavy Tank (Warrior)<br />
- The DPS Tank (SK)<br />
- The Stun Tank (Paladin)<br />
<br />
<br />
For Bosses its another problem, but since stun arent usable.<br />

Too bad theres not enough SK's to really make ourselves heard.  Basically when it comes to tanking SK's need something to compete with Paladin stuns, they create too much of a gap between the classes and when Paladins get stuns up to level 75 next expansion we're going to be pretty much screwed.  Tanking is the primary role of both SK's and Paladins and we need to be equal in that role, our secondary jobs (in order of importance Pulling, Damage for SK and Healing, Buffing, CC for Pal) shouldn't really have any impact on our ability to perform our primary role.<br />
<br />
Also, when it comes to lifetaps when you look at them and think &quot;they're low but they provide damage and healing so they must be alright compared to Pal heals&quot; remember, they provide 85% of the HP swing of a Paladin heal in twice the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about adding in lifetaps that have a greater healing than DD portion?

Tuning each portion of a life tap independently could be useful, at very least.<br />
<br />
I'd be all for the exact opposite of this.  Making the lifetaps do more DD than they heal.  It's the healing portion of the lifetap that makes the SK tank significantly better than a warrior on exp mobs, and also better than a defensive warrior on a few mobs out there (like my Rumblecrush example).<br />
<br />
It's the tanking realm warriors don't want knights taking over, cause it's our only job.  No use in playing if someone else is always doing your only job instead of you.  I wouldn't mind at all if they recieved a DPS upgrade.  DPS uprade would be sweet, my group would kill stuff faster and progress faster (I have two RL friends who play SKs).  Any upgrade to my groupmates, that doesn't step on my toes and take my job away from me, is an upgrade to my character as well.<br />
<br />
But as pointed out previously in this thread, replace that SK with a Pally, and the Pally does it better - better mana to heal ratios, faster cast times, not to mention stuns.<br />
<br />
The pally does that better true, while the SK does other things better to balance it out.  The SK can conceivably give single pulls to the group constantly.  If the pally tries that, he has a good chance of get multiples, which would render his advanced healing moot if he's the only healer with no chance of healing enough to survive the adds, like in my LDoN SK example.  Sure he can stun and heal and do a more mana efficient job at killing that single mob, but it doesn't mean anything if he can't get that single mob to begin with.  The pally can't feign/pet pull one mob into the camp, and tank it, and heal himself while doing damage to the mob at the same time.  The SK does this without relying on anyone else nor having to target himself for a heal.  His heals come on the fly in combat while still damaging the mob at the same time.  So the pallies heals being bigger is balanced in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I don't think SKs lifetaps should be as big as a paladins heal, I don't think that would be fair to paladins.  I feel that SK lifetaps vs. Pally heals are already balanced myself.  When the pally is healing himself with his better heals, he's not doing any damage to the mob.  The SK's lifetaps however are taking the same number of HPs from the mob as they are giving to the SK.  So really, I think the smaller raw value of the heal from the lifetap is still balanced when weighed against the pallies larger heal.  The heal recieved by the SK may be smaller, but it has a different type of advantage instead of simply being bigger.  The mob doesn't last as long, requiring less healing.  You have to take both components of the lifetap into consideration when comparing it to the single component of the paladin heal to get an accurate picture.<br />
<br />
My advantage as a warrior is suppose to be taking the hits better, but my advantages are completely negated if there is no one around to heal me.  Synapticus talks about a good example of this.  Obviously being the best tank means that balance wise I can't also be the best healer.  I feel knights not tanking as well as a warrior is balanced by the fact that they're more self sufficient and don't rely as much on that healer, who is an absolute requirement for me.  One of my downsides to having the most HPs and a skill like defensive.  Everyone has different advantages in different areas, and not all of them overlap, and not everyone has all of them at once.  There needs to be a con to every pro.</div></div><hr />

  Actually, they do... to some extent. Healing for a pally, for example, can keep himself alive when a SK or a warrior couldn't do the same. A SK harmtouching a high DPS, low HP mob will kill it much faster than a warrior or pally could. SKs also have lifetaps, which do add to your effective hp. They might not be good enough to help tanking very much, but they are part of the equation. You have to take them into account, no matter how little they add.

Damage means little for tanking, the overall damage I add doesn't change the amount of damage intake significantly.  That method of tanking better also is only good when you have a mob then nothing then another mob, in a situation where you always have a mob in camp (such as when you have a good puller), that &quot;advantage&quot; is completly gone and becomes a disadvantage.  HT doesn't scale well, with the exception of an accidental upgrade it got when discs became unlinked it's worse now than it was when LDoN came out because it doesn't refresh on death anymore and it used to.  I can only use it once every 65 minutes even though I've spent 12 AA's on making it refresh in 36 (disc refresh is 65, ht is 72 base).  HT can still be useful in single groups in some places but thats about it, I tend to use it on Aneuks when the mezzer is slacking and they're chaining CH there isn't much else use for it.<br />
<br />
Basically what it comes down to is because of Paladin stuns SK's need some stuns also, theres no other way to compete with them without getting them.  Because of Aura of Pain we don't really need as much stunning power as them but we do need some still for useage in exp groups.  A tanking disc thats good for offtanking (lower duration/fast recycle) is also needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Rumblecrush example is very flawed; its older content being taken with overgearing and extra levels included. Without twinking, take a lvl 60 sk and a lvl 60 warrior in gear appropriate for the level of challenge RC produced, and mesure the difference that sk's lifetap makes to him tanking the mob compared to the warrior. This holds true today - an SK's lifetaps are not going to keep them healed tanking any of the GoD trials named or even most trash no more than a warrior can keep themselves healed; both warriors and knights require a / multiple healer(s). Being able to trivialize older content with gear and levels does not mean the class is functioning appropriately.<br />
<br />
SKs do provide a vast amount of available options to a group, but the problem is so many other classes do it better. Its very difficult to balance between grouping and raiding. In grouping, you have limited number of spaces, therefore there is some desire for flexibility. Even so, if warriors and pallies tank much better than an sk, why choose an sk for your group as the tank? If monks, bards, and pacify pullers pull better, all offering more desirable utility or dps, why take an sk for pulling? So sk's are nice in that they can fill a lot of roles, but also hurt since they are outdone in every one of those roles. In raid forces, some like to min / max their makeup, to get the most efficent group together on the raid. In that scenario, why have a class that is behind every other class as a member?<br />
<br />
SK's are a great class, bc of what the do offer in flexibility. We all know that having all the right classes for a situation hardly ever happens, and sk's help to fill some of those gaps. The problem is when those classes are present, sk's are out in the cold, and since tanking is suppose to be our primary function, we feel we should be on par in tanking with other tanks in group content, and with pallies in raid content. Since our DPS cannot gain enough to be meaningful, due to stepping on DPS class's toes, any boost we bring in DPS is negligible. No sensibile knight wants to take damage as well as warriors; all knights look for is equal desirability amoung all 3 tanks in groups, whether for a grind, or for 1 group nameds, and to be equal 'specialty' ( aka offtanks ) as pallies in raids. Many have felt the desire for knights to offtank is leaving the game, least in GoD raids, due to the high DPS adds. So both knight classes are suffering in that respect, and sk's suffer even further down the line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it laughable that people insist on using a Shadow Knight's secondary (utility) value as a means of justifying the tanking gap between Paladins and SKs.  Yes, it does justify a gap between warriors and knights, but not between the two knight classes.  You mention all this utility that I as an SK bring to a group and say this somehow justifies a Pally being a far and away much better exp group TANK than me.  You say this as though Paladins don't have utility.  If that were true, then the gap would be justified, as in the case of warriors vs. SKs.  But Paladins bring an arsenal of utility to the group.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the two knight classes, they should be balanced by starting with two premises:<br />
<br />
1.  Both should be EQUAL at tanking.  One should not be better except in a given handful of special circumstances.<br />
<br />
2.  The overall utility should be EQUAL.  This includes balancing an SK's DPS (offense) and other secondary abilities with a Paladin's far superior healing (defense) and other secondary abilities.<br />
<br />
Paladins should NOT mitigate better, whether it be through stuns or anything else.  Being able to heal better is NOT mitigation, and I have no problem with the fact that they have some pretty good heals they can toss out.  Likewise, having some decent burst DPS is NOT mitigation.<br />
<br />
As for balancing knights against warriors, you still have to balance both tanking (mitigation) and utility between warriors and knights.  But we all know that a warrior's utility value is no where near as high as a knight's.  As such, the logical conclusion will be that a warrior must make up for this disparity by being the better overall tank in all but very special circumstances.  And this includes exp group tanking.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, Paladins are by far the best exp group tank in most situations, with warriors coming in second and SKs third, just as some have pointed out.  The biggest reason for this is STUN, and we all know it.  The amount of mana returned by Zevfeer's Bite is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of healing mana saved by a Paladin's stuns.   And the stuns also make the Paladin much more likely to survive against really hard exp-group mobs like you find in Kod'Taz and Yxxta.  It's not just the fact that they can stun.  It's the fact that they can chain-stun almost indefinitely.  Sure their DPS suffers for it.  But I guarantee you that the group didn't pick them to  tank for their l33t DPS (they don't pick SKs to tank for our l33t DPS either, btw).  They picked them because they would have excellent aggro and excellent surviveability.  They pick warriors because they have decent aggro and excellent surviveability.  And us poor SKs???  Excellent aggro and terrible surviveability in comparison.  Sure, if you're doing normal LDoNs, what do you care?  The SK and Pally can tank equally if they both have Time gear. The pally would have no reason to stun.  Just hold aggro and all is good.<br />
<br />
But put the same two up against challenging exp-group content, and surviveability becomes a HUGE issue.  Can gear overcome it?  Sure.  But when the system is broken from the ground up, how is gear an excuse to perpetuate the broken problem?</div></div><hr />

Similarly geared rangers in my guild have 300-500 HP less than me and maybe 150-200 AC less, depending on their gear choices.  While a ranger isn't the best tank against Kod'Taz level exp mobs, they can actually tank it almost as effectively as an SK.  In fact, what does an SK bring to the table in such a scenario that a ranger doesn't?  Hmm?  SKs have harm touch.  Rangers have HT * 8 with true shot (provided the mob can be snared and kited or rooted).  SKs have absolutely no ability to mitigate damage better than rangers other than the minor HP/AC difference our gear provides.  Rangers can snare better than SKs, and they can also root.  They can heal themselves about as effectively as an SK.  Their normal non-burst DPS is far superior to an SK, whether using a bow or duel-wielding.  Rangers can invis and SoE not only themselves but others.  About the ONLY thing a ranger can't do is feign death.  Oh...and cast the ever-so-uber Zevfeer's Bite.</div></div><hr />

Stun 70 is simply a mistake... it needs to have a cost of say 300 mana on it to justify how powerful the abilty to stun a level 70 mob on demand is.  Even at this cost, at a modest 500 DPS estimation for yellow+ cons in GoD, that's still 2000 damage mitigated for 300 mana.  <br />
<br />
I mean, they put random immunities to Time Rend (stun 68) on yard trash in Qvic+ areas which I assume is because Time Rend's stun is overpowered (and it is) and then they're giving a standard 1 second cast 12 second recast stun for 80 mana to all Paladins?  At the very least it needs to have a 30 second recast time, i.e. for emergencies as opposed to permanently mitigate 1/3rd of all mob DPS.</div></div><hr />

Yes elemental-Gates stuff is nasty, and our tanking abilities show over knights there.  But those aren't the characters that I'm talking about.  What about every warrior vs. SK pre-elemental?  Surely you're not suggesting that since you've achieved elemental that that automatically makes me and the other 90% of the players on our servers elemental as well?  Surely you're not suggesting that since LDoN is a joke that knights should be able to solo any mob in the zone &quot;and&quot; tank better than a warrior through lifetaps while warriors remain no where near able to do the same?<br />
<br />
The high end knights may need some tweaks, but any tweak given to them you have to realize, is gonna also make the knights who were already plenty powerful vs. other classes even more powerful at the other stages of the game.  Everytime I say something like this someone chimes in like the pre-Elemental-GoD game doesn't even exist.  It does.  The entire population isn't stuffed into end GoD zones all with the same balance problem.<br />
<br />
Surely you don't agree that because elemental-Gates knights might need a boost that pre-elemetal knights should be able to solo Kunark dragons better?<br />
<br />
Non-retroactive changes across the entire class need to be discussed, not retroactive ones.  Not changes that will overpower the already overpowered.  This is exactly the opposite of what happened to monks with the mitigation nerf.  The high end monks were tanking stuff they shouldn't be able to tank, so monks living in the older expansions whom didn't need to be nerfed got nerfed... and the high end monks that were tanking stuff they shouldn't be able to tank could still do it!  Mitigation had nothing to do with why those monks could tank those mobs they were tanking.  Yet mitigation is what got nerfed.  The nerf completely missed it's mark.  I'm fairly certain that if GoD knights get a boost, they will barely notice it... meanwhile, the knights living in older expansions will need to be issued super hero capes.<br />
<br />
Here's my suggestion.  Level 70 comes, sweet.  Knights have their standard upgrades, sweet.  Slightly larget lifetaps, whatever.  Then, the &quot;real&quot; big lifetaps that actually mean something to end-game content are No Drop, and drop near that end-game content where only the knights doing end-game content will have access to them.<br />
<br />
Touch of Innoruuk may be fine compared to trash low level xp mobs (like normal ldons, teir 3) groups ya they do shine, they are even pretty decent in time trials ( but that trash doesnt hit hard either). Take that same sk and put him next to a paldain or warrior on a hard hitting -one group- named and then see who last longer<br />
<br />
You don't consider Rumblecrush to be a hard hitting one group named?  He did more damage to me quicker than the 1118 hitting mobs in one of the GoD sewers I tried out the other day... both slowed of course.  And the SK can last 22 seconds compaired to the warrior lasting 12.  That makes that lifetap far better than just &quot;fine&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating any nerfs here... I'm just trying to prevent massive overpoweredness in an area that didn't need to be boosted in the first place.  End-game knights have their issues, pre-elemental knights have none... not a single thing to complain about.  Boosting all knights are gonna give even more to the ones that already questionabley have too much as it is.</div></div><hr />

As for what knights have access to any improvements, that is debatable ( as we have quite a number of times on the SKs boards ;) ). I think its safe to say nothing below 65 would be a consideration. Spell adjustments for the higher DPS mobs, I personally can agree with limited access to. While pallies' heals are far better, teir 1 sks are effective with what we have now. Normal LDoN'ing sk's can as well. The problem is how do you address EPs, GoD, and hard LDoNs? Those are places the spells are warranted, but providing limited access becomes a difficult task, least for the LDoN part ( esp if an extra teir of LDoN is implemented ). As for a knight mitigation ability, while some feel limited access is necessary, from the 1 group named perspective, its justified a lot earlier than some percieve. But that's another story...just seeing acknowledgement like this on non-knight class boards bring tears to my eyes. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
People, SK's included, keep bringing it up, but it's simply impractical.  Upping our DPS would simply make us even better for 2-boxing (not like we need help there) and have no impact on what matters.  SK's don't get groups because of their DPS and until they can compete with the real DPS classes (which will not and should not happen), they never will.  Your tank's DPS means shit when the tank can't stay alive, and even if the tank can survive, his DPS means shit compared to the rest of the group.  Margainally better DPS from the tank is nothing compared to what's comming from 3-4 dedicated DPS classes in a group, and 30+ in a raid.  SK's aren't going to get groups because of their DPS, and they certainly aren't going to get offtanking jobs because of their DPS.  SK's DPS and pulling is analgous to paladins' group friendliness, root-parking, etc.<br />
<br />
A disc is the ideal solution to bring knights into line with warriors because it scales.  It wouldn't really factor in the normal LDoN's you like to base your case on; it's impact would be most significant on named mobs and on raids.  It's also advantageous in that it can be tailored to the specific needs of the class.  Warrior defensive is perfect for raid tanking - long enough to be worthwhile with unparalleled mitigation and a reasonably long refresh because you don't face raid named in rapid succession generally - you can alternate warriors if needed.  The disc given to knights could be tailored more toward offtanking, say 72 second duration and 4.5minute reuse, with 30-35% DI mitigation.  This would be ideal for offtanking - it would be readily available as new waves of mobs are brought in and would be long enough for the short time they're alive.  It would not be of sufficient duration for raid MT'ing, and even if it were, it's lower mitigation % would leave warriors superior (even ignoring advantages such as AE taunt).  Both of these discs would not be a significant factor in grind content like LDoN's or BoT (Note: with the numbers I used, a knight would spend less time under the effect of a discipline assuming both classes used it every time it popped.), both would be sufficient for 1-group named in GoD and elsewhere, and both would fit the traditional role of the class in raids.  <br />
<br />
As I've said before, Defensive is only broken because only one tank class has a form of it.  Beyond that, it serves useful balance purposes.</div></div><hr />

  Pretty please, don't bring a mini-defensive into this. That subject has been run into the ground. Whether you think this is the one and only solution or not, you're just going to break down communications by bringing this up again on the warrior boards.

40% more healing and 40% more caster DPS gives SK’s the advantage unless they are in danger of dieing on the content.<br />

Uh... in any given fight ZB is nowhere near 40% more healing, or 40% more DPS from casters. How exactly do you figure, in a minute or two fight, having lets say 200 more mana adds up to extra anything? Ridiculous.<br />

I really don't think anyone cares how it's done as long as the numbers are the same. What's the diff if it's a &quot;mini /disc def&quot; or if it's some new &quot;/disc lifetap&quot; or if we type &quot;/viable tank on?&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason why people refer to /disc def so specifically is because it's already implemented in the game: toss in a softener variable to lessen it's power and there you have it. <br />
<br />
Inventing some new device doesn't have a very good track record, even in light of the melee upgrades to pull them towards caster dps.</div></div><hr />

There are entire threads dedicated to it. My point is that this thread might be best spent suggesting alternate means of increasing your tanking ability rather than beating a dead horse.<br />
<br />
 My suggestion, again, of increasing the healing without increasing the DPS of lifetaps would be an example of something that would allow you to tank better. An upgraded fear of sorts to compare to the mitigation brought about by stuns is another. Especially if the fear was fixed, short duration (several seconds only) with a built in high percentage snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrthin</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fatal flaw with defensive (and it being a warrior-only discipline) is that it essentially caps the max damage of the mob, rather than just reducing the frequency of max damage hits.<br />
<br />
For the sake of illustration, assume a designer is creating a new boss mob, weighting the DI and DB values in such a way that using defensive results in a 40% reduction in the damage per hit of the mob (not atypical).  If it was to hit a knight (or other class) for 1000 damage per hit, for example, it would do 600 damage per hit to a warrior.<br />
<br />
Clearly, a mob doing 2400 (600*4) damage per round would be trivial for a top-end warrior using defensive, so the mob's base damage would have to be set pretty high to be a danger to a warrior under defensive.  Assuming the warrior has around 12.5k hps raid buffed, the mob would need to do around 3150 damage per hit while he is using defensive to have any chance of killing him outright in one round (more than that, really, taking into account BoV and shielding).  This same mob would normally do 5250 damage per hit without defensive.  There is no knight that could take such a beating, and likely won't be for several expansions to come (if ever).<br />
<br />
Imagine how mobs would be tuned if instead of defensive being simply 0.5*DI it simply shifted the frequency of high DI values lower in such a way that it had the same effect on overall DPS (about a 40% reduction), but still allowed for the possibility, however much reduced, of the mob still doing a quad max damage round.  If that were the case, the boss mob above would still be a real threat to the warrior even if its max damage without defensive was just 3150.  However, that mob would now be in reach for a knight to tank, though they'd need a great deal more healing still than a warrior, and still have a higher risk of being killed too quickly.  Healing requirements overall would drop though (and less dependence on an army of clerics is a good thing).<br />
<br />
Even a mob that hits for 1600 and flurries (1600*8=12800) would still be a danger to that warrior, and yet defensive would still greatly improve his survivability compared to an equally geared knight (who would be one-rounded by a max damage flurry).  With the way defensive works now though, the warrior would only take 960*8=7680 damage at most, trivializing the mob.  And there are plenty of VT and pre-elemental warriors (even LDoN and bazaar-geared) who can reach 8k hps buffed.<br />
<br />
What this illustrates is that defensive as it is now makes a mob that would kill a warrior without defensive doable, even easy, simply by pressing a hotkey, even if their gear is completely outclassed by a knight for whom the same mob would be challenging and extremely risky to tank.  If the mob was slightly tougher and only hit for 2000 and flurried (16000 max), it would be suicidal for a top-end knight to tank, while trivial for an equally-geared warrior using defensive (9600 max).  Even worse, if the mob hit for 2500 and flurried (20000 max), defensive makes it possible but scary (12000 max), while knights would need several expansions worth of gear beyond GoD before they would have a chance of tanking the same mob.<br />
<br />
I know someone is going to chime in and say that a top-end geared knight would have such a high AC that mob DI values are going to be skewed much lower for them than a VT or elemental geared warrior, and they might very well take the same average DPS from a mob as a VT or elemental warrior using defensive.  However, this isn't about average DPS, but rather the worst-case scenario of a mob connecting on all of its attacks for a round or two for full damage.  That VT or elemental warrior has a chance to survive this worst-case scenario, while a top-end geared knight would die outright.  AC just gives you a better chance of avoiding the worst-case scenario, while defensive guarantees that you avoid the worst-case scenario.<br />
<br />
The problem with mob damage continuing to scale up as it has been is that the amount of gear required to overcome the advantage that defensive gives to warriors gets pushed further and further out of reach.  A mob needs to dish out 20k damage (or more) in very short order (one round, or one round+flurry, or two rounds unslowable), in order to be a threat to a warrior with 12-13k hps buffed.  That's a 7-8k disparity in hps that a knight would need to make up to even stand a chance at tanking that mob.  Meanwhile, a warrior's gear can be further and further behind that of a knight, and yet still be able to make up the difference with defensive.<br />
<br />
It's too late to change the way defensive works now (it would be a trivial adjustment to change the way defensive itself works, but would be a massive nightmare rebalancing mob damage across the board to compensate), and anyway warriors would pitch a fit even if they would still take the same average DPS after the change as they would before.  This is why the only solution for class balance is to give knights a reduced form of defensive (30-35%).  There is simply no way around the fact that gear upgrades cannot keep pace with the growing disparity between a defensive warrior and a knight, and any spell-based solution (that doesn't just mimic defensive) that is sufficient to really close this gap would make knights massively overpowered.<br />
<br />
Even so, as mob damage continues to increase, the knight form of defensive is going to have to increase marginally as well, and even approach full warrior defensive at some point, probably when they're sitting at 25k hps while knights are at 20k hps, assuming the game survives that long. :P  30-35% for knights vs. 50% for warriors is a 15-20% difference, or a little less than 3-4k potential damage from a mob that can do 20k in one round.  The mobs that are going to be a challenge to warriors in the future are going to be hitting significantly harder (at least twice hard to be a challenge to a 25k hp warrior).  That 15-20% difference against a mob that can do 40k in one round will be 6-8k, and we're back to where we are today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A defensive-style discipline scales, while lifetaps do not.  Because of that, it is a superior answer to the balance problem.  The solution must be something that scales to content.  The only way to &quot;find something with [our] casting side&quot; would be to essentially create a defensive or a massive BoV type spell based on mana, which accomplishes the same thing but with some unnecessarily inhibitive drawbacks (long refresh after a death anyone?).  There isn't anything along the lines of our current spell book which will scale to the content.  It'll be overpowered on 1-group trash and the like or uselss for raids.  Alisdahre's posts should tell you exactly why a lifetap isn't the answer.  For the same reason improving our leechcurse discipline or any of the number of similar suggestions won't work either.  <br />
<br />
Also, healing isn't mitigation.  Letting us heal better wouldn't stop us from being one-rounded.  It's not nearly as reliable - ever tried casting even 1-1.5sec spells while being quadded by an unslowed mob?  It's hard enough keeping enough aggro spells going; healing oneself consistantly is basically out of the question.  <br />
<br />
Pyrthin - You assessment is largely correct in regards to being one-rounded, but your solution would leave a major part of the problem unresolved.  A big part of the problem is how much closer knights are to non-tanking classes than they are to warriors in tankability.  Being one-rounded is the most pressing threat, but the huge gap in damage taken is still significant, especially with the respective gaps between warriors, knights, and non-tanks.  <br />
<br />
As for your conclusion that upgrades would need to be implimented bringing a &quot;knight-defensive&quot; closer to warrior defensive over time, this is flawed.  Such disciplines scale to content, so, if it were sufficient now, it would be sufficient in the future.  This is of course assuming the game continues to progress as it has been, but that should be a reasonable assumption for someone who can't foretell the future.</div></div><hr />

I was just pointing out that the implementation of defensive is flawed as is, and since it exists and isn't going to be changed, the only way to achieve balance is to give knights some lesser form of defensive.  It's too late now to change defensive the way I think it should be changed, but I agree if it was changed that way, we'd still need adjustments to really set us apart from the non-tanking classes.  I'm advocating the same knight-defensive that you are though.<br />

The reason I believe this needs to be done is that I believe the designers have learned their lesson, and we won't see gear bringing us anywhere near warrior hps again in the future.  As it is now, I've seen at least one warrior magelo with over 11k hps unbuffed, and several other warriors pretty close to it.  I haven't seen any knights close to 10k though, and the closest was only around 9400.  I don't think it'll be too long before warriors have 2k or even 3k or more hps over knights, and that advantage on top of a 15-20% better defensive is just going to leave us right where we are right now.  Mobs tuned to be challenging for a defensive warrior will be impossible for knights, and mobs that are a challenge for knights will be trivial for warriors.  Run the numbers for a mob that can almost kill an 18k defensive warrior, vs. a 15k knight with &quot;knight-defensive&quot;.  The knight is still going to come up about 5k hps short.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only because only one tank class has it.  If all three tanks had a defensive-style disc from the onset, it wouldn't be a problem.  It would simply serve to distance the tanks from the DPS classes (which are increasingly encroaching on our tanking roles); that's a good thing.</div></div><hr />

I've pondered it a bit recently and havn't really decided how to make it work short of using something to the effect of the fear2 line used by fearing mobs in dungeons, but I'm not convinced it couldn't be done eitiher.  I doubt SK's will get a stun in the same sense as pallys do, but something needs to be done to address the glaring inequality between the knight classes.  <br />
<br />
Possibilities include: <br />
<br />
Fear2 line spell - effectively equivilant to stunning the target.  Would be ideal.  <br />
<br />
If it's possible to make a spell overwrite a mob's immunity, it would be simple enough to add a high percentage snare and keep the duration short; pally stuns would still be slightly better in that they wouldn't fuck with rogues and effect mob positioning, but the SK spell would still do the job mitigation wise.  Pally stuns should be slightly better than what SK's get to compensate anyway to account for Aura of Pain and it's upgrade.  <br />
<br />
If the above is not possible, and fear can be coded in partial ticks, a super-short duration fear could possibly work too.  This would be a last resort if the above is not possible and if SOE would refuse to impliment a fear2 type spell, as its drawbacks would be excessively significant with the high number of unsnarable mobs found today.  <br />
<br />
A spin-stun type spell, like Whorl 'till you Hurl and Spin the Bottle would work too.  <br />

<br />
Frodlin, how then would you fix it since stuns are overpowered (which I'm in no way going to try and argue they aren't)?  There really aren't a whole lot of ways for SK's to fix the inequality.  Stuns of our own, disciplines, stackable slows, or buffs that add ridiculous amounts of damage avoidence to us without taking up buff or spell slots.  Can you think of a way that I overlooked?  Stuns are the most attractive of that list unfortunatley.<br />
<br />
Edit: OoW Paladin stuns if they actually go in like that need to have a -hate component on them to balance them out, make it harder for a Paladin to tank while they reduce DPS by such an obscene amount.  So they would end up doing something like stun on inc so it's slowed before the mob is on them, cast 2 low level stuns, cast high level stun, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I agree that a spinning stun isn't the solution. I was refering to a fear that'd last only a couple seconds and the mob would MOVE, adding a dissadvantage to the fear. Add a snare built in so the mob, especially in GoD, doesn't go grab 30 of his friends. It actually IS a sort of fix for SKs. It compares to, but is different, from stun. Seeing as they're increasing stuns, not decreasing them, a viable balancing between SKs and pallies would be to give SKs somewhat of a similar ability.<br />
<br />
I think the real issue is that stuns are overpowered, so I'm beginning to realize that it would be pretty dumb to add another one that's &quot;fear based&quot;. <br />
<br />
  Stuns are overpowered, defensive is over powered. If everyone is equally overpowered, then at least we're balanced between each other. Again, I'd prefer defensive was removed. It'd be a heck of alot easier to balance an innate and mutable mitigation bonus than adding any sort of defensive to other tank classes.<br />

  Fear immunity would be like stun immunity in this case. Simply tag mobs accordingly. It'd add for differentiation between SK and Pally tankable mobs.</div></div><hr />

Without twinking, take a lvl 60 sk and a lvl 60 warrior in gear appropriate for the level of challenge RC produced, and mesure the difference that sk's lifetap makes to him tanking the mob compared to the warrior.<br />
<br />
Flawed?  Not even close.  Didn't you read my blurb about the GoD trial?  I was in one where the mobs hit for 1118 max.  I didn't need defensive up to kill them.  I needed a CH chain cast, so again I was being healed every 12 seconds... but this time 12 seconds &quot;without defensive&quot;.  If a SK can last 22 seconds with lifetaps against a mob that I last 12 with defensive, then OF COURSE an SK will last longer than I do on a mob that requires me to be healed every 12 seconds non-defensive.<br />
<br />
Eventually this gets overtaken when the mob starts hitting big enough.  But not quite yet, not where I'm at progression wise.  Using lifetaps, an SK of equal equipment to my warrior can tank every mob I can non-defensive much better than I can.  And some even when I'm defensive.  The only time my defensive will finally make me tank any mob better than an SK chaining lifetaps is when the mob hits so hard that the hits absolutely must be mitigated down in value for someone to not be one rounded.  So basically, lifetaps are far more powerful than defensive until you get to big enough mobs where lifetaps can't scale like defensive does.  Defensive scales, in that it will always make me mitigate better no matter how big the mob gets true, and yes lifetaps will fall off and not be able to help sudo-mitigate anymore.  But none of that content exists at my level of play.  I'm not in the elementals, I'm not passed the GoD trials yet.  I'm at the starting GoD trials, doing hard LDoNs, doing tower bosses, and taking on the occasional first brood dragon for kicks stage.  The SKs at the end-game level of play need a boost compaired to the warriors they claim.  Whatever, fine, they need an upgrade, I can't say for sure since I'm not there I just have to take their word for it.  But what I'm saying, is that if you boost those knights, it has to be done in such a way that the knights at my level of play &quot;don't&quot; get upgraded with them.  They can already outtank me as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you atleast pop furious then into defensive or just compared raw damage dealt? A war should last well outside of 12 seconds using it's tools available.<br />
<br />
How is that using everything an SK has available to him?  It's one spell.  Compaired to my one discipline used.  I didn't furious, I just used stonewall(defensive).  Using furious would only give no heals needed buffer at the start, would hardly let me survive more than 12 seconds every heal for the rest of the fight.  Even if I used furious, it's a moot point.  It's not the first heal I'm talking about here.  I didn't walk up to Rumblecrush and test how long I'd last till I died.  We one grouped him and killed him.<br />
<br />
With defensive up (stonewall actually, same thing), I had to be healed every 12 seconds or I would have died.  That's chain casting complete heal, one right after the other, 10 sec cast time 2 sec refresh for the gem icons.  Both my friend, and another SK in this very thread displayed that they can tank that very same mob using lifetaps for 22 seconds before needing a heal to land.  If I didn't use defensive, I'd be dead.  If they didn't use lifetap, they'd be dead too.  But the lifetap far outclassed defensive on this mob, and will equally outclass defensive on any mob of this DPS and lower (and I'm sure there are some higher, after all there's a huge gap between 22 seconds and 12 seconds).</div></div><hr />

No, it has no merit because the ability to do it with one overpowered group does not make it a 'one group' mob. The trials are filled with 'one group' mobs because you can never have more than 6 people there at one time. Period. Calling older content 'one group' is as silly as calling Vox or Naggy 'solo mobs'.<br />
Then again, if more high levels with ridiculous amounts of gear were actually DOING GoD instead of farming older content........meh, not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

Rumblecrush doesn't really count as a &quot;hard-hitting one group named&quot; because a) he's not tuned or designed for one-group content(see Partha's reply) and b) he really doesn't hit that hard.  Fast?  Possibly, but only until he gets slowed(which btw you have a huge advantage on, being able to furious and not have to pray for RNG luck during the trying-to-get-slow-to-stick phase).  But hard?  Not really, compared to current content.<br />
If a SK can last 22 seconds with lifetaps against a mob that I last 12 with defensive<br />
Let's try some math here.  A shadowknight's best lifetap is 470 damage, with a 10-second recast and 1.6 second casting time(assuming max spell haste).  Hell, for the sake of this argument, let's go with 500hp healed to account for random focus.<br />
<br />
500hp every 11.6(recast time + casting time) seconds.   That's very roughly 43.1 dps that gets healed back via taps.  If the SK decides to chain-cast his or her level 63 and 65 lifetaps together, and he or she never gets stunned or interrupted or fizzles, it comes out roughly 73.2 hp healed per second.  We'll even bump that up to 80hp/s to count for potential crits.<br />
<br />
So this 80hp healed per second under optimal conditions(less than a level 34 cleric can do, btw) allowed him to last a full 10 seconds longer than you WHILE DEFENSIVE?  That seriously does not seem logical, if you both have gear even remotely of the same calibur.<br />
<br />
Edit:  maybe I'm remembering Rumblecrush as he was during Luclin, without level 65 and pop aa's, but it seems like defensive would cut off more than lifetaps</div></div><hr />

Granted you can't assume them, but you can take the percentage into the calculation if you really want to find an average heal/sec.  Otherwise what you've calculated is really the MINIMUM heal/sec.<br />
<br />
It seems like you're looking for tanking parity using spells rather than a discipline.  How would that EVER happen when SKs admit they have secondary roles and bring a hell of a lot more utility than a warrior to a group?  And now get more hp from buffs than paladins?<br />
<br />
There has been discussion about SKs not being as good of tanks for XP groups.  In xp groups what matters is how fast things dies, to max xp.  It is assumed that your healer can heal you just fine.  Yes, it sucks that SKs might have a more difficult time tanking in trials, but hell in tipt max aa'd harmtouch would take a significant chunk out of KHJ.  Maybe it doesn't work being an &quot;offensive tank.&quot;  Maybe as the tank class that can best solo you give up a little group desireability (maybe you got this from your necro side).  Maybe.  Just trying to bring the big picture.<br />
<br />
And last, what people always seem to forget, is that any balancing reflects over to PVP where SKs are doing just fine atm.</div></div><hr />

In the endgame Time and Discord, how many SK's solo, .... hmmmm, bugger all, ... actually I doubt many SK's solo since PoP came out, fear doesn't work on most of the mobs and druid kiting with the SK spell lineup is a moot point - the return for the risk and time is just not there.<br />
<br />
Lastly; Why the hell drag PVP into this arguement ?<br />
EQ PVP is a badly implimented afterthought nothing more.<br />
<br />
Too casually throw in the generalisation on 98% of all SK's that they should recieve minimal balance because it might affect PVP is just plain desperate on your part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, that does not seem logical.  But then again, here we are.  Another SK in this very thread even confirmed that he could do the same.  He lasted 22 seconds against this mob, a mob who puts out more DPS than any hard LDoN mob, while I only lasted 12 seconds while defensive against the same mob.<br />
<br />
We're both equiped fairly close to each other, both with nearly the same LDoN gear.  I've got a small hp advantage, and he has a small AC advantage.  Although, being a boss mob, they tend to follow a trend that no amount of AC is going to make a huge difference in mitigation.  (Which is why monks were able to tank some things they weren't suppose to, which led to their unfortunate nerf.  Everyone takes near max damage regardless of AC vs. that mob's ATK, and it was the monk's avoidance that put him over the top.  Sony missed the target on that one).<br />
<br />
I'm curious, what was the AC softcap in the Luclin era?  I had thought I heard 1250 for Velious and around 1450 for Luclin, then no real cap at all in PoP.<br />
<br />
If this is simply a case of SK utility trivializing older content due to some wacky AC handling that screws me on that same content, my mind is a lot more at ease.  That's more of a programming limitation rather than in in-character limitation.  This could possibly be a case of where at level 65 with much higher stats, I still get eaten just the same as I did when I was level 60 tanking this mob because of crazy AC vs. ATK programming into the bosses of that era.  After all, if AC is near meaningless on this mob, and AC and HPs are all that I have to rely on, my extra 2k HPs since then are my only real addition to the fight.  Any AC upgrades I've had since then are moot.  Where as the SK got lifetap upgrades, which let him go above and beyond that same AC limitation he'd have (well, the illusion of it anyway).<br />
<br />
I remember tanking this dude at level 60, and how well I held up against him while the heal chain was going off.  I remember shouting to the cleric chain to slow down because I wasn't taking nearly the damage I expected to take, and I didn't want them wasting all that mana.  Trying this mob again now, when I'm faaaar more powerful than I was back then, I expected to last a hell of a lot longer against him, but I didn't.<br />
<br />
I thank you for providing a good argument that let me realize that, and &quot;hopefully&quot; this truely is the case.  This fight compounded with the fact that those same lifetaps lets the SK tank with no heals in LDoN, makes the SK look like a super hero compared to me.  I'm hoping you're right and that it's only because of these special cases that it looks that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, as a warrior you start off with more HP/AC than the SK. Second, your mitigation is higher.<br />
<br />
If you have similar gear/AAs, you have AT LEAST 500-1000HP more than the SK.<br />
<br />
So you say he lasted 10 seconds more than you?<br />
<br />
470 lifetap, 10 second RECAST, 3s casting time.<br />
330 lifetap, 3 second RECAST, 6s casting time.<br />
(rounded number for easy calcs +/- 1s wont change nothing).<br />
<br />
So he could have 470, then 330. That took like 9s. He got 800HP back.<br />
Then he could again 470+330. Another 800HP back.<br />
<br />
So... assuming no interrupts (haha) and nothing going bad, he got 1600 HP back.<br />
<br />
Oh wait.. he started at 1000HP lower than you... so that uber 600HP assuming nothing went bad compensated for your higher AC, mitigtion and other warrior abilities and he lasted twice as long as you?<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHA. Bullshit.<br />
<br />
EDIT: You also said you had 2k more HP than him, so in fact using his taps, he was at -400 from you. Even more laughable.</div></div><hr />

Your attitude is only thing that is a load of crap.<br />
<br />
First of all, as a warrior you start off with more HP/AC than the SK. Second, your mitigation is higher.<br />
<br />
More HPs, not more AC.  &quot;Equally&quot; equiped knights will ALWAYS have more AC because I don't get 50AC on my offhanded weapon.<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHA. Bullshit.<br />
<br />
Fuck you.  I provided what I saw, someone else also saw the same thing in this very thread (lasting 22 seconds).  The one thing I can't stand more about assholes like you is when you call someone telling the truth a liar.<br />
<br />
EDIT: You also said you had 2k more HP than him, so in fact using his taps, he was at -400 from you. Even more laughable.<br />
<br />
I said I had 2k HPs over what I had when I tanked him at level 60 long ago.  I never said I had 2K HPs over the SK.  LDoN equipment is all plate classes remember, that SK the same AC and HPs per slot as I do, leaving only my innate class HP advantage the only seperation.  And I don't have the 500HP Gates AA yet to make that gap wider.<br />
<br />
You seem to have also missed the part where an explaination for how this was possible was offered.  The SK can last 22 seconds, and I lasted 12 seconds while defensive, period.  That's what happened.  There's no refuting that, that's what I saw, that's what happened.  No amount of calling me a liar will ever change that.  But you missed the new explaination as to why this could have happened.  AC softcaps, and boss mobs that have a very high ATK.  The boss mobs of that era, Velious and Luclin, had such high ATK ratings, that tanks took max hits most of the time regardless of their AC.  That right there is what could have negated any advantages I had over the SK at that point, because AC is about all I can rely on to mitigate that damage.  The SK has a nice new little toy that came with the next expansions, higher lifetaps.  Rumblecrush's ATK rating can't effect the amount lifetap does.  But his ATK rating can still wipe my AC rating off of me like it never existed.</div></div><hr />

That's laughable.  Yes I saw the description DAY ONE of this games commercial release when I rolled him, and it says I'm am unmatched at taking abuse from mobs.  Yours doesn't say unmatched, mine does.  You're using a decription that says I'm suppose to be better at tanking than you as your defense that it's moot that you can in actuality tank better than me?  Are you dislexic?  What you just said is completely backwards.<br />
<br />
None of this holds merit against sk spellbook revision and or sk burst mitigation abilities, it appears to be a poor attempt at a derail.<br />
<br />
Yes it does.  It means that if an SK can outtank me, upgrades to that class will only make him tank even better than that.  Duh.<br />
<br />
I've already admitted that this may be a rare case when taking previous expansions AC caps and special boss ATK ratings into account.  The mob hits for max almost all the time, and no amount of AC changes that.  More AC on my part may not matter on this mob at all, where as the lifetaps get right around that limitation.  I've hit the top of how good I can get against that mob other than simply getting more HPs.  But because of spells, the SK is able hurdle right over that little blockade.  The SK in this example was able to use what was given to his class up to level 65, whereas I'm capped to what I was at level 60 mitigation wise when I did this the first time.

Get over it, warrior equipment have more AC / HP than Knights. I am not talking 2 guys in full banded. Both classes with their class armor, that's a fair comparison. Now add your warrior HPs and increased mitigation.<br />
<br />
Look at the casting times (even haste, maybe we can slip in an additionnal lifetap).<br />
<br />
You can claim whatever you want, but the numbers speak for themselves. I bet one of those lifetaps is interrupted as well. How can he last twice what you last while taking more damage, without defensive and having his few lifetaps he can cast in that amount of time nearly negated by your HP margin?<br />

Hi, two clerics for your gimpy ass, since I dont have a magelo link, a parse, or any proof Im just going to assume you suck, your lying, and trying to drive a wedge into what was a partally constructive converasation into another war vs sk thread.<br />
<br />
Your post holds no merit since I have no magelos to compare, and all evidence shows that the sk taps would not be sufficent for the situation your describing.  Did the knight have leech touch? Sk taps do jack and shit to any mob that hits beyond our returns for the tap, its not like Im not getting hit, stunned, interupted while trying to cast a 1.5 sec tap thats not going to do nearly 1/4 of the damage that was done to me during the cast time alone, just dosent happen.

<br />
Frodlin, how then would you fix it since stuns are overpowered (which I'm in no way going to try and argue they aren't)? There really aren't a whole lot of ways for SK's to fix the inequality. Stuns of our own, disciplines, stackable slows, or buffs that add ridiculous amounts of damage avoidence to us without taking up buff or spell slots. Can you think of a way that I overlooked? Stuns are the most attractive of that list unfortunatley.<br />
<br />
Edit: OoW Paladin stuns if they actually go in like that need to have a -hate component on them to balance them out, make it harder for a Paladin to tank while they reduce DPS by such an obscene amount. So they would end up doing something like stun on inc so it's slowed before the mob is on them, cast 2 low level stuns, cast high level stun, etc...<br />
<br />
Brael,<br />
<br />
I just think it's stupid to match overpowered abilities.  If Paldin stuns go live the way they are, which would be the stupidest thing in the history of EQ, then of course Sk's and warriors would both be hosed, SK tanking more than anyone.  I MAY even fully agree with you that a de-aggro on stuns, and giving different types to both knight classes could be a good thing by creating a new role of &quot;non tanking mob manipulation&quot;.   Otherwise, I want a 4 second stun on stunkick too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you, Alisdahre, ever considered the remote possibility that the SK just had a lucky round?  Fighting RC once each and making such a claim, with absolutely no log parses, magelo profiles, or anything else to support it is kind of...wellll....pointless.  Everyone knows the RNG in EQ is highly variable.  If RC runs up and misses 6 times in a row (and boss mobs can and DO have that happen quite frequently), then it's easy to imagine an SK lasting 22 seconds without a heal.  But all you have at this point is purely anecdotal evidence.  Post some logs.  Post the respective magelos so that the rest of us can actually compare the equipment.<br />
<br />
The fact is, SK lifetaps are interrupted VERY frequently when tanking even trash mobs.  Against boss mobs or any hard/fast hitting named, whether it's geared for single groups or trivialized old content, it simply isn't near as useful.  SK lifetaps are best used in non-tanking situations.  They are great for keeping an SK alive on AE mobs.  They can be useful for offtanking, providing the mobs being offtanks aren't similar in calibre to named mobs themselves (hello yellow cons in Ikkinz).  If you played a high-end SK on a regular basis, you would understand just how unreliable lifetaps are as a means of mitigating damage.  I still try to use them, but they are just ONE SMALL TOOL that we have to try and use to survive.  They aren't a deciding factor by any stretch.  I've been trying to tank some of the named in Kod'Taz lately, and when deciding which spell to cast, I have to balance between well-timed lifetaps that *might* help me survive a damage spike for a few seconds longer and high-aggro spells, all of which have a very high rate of interruptions.  If SKs had several one-second cast time high-heal-ratio lifetaps, then you would have a point.  But we don't.  We only have ONE quick-casting lifetap, and it probably never gets memmed at level 65 due to the fact that it's a level 49 spell.<br />
<br />
Your data is simply flawed.  Not saying you're a liar.  This may have, indeed, happened exactly as you described.  But it's not a stretch at all to say that if it really did happen this way, the SK was simply lucky...or you were simply very UNLUCKY with the roll of the dice.</div></div><hr />

This happened END OF STORY, and a reason why it probably happened has been offered, but you still can't seem to understand.  All you want to do is flame and make sure that what happened to me doesn't find it's way to the right ears in fear of a nerf.  Your numbers don't mean jack, you looked at some spell descriptions, and a false idea of how defensive works, and pulled some shit out of your ass.  I saw a real working example of this in action, not just added up some numbers and passed it off as though it never happened.<br />
<br />
Fuck you and your gimp comments, you have no idea what took place you weren't there.  Another SK in this very thread did the same thing and agreed that he can last 22 seconds, but that's too scarey for you to admit that it happened.<br />
<br />
Bring two clerics?  You're only proving you're overpowered now.  If a warrior is suppose to tank better than a knight, how in the hell can you possibley advocate that things are balanced when your class requires one cleric and mine requires two on the same mob with both classes having near identical stats?<br />
<br />
Nothing like seeing something odd in the game, being offered a perfectly logical explianation as to why it could have happened, accepting it, but then having assholes like yourself continue to jump on the original issue as though the explaination was never presented nor accepted.<br />
<br />
I accepted the explaination, AC vs. ATK on that mob is unlike other mobs, and can lead to some odd results.  It sounds logical, and is probably why I saw what I saw.  But unfortunately, you'd rather tune that out so that you can flame someone instead.  You'd rather say how gimp I must be, but fail to realize that if you yourself attacked that same mob all of your AC would mean nothing as well, making you just as &quot;gimp&quot;.  You're throwing stones from a glass basement.  The only difference, is that you've got lifetaps that can help mitigate the damage coming in that no amount of AC will help mitigate.  I don't have that option.  I don't have a level 65 skill that helps reduce damage taken that I can use on that mob.  All I have is AC and defensive, two skills which work exactly the same way against this mob as they did when I was level 55-60.<br />
<br />
If a druid entered a Kunark zone, and all of a sudden his new 2k+ heals no longer worked cause they weren't a part of that expansion, then a shaman came in after him but was allowed to retain his 1950 heal even though it too was from a later expansion, that would compare to what happened to me reguarding my AC.  All of my benifits on this mob were cancelled out by the AC cap of that zone.  The SK retained his benifites from future expansions and is able to bring them to the fight (his lifetaps), meanwhile my AC wasn't retained when I zoned into a Luclin zone, so was of course overpowered compared to me.<br />
<br />
50% damage reduction?  You're damned clueless about defensive.  First of all, it's 45% to &quot;mitigation&quot;, not 45% damage reduction, not 50% damage reduction like you think it is.  A max hit of 700ish coming from this mob is not reduced to 350ish.  It is reduced to high 500s.</div></div><hr />

Your thing barely adds up if those are the only variables. But whatever. Like I said, many other classes can last longer than a warrior using a spell, you should be reading what others type as well instead of just saying fuck you.<br />

<br />
I see different everyday.  See, the problem is that I've got people from farther up in the game commenting.  Of course lifetaps are less useful at that stage of the game.  The mobs just hit too hard for it to make an impact.  But the thing is, non-elemental plus players aren't capped at level 60 spells.  Players who are level 65 at pre-PoP stages of the game are not rendered unable to mem their lifetaps when they enter those zones.  I'm rendered unable to use my full AC because of softcaps with nothing else from later expansions to help me mitigate.  The knights have a way however.  This is why a knight can solo a kunark dragon and I can not.  While my AC value can't grow anymore in previous expansions, cause it's been capped out, the knights are getting bigger heals and bigger lifetaps than they had before.  I'm maxed, they keep getting bigger.  This doesn't make old content trivial for these people, it makes &quot;current&quot; content trivial for these people.  They may be useless at the level you get them if you follow end-game content, but they make knights at my level of play far more powerful than me on anything but the most brutal of encounters.<br />
<br />
I started a warrior the day of release because I wanted to be the beefiest sword wielder to get in a mobs face.  That was my description.  What changed with PoP however, is that now I'm the weakest tank save for those encounters that I don't even have access to.  The game progressed higher and higher, trivializing older content for everyone &quot;but&quot; pure melee classes.  Because while spells are enough to trivialize it, our upgrades are no where near the same leaps and bounds.  We got more HPs and more AC, but so did everyone else with us.  While this makes things balanced at the end-game, it scews class lines lower down.<br />
<br />
They can be useful for offtanking, providing the mobs being offtanks aren't similar in calibre to named mobs themselves (hello yellow cons in Ikkinz).  If you played a high-end SK on a regular basis, you would understand just how unreliable lifetaps are as a means of mitigating damage.<br />
<br />
I know exactly what you're saying and I agree and have been agreeing the whole time.  High-end SKs don't get that much use from their lifetaps.  Yes.  But that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  I'm not talking about a high-end warrior vs. a high-end SK.  I'm talking about a pre-elemental warrior vs. a pre-elemental SK.  Remember, just because your guild is elemental plus, doesn't mean that every guild the game over is.  There are guilds that are still doing nothing but Velious content, because they aren't equiped well enough for anything harder yet.  The knights of this era have high-end knight heals and lifetaps, but the warriors of this era do not have high end abilities that they were able to carry over into that older expansion.  The knights are given all of their highest spells, end-game or not end-game, while his entire guild can't get into the zones that have the balancing upgrades for the warrior.<br />
<br />
I still try to use them, but they are just ONE SMALL TOOL that we have to try and use to survive.  They aren't a deciding factor by any stretch.<br />
<br />
No, not at your level they're not a deciding factor.  I agree.  At your level of content, they are just one small tool.  At my level of content, they are WAY powerful and not just a small tool.  No small tool would allow someone to solo what is current content to their level of progression.  Remember I talked about that SK being able to do a regular LDoN without a single heal, and another SK spoke up that he was able to do the same in this thread.  As trivial as LDoN is, that's still a ton of power.  Think about a cleric and warrior in an LDoN (if 2 characters alone in there were possible).  Then think about a cleric and an SK.  Because of those lifetaps, the cleric can nuke instead of heal every fight.  The SK is far more efficient of a tank &quot;at my level of play&quot;, not talking about &quot;your level of play&quot; remember.  If he didn't use lifetaps, he'd go down just as fast as I would.  So I hardly consider lifetaps to be a small tool &quot;at my level of play&quot;, not considering &quot;your level of play&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is why I'd rather not see a new larger lifetap that is available to all SKs.  This is why I'd rather not see a new larger heal that is available to all Paladins.  At my level of play, they're already more powerful than me.  The fact that they're not in end-game zones won't stop them from getting level 70 and the new lifetaps.  Leave the upgrades where they're needed, not where they're not needed.  Only the end-game SKs need these larger lifetaps.  The non-end-game SKs don't need them, they have nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to tank some of the named in Kod'Taz lately, and when deciding which spell to cast, I have to balance between well-timed lifetaps that *might* help me survive a damage spike for a few seconds longer and high-aggro spells, all of which have a very high rate of interruptions.  If SKs had several one-second cast time high-heal-ratio lifetaps, then you would have a point.<br />
<br />
You're comparing your lifetap ability to content I'm not able to do yet.  I have a point, it's just that you're not considering where I'm coming from when I point it out.<br />
<br />
Your data is simply flawed.  Not saying you're a liar.  This may have, indeed, happened exactly as you described.  But it's not a stretch at all to say that if it really did happen this way, the SK was simply lucky...or you were simply very UNLUCKY with the roll of the dice.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll test this more as that mob is a target I wouldn't mind hitting a lot for the hell of it.  The whole reason this all got started was because someone said lifetaps are pitiful, so I pointed out that at my level of play they're no where's near pitiful and gave examples of why.  Other SKs confirmed they have done the same.  So I went with it, as it seemed to have been confirmed from another SK to have not simply be a freak occurance.  Maybe the SK was lucky, and the sample size isn't big enough.  But seeing what my SK friend can do on high risk LDoN mobs every time we do them, tells me that he's certainly not hurting for power.  In fact, he laughs at all of these knight discussions telling me full well that he has nothing to complain about.  Which is exactly the same way I look at warrior aggro problems.  I've never had a problem with aggro, ever.  I myself know that we have nothing to complain about after having recieved incite, even though you'll hear others swearing up a storm about it not being enough.<br />
<br />
You've discussed good things and pointed them out in an intelligent manner, instead of like a few others that would rather belt out &quot;you're gimp&quot;.  I'm willing to consider any real reasons why this happened, &quot;you're gimp&quot; isn't a real reason it's just an insult :(  The kind I respond back to in like.<br />
<br />
I know for sure that I wasn't simply unlucky however.  I didn't test the mob and die in 12 seconds like I think some people are assuming.  I tanked him the entire time, and every single heal was needed as fast as I could cast them (I was 3-boxing, the cleric being one of the characters).  If I was simply unlucky, that unluck wouldn't have lasted the entire battle.  This is 6 pre-elemental characters on a 100kish mob, so it's not like we dropped him in 24 seconds for a sample size of 2.  If I was unlucky on the 12 second rounds, I should have seen some 20 second rounds.  Never happened.  I was running out of mana, and luckly we killed him before I was totally out.</div></div><hr />

Is it overpowered when used in previous expansions? Maybe...but then so is a rogue with a 21/20 dagger in PC, or a cleric with FT15 in SolB. One cannot balance a game like EQ both backwards &amp; forwards, least not very easily.

I just think it's stupid to match overpowered abilities.  If Paldin stuns go live the way they are, which would be the stupidest thing in the history of EQ, then of course Sk's and warriors would both be hosed, SK tanking more than anyone.  I MAY even fully agree with you that a de-aggro on stuns, and giving different types to both knight classes could be a good thing by creating a new role of &quot;non tanking mob manipulation&quot;.   Otherwise, I want a 4 second stun on stunkick too.<br />

Unfortunatley even deaggros on stuns wouldn't fully fix it, would fix it some atleast</div></div><hr />

When it comes to trivializing older content, you are right.  An SK can solo trivialized stuff a warrior can't, or can't as easily.  I can solo dragons in WW easily now, some with no more healing than what I get from lifetap procs.  For those dragons, I'm sure a well-geared warrior could solo almost as well.<br />
<br />
But Xanathol is right.  Trivialized older content just can't be discussed in the same conversation as class balancing.  It's a completely different issue.  And for the most part, it doesn't have a huge impact on the game.  What do I get out of soloing WW dragons?  Bad faction and a couple thousand tribute points.  What do I get from soloing Gore?  A haste belt if I'm lucky that can be sold for 15k.  Money means nothing at my level of play, unless I want to equip an alt.  And when it gets down to it, if a farm bot is what I want, there are far better choices than an SK.<br />
<br />
I have been through the various levels of the game, though.  I believe it may have been Frodulin that once very accurately pointed out that a hybrid is at his most powerful point with his spellbook during the early stages of an expansion.  We become more powerful with our melee side at the latter stages of an expansion.  Touch of Innoruuk would be very powerful in the early stages of PoP, and certainly prior to PoP.  But what can the game designers do about that?  Maybe they should make it so that higher level spells can't land on these older mobs.   I doubt that would go over very well at all with the EQ community in general, though.<br />
<br />
If your SK friend is tanking significantly better than you on non-trivial content, then you may want to look at various reasons why that may be.  When I first started doing LDoN missions, my AC was pretty sucky...probably in the 1500 buffed region.  LDoN normal mobs weren't extremely hard for me to tank, but I certainly required healing.  Now...it's a complete joke, I will admit.  My favorite way of trivializing normal LDoN runs is to bring 2-3 SKs and keep eveyr healed with Zev's Bite x 3.  Or to bring a cleric with a Blackstar Mace.  Oh, that's a ton of fun!  But in either case, my AC is so high that these guys can barely hit me now.  It would be no different with a warrior, except for the fact that I have broken the threshold where my proc heals and occasional Zev's Bite are enough to keep me almost completely healed, whereas the warrior has NO way to heal himself.<br />
<br />
But again, this is trivialized content.  Put me in a hard LDoN, and I actually have to be careful about what I take on.  And an equally geared  warrior can still tank equally as well or better, because 2-3 SKs aren't going to keep the gorup full with just Zev's Bite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alis, what you are discussing is trivializing older content. EQ is a game made with a  progression in mind.<br />
<br />
Definately.  The only thing is that people progress at different rates.  I'm progressing, it's just that with every expansion I get a little bigger while the other classes grow by leaps and bounds.  I mean, just because a new expansion comes out where we are indeed balanced, doesn't mean that people in previous expansions don't have the right to play a fair game anymore.<br />
<br />
The description of my class didn't say &quot;raid only&quot; in it.  And that's what's happening.  As more and more expansions come out, everyone but pure melee classes are given abilities that trivialize previous content.  I was the largest tank from old world all the way up to Luclin within my circle of friends and my family guilds.  But now, I'm required to join a 60+ man guild if I want to remain bigger than them, while they remain happy in the family guild getting more powerful.  My tanking powers are slowly diminishing compaired to their's now after PoP was release, unless I forgo all current relationships and ditch them.  Which I'm not willing to do, so I'll forever be in their shadows, once the king.  The only reason they're still letting me tank is because they know it's the only thing that makes me happy and the only way I'll play the game, cause I know damned well that it would be more mana efficient to just let my SK friend tank instead.<br />
<br />
ToI for a 65sk is right about where it needs to be, as far as amount healed, in a lot of PoP ( still needs tweakin, believe it or not, but that's besides the point ). Is it overpowered when used in previous expansions? Maybe...but then so is a rogue with a 21/20 dagger in PC, or a cleric with FT15 in SolB.<br />
<br />
For sure those items are overpowered in previous expansions... but the thing is, where did that 21/20 dagger come from?  An area of the game that I, nor any of my rogue friends can get to yet.  So while I slowly become overpowered in previous expansions, they're given spells outright that make them leaps and bounds more overpowered in previous expansions.<br />
<br />
It's just very frustrating to know that I have the skill to play this game, but not given the tools to match my peers around me in power to fully take advantage of that skill like they can.  My friends SK can 3-box high risk LDoNs using his SK, shaman, and mage.  I can't even begin to do the same thing with my warrior, cleric, and wizard.  And it has nothing to do with how skilled I am or am not at the game, it has everything to do with the tools given to everyone but my classes.  Yes, on the most basic level it's jealousy.  Unless I sell out and go elsewhere away from my friends, I'm slowly dimishing, and will never achieve the power their classes were given.<br />
<br />
And for the record, when I did RC, he was slowed, and missed a lot, doing less damage than a hard LDoN mob, IMO<br />
<br />
He was slowed, and missing a lot here too, this is the same mob we're talking about after all.  But he was certainly doing more damage than an LDoN mob.  I don't have to go defensive on a high risk LDoN mob, I did on this guy.  I'm not sure why there's such a difference here, did you debuff him in any other ways that we may have not done?<br />
<br />
But please, please, ( and I mean this sincerely ) stop trying to balance using arguments with older content; it just doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Why doesn't it work?  Because people who are not end-game don't matter?  Balance in a game like this can not come soley from the last few zones in the game.  Saying that I can't use older content as examples is the same as saying that a non-elemental geared character has no right fighting in non-elemental zones.  To an elemental character this is old content.  To a non-elemental character this is fresh content they've never seen before.  I'm not allowed to complain about balance problems earlier in the game?  I'm suppose to load up EQ for the first time and just appear in elemental zones right off the bat?  That old content exists for reason, so that it can be played, not ignored as moot.</div></div><hr />

Aye, and that's the point.  A well geared warrior could solo almost as well.  Problem is, that good gear you're talking about comes from an area of the game I'm not too yet.  The SK didn't need to go there to solo the dragons, but I do.  I think this whole argument can be summoned up with one sentence &quot;Spells grow in power much faster than melee does&quot;.  I don't think that it's fair that I'm required to do higher end content just to match the power of people that are below that higher end content.  After putting 5 years into my character, it's too late to do that all over again.  The class changed out from under me.  It changed in such a way that I can't grow as large and as fast as any spell caster around me both doing the same content.<br />
<br />
But Xanathol is right.  Trivialized older content just can't be discussed in the same conversation as class balancing.  It's a completely different issue.  And for the most part, it doesn't have a huge impact on the game.<br />
<br />
Yes it does.  It has a huge impact.  Once again, and I have to keep repeating this because no one seems to have understood word one of it yet...  just because you're elemental plus, does not mean that I am.  It has a huge impact on the game for everyone not end-game.  And that's a much larger population.<br />

<br />
You're talking about things that mean nothing to &quot;you&quot;, but mean &quot;everything&quot; to other people that play this game.  Yes, it's meaningless compared to what you get end-game... it's far from meaningless where I'm at.  Just because it's trivial to an end-game character, doesn't mean that it's okay for me to get screwed out of my tanking job by someone that can do it better because of their upgraded spells.<br />

That's a good observation.  But I'm not complaining about being outclassed by spells from an expansion that I'm currently doing.  I'm complaining that since none of us have access to these end-game zones in future expansions, I will not increase much in power meanwhile the people with spells will.  That's like giving warriors easy to obtain weapon upgrades every expansion, but not giving rogues any unless they actually hunt to the end of that new expansion to get them.<br />
<br />
Maybe they should make it so that higher level spells can't land on these older mobs.   I doubt that would go over very well at all with the EQ community in general, though.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want this either.  See, if you fight to these end-game encounters I feel you have every right use your items anywhere in the world.  The trouble is, casters don't have to go to that end-game content to get half of their upgrades (spells), and I do.  The only thing pure melee have is equipment... which they can only get through challenge.  The people with spells are boosted significantly without trying very hard at all.  The older content becomes trivial for them, but stays near the same for me.  I wouldn't suggest making high level spells not land on mobs.  I would suggest making high level spells no drop and only drop from those high end zones.  That way, the spell is balancing high end content, and not overpowering the players stuck in previous content.<br />
<br />
If your SK friend is tanking significantly better than you on non-trivial content, then you may want to look at various reasons why that may be.<br />
<br />
As stated earlier, I think I have an idea why in the Rumblecrush case.  AC caps didn't allow me to use the full power of what I'm wearing.  The only thing I have to rely on.  AC caps effected the SK as well, but he had a way of getting around that better than I did on this particular fight.<br />
<br />
But again, this is trivialized content.  Put me in a hard LDoN, and I actually have to be careful about what I take on.  And an equally geared  warrior can still tank equally as well or better, because 2-3 SKs aren't going to keep the gorup full with just Zev's Bite.<br />
<br />
Once again, yes it comes down to jealousy.  If it's old trivialized content, then why has it not become as trivial for me as it has for them?  The upgrades and things I could get if I was able to take on the things other classes are allowed to do in trivialized content... I'd feel a hell of a lot more pride, instead of feeling like I'm weak compared to them.  It's the spells, not the armor that's doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. spell accessibilty compared to gear...while an SK can buy ToI in the bazaar, more and more gear is becoming no drop..this is being fixed ( see GoD spell drops ).<br />
<br />
2. Playing at a different level of the game is really not what you are doing - you are attempting a 60's raid level target with one group, meaning automatically, you are overpowered for the encounter the way is was meant to be if you are over lvl 60, and have late luclin+ spells, AAs, or gear. Obtaining balance for that situation is near impossible.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I know not how to explain it otherwise. Can we return to discussion on tank balance at the PoP, GoD, etc game please ( not to be disrespectful, but this has really been a derailment )?</div></div><hr />

High-end SKs don't get that much use from their lifetaps.  Yes.  But that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  I'm not talking about a high-end warrior vs. a high-end SK.  I'm talking about a pre-elemental warrior vs. a pre-elemental SK.  Remember, just because your guild is elemental plus, doesn't mean that every guild the game over is.  There are guilds that are still doing nothing but Velious content, because they aren't equiped well enough for anything harder yet.  The knights of this era have high-end knight heals and lifetaps, but the warriors of this era do not have high end abilities that they were able to carry over into that older expansion.  The knights are given all of their highest spells, end-game or not end-game, while his entire guild can't get into the zones that have the balancing upgrades for the warrior.<br />
<br />
I understand where you are trying to go with this, but, 63+ spells aren't just handed out.  The time we spend farming plat/items to sell for spell money (again, talking those who can't get gylped rune spells on their own)  is time you can spend farming ldon points for anger augs or items, or even plat for high-end bazaar upgrades.  Knights still probably come out ahead, but keep in mind that something like a WMBS (which war and knight paid the same for) is only 80% as good for the knight as the warrior (due to skill caps).  The same pieces of armor are probably 5-10% better for the warrior than the knight (again, due to caps).  [Part of] Those differences are to be made up for by spellbooks.  And finally, level 65 spells are designed for a certain amount of focii and FT, which bazaar geared knights tend to be lacking.<br />
<br />
And just for reference, my 65 shaman is missing Fot7 (out of the big four level 65 shaman spells) and the only 65 spell my SK has is the level 49? necro summon corpse spell.  Plat doesn't grow on trees for most of us.  If you take the price of all the spells level 63-65 that knights have to buy, I wouldn't be surprised if a warrior had at least an extra 5k per slot to spend on better gear.<br />

<br />
Find it odd people talking about the power of ZB and SK lifetaps. I saw someone say about ZB<br />
<br />
FT 5 * 2 hours = up to 6000 mana, that is rather significant <br />
<br />
6000 mana in 2 hours significant ?? get real. Its 15 CH's in 2 hours (if you ignore mana pres etc) enough mana for 1 extra CH every 8 mins. That is hardly significant although I will grant you it is handy extra mana but not exactly something that casters go around say 'we must have an SK here for the mana regen they give'<br />
<br />
<br />
Lifetaps - yeah they are nice, indeed at times a lifesaver , but of zero value if the mob one rounds you anyway . Too many people have posted how great they are in this thread as if they were mana free instant cast 1 second recast kind of spell. Well errr they arnt. 330 mana a pop,  and can only be cast every 10 seconds. But there is no way that any SK can regen 330 mana every 10 seconds. Lifetaps are probably the biggest mana hogging spell an SK has and are not something we can cast indefinatly. Yes normal LDON could well be done without a healer with a well equiped  SK using lifetaps, but then a normal LDON could be done with a warrior using bandaids almost as easily ;)<br />
<br />
SKs need something to bring us into line as a tank. Warriors should without a doubt remain THE best tank, especially on boss mobs. Paladins and Sks should be able to tank as an equal to each other but not as well as a warrior but significantly better than the 'none' tanking class's.  A form of defensive would provide this. Hell make it that while under 'defensive' the knight is unable to cast any spells or something but please get behind the knight community on this just as we got behind the warrior community for giving you something for snap aggro</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what would you suggest?  The difference in mitigation between Warriors and SKs is so small that it's almost hard to detect with parsing.  And you certainly aren't getting defensive or evasive, during the big defensive debate, prior to GoD content being fixed Warriors were probably something like 95% against the idea of defensive being shared in any form with the Knights.  Why do you think that's liable to have changed now after SoE has gone to a great deal of trouble to properly tune GoD and even modifed a couple of trials so defensive won't work?  Why exactly do you think SKs need defensive or some version there of rather than improvements to their spells?  And please explain to me why Knights, SKs and Paladins both, constantly use the arguement &quot;our spells suck, so we need defensive&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Until I got decent weapons I was gimped in the tank role unlike all the knights I knew.Warriors have thier own investments to worry about and can't solo farm worth a damn.Luckily, I'm married to a shammy.<br />
<br />
When we raid I usually try to get knights to tank for clearing and I'm ma.Distance aggro comes in handy especially in places like pow.Our knights always have something to do, a significant cotribution to make.What do warriors in the 3rd+ slot in tank order do?They back up the knights on clearing and well erm dps... and we have a great warrior cadre.They don't mind ,however, because they made a choice when they chose to play a warrior.They opted to specialize in one thing only;being able to stand up significantly better to damage when tanking.The lighter wars in my guild probably don't stand up as well as the heaviest knights without defensive.The gap has finally been modified to show some appreciable differance without defensive.Now you want to close the gap again by having a defensive disc...<br />

I don't know why i'm replying here.The knights in my guild are happy with the balance between knights and warriors.They crack jokes all the time about how gimp we are.No fd,heals,snares etc etc.We can only do one thing well.The mitigation gap should not be narrowed at all in any way imo.Personally, I think some other classes beneath knights mitigate too well and SK's could use some improvements to better balance with  pallies.<br />
<br />
This stuff was just fixed.I never wanted any improvements save in mitigation/hp.That is a warriors defining ability and should be obvious in contrast to other classes.I can't speak for the time+ people cuz I haven't been there.Our Knights tank fine in tipt and the god stuff we've seen.If the balance problem exists only in god;then theirs a problem in content design.Any fixes shouldn't narrow the mitigation gap in lower content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My son quit playing an SK quite some time ago but I asked what his main gripes were:<br />
<br />
Lifetaps - for some reason Verant and SoE have pretended that a Lifetap that does 500DD to the mob and heals the caster 500HP's is equivilant to a Paladin heal anybody 1000HP's spell. Doing 500 damage to a mob with 40k HP's is not equivant to healing a player for 500HP's. Paladin's come out so far ahead in this area it's not even funny and it affects every environment.<br />
<br />
Fear/Stuns - unlike stuns which SoE keeps making effective every single expansion, Fear is a soloing tool for trivial mobs only. He dearly wanted a Fear that simply stunned the mob and worked at as high a level as any Paladin stun.<br />
<br />
HT - the best offensive ability in the SK arsenal. Compare it to the impact of LoH and a Soulfire with 5 charges though and it doesn't seem all that shinny anymore. Where's the SK 5 charge HT right click item? Again, 8k damage to a mob does not equal 8K of healing on a player.<br />
<br />
Melee - Knight melee is about equal except when doing a significant portion of places like PoTime. Paladins do a completely amazing amount of melee DPS against things like Saryn's adds. The Offensive Knight is a paper tank compared to even the Defensive Knight much less any truly offensive melee class.<br />
<br />
DD - while spears and such are nice, he assured me a level 60 Druid foucusing on DD output puts him to shame.<br />
<br />
Parent Class Abilities - he cites a pet that can't be used and debuffs that aren't worth a lick on raids or even in groups.<br />
<br />
He quit because to his mind given a choice of playing a Warrior - a class that sacrifices everything to be the best tank vs. hard mobs, a Paladin - a level 64.975 Warrior without Defensive but with an invisable level 60 Cleric in their back pocket, and a Nerco/War he ended up with neither the focused ability of a pure class nor the leveraged capability of a generic warrior coupled with a meaningful set of abilites from one of the most powerful casters in the game.<br />
<br />
He wanted normal mobs to gibber in fear when an SK stood in front of them. This is not at all what he got. Shortchanged, dirty end of the stick, Red-headed step child were phrases he used. I've never known him to exagerate.<br />
<br />
Oh he suggests 50/75 Lifetaps instead of 50/50 to at least let SK's meaningfully heal themselves. This pales compared to Paladin heal anyone healing.  He suggested an upgrade to the next Necro pet and unique debuffs that are nearly as good as Cripple. And a Fear that stuns as good as the best Paladin fear. As things were, the casting side of SK's did not reinforce their tanking anywhere near as well as they do on Paladins. This is what he felt needed to be changed.<br />
<br />
To my mind what he wanted might have made SK's a bit too powerful in normal experiance groups (approaching the godlike capabilities of Paladins) and effective add tanks but would not have threatened the Warrior raid role at all.<br />

<br />
If SKs and Paladins see their spell line ups as inadequate, I see no reason why they shouldn't be communicating that to SoE and trying to get changes.  Perhaps even changes up and down the levels.  Or at least things that work better at level 60+.  I'd even go so far as to accept that something like a &quot;stonestance&quot; discipline might be okay for SKs and Paladins, depending on duration and what exactly it did.  But seriously, if Knights think their fix against the environment is to bemoan the inadequacy of their spellbooks in order to justify obtaining the one real unique Warrior only discipline, well I just don't see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think giving SK's a whole line of fears that act as stuns would be a great addition to them...i hadn't ever thought about it, but i think it could really work in thier favor. and works from a storyline perspective....mob is so scared it can't move etc..<br />
<br />
and on thier lifetaps, i dunno what the limiting factor is really in terms of why they are balanced the way they are, wether it be to stop them from soloing, or to stop them from tanking better..i dunno...but i don't see why their lifetaps shouldn't be upped by a significant margin, altho definatley not as large as ours, because our heals don't do dmg, and we have to target ourselfs to heal...i think it's a fair trade-off..others may not.<br />
<br />
i don't see why thier group spells shouldn't be upped as well<br />
<br />
i personally, and i'm sure most paladins would agree, that HT is oodles more powerful and useful that LoH is...and this is obvious by how often each skill is used. i would LOVE to have a pre-nerf manaburn like SK's have, don't downplay an instant 8k+ hit....not to mention it's nice to have something to do when a raid leader yells for everyone to go all out.<br />
<br />
as for our spells being upgraded and talking to sony....theres a board over on the druids grove set up for all the healing classes to talk about healing, upgrades needed etc....the paladins got an invite, but we're treated like little kids, and anytime someone pipes up, we get told to go sit back at the kiddie table...and how dare we ask for upgrades in the face of real healing classes...they are interested in balance about as much as you guys are...tho one thing i respect about warriors is, they certainly aren't asking for more...while clerics want everything under the sun...<br />
<br />
so you see, simply asking SOE for upgrades isn't going to work....we even have warriors here telling us what it's like to be a paladin and condeming all of our spells, let alone any useful upgrades we might see. let alone the fight we get from casters...there's simply no place in todays EQ for a hybrid tank class.<br />
<br />
we have to fight 5 fronts just to get any sort of upgrade, and we have to be balanced vs so many classes, upgrading any aspect of a tank hybrid steps on the toes of another class and they get pissed off etc etc etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think many Warriors are interested in balance, they just don't agree with what Knights think balance is.  Many see defensive as this great overwhelming advantage.  Most Warriors see it as the only real reason for anyone to play a Warrior or to want a Warrior on a raid.  Just as Paladins and Shadow Knights are always claiming that even though they can do various things, some other class can do any one of them better, Warriors are in much the same boat.  If you look at Warrior DPS, most of the classes in EQ do it better.  If you look at Warrior &quot;utility&quot; it is nearly non-existant.  And while you can claim that we do tank slightly better (somewhere around or less than 12%) than the Knights even without defensive, that alone isn't enough to keep the class viable.<br />
<br />
Making Knights more Warrior like is not the answer.  There isn't much room left between the Knights and Warriors as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I keep reading your replies and it's very clear to me that you have no interest in class balance.<br />
<br />
Your sole goal is to maintain the WAR stranglehold on the tank dominance.  What a total joke.  You need to sit down and look at it from a neutral perspective, as your comments are so biased, no reasonable person could even put any weight into them.<br />
<br />
The *base* of the WAR class should be the class that can absorb the most damage and receive the least melee damage.  That's all--nothing more.  They should also do the least DPS of all melee classes as well, but that is another story.  In any case, the attributes shown above will generally make them the tank of choice on boss mobs and such, but they should not be the best *tank* class per se, as all 3 tank classes should be as balanced as possible.  Sadly, this is far from reality.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely, positively nothing wrong with giving knights an *appropriately scaled* form of /defensive.  Nothing.  Those arguing otherwise have extremely dubious arguments at best, making highly ludicrous claims such as, &quot;This is a WAR only ability&quot; and the like.  It's laughable.  Why on earth should that be a WAR only ability anyways??  It sure makes sense in my mind that any class can take a &quot;defensive&quot; position (or something similar) and focus on avoiding damage then dealing damage.<br />
<br />
Why do --what was it--95% of the WAR not want /defensive shared with the knight classes?<br />
<br />
I'll tell ya--fear of losing a *role.*  <br />
<br />
What's so humorous about this, however, is that many suggestions shown even in this thread would *STILL* leave WAR as the tank of choice on boss-mobs and wouldn't diminish their role at all.  So, what the hell is the problem?<br />
<br />
There is only one possible answer.  Yes, people like you Glatius, who are interested in class dominance, not class balance.  Shame be on you sir.<br />
<br />
SHD have NO role at the moment.  SHD bring piss-poor DPS to a raid, can't tank even remotely close to WAR (hell, on stunnanble mobs, add PAL as well), and have, basicallly, no useful role.  NADA.  Please explain to me how much fun that is.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and there is NO POSSIBLE chance that ANYONE could have predicted even a year ago how class balance would be played out, so don't answer, &quot;Well, duh, re-roll as a WAR if you like them so much.&quot;  I'm not giving up 500+AA and all the other BS I have into my current character solely due to SoE's stupidity.  Rest assured, however, I'd trade my SHD for a WAR, all things equal, in a SECOND if I could at the moment...<br />
<br />
PAL stuns are woefully broken.  I'm not sure what the answer is at the moment, but that ability borders on annoying.  Personally, it doesn't bother me that a PAL can get agro with that spell (hell, agro from spells is broken as hell anyways, so...) but the fact that PAL can mitigate significant amounts of damage received is terribly out of balance with SHD.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, and, in my mind, the point of this entire thread, is that SHD are, by a large margin, the most worthless class in all of EQ at the moment &amp; something needs to be done.  <br />
<br />
Oh--for the record--ADJUSTING OUR SPELLBOOKS IS NOT A ViABLE ANSWER.  <br />

Well, it's unfortunate that you've arrived at that conclusion, because you're wrong.  But luckily for me, I give your poor opinion of me no value.

I agree with them then.<br />
<br />
Now that we are higher on the hog, it seems that a lot of warriors have changed their minds about our dear little albatros.<br />
<br />
Well I for on do see defensive as one of the game breaking abilities (amoung many) that EQ lives with. I am still for sharing /defensive with our heavy tank brothers and sisters. Should it be as powerful as ours? Of course not. Should SKs (in particular) be better named (not raid) tanks than rangers? Most definatly. <br />
<br />
EQ has somewhat solved the problems of slow (another of the huge game breaking abilites) by spreading it out more. But with it spread out between 3 different classes its less of a problem than it was. <br />
<br />
I see no reason that the same solution would not work with defensive. Sure it might require some tweeks-but EQ is an evolving game. Yes the differances between paladins, SKs and warriors is far smaller than that between chanters, shammy and bst. But a balance point can be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes,warriors want and should be the dominant tank by a clear margin.That is the focus of the class after all.Just like clerics are obviously the strongest healers,wizards obviously produce the strongest burst dps,warriors were meant to be obviously the strongest at taking damage.<br />
<br />
Hybrids chose to do many things instead of compete with their parent classes in their area of expertise.I agree that SK's need to be brought in line with paladins.However, from what i've seen of the game paladins are a very strong class already.To be honest I would have re rolled a paladin a long time ago except for one thing.I liked the Ideal of the warrior class.The differance in mitigation used to be so insignificant  without disc warriors had nothing to offer next to a knight with his superior aggro and utility.However, the ideal of being THE damage absorbing class above others kept me playing a warrior because I liked the warriors ideal role even though it very seldom showed much evidence in game.Now their is a very small ,but, noticable differance undisc'd with of course a wider gap under disc that can be brought into play when needed.Finally the differance in mitigation is in a small way significant to game play and we still have our 3minute bonus to whip out when we need it.<br />
<br />
I play with a lot of knights who at my level can tank almost everything I have and exert stonger control more quickly on loose mobs.They are very close to my overall tanking ability.Narrowing the mitigation gap(in an overall sense) would defeat the recent changes that give the warrior class it's identity back.A hybrid is not a pure tank like a warrior and the differance should be noticable to the eye in gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I find interesting, if you go back to dig up the warrior protest thread and the other dozen or so threads discussing Wariror issues, is how large a part of the community was outraged that the difference between Warriors and Knights was only a miniscule innate ~386HP advantage after AoTC and Arch Overseers proving that a Defensive Warrior isn't an absolute requirement for taking on PoP end expansion boss mobs.<br />
<br />
I think a review of what has been posted including the show of hands thread on Knight Defensive might make you conclude the opposite of your contention.<br />
<br />
Share enough class defining abilities and we all end up as WarShadowPallies. Worse, remove enough and we all become ordinary fighters wondering why groups are using pets to MT.<br />
<br />
EDIT: wanted to add, I'm not flaming you at all. I am pointing out that you are wistfully hoping for WarShadowPallies. I can't chastize you for wanting three &quot;equal&quot; tanks - its would make soooo many Knights happy :D. But, given that Warriors are very unlikely to get 2k 1 second heals and cleric buffing or HT, it's pretty predictable who ends up on the short end of the stick should &quot;class blurirng&quot; occur.<br />
<br />
A wild guess - I think most Warriors wouldn't be opposed to a 10-15 second auto-parry ability. This would help Knights enomously when tanking an add that threatened to get the upperhand. It would do the job for many one-groupable named mobs. It would even give Knights that are geared up to take on raid boss mobs a chance to get in position and have the CH rotation get in synch. But I'm pretty darned certain the vast majority of Warriors would not want to go beyond that.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that a 10-15 second auto-parry wouldn't do the job, it's that some knights want more - or more precisely for Warriors to have much less of a tanking advantage. For them it's not PvE (player vs. environment), it's KvW (Warriors get to MT too much).<br />

Lets face it Vabtoo tanked Fenin Ro with 15+ ? <br />
Time loots and Every Monk usable Quarm item.<br />
<br />
Lets face it Nomilus tanked All time with 15+ ?<br />
Time loots and Every best Paladin usable Time Item.<br />
<br />
I'm really curious how &quot;cocky&quot;  Nomilous &amp; Vabtoo were be the day they entered EP/Time.<br />
<br />
Your basic argument is not only flawed but also ridiculous.<br />
After 25 30 40 50 Time Clearings, everyone will be able to tank anything.<br />
<br />
You killed Barxt, you've seen his obsene DPS.<br />
Now tell me, how will a Pal/SK that hasnt farmed the SHIT out of Time/Qvic+ will tank him ?<br />
<br />
At 2300/10000 23% Shielding he's giving me trouble under defensive...<br />
And no my healers dont suck, Its Barxt that can be Spiky.<br />
I wonder how Nomilous/Handymak would do vs Barxt.<br />
<br />
I dont care if after 20 RZ kills, a Paladin can come and get the job done.<br />
I dont care if after 60 RZ kills, a Monk can come and get the job done.<br />
I dont care if after 180 RZ kills, a Chanter can come get the job done. <br />
<br />
I want that from Kills 1 to 20, RZ is &quot;Warrior Only Territory&quot;.<br />
<br />
After Kill 21° who the fuck cares, its Farmed Trivialised Content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now please, get away from the &quot;Paladins stole my Mojo&quot; attitude.<br />
We always tanked better, we will always tank better.<br />
EQ in raids should be :<br />
<br />
Hard for Warriors = Impossible for Hybrids<br />
Tought for Warriors = Need a Miracle for Hybrids<br />
Challenging for Warriors = Hard for Hybrids<br />
Normal for Warriors = Challenging for Hybrids<br />
Trivial for Warriors = Normal for Hybrids<br />
<br />
Any lucky or overhealed paladin could live VS Barxt.<br />
On our First Xegony kill i used 13 DI, On our First Innoruk Kill 14 DI. <br />
On our First TZ kill another warrior used 8 DI. Wanna talk about luck ?<br />
<br />
<br />
On a &quot;Normal Barxt Run&quot; i usually use 1 , maybe 2 DI. Of course when defensive drops i'm as good as dead.<br />
I find him &quot;Tought&quot;  but with our usual healing crew, i dont expect to die with DISC up.<br />
<br />
He hits for like 1000-3000. And will one round (DI check) any paladin easily.<br />
Now if that paladin uses 20 DI and lives, well nice luck.<br />
<br />
If tomorrow we see a 2800/11000 paladin tanking Barxt and not dying.<br />
Why fucking care ? I mean if the guy is at 2k8/11K its he's farmed the hell out of Qvic+.<br />
And that point Barxt is at best &quot;farmed trivialised content&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if it is a favorable option, but it is still an option, to do this.<br />
<br />
Give SKs a Reverse defense discipline.  Instead of making the mob do 25% damage less to YOU.  Why not have that 25% damage be done to the MOB as well as you.<br />
<br />
So, like a damage shield, but with scalability based on the enemy you are fighting.<br />
<br />
So, say, not necessarily 25%, that is too much, but a reasonable amount(10%?  15%?).<br />
<br />
So, let's say a mob does 330 dps, as was listed above.  By using this, the mob would take, say, in the case it was a 10% disc, an extra 33 DPS for attacking the SK.<br />
<br />
You see, this would make SKs have an advantage for tanking the GoD trials encounters, and similar enemies(as in, high DPS mob with low HP) as it would accellerate the mob's death speed incredibly, at the cost of putting the SK in danger.<br />
<br />
If SKs are the &quot;Offensive light tank&quot;, why not make em more offensive, when tanking?</div></div><hr />

A group with a dead tank cant kill stuff.<br />
You could push SK DPS to 1000 wont change anything VS Barxt in Uqua.<br />
A dead 1000DPS tank, is a dead tank.<br />
<br />
When you enter a &quot;Tanking Mode&quot; the only thing that matters is staying alive.<br />
Every other thing (like DPS) is at best a non factor.<br />
<br />
I sit have ATM +170 ATK , i could get it to 250 but it would decrease my tanking capacity.<br />
I could get Avatar / Fero / ATK Buffs on raids to do some decent DPS.<br />
<br />
But the 6 rogues &amp; 6 wizard will make my DPS look pathetic any day of the week.<br />
Worse,  if die , so does the 12 man DPS team.<br />
<br />
The same thing goes in XP groups.<br />
When you /disc on a named, you do it because you want to stay alive.<br />
Hence, the most important thing is you not dying. Because if you die , game over.<br />
<br />
Of course you not dying &amp; doing sick DPS is a double bonus.<br />
But &quot;sick DPS&quot; isnt want you were born for , or what got you in the group.<br />
<br />
So increasing DPS, will never balance decreased tanking capacity.<br />
Because a dead tank, is zero dps (actually a dead tank is a dead group)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes I do agree, the all plate or all/all gear would by and large have to go if pallies and/or SKs got mini-defensive.  But as a normal LDoN/non-elemental/0 flag GOD kind of warrior (who is trying to fix all that) I think I am the one far more likely to be hurt by the changes than you, because I as I understand your best loot is indeed class differentiated where as mine is class blind (I am saving up of the Sands BP (69 AC) that any plate wearer can get)).<br />
<br />
Is mini-defensive the only step in the process? No. But its the biggest and easiest. And would require that SOE stop its all/all or all plate uber armors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All mini-defensive does is allow Knights more opportunities to tank raid calibre mobs in place of Warriors.  It isn't something they'll need that much in a group, because the mobs are designed that they don't.  So if you give them mini-defensive you set the stage for Knights at some point potentially replacing Warriors as raid MT of choice.  And why exactly should that be done?  Because Knights want to tank raid calibre mobs?  Well if they want to do that they could play a Warrior.  There are lots of things a Warrior never gets to do that Knights do.  That's part of the balance right, each class gets unique and useful things that the other two classes don't?  Yet it seems that neither Knight class is going to be satisfied until they can do everything a Warrior can do, but just a tiny bit worse, not enough to really matter mind you, just enough to say it's there, while still hanging on to all their class uniqueness, which they claim is all worthless anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not ? We'd still do it better anyway. And thats all what its about. Doing it better.<br />
<br />
BST getting slow didnt &quot;DESTROY&quot; the shaman class as many whined.<br />
Druid getting CH didnt &quot;DESTROY&quot; the cleric.<br />
Clerics getting ProcHammer didnt &quot;DESTROY&quot; the paladin.<br />
Mages getting Firebolt of Talon (on vendor) didnt &quot;DESTROY&quot; the wizards.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you could find more examples of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages &amp; Necro have great caster DPS.<br />
Then why is it that we often see &quot;looking for wizards&quot; and not &quot;looking for mage/necro/wiz&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Because wizards to it better. <br />
Thus they are the prefered solution for the Caster DPS problem.<br />
<br />
Warriors could tank CT in time. But its often Paladin/SK ...<br />
Why ? Because they do it better<br />
<br />
Paladins could tank Barxt in Uqua and maybe with a miracle live.<br />
Even if they had MiniDisc you would choose a Warrior.<br />
Why ? Because he does it better.<br />
<br />
Its all about using classes to the best of their potential.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could you use a Knight with MiniDisc to tank Named01 ? Sure<br />
But he has a 50% chance of using a DI every 30 Seconds.<br />
Why bother with a Knight , when a Warrior will almost never use DI ?<br />
<br />
Quarm is the best (and worse) illustration....<br />
A knight can tank him (gimpastic DPS) but a knight will get one rounded.<br />
A Warrior can tank him , and you know its IMPOSSIBLE to one round with disc.<br />
<br />
Sure a Pal/SK can get the job done, but we do it better.<br />
And for &quot;Delicate Fight&quot; Doing it better is more important than everyone thinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And considering what I have heard about the 1 group encounters in GoD--they need it (or did need it) there.

<br />
If you are talking about surviving more than one DI, I OBVIOUSLY need way more chr!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not?  Simple.  Because a Warrior will never save a raid or a group by LoHing a healer.  Because a Warrior will never save a raid or a group by using a properly timed HT.  Because a Warrior will never save a raid or a group by a well timed group heal.  Because a Warrior will never save a raid or a group by using FD to split mobs.  Because a Warrior will never save a raid or a group by buffing their HPs higher.  Because a Warrior will never save a raid or a group by increasing their mana supply.  And so on and so on.  There is so much the Warrior class can't do at all that the Knight classes can do.  So why should we only be allowed to do a very few things &quot;slightly&quot; better than Knights rather than having a few things they can't do at all?  Why should Knights be Warriors in all but name with lots of added features while Warriors are just Knights with a small + and none of the extras?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariakkas</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hate to break it to you glatius, but we don't save raids with those abilities either.<br />
<br />
if you argued that you can't do those things, you might have a leg to stand on...but saying that we shouldn't be able to tank anything because we save raids with trivial abilities is laughable.<br />
<br />
on a different note, i believe it was you glatius, that said that if paladins are so unhappy with our spells, we should try for upgrades there, and not in the tanking department...i mentioned the board for discussing healing, and this was from the paladin thread, i think you'll find it hits close to home...<br />
<br />
Correct me if I am wrong, but this is the &quot;priest's covenant&quot; meant to discuss &quot;priest balancing&quot;, not &quot;healer's covenant&quot; meant to discuss &quot;healer balancing.&quot; I recognize paladins were invited, I just do not believe they belong since they are defined by EQ as tanks, not priests, 3 tanks, 3 priests, 3 mana-based DPS, then a bunch of melee DPS and mix of utility in a couple. Paladin healing spells are a means of adding dimension, improving their situational usefulness, and their other spells directly or indirectly work towards making them better tanks. Them participating in &quot;priest balancing&quot; makes as much sense as shadow knights participating in &quot;arcane/intelligence caster balancing&quot;, and if we are talking about improving shaman/druid heals, then the same logic that has paladins here (cleric hybrid) is precisely why we should have rangers and beastlords as well. After all, if shaman healing is upgraded, wouldn't or shouldn't that affect beastlords, their hybrid? Likewise for druids and rangers.<br />
<br />
Paladins are not priests, they are tanks. Just like people here who claim clerics should be the best healers are proposing modifying the situation that produced the mess we're in rather than actually changing/fixing it, I believe warriors who claim that wariors should be the best tanks are likewise wrong. You cannot have a &quot;best&quot; without making the toughest content dependant on them in order to provide &quot;challenge&quot; which in turn makes group-building a progressively more difficult nightmare as one levels. Differant? Heck yes. Better? No.<br />
<br />
Better or best means the top end groups are dependant on one class. We're here discussing how to end that among the priests in terms of the core/central role of priests: healing and specifically being the main healer. Since we all agree paladins are not now, nor will they ever be, main healers, and certainly aren't priests in the game mechanic/role sense (except loosely in the RP sense, by which standards necromancers are sometimes also called &quot;dark priests of the dead&quot;) their participation in these discussions any more than beastlords belong in a discussion of tank balancing (since they can sometimes offtank and that can be helpful).<br />
<br />
IMHO paladins and shadow knights should be viewed as tanks, and balanced against warriors in terms of overall power in all stages of the game and in terms of grouping and raid roles. The differance would be a warrior would have more &quot;free&quot; or &quot;innate&quot; abilities (or conversely much more effective endurance based ones) and better innate tanking capability and better base melee DPS. Paladins and shadow knights close those gaps with spells, for as long as the mana lasts. Paladin spells focused defensively, shadow knight spells focused offensively. Equal in capability, equal in power, equal in effectiveness, differant in means and flavor.<br />
<br />
In other words, for tanks the same darned thing I am advocating for priests. Equal in capability, power, and effectiveness healing, differant in means in flavor. Warriors not being able to stack well in groups, or paladins, or any other class, indicates in each case they need to have their secondary/tertiary roles looked at to provide better stackability. The ultimate goal here is to make it possible at all levels (not just versus trivial content) to get away with something other than &quot;the holy trinity + 3 DPS.&quot; At least that's how I see overall class balance being best approached, but I also am looking at this from the perspective of someone who knows the game and is looking from the outside in now, who doesn't have a vested interest in keeping my class &quot;the best&quot; or any class &quot;the best&quot; but rather from a design standpoint and being fully aware of how some of the various &quot;being the best&quot; assertions led to problems and a lack of fun for me as a non-raiding player in the high end.<br />

And how would the proposed knight defensive of 1.0-1.5min duration, 4.5-5.0min recast and DI 30% mitigation designed specifically to assist our short duration single group encounters and raid add-tanking replace the warriors as main tanks with their 3min DI 50% mitigation defensve, AE taunt, and furious?<br />
<br />
The only situation were a knight would be used on a main raid level mob under these situations would be if all the other warriors have gone down.  In such situations, rangers, beastlords, monk and rogues are curently the ones stepping into this position using their avoidance disiplines.  None of which are tanks in the first place. Would it not make more sence to have a knight be the one to jump in when the warriors go down than the raids DPS classes?<br />
<br />
As you have somehow managed to miss it in every other discussion on this topic, let me repeat just for you:<br />
Knights DO NOT want to replace or even share MT responsabilities with warriors.<br />
Knights DO want a disipline that will allow them to accel in the position of add-tank.<br />
If the situation justifies (see: all warriors dead) that someone else steps up to tank the main target, knights want to be considered befor the chain and leather DPS classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what?  I'm getting pretty fucking sick of pussy ass knights who are afraid to get hit because of rumors and nonsense and not based on actual experience or facts pushing further and further to marginalize warriors.   There are NO offtank jobs that knights cannot do that are designed to be tanked with perhaps one exception, and guess what... as long as there exists a single boss that is designed for knights to tank, then there is nothing wrong with a raid where the adds are designed for warriors.<br />
<br />
Mini defensive is bullshit nowdays, since the content has been changed.   It's over, GoD tanking is JUST RIGHT.   <br />
<br />
It's a pile of fuckin rubbish to claim that there's not a big enough gap between knights and non-knights.    Show me some numbers.  Show me the 2500AC+ god damned rangers/beastlords.   Post time, the gap has grown betwen knight and non-knight *faster and more exponentially* that the gap between warrior and knight.<br />
<br />
Not bullshit numbers that are howled about like the &quot;This is how broken we are&quot; thread where the Paladin in question is a BETTER TANK than the warrior WHILE DEFENSIVE yet howling in protest that the warrior is taking less DPS than the *omfg time geared Paladin* when the warrior is taking... less damage ALSO than the &quot;Time geared warrior&quot; yet no protest exists, and EVEN THOUGH the Paladin is taking more DPS, the're STILL a better tank because the healing interval is STILL shorter for the warrior than the Paladin.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Beastlords are tanking what we can&quot; argument is a load of crap when you have to whip out trivial content that you exceed warriors on because you can stun them anyhow.<br />
<br />
I content that the gap between knight and non knight in GoD is not only acceptable, it's unsurpassable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 And, of course, the whole idea of 'step in if the Warriors are dead' reeks as well. Any top end raiding guild I've seen runs at least 2:1 Warriors to Knights - If all the Warriors are dead, you're camping clerics, not changing the heal rot to Knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you don't save raids with those abilities, but I've seen raids saved using them.  So if you have the same tools as the people I've seen doing it, then it stands to reason that the class isn't the problem.<br />
<br />
if you argued that you can't do those things, you might have a leg to stand on...but saying that we shouldn't be able to tank anything because we save raids with trivial abilities is laughable.<br />
<br />
Exactly what Knights are always attempting to claim.  Their spellbooks are trivial.  Mere roleplaying fluff that serves no purpose.  Which is bullshit, plain and simple.  Any good player can take the Knight spellbook and do things impossible for a good Warrior player to even attempt.  But those things are trivial, right?  Wrong.  They're only made even close to trivial when going up against the very hardest cutting edge content.  Otherwise there is a ton of usefulness in them.  While many will claim that's only against &quot;trivial&quot; content, it's still usefullness Warriors don't receive against the same &quot;trivial&quot; content.   Knights have lots of things they can do and continuely insist on comparing them on a one for one basis against defensive.  Stuns aren't as powerful as defensive, roots aren't as powerful as defensive, heals aren't as powerful as defensive, snare isn't as poweful as defensive.  But the point isn't that any single ability isn't as powerful as defensive, but the combination of abilities can be.   Warriors don't get a whole lot more in the way of real usefulness.<br />
<br />

<br />
If Knights require a mini-defensive for single group encounters and raid add-tanking, not just want but require it to be reasonably successful, then one of a number of possibilities have occured.  The content is mis-tuned, still.  The Knight isn't properly geared for the content.  Or the Knight is really taking on something that was intended to be a Warrior tanked mob.<br />
<br />
Knights DO NOT want to replace or even share MT responsabilities with warriors.<br />
<br />
There you are absolutely wrong.  If what you mean to say is some Knights do not want to replace or even share MT responsibilities with Warriors, I would agree.  But by the same token some Knights DO want to replace and share MT responsibilites with Warriors.<br />
<br />
Knights DO want a disipline that will allow them to accel in the position of add-tank.<br />
<br />
A stonestance or furious like discipline would go a long ways toward doing this for Knights.  The advantage to this approach is, 1) numerous classes already have one so it's not something particularly unique, and 2) it would ensure that defensive, one of the only unique Warrior class abilities, isn't given away and doesn't damage the Warrior class functionality.  And understand, anything that allows Knights to &quot;excel&quot; in the position of add-tank as you describe it is by its very nature going to have to make them very close to as capable against raid calibre mobs as a Warrior, because there is less and less of a difference between &quot;trash&quot; mobs and boss mobs these days, or so it appears.</div></div><hr />

this argument is pure gold...warriors want to be able to use thier abilites to do stuff beyond thier level of play, but they want paladins to use thier abilities on trivial content that is of no worth to them. how can you not see this horrible double-standard?<br />

the problem lies in the fact that all of those things together, doesn't add up to us being able to tank...and that is a base level..square one..numbero uno...only goddamn reason we exist...is to tank...<br />
<br />
we offered you guys all the usefulness in the world, and you guys rejected it...so you can piss off with that comment, you guys don't want usefulness anymore than you want knights to tank anything outside of crushbone.<br />

<br />
the problem lies in that you in essence, get the exact same problem in a raid environment, that you have in these single group trials....if they tune the off-tank mob to be knight tankable, it makes it stupidly easy for a warrior to offtank, and people are always going to go with what is easiest.<br />
<br />
if you make the mob a challenge to warriors, it's impossible for a knight, and is clearly your definition of a &quot;warrior tanked mob&quot;, which as was shown in the trials, leaves us up shit creek.<br />
<br />
if you guys insist on your stranglehold on tanking, then i have a feeling that you'll be seeing raid OT mobs that ignore defensive just like in these trials...the presedence has been set, its only a matter of time.<br />

And understand, anything that allows Knights to &quot;excel&quot; in the position of add-tank as you describe it is by its very nature going to have to make them very close to as capable against raid calibre mobs as a Warrior, because there is less and less of a difference between &quot;trash&quot; mobs and boss mobs these days, or so it appears.<br />
<br />
pardon my ignorance, but i've never played a class on a discipline level that has had either furious, or stonestance, so i dunno really what they are...furious is auto riposte correct? and stonestance is the monk eqivilant of defensive? a dmg reduction disc, not an avoidance disc?<br />
<br />
if so, i agree totally, too many warriors think that when we say we need a defensive disc, we mean...THE defensive disc...when all we need is A defensive disc. the duration, reuse and limitations are open to debate amongst people smarter than me in those areas.<br />
<br />
and i think emilia makes very strong arguments as to why knights could perform an add-tank role fairly well, without infringing on a warriors boss mob job.<br />
<br />
don't beastlords already get a mini-defensive also?</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you argued that you can't do those things, you might have a leg to stand on...but saying that we shouldn't be able to tank anything because we save raids with trivial abilities is laughable.<br />
<br />
on a different note, i believe it was you glatius, that said that if paladins are so unhappy with our spells, we should try for upgrades there, and not in the tanking department...i mentioned the board for discussing healing, and this was from the paladin thread, i think you'll find it hits close to home...<br />
<br />
<br />
in other words, go argue with the warriors if you want anything<br />
<br />
<br />
just one thing as I recall he said a SPELLBOOK upgrade not a healing upgrade.<br />
<br />
I agree that the Pallies and SKs should be able to tank ALL one group content assumeing they are geared by the content lower than that (I'm not saying you should farm all previous but  be equiped in all equipment available in the EXPANSION where the single group content that is present... <br />
<br />
now as I understand it this is not how it actually happens  ( I see that it should happen this way because there is no requirement as I recall other than the original game for all expansions so far (correct me if I'm wrong on that))  so there is where the problem lies I believe...  however I've been playing around with an idea in my head... I don't know if people would like it or not but here it is ( might of been proposed before I dunno) <br />
<br />
since the problem is that we as warriors do not want to share defensive (our class defineing ability, and the only one that I use regularly) and paladins and shadowknights both want to have the capability to tank ( note  I am assumeing your going to GoD high end content here) I'm not going to suggest a defensive disc I do not believe that the solution should come from .. however Say that you have a warrior tanking the content and you as a pally or SK are there as backup tank... now currently in these high end zones they pally and SK would get turned into a puddle on the floor... however here is my idea <br />
<br />
1) The Pallies/SKs should get a SPELL that stacks with other spells to help reduce teh amount of damage taken for 3 minutes however in that time it  drains their mana to such an extent that it is equivalent to a warrior using his defensive disc in terms of endurance use/mana use equivilency ( remember the mana pool will be larger and you have FT/KEI etc to get mana back warriors have nothing to help endurance regen) <br />
<br />
2) the Refresh of the spell should be similar in length to that of defensive <br />
<br />
3)  Damage mitigated should be less than defensive.<br />
<br />
4) this spell is castable on anyone single target only... short  cast time  ( no idea how short but short enough that you can get it in time to control that add)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
now before people start flameing me  here is the point ... say the % mitigated by this spell is 20 % then you have pallies and SKs  mitigateing 20% of the damage and warriors mitigated 50% of the DI + 20% of what is left ( this includes DB)<br />
<br />
now that said I expect someone to see something wrong with this idea somewhere... (as far as I can see it doesn't close the tanking gap but does give knights the possibility of being able to offtank some mobs in the harder zones. ) ofcourse if this was done I'd  want the mobs that ignore you with defensive to have the same effect on someone with this spell on as well ... or simply change those mobs back to how they were before that... yes the tanking will be hard but it adds some possibility of doing it...<br />
<br />
Warriors should be the &quot;better&quot; of the tanks available for hard hitting mobs  BUT they should not be the only ones who can do the job IF people are appropriately geared. (I'm not talking its farmed till its trivial I'm saying they have farmed MOST of the content before ... EG for rallos zek(tactics) you are equipped in PoP boss mob items and ornate where as a warrior may be able to do it with fewer of those items (so it can be done earlier and suchlike with a warrior but at the point it is still hit and miss with them) <br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: yes this is a tanking upgrade it is however an upgrade for warrior tanking as well and a reason to have people like SKs along (although they could still use some other spell book upgrades) <br />
<br />
Also I note that this would make pallies a better choise... I'm not sure how I'd fix that... maybe shorten stun times so that they take more damage enroute to the boss mob but still retain thier uesfullness as gate stoppers etc...<br />
<br />
oh and this isn't going to give tanking equality to all those people who scream for it.. it would however give the chance of being viable tanks instead of being a roadblock on the way to the clerics in the late raids<br />
<br />
ok I'll stop typeing now :) let teh flames of my idea commense .. I won't learn how this wouldn't work  unless you lot tell me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be the people still stuck going up against your trivial content because they've decided that raiding isn't their cup of tea and therefore aren't geared in the best stuff raid mobs can drop.  What you consider trivial content, many people consider quite the challenge.  For content you consider your spells worthless for, many people see your spells as making or breaking a situation.  Guess what, not everyone is trying to break into Uqua and battle their way to the end of the expansion.  Many people are still fighting content you consider &quot;trivial&quot; on a daily basis and certainly don't need to see uber Knights whipping out their &quot;mini-defensive&quot; in order to continue to tank even bigger and badder mobs than a non-raiding Warrior could even contemplate.  Non-raider Warriors aren't begging SoE for AOE heals or a lower duration FD, are they?  They're reasonably functional and those that haven't left the game altogether are continuing to plug along as best they can.  To listen to the raider Knights continuely bitching about wanting one of the only things that still sets the Warrior class apart from Knights, even if the Warrior isn't Joe Uber Warrior, is particularly galling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don't want a &quot;cookie cutter of the disc&quot; - we want a disc of our own to use for offtanking.  Just because it's DI-mitigation doesn't mean it's a carbon copy of defensive.  Have you even looked at the disc's I proposed (they're the most widely accepted among the SK community)?  <br />

<br />
Using a spell instead of a disc would work, sorta.  It would have definate unnecessary limitations though - unusable for the entire duration of the reuse after a death, take a buff slot, etc.  Those drawbacks aren't goign to &quot;balance&quot; it, they're just a nuisance.  Making it targetable would defeat the entire purpose - that'd just be religating knights to buff bitches.  Knights don't need something that's targetable, knights need something that will make knights tank better.</div></div><hr />

SoE has come right out and admitted to releasing GoD with mobs tuned for level 70 characters and not level 65 characters.  Obviously if they'd done the job right to begin with, Knights wouldn't have been having the trouble in GoD that they were.  Do you really think that the arguement that Knights need a mini-defensive because SoE is going to come along and release another expansion with mobs designed for a character level that hasn't yet been made available is really a viable arguement?</div></div><hr />

Calling sk's the DPS tank is false also warriors of time+gear can out dmg a sk easy unless the situation is perfect for a sk ( ala spears don't get resisted and its a really nice fight for our melee dps). <br />
<br />
If they fix our secondary skills(spells ect give spears a resist check that doesn't make the spells worthless 90% of the time) and give sk's lull a mitigation disc (weaponsheild/parry ect) the monk skill(stonewall) that keeps fd from being broken on resisted spells, up our dam weapon caps and maybe a little innate mitigation, with these fixes sk's will fill the role as good enough to tank BUT can do somthing else to get/help groups. <br />

When doing things in Qvic such as killing Mshas, Cynosure, etc... appropriatley geared offensive hybrids take the same amount of healing as us as well.  The lowering of the ATK on GoD mobs helped close some of the gap between Knights and chain DPS classes with their typically lower AC.  The reason for this is that mobs die at a speed which causes either class to take the same amount of heals during/after the fight even though the non Knight will take more DPS.<br />
<br />
You're incorrect about Knights still needing a discipline though, from my own expierences when playing a Cleric, Knights still need something to differentiate themselves from non tank classes, a short duration/fast recycle discipline is the best solution for that.  It allows us to jump on a mob fast and tank while the debuffs are being put on and heals are coming to us without having long term value on each mob.<br />
<br />
As far as the Warriors and add tanking goes I agree with you, if theres some boss fights that Knights can tank then there should be some for Warriors to tank adds.<br />
<br />
The discipline is actually the lesser of the two tanking balancing adjustments needed in my view, SK's getting something to bring us more in line with Paladins in grouping content (in raid situations it's pretty equal) is the more needed change, but then again I'm an SK so that could just be a bias.</div></div><hr />

<br />
basically it's a mod rod type spell, casting it summons up a rod/shield/sword/whatever and has 1 charge of whatever it is people consider to be a fair defensive type mitigation disc.<br />
<br />
it eliminats the problem of it not being ready after death, you can put whatever kind of timer you want, give it double mana cost, once for summoning, once for using, make it drain over time...or do whatever needs to be done to balance it.<br />
<br />
glatius, your looking at the god problem too narrow, the immediate problem is yes, content was designed for lvl 70 characters, if we were level 70 right now, these problems MAY not have happened, but we will honestly never know.<br />
<br />
looking at hte bigger picture, from a game mechanics sort of view, you can see the underlying problem, and why this will re-surface again. we've reached critical mass, where a knight and a warrior cannot tank the same mobs with any degree of equality. by equality meaning, if warriors can do it, we can't. and if we can't, it's stupidly easy for a warrior.<br />
<br />
and im speaking from the single group perspective, not raid mobs. without giving us something to pick up teh slack on our end, they will either HAVE to keep on nerfing defensive in single group encounters, or do away with knights as tanks altogether, which im sure would break your guy's hearts, i can see you weeping from here.<br />
<br />
i understand your point about lower tiered knights not having problems, and any &quot;fix&quot; to them would be overkill...i completely agree. however, that doesn't hide or diminish the fact that there is a real and serious problem on the top end. i wouldn't have a problem with the fix..whatever it may be, happening only to the top end...i honestly don't care if nothing changes, and they keep nerfing defensive in every single group encounter from here on out, i think it was a fair &quot;nerf&quot;. im a bit more bitter than some towards warriors, but as long as you guys have such a stranglehold on the top tank spot in raids, i see absolutly no reason why we shouldn't be viable in every single group encounter, as well as in the off tank positions on raids. however that comes about.<br />

im sorry if you think im wrong, but you can ask anyone with half a brain, and they will tell you that a paladin is a tank...a shadowknight is a tank. it doesn't get any broader than that. you can quote BB's class descriptions all you like...you can play dumb and act like there is no such thing as the word tank...you can hide behind any word play or spin doctoring you want...but it boils down to we're tanks, first and foremost. that doesn't mean we're warriors, that means...according to warriors own arguments during agro changes, we can get the attention of the mob, and tank it with a resonable degree of success. we're tanks...not warriors, but tanks.</div></div><hr />

That is pattenedly absurd.  What you are really saying is that if a Warrior can tank it only by using defensive then a Knight can't.  This has been true since Velious.  Nothing has dramatically changed except one mis-tuned expansion that Knights are trying to leverage into justification for an ability they don't need.

<br />
<br />
Nothing has dramatically changed except one mis-tuned expansion that Knights are trying to leverage into justification for an ability they don't need.<br />
Other things have dramatically changed.  One group progression trials have taken the place of some large scale raid encounters.  Warrior aggro has improved (which it needed) to the point where there is practically no aggro-versus-tanking tradeoff.  Discs are now unlinked allowing for 12 seconds of melee immunity (and HT-like riposte damage) for initial fight stabilization.<br />
<br />
<br />
If a Warrior can tank a mob without using defensive a Knight can also tank it.<br />
<br />
This is true, but that same mob is then utterly gimp for a defensive warrior, and doable, albeit extremely challenging for select chain and leather classes.  A knight defensive ability would allow encounters to be tuned to be challenging for one of the three plate tank classes when under their respective defensive disc, and practically impossible for anyone else.  By nature of a warrior's innate defensive advantages, plus Defensive would be superior to whatever knights would get, would ensure that warriors do tank these mobs better.  They just wouldn't be the only choice (perhaps &quot;strongly prefered choice&quot; is better wording) for one group trial content.  Hell, traditional large scale raid mobs could even be immune to knight defensive like the recent changes either by aggro silliness or flat out ignoring the effects.  From a content design and balancing standpoint, expecially with the push to small scale/one group encounters, I'm suprised the devs haven't already given knights some form of a defensive ability.<br />

<br />
No one said knights weren't tanks. It is the kights primary role, that much is not disputed. The part I have a problem with is the fact that knights have a significant secondary role, unlike warriors. The knight's secondary role is the reason that knights will never and should never tank as good as a warrior. Going back to my druid vs cleric healing example, healing is both classes primary role also, but druids only heal around 55-60% as good as a cleric, which is offset butthe druid's other abilites. Palladins tank a hell of a lot better than 55% of a warrior, even if we said that they tank a low 90% as good as a warrior, there is still the fact that palladins heal a lot closer to a cleric than 10%, I'd put it atleast around 35-40% and those abilites aren't mutually exclusive. It's already been said that hybrids would not be more powerful than they class(es) they were derived from as early as beta, given this example, I think that I would disagree and say it's already happened.<br />
<br />
If knights were given any more tanking ability there would be no point to the warrior class. Hell, you'd have a 65 palladin walking around with a pocket 50 cleric.<br />
<br />
On another note, I do think that SKs need to have their spellbooks looked at and adjusted, they are nowhere near as effective as a palladin. Most of the classes abilites are outdated and their roles are mutually exclusive. Maybe some spear adjustments, and some more offensive abilites are in order to flesh out the class where it is lacking. However, I do not think that thier pure tanking side is the one that needs adjustment. You want to play a class where you can effeciently tank, roll a warrior.<br />
<br />
Edit: Don't even think about wasting breath analyzing my numbers, they are there only as a rough illustration. And no, those numbers weren't considering defensive any more than LoH or HT was considered into my examples.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When reading various proposals for a Knight mitigation discipline there is a very confusing range of reasons it's needed and arbitrary amounts and durations.<br />
<br />
Can we agree SoE has adjusted the trials and it's no longer needed there? Can we agree that it's not needed for normal add tanking (I don't use Defensive for this purpose)? If two named mobs end up in camp, can we agree raiding guilds have more than one Warrior?<br />
<br />
If we can, then to my mind there are 3 reasons it might be semi-legitimately wanted:<br />
<br />
1. Emergengy mitigation needed when tanking an add. IF it was concluded capable Knights needed such an ability despite LoH, DI, etc. an auto-parry discipline lasting 10 seconds and refreshing every 15 or 20 minutes would seem to more than suffice.<br />
<br />
2. Start up mitigation when MTing a raid boss mob that is Knight preferred and designed for Knights to MT. IF needed for positioning and CH rotation start-up, a brief auto parry discipline would do the job.<br />
<br />
3. Mitigation needed when stepping up into the MT rotation because too mant Warirors have died. Any fight lasting more than three minutes is tanked with Defensive down. Not very pursuasive either.<br />
<br />
I'm not opposed to Knight getting a brief auto-parry discipline.<br />
<br />
Since nearly all Knights state that they don't wish to MT raid boss mobs (except those especially designed with them in mind) such a discipline is not likely to cause this undesired result to be significantly more likely to happen.<br />
<br />
Hower, a brief auto-parry discipline, while maybe not absolutely required, would provide an emergency capability that would be quite useful in the roles Knights do wish to perform.<br />
<br />
The question is not if at 50% Defensive Wariors would be superior tanks to Knights at 49%, 40%, 30%, or 10%. The question is what Knights actually need to perform their role while insuring they do not have a possiblity of regularly performing the Warrior role.<br />
<br />
The question is not if Druids healing 90% of SL or HL would Clerics still have a job. It's if Druid healing is adequate for them to have their own role.<br />

10 second riposite/evade does not = 75% warrior, sorry.  That comes off as more of a &quot;less toss knights this and hope they shutup&quot; kind of unoriginal idea, which is exactly why so many warriors are catching the class dominance stereotype when they post this sort of thing.  Try around 30 seconds with perhaps an 8 minute refresh and I might take that as a less halfassed attempt.  I have still yet to hear a solid argument on your part towards SJ's ideas towards out disc's other than &quot;Defensive is the warriors class defining ability.&quot;  What your not seeing is that were asking for discs that would be tailored to offtanking, and while your might not use defensive or evasive in an offtanking position, most of the time thats because you save it for the big fights because of its refresh, wheres some knights may need to use it in an applicable situation.  This isnt going to be defensive v2.0...more like defensive v.25.  I dont see how with your tanking mitigation advantage, and longer and better discs, you can say that knights would be in a position to overtake the MT position in anything but a TPW.<br />
<br />
Warriors: -1 DI, AoE taunt, Defensive, Stonewall, Furious, Evasive.<br />
Knights: Taunt spells, v.25 extremely watered down defensive, evasive/autoriposite disc.  <br />
<br />
Im not trying to downplay our spellbooks, Im just saying that from a disc perspective and non casting, you still would have the advantage.  Theres no reason to use a knight in a warriors spot as MT if he clearly has the advantage all the time, thats a liability.  If you hook the discs to be mana relyant with a refresh timer, I honestly dont think that its too out of line, as long as they are discs and not spells taking up my spellslots and having to channel through inc hits.  With mobs beginning to ignore discs, I dont see how anyone would put a knight with discs up there when your going to need the best tank possible to handle the situation, and that spot has always belonged to warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other things have dramatically changed. One group progression trials have taken the place of some large scale raid encounters. <br />
<br />
And which have been tuned accordingly to allow Knights to tank.  Even so far as to negate the power of defensive in some of them.<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro has improved (which it needed) to the point where there is practically no aggro-versus-tanking tradeoff.<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro control is unrelated to Knight mini-defensive.  They are completely different issues.  Warriors weren't capable of functioning properly in a group role without an aggro improvement across the board in zones since PoP except for the very highest end Warriors.  Knights are functioning fine against the vast majority of content.  It's greatly debatable that they have a problem at all.  <br />
<br />
 Discs are now unlinked allowing for 12 seconds of melee immunity (and HT-like riposte damage) for initial fight stabilization.<br />
<br />
Yes, unlinking the disciplines has been very useful.  It actually allows Warriors to use disciplines which have mostly lied dorment since they were introduced.  Has this shifted things for Warriors to a degree?  Certainly.  But what happens when Knights get their upgraded spells in OOW?  What exactly is the impact of that going to be?  What exactly if anything will Warriors get?  The balance could very easily shift again.  And there is no justification for shifting it early without knowing exactly what the additional changes will do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights (or Warriors) saying furious/fortitude disc isn't much so Knights should have it is like Warriors (or Knights) saying a spellbook isn't much so Warriors should have it.<br />
<br />
As long as they don't let the stun/70 go live without a cost of say, 300 mana or at least a recast time of 30 seconds, the current Knight vs Warrior situation is manageable.  Maybe they're better for easy things but it's really expected...  Leave the discs alone.  I'll take some gimped encounters where defensive doesn't work than messing up the current balance.  <br />
<br />
And why do you want a Warrior for the other 95% of the fight?  Well, there's still Furious, and you know, Warrior still survives better even without Defensive?  A random search on high end magelo profile shows Warriors ahead by roughly 1100 HPs compare to the top Knights, factor in AoTC line it's probably closer to 900, which seems fine (close enough to 90/100 paradigm).  And the gap only gets bigger as you go lower (thogh this 1100 gap might decrease some when more Tacvi loot gets in the game, but seeing our high end weapon has 4% shielding, if Knight weapon sucks for defense that alone is enough to justify losing HPs, seeing shielding is huge).  Also defensive still works on yard trash, and yellow mobs can kill you rather easily in those trials.  I personally never disced on yard trash since I don't plan on failing them but the ability to disc on yellow hard trash (like Kyvs) helps a lot if you're at a level where the trials are difficult.  That is, provided, that a stun/70 thing wouldn't go in the game. Or, it could go in, but give mob over level 65 in GoD/OoW gets +75 resist against Paladin stuns like the way Qvic+ mobs are coded to resist anything cool you can proc on them but not anything else.  Oh, and then they can actually make the Ancient useful, i.e. something like 120 mana -75 to resist as opposed to 80/-45 regular stun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Claims of Knights being grossly out of balance compared to Warriors hasn't been well substantiated.  There are certainly some issues with how Knight spells scale against harder content, this true.  But OoW is going to introduce more levels and upgraded Knight spells.  It is exceedingly likely that with a couple of levels under their belts and packing some new spells, Knights will do just fine even in that limited content where they claim to be having a problem currently.  <br />
<br />
Adding a mini-defensive hasn't been well justified as being something the entire cross section of level 65 Knight players need to be functional across the spectrum of the content they face.  At most, Knights can claim that uber Knights who are taking on the most challenging content are facing a few obstacles.  This is not a gross across the board out of balance state for the class.  This is a minority group going up against some of the hardest stuff in the game and running into occassional trouble.  Isn't cutting edge content supposed to be challenging?  Yes, Warriors can tank the problem mobs easier than Knights.  Which has always been the case, for years.  Nothing new.  Nothing that all level 65 Knight players are facing.  Not justification for a change to all level 65 Knight characters.<br />
<br />
Now, I know people are going to be pissed to hear me say it yet again, but if you've got problems with Knight spells, start trying to get SoE to look at the spells.  Continuely crying that your spells suck, therefore you need a mini-defensive, isn't particularly convincing.  And attempting to claim that you'll have more success at getting SoE to impliment a mini-defensive rather than fixing or adjusting spells that really need it, seems to be a very thinly disguised way of saying you don't want the spells fixed, you want mini-defensive.  Which begs the question as to whether or not the spells are even broken to begin with.</div></div><hr />

You have your own pie. You have a Key Lime pie made with fresh Key lime juice, 2 teaspoons of Persian lime zest, a graham craker crust, whiped creme piped on in rosettes, etc.<br />
<br />
Warriors have a less fancy apple pie. I'll agree it has a mighty tasty crust, but having ordered the Key lime pie, you aren't entitled to have it AND dart your fork over and &quot;borrow&quot; some of my crust.<br />
<br />
HT, Zeefers Bite, spears, mob debuffs, melee DPS, and tanking adds are more activities than I can perform on raids. I have MTing, melee DPS, and tanking adds (which I won't generally be doing since MTing or waiting in line to MT is what Wariors do in raids.)<br />
<br />
I happen to believe SK's need the following changes:<br />
<br />
Instead of 50/50 lifetaps using Paladin heals as a template, I believe 50/75 is much more appropriate. A 1K HP Paladin heal should be balanced by a 500 DD/750 HP tap heal. This is particularly justified because Paladins can heal anyone while SK' can only heal themselves with lifetaps. Knight should be able to contribue to keeping themselves alive.<br />
<br />
Fear that duplicates &quot;stun mitigation&quot;. If stunning mobs is not unbalanced for Paladins to do, it is not unbalanced for Fear to have continued usefullness either.<br />
<br />
Since the Shadow Knight Class description explicitly says:<br />
Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies.<br />
I believe a unique mob debuff that keeps this promise is in order. I'm suggesting something like Cripple here, -30AC and -Attack. A 20% slow component overwritten by a Shaman, Beastlord, or Enchanter slow would not seem inappropriate either, given the promise. Either restoration of Fear line usefullness or a unique debuff is a must to balance out &quot;stun mitigation&quot; and give SK's some method to reduce a mob's DPS.<br />
<br />
A higher damage spear is very reasonable. A DD spell should allow the caster to do more damage than it they stood beating on the mob for the same length of time. A debuff to increase the chance of the spear hitting being a component of the debuff mentioned above is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Finally, give SK's a 10 second auto-reposte ability and Paladins a 10 second auto-parry and you end up with Sk's able to reduce a mob's damage output, contribute to healing themselves while tanking and with elevated DPS while not.<br />
<br />
That to me seems much better than trying to make SK's into mini-Warriors who will never be prefered to Warriors if one is available.<br />
<br />
My suggestions MAY be overpowered, but I think they are on the right track.<br />
<br />
No sir, most Wariors don't begrudge you pie, but get your fork away from mine.<br />

Obviously if they'd done the job right to begin with, Knights wouldn't have been having the trouble in GoD that they were.  Do you really think that the arguement that Knights need a mini-defensive because SoE is going to come along and release another expansion with mobs designed for a character level that hasn't yet been made available is really a viable arguement?<br />
<br />
That's an interesting point. So, what you are saying is that level 65 warriors, in some cases lesser level of gear than level 65 time enabled knights, were capable of regularly tanking this level 70 content with a better than average chance of success, while the knights were going splat on incomming.<br />

Assuming that the content was not retuned, level 70 was released with GoD, and that a level 70 knight was capable of reliably tanking the trials and adds in raid events - a warrior 5 levels beneith him in substandard gear would still make at least an equivelant, if not better, tank in single group encounters.  Yup, seams balanced to me.</div></div><hr />

Well gee, this is surprising?  That is what defensive does right?  Allows Warriors to tank mobs in inferior gear that would cause other tanks to go splat on incoming, right?  How many guilds are actually &quot;appropriately&quot; geared the first time they take on a particular boss mob?<br />

You mean it has just occured to you that for 3 minutes out of 10 a Warrior is a far superior tank to a Knight against high DI mobs?  Wow, and here I thought that kind of thing was obvious since velious where Warriors used defensive to tank things like Flurry Drakes and AoW.</div></div><hr />

After being reminded that SoE has said:<br />
Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared. <br />
So, when a Warrior supports Knights getting abilities just like the other Tank hybrid has for avoidance/mitigation (and let's remember Knights have widely pointed out that this ability is sufficient for WS Rangers to tank named trial mobs before the adjustments even) despite the fact it may no longer be needed and despite the fact SoE has shown little movement to provide one, he's being condensending.<br />
<br />
Balance in this case I believe is insuring Knights have the tools (including spellbook revision) to perform their roles without being able to also perform the Warrior role. Right now, SoE has embarked on a path that includes only adjusting content apparently.<br />
<br />
I support (read above) adjusting content, revising spellbooks, and even if it's not 100% needed, providing Knights with an avoidance/mitigation capability because all other melees have one. This is in addition to DA and FD which Knights have instead and an ability to heal themselves in combat that Warriors entirely lack.<br />
<br />
I don't see Knights having half or three-quarters Defensive, not even by other means. I don't believe SoE will do it. Embracing a solution Warriors WILL accept (if they will) that does the job is more likely to be successful than insisting on a solution that will not happen.<br />
<br />
Warrior support for measures that will improve things for Knights in GoD is still support even if it falls short of asking SoE to share, remove, or negate their defining class ability.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that sounded condensending.<br />

This is particularly justified because Paladins can heal anyone while SK' can only heal themselves with lifetaps. Knight should be able to contribue to keeping themselves alive.<br />
I've thought that to be a good idea for a long time.<br />
Fear that duplicates &quot;stun mitigation&quot;. If stunning mobs is not unbalanced for Paladins to do, it is not unbalanced for Fear to have continued usefullness either.<br />
As long as it doesn't make the mob run away(which sort of makes it not a fear spell anymore), that would be a welcome ability.  If said spell were to make the mob run, and potentially jeopardize the raid or group, no thank you.<br />
I believe a unique mob debuff that keeps [the SK class description] promise is in order. I'm suggesting something like Cripple here, -30AC and -Attack. A 20% slow component overwritten by a Shaman, Beastlord, or Enchanter slow would not seem inappropriate either, given the promise. Either restoration of Fear line usefullness or a unique debuff is a must to balance out &quot;stun mitigation&quot; and give SK's some method to reduce a mob's DPS.<br />
One would have to be very careful on stacking issues with a spell like this, but it has the potential to work.<br />
A higher damage spear is very reasonable. A DD spell should allow the caster to do more damage than it they stood beating on the mob for the same length of time. A debuff to increase the chance of the spear hitting being a component of the debuff mentioned above is a good idea.<br />
Higher-damage spears, thumbs up.  Debuff for that purpose, thumbs down.  <br />
<br />
For one thing, a debuff of that nature(-DR) would tie up two spell slots just to make one spell effective.  It would also take up a precious debuff/dot spot on the mob that offers no real benefit to the raid at large, just myself and one or two other people.  The debuff mentioned in the section above would at least benefit the entire raid by virtue of making whomever is tanking the mob take less damage, the healers having more mana, and the raid moving faster as a result.<br />
<br />
I suggest an innate -resist modifier on spears rather than giving SKs a disease debuff.  I honestly have no idea how resisted the lower spears are... maybe they need it, maybe not, but it's definately needed for high-end content.<br />
Finally, give SK's a 10 second auto-reposte ability and Paladins a 10 second auto-parry and you end up with Sk's able to reduce a mob's damage output, contribute to healing themselves while tanking and with elevated DPS while not.<br />
<br />
The one thing I don't like about SKs getting a riposte disc as their only form of triggered melee avoidance/mitigation is high-end pulling(where the mobs hit too hard and too fast for pet pulling to be viable).  <br />
<br />
Say I pull 3 mobs to split, hit SK_Furious, and have to time my feign to a spellcasting mob... it's very possible that I'll do enough damage(on non-slowed mobs) during disc to cause them to summon me back when I stand up to finish getting them split.  Or if I get one to linger behind while the others go home, it's more than possible that the tagger will get summoned into an unslowed mob that's not in range of heals at camp.  That kind of risk returns us to where we are now... with lull pulling(monk, bard, enc, cleric, occasionally rng/dru) being safer and faster than wasting time with an SK.<br />
<br />
But if a stonestance style mitigation disc(short-duration/fast-reuse) is out of the question, I could see your suggestion being implemented as a 2-tick riposte for SKs, and 3-tick parry for paladins.  That would make sense for the two classes, with SKs getting more damage while paladins get no damage but a longer period of &quot;defense.&quot;</div></div><hr />

While I have tremendous concern for the state of SK's, stuns and anything that mimics stuns that work up to level 70 (Even 75) mobs are game breaking and need to be removed, not given to others.   Otherwise, kickstun is going to need to be 4 second duration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't call it practically none.  Knights still have an advantage there.  But it was NEVER supposed to be a huge advantage.  The fact that there was such a big difference for a long time was an imbalance.  They corrected the imbalance.  Correcting the fact that knight to warrior aggro, relatively speaking, was way overpowered, does not mean you then have to give the knights something to make up for it.  The classes were brought closer to balance by the change.  The same goes for the -1 DI change to warriors, which ya didn't mention.  But it was another change the devs felt was necessary to make the classes more balanced.  Therefore, &quot;warriors got X so we should get Y&quot; makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between stun 4/65 and stun 4/70 is something like 300% better when you look at the DPS you can mitigiate.  Paladins are scheduled to get a stun 4/70 and complain they only get a 10% increase?  To put it in perspective, that's like if greater defensive that drops mob's DI to 25% and warrior are saying 'well it's only 25% better than the old one'.<br />
<br />
The only way a stun 4/70 would even make sense is if every GoD and OoW 66+ mob gets +100 (at least) MR against those stuns so they become effectively +55/+45 (ancient) to save.  That way Paladins can also stop crying about their Ancient being useless.  After Qvic+ mobs only get something like +400 MR versus Time Rend which saves at -200 MR.  This still doesn't deal with the fact that it'd make most old content beyond trivial (as in 3 Paladins can kill anything old uber that's stunnable) but at least it'd keep the current content balanced.<br />
<br />
Some other alternatives would be to make the paladin stun recast on 30 seconds, you know, like the one your parent class, the cleric, gets in OoW.  By the way, your parent class's stun saves at 0 MR as opposed to -45/-55 too.</div></div><hr />

And one of the most significant things we get to counter balance our lack of spells is defensive.  Which Knights desire.  Which they claim they need.  But that &quot;need&quot; isn't supported by the reality.  The game has gone along just fine for four years without Knights needing defensive.  If there are problems here and there for Knights in GoD, that should be addressed as a content tuning issue, not a Knights need defensive issue.  If Knight spells aren't adequate within the environment, that should be addressed as a spells adjustment issue, not a Knights need a defensive issue.  It seems that with Knights, much like all roads lead to Rome, all roads lead to defensive.</div></div><hr />

stuns simply don't mitigate as much dmg as you guys seem to think. i'd really like to see some parses to prove that stuns are somehow game breaking...because i know from actual practical expierence they are only useful for agro generation, and the occasional spell interrupt, they amount they mitigate is minimal at best.<br />
<br />
if you think that every single mob in the game is somehow going to be able to be stunned because the cap on our stun spells will be 70, then your completely clueless on how the game works on a stun level. not to mention stunning cuts into out mele, and as piddly as that may be, we would like to contirbute to the mob dying like everyone else.<br />
<br />
there are indivudual mobs flagged immune, there are entire creature models flagged immune, and im not just talking giants and dragons from 4 years ago...there are several mobs higher than our caps, and i have ZERo doubt in my mind what-so-ever that there will be just as many mobs over lvl 70 in the new expansion, just as many creature types flagged immune, and just as many indivudual encounters completely negating stunning for anything but agro generation. hell, even mez works better as a spell interrupt.<br />
<br />
you make any of my stuns 30 second reuse, and i can guarantee you it will never get mem'd, as it will be absolutly worthless, not even useful for agro generation. put a riduculous mana cost on it, and it will never get mem'd, and i will expect useful spells to make up for these riduculous ideas brought up by a class that has zero idea about spell balancing and how spells work in a gameplay situtation.</div></div><hr />

I play a cleric every hour I play a warrior.<br />
<br />
The warrior was born and power leveled by the cleric and my original druid.<br />
<br />
On stunnable mobs, a paladin WILL TAKE LESS MANA PER HOUR.<br />
<br />
Less mana per hour means more kills per hour.<br />
<br />
Zones I have played with a paladin include PoFire, PoEarth, Vxed (before most recent revamp.)<br />
<br />
My warrior has all LR/ID aa, 1760 AC, and 9700 hp.<br />
<br />
One paladin that is a better tank in these places 1650 AC, 9300 hp.<br />
<br />
I have played with some paladins that only stun twice on incoming.  I try to avoid these paladins in the future.<br />
<br />
Considering the fact that paladin stun avoidance is linear to the mob DPS, any increase in mob DPS and stun level in OOW will be unbalancing to warriors.<br />
<br />
It already requires more gear on the warrior (a lot more) to balance stun avoidance.<br />
<br />
So please stop using the &quot;on paper&quot; denial.  Stun avoidance is massive and if you don't know that, then you may not be a very good paladin.</div></div><hr />

Knights bitched because we got 500hp for 60 AA's.   <br />
<br />
One hit from mobs in KT is up to 1150ish.   Over twice of that 500hp that knights were bitching about.   Mobs can hit up to 8 times in a combat round and any stuns that land will stop a combat round.<br />

And if you don't think stopping one of her quad 2200 rounds helps a lot even when you've no idea when that Time Rend is going to come, well, I suggest take some extra quad 2200 rounds and see what happens.<br />
<br />
There are three things Stuns do.  First, it automatically achieves the purposeo f tanking when the mob is stunned because it can't possibly hit anyone, so it's always 'off' the wrong target until it's unstunned.  That's 4 seconds which is enough time to taunt again.  It also gives you aggro.  It also stops the mob from hitting you or anyone else, therefore its mitigation.<br />
<br />
Only a few mob types have been immune to stuns in Sewers and all generic Muramite models are stunnable, so I don't see that changing anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I'll put it this way.  If the game decides that my Static Blow (stun 3/65 MR-100) is too overpowered that Kyvs in Qvic has special immunity to Static Blow (and just about every form of proced stun), then your stun 4/70 better have at least half of the mob having special immunity against it, too.  I mean what's the problem here I thought Paladins only cared about stun for the aggro because it was worthless for everything else?  So what exactly is wrong if half (or more) of the mobs have +100 MR versus Paladin stuns?  It doesn't change your aggro at all, and it can still work.  Even at +55/+45 you're still going to be able to stun a mob more frequently than any other class since other classes actually don't want to aggro (and did people forget cleric stun is 30 second refresh?).  Our Paladin that got the diamond javelin thing recently commented on there was only one or two mobs that can be stunned with Time Rend (stun 3/68 MR-200) because everything else resist at Time Rend at modified MR so high that it never lands.  See a pattern here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually some of us aren't particularly bothered by defensive being negated in two trials.  It's a far far better solution than to havingto listen to the continual preaching of Paladins about how they need defensive to succeed in them.  Guess what, no one gets to use defensive there.  So you don't need defensive to succeed.  Therefore a major portion of the Knight case that defensive is unbalanced because of trials just went down the tubes.  So sorry.  You'll have to come up with a different bullshit arguement about why Knights think they need defensive.  Next!</div></div><hr />

It doesn't take a genius to see what stun 4/70 will do to this game.  The difference between level 66 and 65 mob is twice the DPS.  It's not our problem that people do not recognize Paladins are better tanks on stuff that can be stunned, and it certainly doesn't mean you should be better tanks on mobs 66-70 (which puts out significant DPS) which is what will happen if they're stunnable, and currently they are.</div></div><hr />

2) Paladins facing the same weakness in tanking on non-stunable mobs. Also just how much and how long a paladin can maintain stunning on every fight will vary hugely even within the confines of 65. A 65/00 or even 65/100 paladin will probably have a very different experiance chain stunning than a 65/300 Time plus pally. Lets not blinder our selves to the 10k/2k club only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When mobs hit for several hundred, stuns (when they even land) and defensive are a big help, but you can get by without them.<br />
<br />
When mobs hit for around a thousand, stuns (when they even land) and defensive are very powerful, and make difficult encounters easy.<br />
<br />
When mobs hit for a couple thousand and more, stuns (if there will even be many mobs that hard that can be stunned) and defensive are stupidly unbalancing and overpowered, and make the impossible doable.<br />
<br />
The funniest thing about warrior complaints about stuns is that everything that makes stuns &quot;unbalancing&quot; and &quot;overpowered&quot; against higher level/DPS mobs is exactly what makes /disc defensive as &quot;unbalancing&quot; and &quot;overpowered&quot;.  In both cases, the ability in question scales with mob DPS, regardless of how astronomically high the numbers get.  The disparity in DPS when you can stun or use defensive becomes so obscenely large as mob DPS increases that increasingly ridiculous amounts of gear upgrades are required to even come close to making up the difference.  The irony of warriors making the same case against stuns that knights have been making against defensive is too rich.<br />
<br />
What makes it that much more laughable hearing it from warriors is that there are so many drawbacks and complications to using stuns that warriors conveniently disregard or disingenuously trivialize that simply do not exist for defensive.  Defensive cannot be interrupted.  Defensive cannot be resisted.  Defensive does not fizzle.  Until now, no mobs are immune to defensive (and there are still only 2 mobs in the game where using defensive isn't effective).  Silence doesn't prevent you from using defensive.  You can use defensive to its full effect immediately after being resurrected.  Defensive is effective against every mob that is hitting you, instead of only the one mob you have selected to use it on.  Defensive always lasts its full duration.  The same defensive you got at 55 is just as effective on any mob you are fighting, regardless of level.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, SKs still have nothing that is anywhere near as effective as stuns or defensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the people who have zero ideas about spell balancing are the ones who think this is actually a good idea.I think the people who have zero ideas about class balancing are the ones who think warriors being the only class with defensive (and have the gall to complain about paladins having stuns) is actually a good idea.</div></div><hr />

So since you think stuns are unbalancing and defensive is unbalancing, it great sense to give both stuns and a form of defensive to a single class?

What makes something &quot;unbalancing&quot; is precisely because one side has something too powerful that the other(s) do not.  Defensive is the most egregiously overpowered skill, while stuns are overpowered to a far lesser degree (being situational and having so many complications and drawbacks as noted in my previous post).<br />
<br />
Giving paladins a lesser form of defensive would bring them up to par with warriors (who could then stand to gain some upgrades to help their utility and desirabilty in single group situations as long as they don't once again make them completely outclass knight tanking in all situations).  I don't think paladins would object to having their 65+ stun durations all decreased to 1 second either so they were used primarily for aggro and spell interruption rather than damage prevention if they were to receive a knight-tuned defensive.  Shadowknights of course would need something competitive with paladin stuns AND the same lesser form of defensive to balance them with paladins and warriors.</div></div><hr />

Nonsense, it happens all the time.  Ever do Time without bards?   Ever do a raid without clerics?  Ever do time without an enchanter?   I hate to tell you but some classes are required and some aren't.  You picked one that isn't required, and I picked one that is.    You picked one who also has other strengths that mine doesn't have in various aspects of the game.    <br />
<br />
Defensive never made fights &quot;just a little easier&quot;, defensive was released in Kunark, it was MANDATORY in Kunark in VP, there wasn't a VP raid without warriors EVER while it was current.   It was MANDATORY in Velious.  Encounters were balanced around it since the day it was implemented, and it has continued to this day.   Hell, even Venril Sathir was unbeatable without /disc furious at first.   <br />
<br />
There are classes who excel at their specialties because they MUST compensate for their narrowness by being deep.    This is a concept you have no clue about, because you dont' give a crap about it.  You have an &quot;I want&quot; philosophy, there's things you cannot do and want, whereas you STILL want to keep things that I cannot do to yourself.  <br />
<br />
You want to talk about &quot;balance&quot; by such an odd definition that it's off my radar screen.<br />

Balance has it's origin in scales.   Things of equal weight when the whole is placed on either side of a scale.  If you have more things than me, my things must be heavier to be &quot;balanced&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Maybe so Crimson.  But you have to understand that many of the arguements you present have been presented dozens of times previously.  And many Warriors have said, yes there may be problems with some of the Knight spell lines.  Yes there may be problems with some GoD content.  We're open to Knights approaching SOE to address some of these issues.  Your spells are your compensation for not getting things like defensive, so if they're not adequate, that should change.  But, seriously, it does seem like it all circles back to wanting defensive again and again and again.  If that wasn't your intention, then I misunderstood.  But you'd be one of the first Knights posting here that didn't get around to wanting defensive at some point.</div></div><hr />

I'll admit that what you say is the pitch some Knights are trying very hard to make to SoE - Who says Wariors should be far and away the preferred MT.<br />
<br />
Unmatched does mean only sir. More precisely, in this context, it means without peer, equivilent, reasonable substitute, etc.<br />
<br />
The original class descriptions, assurances that Warriors would not lose their primary tank role, changes made to Warriors to insure they maintain this role,  and the &quot;like it or not&quot; observation made recently all have supported this. Verant and now SoE have been the &quot;Who says&quot;.<br />
<br />
Greig, CT, Inny, Rathe Council, Mindrider, etc. show that SoE can as it chooses make Warirors not preferred for individual mobs.<br />
<br />
Would you be happier if Verrant/SoE had calculated the AC and HP's required (and returning CH to be much closer to a real CH) to give Warriors a permanent advantage equivilent to Defensive being used? Would 17k HP 3000AC (with the AC softcap adjusted upward) Warriors make you happy? With even more every level in OoW?<br />
<br />
With Defensive the way it is designed, Knights are equally acceptable in experiance groups, can have a raid add tanking role, MT raid boss mobs designed for them to be preferred, and after &quot;gearing up&quot; even MT boss mobs that start out as Warior preferred. Just pile on the AC and HP's Warriors were entitled to every new level and new expansion and Knights aren't viable at all.<br />

Truth is you believe Knights should tank much closer to Warriors (be reasonable substitutes) vs. raid mobs and have their spellbooks. Warriors with Spellbooks/Tank Mage -there's a new concept, never heard that one before.<br />

And ya get other classes and Developers who seem to believe that SK's are fine if not overpowered.<br />
<br />
5 or 6 months ago, my eldest son who had a 63 SK asked me if I wanted him. Note, I could have gotten the SK to 65 easily and since my guild did many re-flagging events could have gotten him flagged. I passed.<br />
<br />
I didn't pass because SK's aren't powerful and fun to play in moderately challanging groups, you'd have to be stone blind to think otherwise. I passed because when the mobs start hitting for 1k, even in groups, I'd much rather play a Warrior or better yet a Paladin. In today's hard hitting raids, SK's have even less to recommend them. IMO SK's are badly shorchanged.<br />
<br />
You needn't compare an SK to a Wariror and lament Warirors are more powerful in raids - that's a given. Compare SK's to Paladins in raids where a major discrepancy is hard to justify on any grounds, and SK's clearly have gotten little or no love.<br />

<br />
I'd have to agree, at least from a superficial comparison of the two classes, the Paladin comes out ahead, hands down.  When and where Paladin abilities work at full capacity they pretty much blow both Shadow Knights and Warriors away except in those cases where defensive really is a requirement.  And Shadow Knights don't even get those exceptions.  The Shadow Knight spellbook has it's uses, but it doesn't appear to have as many as the Paladin spellbook.</div></div><hr />

Ever do Time without bards?   Ever do a raid without clerics?  Ever do time without an enchanter?None of these invalidates my argument.  Sure, it would be tough without those classes, but you can compensate in each case by bringing enough of another class, or having everyone else working twice as hard.  You cannot bring enough healing, or somehow work exceptionally harder, to accomplish the same thing with a knight that requires a warrior to use defensive just to avoid being one-rounded.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate to tell you but some classes are required and some aren't.  You picked one that isn't required, and I picked one that is.    You picked one who also has other strengths that mine doesn't have in various aspects of the game.Your class description does not say, &quot;Required for every raid (and now single groups too in GoD!) to even have a chance.&quot;  My class description does not say, &quot;Has no use on raids, and good luck trying to solo with watered down necro knockoff spells.&quot;  This is a bullshit argument.  Every class should be desired to fill some role on raids and be effective in groups, something that you want THAT specific class to be present for.  Shadowknights are only reluctantly wanted to tank when there are no warriors or paladins available, or pull when there are no bards or monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive never made fights &quot;just a little easier&quot;, defensive was released in Kunark, it was MANDATORY in Kunark in VP, there wasn't a VP raid without warriors EVER while it was current.   It was MANDATORY in Velious.  Encounters were balanced around it since the day it was implemented, and it has continued to this day.Defensive made things a &quot;little&quot; easier in some cases, and a lot easier in others, but the only time it was &quot;mandatory&quot; was with AoW.  No one objects to needing the absolute best people to do the very toughest content in the game (at the time).   You absolutely could have compensated in every other case you're talking about though by bringing enough healing.  The problem with GoD is that there are mobs all over the place, including single group content, that just aren't feasible to do without a warrior using defensive, no matter how much healing you bring, or you are limited by the group size and can't bring more healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, even Venril Sathir was unbeatable without /disc furious at first.Which has nothing to do with knights needing some form of defensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are classes who excel at their specialties because they MUST compensate for their narrowness by being deep.    This is a concept you have no clue about, because you dont' give a crap about it.  You have an &quot;I want&quot; philosophy, there's things you cannot do and want, whereas you STILL want to keep things that I cannot do to yourself.You want all my utility, go ahead and buy it, it only costs you platinum.  There are only two things of any use that I can do that you can't buy:  FD, and feed my group a miniscule amount of mana.  If you want more utility to make your class more diverse and enjoyable and have more to do than hit your defensive hotkey, I'm all for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You want to talk about &quot;balance&quot; by such an odd definition that it's off my radar screen.<br />
<br />
Balance has it's origin in scales.   Things of equal weight when the whole is placed on either side of a scale.  If you have more things than me, my things must be heavier to be &quot;balanced&quot;.The problem most warriors have with balance is that they continue to parrot the fallacious argument that 75% warrior + 25% necro = a class that's 100% balanced with warriors.  The ability to effectively tank named mobs is at such a premium that 25% of a warrior's ablities FAR outweighs 25% of necro ability (and low-end, expansions-old necro ability at that).  No one would replace ANY level 65 character on their raid with a level 60 warrior with no disciplines and a level 49 necro.<br />
<br />
Warriors KNOW that their tanking advantages are at such a premium that they are happy, even overeager, to throw us any spellcasting bones (more DoTs, more debuffs that have no measurable effect, more lifetaps that don't scale, better soloing tools!), anything at all so long as it doesn't bring us any closer to warriors' tanking abilities and threaten the monopoly they have on GoD tanking.  Anything at all that brings us closer to warrior tanking and separates us further from the other non-tank classes meets completely unreasonable and unthinking resistance.<br />
<br />
The fact is, even if we were given the exact same form of defensive as warriors, warriors would still be the clearly prefered raid tank, and very competitive single group tanks.  However, we aren't asking for full defensive, but a lesser form of it tuned to our particular needs (somewhat less DI reduction, half the duration, less of a reuse time), that still preserves warrior tanking dominance for the hardest hitting mobs.  <br />
<br />
Knights are tanks first and foremost, who have some necro or cleric spellcasting ability, not necros or clerics who can do a little tanking.  Any balancing must consider our tanking ability first, with spellcasting abilities that give us clear advantages in other areas that give people pause and reason to consider whether those other advantages are worth the trade-off for a lesser tank.  Warriors are going about this process in reverse, trying to emphasize or push on us other non-tanking abilities, and then pointing to them as reasons for not making us adequate tanks.  There are already 13 other classes that are not (or should not be) adequate tanks because of other abilities they bring to the group/raid.  Warriors just want to secure and guarantee their position in the group/raid when they should be competing for it like everyone else.</div></div><hr />

True, the Warrior class description contains word for word what everyone agrees is a MT personified.<br />
&quot;Has no use on raids, and good luck trying to solo with watered down necro knockoff spells.&quot;<br />
True also - your Class Description says:<br />
Shadowknights are unholy warriors who use fear, pain and disease to attack all that is good in the world. Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. When needed, shadowknights use their powerful harm touch ability to greatly damage their opponents.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them. Combined with spells that degrade an enemy's ability to fight, a shadowknight becomes a fearsome foe.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. The shadowknight's lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight.<br />
I note the lack of a MT set of abilities as are contained in the Warrior description. I see phrases like &quot;unholy warriors&quot; (note the lower cass 'w'), &quot;primarily a melee class&quot;, &quot;Players who like offensive melee fights....&quot;<br />
<br />
What I don't see is taking the point in battles, unmatched survivability in brutal battles, and keeping vulnerable party members safe from harm - that would be Warriors. That would be the 100% pure Tank, the Primary Tank.<br />
<br />
As a primarily tank/meleeyou do need to be able to tank in experiance groups, get mandatory individual flags, and contribute in raids (hopefully tanking adds if your equipment permits it and even to MT boss mobs that are not Warrior prefered).<br />
<br />
SoE has said that:<br />
Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared. I think that pretty darned clear.<br />
<br />
Do SK's need improvements? Yes, I think so - I even enumerated some above. It even includes an uneeded &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability entirely suitable for hybrids.<br />
<br />
You want a piece of my central defining class ability despite the fact it is blatently unfair to Wariors? OK, it can be done..........<br />
.......roll a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Want the best Necro pet despite the fact it would be blatently unfair to Necros? OK, it can be done..........<br />
.......roll a Necro.<br />

if you had said group, i could have at least seen, but to say that we are somehow more useful or nessecary to a raid is absolutly ludicrous...<br />
<br />
<br />
the one place where damn near all of our spell book becomes marginalized by an abundance of healers and curers that are on every single guilds roster, and you somehow think that FD/snare pulling and better DPS than us, group mana and are somehow less useful than what we bring? i'd say we're both close to pretty damn near useless in a raid setting, but by no means whatsoever do paladins have some mythological use during a raid that SK's don't.<br />

this has turned into a witchunt, the mob mentality has taken over and when someone seens a paladin, it doesn't matter what he says, all they see is &quot;defensive, defensive, defensive&quot;...if you guys would slow down and read what people are saying, instead of figureing out what class they are, and then responding, you might get more than the same crap over and over again...<br />

BBI never claimed otherwise, and you have no point.  <br />
<br />
Why did I know you wouldn't even be able to argue the issue and instead just continue to parrot the same tired crap and sidestep the real problem.  Improving knight tanking (including a knight-tuned form of defensive) does not contradict a single thing you've said.  Warriors would remain the &quot;unmatched&quot;, premier tanks.  They just wouldn't be so far and away ahead of everyone else that knights aren't even considered an option.<br />

Regarding anything SoE has ever said, clearly they're not geniuses, and they're not always right.  Unless you suddenly think disabling defensive in Tipt and Ikkinz1 was a great way to solve the problem?<br />
<br />
Why don't you speak for yourself and say what you really mean:  You don't want the other two tank classes to tank any better than they do now and actually be able to compete with you for the tanking job.  You'd rather see their tanking remain as bad as all the other classes so your guaranteed tanking job remains secure and unthreatened.</div></div><hr />

Both Knights can tank pretty close to a Warrior when he's not using Defensive.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, Paladins are the third best healer, a group healer, have a useful buff, can GRC, can Root and stun many adds. In PoTime on a number of ocassions SU/Holyforge just plain rocks.<br />
<br />
An SK can HT, use spears, and Z-bite. Even going flat out they aren't a high DPS melee - not like a Rogue for example.<br />
<br />
We can all write off Rangers, the Forgotten Tank, and pretend they as a hybrid shouldn't tank almost like Knights. But writing off SK's while Paladins have powerful raid usefulness is going overboard.<br />

don't discount DPS simply because its not rogue level...i've often been accused of being too DPS oriented..i know i shoulda rolled a rogue 4 years ago. but doing dps, of any sort, is useful, not to mention fun.<br />

BBI'm not interested in skipping PoTime, I'll finish it in due course.  However, there is no justification for a knight decked out in PoTime+ gear to still unreliably tank this stuff when Luclin-era and worse geared warriors can pull it off just by hitting defensive.

<br />
Define poorly.  Shadow Knights are great tanks for the vast majority of one group content.  Shadow Knights can't typically tank raid calibre boss mobs unless significantly overgeared.  Now, why exactly should Shadow Knights be tanking raid calibre boss mobs?  Because you &quot;want&quot; to?  Or because that would be &quot;balanced&quot; when a Warrior receives no spellbook, even one as &quot;limited&quot; you claim yours is?  When in reality the major limitation to it is that SoE has seen fit to negate most of its effectiveness against raid mobs.  SoE could easily, if they thought it was a problem, adjust the resists of whole catagories of mobs to make Shadow Knight spells more effective.  Maybe that's where you need to take this, to the mob resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry if this has been properly addressed, but I find this statement quite lollerous.  Yes, many classes can slow and haste and heal and pull and wipe their own asses, but all of those classes can also do other things if those roles are taken.  A warrior really doesn't have any other &quot;role&quot; but tanking.  I find myself in groups where my spellcasting skills are not needed, and it stinks to feel so useless with only my subpar dps to add to the group; I imagine a non-tanking warrior feels much the same, but more often.</div></div><hr />

What single-group targets or raid adds can you NOT tank without defensive?<br />

Speak of what you know, please.  I am a knight.  My gear is time+.   I can tank most single-group content or raid adds fairly reliably... and the upgrades I suggested earlier in the thread would allow me to do it without the &quot;fairly&quot; qualifer.  Yes, I'd still die occasionally... shit happens, warriors die occasionally to, even with defensive.  Hell, I can even MT a few raid-calibur &quot;boss mobs&quot; if I had to.<br />
<br />
There are certainly tweaks that should be made(especially for shadowknights), but defensive isn't one of them.  It might have been an option(albeit a really bad one) before they retuned GoD and made the Ikkinz group trials non-required, but that just isn't the case anymore.</div></div><hr />

That seems eminently reasonable.  Every class has a few &quot;tweaks&quot; that could/should be made to make the class a little better in one way or another without throwing things out of kilter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrthin</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's nice to see everyone trying to sidestep or deflect attention from the real issue that a knight-tuned form of defensive would address.  The bottom line is that defensive allows warriors to overcome a greater and greater deficiency in gear as the game progresses and mob DPS continues to climb.  By the same token, knights require vastly more advanced gear to come close to tanking the same content that warriors can.<br />
<br />
The gap is only going to continue to grow, and at an even more accelerated pace.  You only need to look at the mob DPS increases from Kunark -&gt; Velious -&gt; Luclin -&gt; PoP -&gt; GoD to see the trend, and to see why knights are even more alarmed at the prospect of what is to come in OoW.  I wouldn't be surprised to see level 70 exp group trash hitting for 2k, and bosses regularly hitting for 5k+.  Knights are having to over-gear to an even greater extreme than before to tank the same content that warriors can.  In OoW the gear won't even exist in game that will allow knights to come anywhere near the tanking abilities of warriors by that point.<br />
<br />
Warrior defensive will continue to scale, remaining just as effective for future mobs as it is today, while knight abilities will receive marginal, linear increases (barring paladin stuns), that become increasingly ineffectual in closing the tanking gap.  SK abilities would have to double in power going from PoP to GoD and at least double once again going from GoD to OoW, to retain their effectiveness.  If SK abilities scaled appropriately the way defensive does, we'd be lifetapping for 3k, procing 1.5k lifetaps, harm touching for 50k, and casting 5k spears.  No, there is no spell solution for this dilemma that wouldn't be vastly overpowering for SKs.<br />
<br />
There are only two ways to continue to develop content that challenges warriors while not at the same time being impossible for knights; that is doable for knights while not at the same time being trivial for warriors.<br />
<br />
1)  Disable defensive.  or,<br />
2)  Give knights a form of defensive.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, warriors are unable to see beyond their own self-interests, and are adamantly against either alternative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look Prythin, if your group only fights two mobs back to back every 10 minutes, then yes defensive is going to make a world of difference.  How many groups do you know that fight two mobs back to back (remember defensive isn't on 24/7, it lasts 3 minutes and has a 10 minute total refresh time) and then have 10 minutes of down time?  Not a whole lot.  In your average experience group defensive doesn't mean jack.  It's only when you're pulling something particularly hard that it starts to have an impact.  And it really has it's greatest impact when going up against high DI boss mobs.<br />
<br />
So this perception you seem to have of Warriors firing off defensive on every mob and out tanking the crap out of Knights as a result just doesn't exist.  If a Warrior is grossly undergeard for the content he's going to get raped by everything he comes across.  The group is going to have to work extra hard to keep him standing, or they're going to have to use gimp approaches like using a charmed pet against everything except the boss.<br />
<br />
And most of this has been addressed!  Content mods have gone in.  The content should be more reasonable for an &quot;appropriately&quot; geared tank.  Now the question you have to ask yourself, is not whether or not you need defensive, but whether or not you're &quot;appropriately&quot; geared for the content you want to tank.  The odds are very good that you aren't.  And you're not alone.  A LOT of people aren't appropriately geared to be tanking in GoD, Warriors included.  The only real advantage a Warrior has is that for one mob or maybe two, within a three minute period, they really tanks well.   Otherwise an undergeared Warrior is getting raped every step of the way just like an undergeared Knight.</div></div><hr />

What Knights need to be appropriatley geared for an encounter is far more than what a Warrior needs.  A Knight should function just as well in a group between tanking and casting as a Warrior does with an equal level of gear.  The Warrior should out tank the Knight yes, but the Knight should make up for it.  As it is right now a Knight functions in a group equilavently to a Warrior 1-1.5 tiers behind in advancement.  That is where the problem is, a Knight has to work far harder to contribute as much to a group as a Warrior does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time on Cragbeast Queen, a Paladin did 170 DPS using Diamond Tipped Javelin (74/42 piercing) while chaining 2 Waves.  Now, before you say that sounds like a lot of DPS, realize that CBQ takes 130% damage from piercing weapons, so on a normal mob it'd be around 130 DPS.  I'm interested in seeing some parse numbers to see what Knight DPS really turns out to be.  I'm well aware that having auto attack on isn't quite the same DPS as casting mid-battle so it'd be interesting to see just how much DPS Knights give up for spellcasting.<br />
<br />
On the same note, anyone know what kind of DPS warriors do?  I have heard 200 DPS is not unreasonable for a warrior dedicated to DPS (i.e. get attack buffs instead of Brells) but don't have any verification, though my rough calculation shows a Great Maul of the Mighty (59/31) should do about 192 DPS using the numbers for Vanazir (slightly overestimated) with only 250 worn attack + max haste, so 200 certainly seems doable.  200 versus 130 seems pretty out of whack... now everyone knows I hate Paladins, but that's almost 50% more DPS there.  Even if we're using the same weapons, that'd look like 200 versus 150 DPS, so only 75% the DPS of a Warrior...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, exactly.  For one single encounter every ten minutes the Knight would have to be massively geared beyond the Warrior to compete.  That's the point of defensive.  That's what it does.  It's the Warrior &quot;edge&quot;.<br />
<br />
A Knight should function just as well in a group between tanking and casting as a Warrior does with an equal level of gear.<br />
<br />
And in the VAST majority of situations this is true, it is that way currently.  They just redid a large part of GoD to make it that way.  You don't get to compare your tanking and spells versus a Warrior's tanking and defensive.  Your spells are far more available.  You don't typically have to decide, well if I use this spell on this mob, I won't have it available again for another ten minutes, is this what I want to do?  Warriors do.  They have to commit.  Knights basically don't have that problem.<br />
<br />
As it is right now a Knight functions in a group equilavently to a Warrior 1-1.5 tiers behind in advancement. That is where the problem is, a Knight has to work far harder to contribute as much to a group as a Warrior does.<br />
<br />
Balderdash!  Pure fantasy!  Seriously, where do you come up with this?  There is nothing anywhere that shows that in an experience group, with defensive tucked away and not being used, as it is MOST OF THE TIME, a Warrior is going to tank like a Knight geared 1-1.5 tiers better than he is.   The best parses don't show more than a 5-12% difference in tanking of &quot;somewhat&quot; equally geared Knights versus Warriors.   The thing you're bothered by is that once in a while a Warrior will actually be able to take defensive out of the box and use it, and when he does, he'll blow the doors of a Knight in tanking.  But golly Mr. Knight, don't you realize how many different ways you blow the doors off Warriors being able to do things with spells whenever you want?  Your spells aren't powerful enough to compensate for a Warrior having 3 minutes of glory out of 10?  Take it up with SoE!  Tell them your spells aren't sufficient.  But frankly, because spells don't scale like defensive, spells are already grossly overpowered against anything that isn't fairly close to the cutting edge in difficulty.  While defensive goes from being &quot;okay&quot; against normal content, to being &quot;kick ass&quot; against really hard content.  Well, that's the trade off.  That's why there are different classes and not just a WaShaPal class.</div></div><hr />

Either it makes you too close to the warrior, or it makes the mob that much easier for a warrior to fight, and neither is desirable really (the latter in effect accomplishes nothing because everything will be balanced against that).<br />
<br />
Putting a minus attack on Aura of Hate that's on the same slot as say druid attack debuff wouldn't be a bad idea though, but if that actually does something, turn up the mana cost a bit too to compensate.  If a Knight has about 90% the tanking ability of an undisced Warrior, then debuffs should account for no more than a 5% increase in effectiveness, if even that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me put it like this, defensive is the most potent(not overpowered) ability in the game, It has not needed an update since kunark, the only thing that changed was being converted to the new system and having its mitigation lowered to take into account our 5% bonus<br />
<br />
It is potent because it gets as strong as the monster, and i mean that, no spell in the entire game is made to match every monster at every turn regardless of level, this is why it is useful in GoD, when it comes to spells you get the biggest baddest ones that are out and when the next expantion rolls around you put them in the back of your book and forget them.<br />
<br />
 if you didnt know they had planned to make GoD and OoW one expantion with a level raise to 70, but when they ran out of production time so they cut off the REAL endgame of GoD and lumped it into this new monster called omens of war, because of this paladins and shadowknights have NONE of the useful spells they were planned to have when fightning this encounter, no good self buffs, no good life taps, no stuns that were MENT TO BE THERE AND BE USED, the thing is if your fighting a rat, a PoT boss or a GoD motherfugger, it scales and matchs the encounter, it was the 1 thing that didnt get its abilitys casterated when they cut the expantion down the middle, it isnt our fault sony decided they would charge twice for the same damn expantion, and it isnt our fault your spells are not even in the game yet, take it up with sony and stop trying to bend us over, it is freaking wrong to screw us like this just to placate a few people who dont even know how these trials are really done, WITH SHORT TERM AVOIDANCE DISCPLINES AND PETS! <br />
<br />
Again, it IS not defensive, if it were then why was everyone saying the tank classes were closest to balance as they had ever been right before that steaming pile called GoD was put out?<br />
<br />
It is simple, GoD puts to much pressure on the player because its level increase and AAs were gutted to sell omens, when you have level 65's with 200 aa's doing content ment for level 70's with 300 aa's it will show each classes worst faults like a black light shows desert scorpians</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glatius: We both agree on what should make up the tanking difference, as it is though it doesn't (keep in mind I'm speaking from the perspective of an SK).  Sometimes spell changes should happen, sometimes melee changes should happen.  The thing is Warriors always want to make Knights more caster oriented, Necros/Clerics want to make us more Warrior oriented.  I see that as both classes being overprotective of their roles, so they want to push a semi similar class away.<br />
<br />
Some spells do scale, those are called stuns.  It's something Paladins have and SK's don't.  If you look through the SK spellbook you'll see absolutely nothing that scales - Nothing at all.  SK's need something that scales to content in order to keep pace with the other two classes.  Prior to the changes to GoD content a scaled down defensive disc like Frodlin suggested back then was warranted, since the changes to content.  At this time that change is not warranted however a melee change still is warranted (for atleast SK's), the more I've thought about this the more confident I am that it's the best fix for SK's although I'm questioning more and more if Paladins should get it as well (because they already have Divine an ability that scales to content) but a 2 tick 12 tick recycle 65% mitigation discipline would fix SK's problems (aside from the obscenely high DR on mobs) almost perfectly.  It would enhance offtanking allowing us to tank a mob before its debuffed far better, it would add to pulling ability, and it gives us a damage reducing ability that scales with content.  That change would do alot for SK's.<br />
<br />
Oh, Knights (either class) haven't recieved any enhancements to their melee abilities since the first day of Velious unless you want to count unlinking discs on a 72 minute recycle that we still rarely use as an enhancement.</div></div><hr />

I would disagree with 2 points in that. 1) Slow is the most potent power in the game. Bar none. Ahd is way overpowered. (This has been brought into balance, at least somewhat--by giving it to 3 classes and having some mobs that are either partially or comepletely immune to it. 2) Like slow, defensive is a game breaker.<br />

Spreading it out wil make things easier as it does with slow.</div></div><hr />

Hybrids (funny how Knights always always hide Rangers in the basement in case company might see them) didn't receive the Phase 1 Update, that's true. As SoE noted when it released the Phase 1 Update, pure melee needed an improvement to offset an imbalance. These chamges needed because casters (you got included for most of these) had been getting a steady stream of improvements.<br />
<br />
Not only were pure melee supposed to get these changes, a Phase 2 Update was planned (but eventually scapped) to INCREASE the groupability of pure melee.<br />
<br />
In order to insure Knights get experiance groups, the Wariror survivability advantage has to be taken away. That's how they &quot;fixed&quot; Sewers, Tipt, Vxed, etc. - they made certain Defensive was not an advantage. Just like in more trivial content, where Defensive is not an advantage either, spellbooks still are.<br />
<br />
It was this inequity that the Phase 2 Update was intended to address.<br />
<br />
So, you are technically correct, Knights didn't receive a tanking improvement. It is a little misleading to omit it was because Knights had an imbalance in their favor that SoE corrected. You don't balance a scale by adding weight to the side that weighs more.<br />
<br />
However, Knights received new equipment AND spells. Good enough spells and equipment that those who receive them can tank pretty well indeed.<br />
<br />
Yes, thanks to Defensive, Warriors can get by with deficient equipment. It's this that has traditionally allowed guilds to take on mobs for the first time. Five+ Warriors ready to hit Defensive and taunt while standing on their predecessor's corpse in the MT rotation.<br />
<br />
But you know all of this. You know Knights didn't get the Phase 1 Melee Update and why. You know that Wariors have had Defensive for 4 years and what it does.<br />
<br />
Your contribution was to say it makes some Knights envious that Warriors have this 3 minutes of glory and Knights get a spellbook. Yes sir, Knight may be able to addtank, better equipped Knights can offtank, and exceptional Knights can be in the MT rotation. That's how it's set up and meant to be.<br />
<br />
Knight base level tanking + spellbook does not and should not = Warrior tanking. You lose some tanking as a cost of versatility. That's been long said by Verrant and SoE and yet you omit it.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, being acceptable in a normal experiance group, getting mandatory individual flags and having a raid role that includes tanking but not generally raid boss MTing doesn't require that you tank like a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Warirors gear up to do their job too. Knights can cast spells naked. Knights are just annoyed they don't have Defensive AND a spellbook. It's apparent in every line you wrote.<br />

<br />
None of this means that Knights shouldn't get a 10-20 second autoparry (Paladin) or autoreposte (SK) ability, tanking adequate to give them a role in raids, and spellbooks giving them a compelling reason to be in raids rather than a superior pure tank - a Warrior.<br />
<br />
IMO is is class differences that should be strengthened rather than attempt to minimize them until we arrive at four tanks with only different titles to distinguish them. Knights with spellbooks so weak they don't bother memming spells and Wariors with no disciplines worth engaging.<br />

That line alone tells me you dont know Braels background, I suggest you go read some posts other than the ones he makes here before you go throwing bricks at one of the cornerstone individuals in the SK community.  And again, the duration on your autoparry is flawed, that brings us to be slightly better ranger clones in the mitigation disc department, try 30-45 seconds.

I'll admit that stuns do scale.  When they land.  All mobs aren't vulnerable to them, but those that are give Paladins a significant edge over a Shadow Knight or even a Warrior.<br />

Here is where we begin to disagree.  You seem to think that because Paladins are granted a scalable spell that you should get a scalable melee ability that mimics defensive to a great degree.  I don't.  And 2 ticks of 65% mitigation with a 12 tick recycle time?  IIRC a tick in EQ is six seconds?  Correct me if I'm wrong.  But 12 seconds of 65% &quot;defensive&quot;?  And then just over 6 minutes to refresh?  I'm not really sure what that would do for Shadow Knights, in as much I don't know many battles that last 12 seconds or less.</div></div><hr />

Mimics defensive?  Slightly at best.  Lets not go into the problems it would cause with the duration when it drops off before refresh, healers would have a field day with that on any boss mob that is non trivial.  Three minutes vs not even 20 seconds is not going to make anyone think about putting a shadowknight in front of a boss mob for anything.  Lets not even go to the furious/defensive/stonewall advantages in comparison either, dosent even come close.  <br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what that would do for Shadow Knights, in as much I don't know many battles that last 12 seconds or less. <br />
<br />
Exactly, thats why its a perfect scaleable ability that is tailored to pure offtanking with little to no MT useage other than severe &quot;oh shit, were fucked now&quot; situations.  Not to mention the air it would put into the lungs of the long dead corpse that is shadowknight pulling.<br />
<br />
<br />
You already have problems with stun, I can only imagine the amount of &quot;Sk's suck!&quot; outhouse posts that would result from us getting anything comparable to paladin stun thats spell based, other than possibly Fear2.</div></div><hr />

I'm well aware of Brael's background.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there are three competing &quot;visions&quot; of what the four tank classes should be:<br />
<br />
1. Knights are an advanced class. In concert with their spellbooks they should be able to exceed a Warrior at the same equipment progression level and have greater flexability. Warriors are simple fighters. At the very most, the best equipped Warriors may be allowed to MT a raid boss mob as sort of a guild pet just to throw them a bone. They should have to share this priviledge.<br />
<br />
2. EQ is not D&amp;D 3rd. Edition. Warriors become Warlords - virtual gods as tanks vs. brutal (high DI mobs) and that until these mobs become trivial or unless they are intentionally designed to be Knight preferred Knights never share the Warrior role - unmatched survivability vs. brutal (high DI mobs) without substantially better equipment. Other melee classes including hybrids have a different role which may or may not include tanking in raids. Pets, non-melee, melee, and Warriors can and do perform a tanking function in experiance groups.<br />
<br />
3. There should be three equal tanks able to achieve the same ends by different means. Two have spellbooks and one has (or should have) &quot;special&quot; attacks or AA fueled infrequent abilities.<br />
<br />
Many Knights seem to be attracted to #'s 1 and 3. Unfortunately for them EverQuest is and has been #2 for a very long time. Since #1 or 3 is their goal, every comment made by these Knights is an effort to make EQ into EverKnight and make these alternative games seem logical and reasonable.<br />
And again, the duration on your autoparry is flawed, that brings us to be slightly better ranger clones in the mitigation disc department, try 30-45 seconds.<br />
You are Rangers. They are Warrior/Druid hybrids, SK's are Warrior/Necro hybrids, and Paladins are Warrior/Cleric hybrids. The fact that your spellbooks are different does not suggest that the more powerful casters should also have the greater Warrior base level tanking and more powerful &quot;burst mitigation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let's just agree that in principle Knights should get some kind of short term &quot;burst mitigation&quot; that is consistant with and supports their traditional roles without comparing it to a Warrior defining class ability. Simple justice and actual need in established roles - not &quot;closing the gap&quot; with Warriors as the compelling reasons.<br />

How many groups do you know that fight two mobs back to back (remember defensive isn't on 24/7, it lasts 3 minutes and has a 10 minute total refresh time) and then have 10 minutes of down time?  Not a whole lot.  In your average experience group defensive doesn't mean jack.  It's only when you're pulling something particularly hard that it starts to have an impact.  And it really has it's greatest impact when going up against high DI boss mobs.<br />
<br />
So this perception you seem to have of Warriors firing off defensive on every mob and out tanking the crap out of Knights as a result just doesn't exist.  If a Warrior is grossly undergeard for the content he's going to get raped by everything he comes across.  The group is going to have to work extra hard to keep him standing, or they're going to have to use gimp approaches like using a charmed pet against everything except the boss.<br />
<br />
And most of this has been addressed!  Content mods have gone in.  The content should be more reasonable for an &quot;appropriately&quot; geared tank.You are arguing a point I never made.  I know damn well defensive isn't &quot;always on&quot;.  This is what I mean about sidestepping the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the question you have to ask yourself, is not whether or not you need defensive, but whether or not you're &quot;appropriately&quot; geared for the content you want to tank.  The odds are very good that you aren't.  And you're not alone.  A LOT of people aren't appropriately geared to be tanking in GoD, Warriors included.  The only real advantage a Warrior has is that for one mob or maybe two, within a three minute period, they really tanks well.   Otherwise an undergeared Warrior is getting raped every step of the way just like an undergeared Knight.The question you have to ask is whether you'd rather have someone tanking who is arguably more efficient against the trash but runs a very real risk of dying against the named (a time-geared knight), or whether you'd rather work a little harder against the trash knowing you'll have a vastly reduced risk of dying against the named (a pre-time and even pre-elemental warrior).  Keep in mind the point is to kill the named, not just get there.<br />
<br />
With an &quot;equally&quot; geared warrior and knight, the warrior will take 10-15% less damage overall, and has a 1200+hp buffer on top of that.  This is a comfortable and noticeable difference; ask your clerics.  What is the trade-off for taking the knight instead of the warrior?  Stuns?  A weak mana-tap?  Neither of these make a bit of difference against the named.<br />
<br />
With a superior-geared knight, such that they'd take 10-15% less damage overall than a warrior and have a 1200hp edge, what level of gear would that put the warrior at?  Full VT?  Maybe early-elemental?  There is a very real trade-off for taking the warrior over the knight, when they can hit furious + defensive and reasonably take on the named that would give the much better-geared knight trouble.<br />
<br />
I'm well aware that you don't see this as a problem, but a great many knights do.</div></div><hr />

In a previous post I stated my support for a brief &quot;burst mitigation&quot; abiltiy for Knights. Brael's specific suggestion is not that different. Frankly, I think it's close enough to almost on the money. BUT, it's not really needed anymore so it should be IMO not a major boost.<br />
<br />
What I object to it's Knights who insist that they haven't gotten upgrades since Velious, that Knights have to be equipped 1-2 progress levels better than Warriors to perform their role, and that somehow atrophied spellbooks mean Knights have to tank more like Warriors.<br />
<br />
Argue that major spell-lines like stuns and fear are not sufficiently effective, lifetaps don't heal enough, spears are always resisted, that the DPS Knight doesn't do enough DPS, that the Knight Priest's heals suck, that the content features too many ordinary yardtrash high DI mobs and I'll join your protests.<br />
<br />
Complain Knights never get upgrades, that Warriors tank too good against brutal mobs (our class defining ability) or that a Warrior without Defensive engaged is vastly superior to a Knight casting spells and tanking experiance mobs or normal adds and no Warrior in his right mind will support you.<br />

I couldnt tell you, my guild has 9 warriors, I never see the assist list.  Posts like that dont help you look any less than someone whos purely against there being 3 tank classes instead of one.  Your unwillingness to even try to make suggestions instead of a cheap shot attempt to turn this another sk vs warrior flamewar dosent help much either.</div></div><hr />

Then what can you not MT in a group or addtank in a raid without a disc that you believe you should be able to manage?<br />
<br />
Plate btw came into use when narrow headed arrows capable or piercing chain replaced broadhead arrows. Chain is not intrinssically worse than plate when not mounted. Check to see what happend to to flower of French nobility when they wore plate instead of chain when dismounted - they died almost to a man. <br />

<br />
Most of us concluded in an older thread that the different in damage taken was more like 7-8%.  I'm not sure if that hit point edge is right or not.  Top geared tanks were down to about a 300 hit point difference before GoD.  Add 500 hps if the warrior has spent 60 AA pts to max out sturdiness and you've got an 800 hp difference at the top end.<br />
<br />
But anyway, your pre elem tank is never going to get to the Tipt boss now unless a stupid overpowered, gimp ass charm pet does the tanking.  Nerf charm here and stop making the yard trash have such ridiculously high dps.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the point still stands that vs other hybrids that arent supposed to even tank, we dont have a burst mitigation ability.  As much as you dont want us having a defensive clone, I dont want to have a weaponshield or furious clone, I want a unique spell or disc for my class, to differenciate myself from every other hybrid, its that simple.  This isnt just about GoD, or PoP, or whatever content era you want to look at, put me in whatever expansion you want, other hybrids have a migtigation ability, I do not, thats a fact.  So far, there has not been one creditable reason why other hybrids have these discs, and we do not.<br />
<br />
And if youve read my first few posts here at TSW, youll see that I dont get xp groups either, I log on to raid, then log off, theres no point in me sitting for 4 hours lfg only to get picked up in a shitty group, mediocre xp, when I could easily be owning noobs and having alot more fun in UT2K4.</div></div><hr />

Giving us spell tools to improve our tanking ability would severely overpower us.  As I said before, we'd have to be lifetapping for 3k, procing 1.5k heals, nuking for 5k, etc.  Any spell that doesn't directly impact a mob's rate of attack or damage output by a percentage amount based on the mob does not scale, and will not be a solution.  Stuns, slows, and defensive fall into this category.  Lifetaps, heals, nukes, etc. do not.<br />
<br />
There are only two paths forward to make content that is a challenge to both warriors and knights:  Continue disabling defensive on more and more encounters, or give knights a form of defensive.</div></div><hr />

I hope SoE developers are more inventive in their approach.  Saying there are only 2 possible options is so rediculous it's worth debating - there are countless options - it just depends how much effort you want to put into it.<br />
<br />
By the way, I put the &quot;only 2 paths&quot; statement in the same category as the warriors that stated the only way to balance warriors 6 months ago was to either give us agro like equivalent to knights or reduce knight agro.  SoE did neither - instead they came up with a better, completely different approach.</div></div><hr />

SoE did neither - instead they came up with a better, completely different approach.You're right, &quot;only two&quot; options isn't entirely correct.  There are other things they could do, but they've demonstrated repeatedly that they'll take the path of least resistance rather than try to come up with something innovative that actually requires work.<br />
<br />
What IS correct though is that right now warriors have the only way in game to reduce the max damage of a mob (I'm talking about per hit, not over any particular time period), based on a percentage value of the mob's DI, other than the Vie line of spells which can be cast on anyone (and so are no more of an advantage for knights than they are for warriors).  As long as this ability exists and is only held by warriors, future content must either take this ability into account and selectively disable it whenever the developers deem knights should be given a break and be allowed to tank, or some method must be implemented to allow knights to accomplish a similar, but weaker effect.<br />
<br />
Slow, stun, and any amount of avoidance &lt; 100% only reduces the odds of the tank taking a max damage round.  Defensive is the only way to actually actually reduce the max possible damage a tank will take in one round (again, not counting Vie, which can be cast on anyone).<br />
<br />
It is possible to implement a knight-only spell-based solution that lowers a mob's max damage per hit, as we can see with the Vie line of spells.  It is also possible to balance such a spell so that it is overall less effective than warrior Defensive so as not to make knights preferred for raid bosses.  Being a spell, it will automatically have several inherent drawbacks that make it less attractive than a discipline to begin with.  Of course, this type of spell has already been proposed and warriors are strongly opposed to it as well.<br />
<br />
It is clear that it is not that warriors want us to be balanced by our spellcasting ability, they just simply don't want us to come any closer to their tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

Forgive me for my ignorance but I was under the impression that the trials where you have to clear trash to get to the boss mob had been modified so that defensive was no longer useful.  That in fact it now comes down to a strict comparison of Warrior innate tanking advantage (that 5-12%) plus furious, versus Knight tanking and their spell books.  If this is true, what more do you want?  Warriors to have furious negated and to take a 12% tanking handicap into the encounter?</div></div><hr />

Kindly show me anything from Class Descriptions, stats, skill caps, AA abilities, and disciplines that show Rangers aren't a tank. Just wearing Plate doesn't do it or Clerics would be tanks. Wearing Palte and being primarily a melee doesn't do it or Bards would be tanks (or are they??).<br />
<br />
The test is the ability to grab aggro (a Taunt button is a big hint here) and survive the beating. It's a role with characteristics theat are commonly found in classes that perform that role, not Warrior, Paladin, and SK.<br />
<br />
The best you can claim is that Rangers aren't a Plate Tank - they pass every other test.<br />

Personally, I don't think it was a good change, and does nothing to address the use of avoidance disciplines and charmed pets.  However, this is not the only place where there is an imbalance.  It's just the place that drew the most attention because these trials are required (were, in the case of Ikkinz) for progression.  I don't want to see anything taken away from warriors, and I think this sets a bad precedent for future content.</div></div><hr />

It's fair to say SoE intends Rangers to be offensive melee and light tanks.<br />
<br />
It's also fair to say some Knights are adament that Rangers aren't tanks, shouldn't have a group tank role, and shouldn't be able to add tanks in raids. As medium tanks, some Knights deny light tanks exist or that Warriors have long been recognized (heavy) Primary Tanks.<br />
