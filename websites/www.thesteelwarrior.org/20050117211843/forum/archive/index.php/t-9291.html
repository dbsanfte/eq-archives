<br />
This however requires me finding 3 augments :<br />
<br />
- Ground Murkglinder Eyes (I have heard MPG not confirmed)<br />
- Ore of Stone Strength (Riftseekers, Lower floor, Named Griplan near Feratha)<br />
- Flamshield Stone (Unable to locate this one)<br />
<br />
I've seen many people with these augments on other server.<br />
But mine is deserted, and people want to farm the 70hp.<br />
There are at most 1-3 groups in rift (none at primetime, only outside raids)<br />
<br />
So i'm having a hard time convincing groups to just &quot;move around&quot;<br />
specially since the 70hp camp is almost always open.<br />
<br />
Would anyone with these 2 augments mind sharing some info ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Its between the two.  The Blind Hunter spawned for us 3 times in 4 hours and the Taskfiend didn't spawn for us at all.  Hunter dropped 1 AC aug (gratz cleric) and two of the earrings (gratz me and shadow knight) so atleast the SK got something out of it.  This was just a pick up group I put together.  The map I have has the two mobs marked.  Plus, you can pull lightning guys to get lightning cores, which sell pretty well on TT.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info on the Perfected Companion btw.  Took a guild group there last night and camped it for a couple hours.

During a primals raid a cleric won the random against me, thinking it was a joke I looted the blessed shard. Cleric wasn't happy but I probably would've given it up to him anyhow, I guess thinking it was a joke saved me 30ac =p</div></div><hr />

be prepared to be charmed, as there are multiple versions of him.  Have first buff slot open (empty) for &quot;Pyrilen Charm&quot; (and everyone else in your group), so it can easily be dispelled by others in your group.  <br />

The other option is resist buff up, I resisted the charm every time at 493MR. (The charm is -350 resist)<br />

I have seen one bow and 9 AC augs so far. In that time have also seen 8 bracers and 2 orbs. Didn't really keep track of the runes, hehe.</div></div><hr />

But yes you can RC charm, at least PC type charms, cant confirm for this particular charm, but if a mob casts Dictate on you, for example, you can cure it with RC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That gives: <br />
2x Ears - 70hp<br />
Neck - fill in<br />
Face - fill in<br />
Head - 20ac<br />
2xFingers - 70hp<br />
Wrist - 25ac<br />
Arms - 20ac<br />
Hands - 20ac<br />
Shoulders - fill in<br />
BP - 25ac<br />
Back - Fill in<br />
Waist - fill in<br />
Legs - 25ac<br />
Feet - 20ac<br />
Ranged - fill in<br />
<br />
<br />
6 slots that you should worry about, and then camp in RS.<br />
<br />
Best for those 6 slots:<br />
30ac Blessed Shard<br />
20ac KT<br />
20ac KT<br />
3xHP augs (txevu, Anguish if you can, Qvic....)<br />
<br />
Dont bother with the 10ac or 40hp LDoN augs anymore, boys and girls!  There's a new aug source in town, and it's Riftseeker's!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">65 HP augs from Companion Prefect for Waist, SHoulders, Back, Neck as well so the only slots you can't fill in RS are face and range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, but if available I'd take 20ac over 65 for sure, so the 65hp aren't the best choices for those slots... Considering I already have all my 10ac augs for the same slots as those 65hp augs I most likely wouldn't bother with the 65hp. I know this can be very different for others, but I feel like I am lacking AC more than HP right now, and would therefore favor the AC augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really though, if you don't use any raid augs, and you have all type 8 slot items, I think you're gonna end up with two of the 65 hp augs since there are only 4 20AC augs (MPG, 2xKT, Yxtta) and you have 6 slots not filled by the other augs.</div></div><hr />

Even in a BYOG situation, which is almost 100% of the time for me, the named is always being camped.

I have all my LDoN AC and HP filled. All the FS from RSS filled and all dropped AC augs (minus token) which is my current profile, tried switching around (Alt profile:Riftseekers) and I came out 40 ac higher and 200 hp better off. Looks like Rss + a few dropped AC augs is really nice and is the way to be, broke down like this:<br />
<br />
2x Ears - 70hp<br />
Neck - 20 ac KT<br />
Face - 20 ac KT<br />
Head - 20ac<br />
2xFingers - 70hp<br />
Wrist - 25ac<br />
Arms - 20ac<br />
Hands - 20ac<br />
Shoulders - 10 ac LDoN or 65 Hp RS or  Qvic, Kelekdrix, Uqua, Tacvi, Anguish etc<br />
BP - 25ac<br />
Back - 30 ac Yxtta<br />
Waist - 20 ac MPG BH aug<br />
Legs - 25ac<br />
Feet - 20ac<br />
Ranged - 90hp Qvic or Kelekdrix, Uqua, Tacvi, Anguish etc<br />
<br />
Of course that's if you are an AC person, if HP sub the 20 ac Ore's and KT/Yxtta/MPG augs for Rss and LDoN/Raid hp augs.<br />
<br />
Nice list Daabu gonna be aiming for this stuff now.</div></div><hr />

ac20 x8 (kt x2, yxtta, mpg, rs x4)<br />
ac30 x1 (yxtta)<br />
ac25 x4 (rs)<br />
<br />
13 out of 18 slots. <br />
<br />
you can use the ac15 x2 from ferubi if you still have any type 7 gear left.<br />

so that leaves you 3 to 5 slots left for hps. 90hp jewel of focus, bic aug, 70hp augs from rs, etc.<br />

AC augs in every slot? I can't believe you're aiming for 15ac augs instead of a few shielding augs for example, let alone a dodge3 TSed aug or some of the Anguish ones. Ok, so maybe the Anguish ones may be beyond some of you, but 50 raw ac vs. 4% shielding and dodge3 isn't even a contest IMO<br />
<br />
AC was the 'fashion' back in nToV days, then HP came into fashion for a few years, and now AC is what all the 'cool kids' wear. My advice is to stick to a more balanced approach and you'll be a better tank in the long run.</div></div><hr />

And I will go after anything with shielding, or improved whatever, but at the moment I don't have to use an aug slot for it. But I can swap em out when needed.<br />
<br />
Pure AC is foolish, like those ac30 earring from UP that have no hps. But all the gear we find these days have hps. Its not so easy to find ac along with it. So plan well and watch for gear with modifiers like shielding, avoidance, improved dodge/parry/riposte, etc.<br />

Ok, so maybe the Anguish ones may be beyond some of you, but 50 raw ac vs. 4% shielding and dodge3 isn't even a contest IMO<br />
<br />
AC was the 'fashion' back in nToV days, then HP came into fashion for a few years, and now AC is what all the 'cool kids' wear. My advice is to stick to a more balanced approach and you'll be a better tank in the long run.<br />

I'd have to agree with Demor on that one, mixture for the win!</div></div><hr />

The TS aug's that are worth a damn are insanly rare and/or expensive to make, in the same time you could of gotten 30-50 aa from Rss and several slots worth of AC augs, and not of pissed your friends off by dragging them to group restricting zones (Ikkinz) for a chance at a 2% shielding aug that doesn't drop a whole lot.<br />
<br />
When I get to Anguish and the aug's flow, hell yeah i'll change the AC out, until then I'd rather take the AC, the AA and the groups in Rss.</div></div><hr />

Gimme a break lol. I can guarentee that there are more 2% shielding augs on every single server than there are 30ac augs.<br />
<br />
As for TS augs, they're impossible to camp. All the componants drop randomly off any mob in OoW. I have no clue where you came up with the arbitrary value of 30-50 aa</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah there is more 2% shielding on every server, because every guild that progressed past KT needed to do the 3 trials at least once, also because it's a 1 group instance which droped great other loot at the time of GoD vs a 3 day spawn that takes a raid (well 3 groupish). Yeah of course theres gonna be more of them.<br />
<br />
On the TS thing, alot of the componants come from the lower part of OOW, so not off any mob, stones are the only thing I beleive comes from any mob and getting a GOOD stone to aug Dodge 3 onto i.e 40hp, is going to take one hell of a long time to get unless you get very lucky, so yeah in the time you get the aug you could probably do upward 30aa in Rss.<br />
<br />
The problem with your post is you put down people who choose all AC, give some good advice then insult them again. I'll agree with you a mix is better but getting a mix is alot harder than getting full AC the way the exp zones with augs are situated atm.</div></div><hr />

I'm comparing it directly to augs such as the 30ac Primals aug, or the 20ac Yxxta aug. You can't accept those as part of a potential AC setup, yet dismiss 2% shielding from Ikkinz2 as unrealistic.<br />

Wrong. ALL the TS aug componants are random off any mob in OoW. I've personally seen discordant scoriae drop in Anguish, NC, and Sewers, and Sphalenite drop in RSS and Hollows. Dust of Discord and Trean Flies have dropped in just about every zone I've been in. As I said, they're impossible to farm.<br />
<br />
Anyone in this forum who wants to farm with a friend or two instead of exp, should be able to get 100kpp+ in an afternoon without breaking a sweat anyway, so you just have to wait for them to pop up in bazaar and buy them.</div></div><hr />
