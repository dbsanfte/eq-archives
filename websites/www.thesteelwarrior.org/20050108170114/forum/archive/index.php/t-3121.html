I have been a lurker here for quite sometime and I thank everyone for their contribution as over the 4 years Ive been playing SW has been the best resource for me.<br />
<br />
Now that thats behind me..<br />
<br />
This morning I picked up a new all/all weapon. I do not remember the name &quot; Orb of knowledge or something&quot; 1hb Stats are 20/28 +stats adds 45hps etc. Effect Frost Shock 320 DD. Primary only<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info on this item or have used it a lot? I just bought it like 4 hours ago for 35k, so I dont have any in game knowledge how it holds up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
parse that puppy out and post some results :D i'm sure a bunch of us might be curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maemai</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cant offhand it. its only primary. I Off hand CHoS for this setup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic.  I saw this weapon in the bazaar at a good price and immediately told my monk friend.  We both were interested in it, and since I was short on cash, we agreed that he would buy it and, if he didn't like it, I'd buy it from him a little later.  <br />
<br />
He was using a Staff of Flowing Water (42/34 + stats) at the time.  After he used the orb for a few fights, he said he's definitely keeping it for a while.  He mentioned seeing it proc as many as 8 times one fight, every time for the full 320 damage.  <br />
<br />
So good news for my friend, bad news for me. =P  Guess I'll just have to watch for more of these - apparently they're not all that rare in the high level adventures.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maemai</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a cute weapon! I just need something different the the Bloodsworn and CHoS combo. I hope it was worth the 35k I spent on it</div></div><hr />

Shikarii if ya ask Achzizra she got one while we were hunting in Miragul. proc seams to work nicely from what ive seen other people using (yep monks with ingenuity ... well its good for a laugh)<br />
atm it sells for 30 to 50k on TT, but it Miraguls so if ya want one head over to Everfrost.</div></div><hr />
