Did VI do something to his loot table? /boggle.  Getting kinda tired of this Moktor bp at 65 :( <br />

Boots = A bit less common<br />
Earring = Rare (thank god caus it sucks)<br />
<br />
Maybe just a bad streak.<br />
<br />
Out of ... 40+ ? or so total Vindic Kill in my life if seen <br />
25i+BP, 15+ Boot, 1 Earring<br />
<br />
I have seen statue with 4 BP (yes not a joke). And with 4 Reaver.<br />
It happens ) just keep killing him. Its easy &amp; fast.<br />
<br />
Btw : Get 1 BP for EVERY PLATE CLASS.<br />
The resist will make a huge difference later in the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's not a bad idea tho nia; shammys+vindi BP = good thing :D<br />
bards usually second because their quested BP kinda blows.<br />
<br />
but keep at him. definately worth the effort to whack him as often as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry, it won't take too long to get a lot of bp's.  The only good thing to be said about that earring though, is that it's rare.  We've killed vindi many many times, and only seen it once.  Bp's are extremely common, and boots are common enough to outfit a guild nicely.  Don't forget that he also can drop Sleepers Tomb keys, but they are almost as rare as the earring, we've only seen 2.  As for who loots the bp, it's a wonderful bp for almost all classes listed (clerics don't seem to be a big fan of it), and really any who would wear should get one... heh, personally I wish it was all chain class usable since it's good enough that it would be worn by many a rogue and ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">should never complain about boots, they are a good drop for many classes, it ultimately means less farm time on vindi as you will eventually see the BP more than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tov bps -&gt; clerics<br />
vindi bps -&gt; everyone else<br />
<br />
Like Ludor said, after 20-30 kills you will be praying for boot drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With an 8hr repop and a chance to drop a Sleeper key, you will have BPs coming out of your ears soon enough. Just make it a point to hit him every time you have a raid force on and you will gear up the entire guild in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cleave</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About what is the ratio for ST keys?  Only numbers I've heard was a rough 1 out of 9.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">key off vindicator is low enough its not worth killing him for just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah usually the BP goes to a shammy cause it is a good combo.<br />
<br />
Not really sure why a bard gets it but i see nothing wrong with it.</div></div><hr />
