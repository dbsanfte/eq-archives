<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about taking the discs, unhooking their timers so that they operate independently (save combinations like defensive and evasive), and instead of having the outdated command line interface for discs, take the unused spell gem bar for pure melee, and allow the placement of 8 disciplines in the spell gems. These gems would refresh when that discipline is available for use again. Also, disciplines could be coded to block each other discipline, so that no two could be active at once. A &quot;cool-down&quot; period could be coded, much like spell refresh gems are now, so that no discipline could be activated immediately after another had worn off.<br />
<br />
This would not only allow more use of disciplines, it would make it easier to see when the disciplines are available, easier to activate a wider variety of them, as well as opening up macro slots.<br />
<br />
If they re-coded the disc commands into spells with instant cast times, it would allow disciplines to be modified and balanced as easily as spells are today, and would also allow them to add new toys, in the form of disciplines, in each expansion, just as new toys in the form of spells are given to casters, each expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be some amount of time (even if only 30 seconds) between using different discs. Being able to follow furious immediately with defensive would be incredibly powerful in raid situations, and make tank switches 100% trivial when combined with AE taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was one of my favorite &quot;recent&quot; discussions on PON.  Unlinking /discs has a lot of merrit yet it needs to be used with caution.  Somethings like Evasive and Defensive for sure need to be &quot;linked&quot; to each other as well as other double combos.  But in general unlinking /discs would add some great raw potential to Warrior Melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see it as a big deal, Gimmel. As it is,  you get the same thing by having a DA pally run in, warrior runs in after, hits defensive, hits taunt, hits AE taunt if taunt fails and away they go with the cheal rot established.<br />
<br />
warrior towarror switches aren't tough at all if your healing crew is at all good... I can't remember when my healing team actually failed to keep me alive till the cheal rotation was re established. spam/fast/LoH heals are great for that.  So I don't see how it would be overpowering at all. It's pretty easy to begin with, with a good healing crew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, while it's a good idea, we would need to be careful on how it's done.  Being able to use def, then evasive, then furious, then fortitude in a row would be much too powerful (I know thats not what was suggested, but just an example of what could happen if not done carefully).  Evasive and Def have to be connected, unless you put in at least a 3 min reuse between all.  With similar discs linked, then a smaller primary reuse could be used.  Primarily I'd like Evasive / Defensive / Precise / Agressive linked, but with a reuse similar to what defensives reuse is atm.  And then the short length discs linked too, with a reuse close to that of defs current one.  But, have both semi linked to the point that you couldn't use one after another, maybe 30 seconds or 1 minute between when you could use one type from another.  Also, I think all classes that use disciplines should have theirs set up similarly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea of using the spell gems and essentially making disciplines insta cast mana-free spells.  Putting a recast timer of 30 seconds or 60 seconds shouldn't be difficult, especially since such a thing is already in the game for mana classes.  Even without that, just unhooking the timers would be wonderful.  I'm almost giddy at the thought of actually using my offensive disciplines.  Not too giddy as I have little confidence in SoE, but I like the concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">defensive/evasive would be a good link, on its present timer.<br />
<br />
I think precise/agressive would be a good link too, on a 10 min timer.<br />
<br />
rest of them should be separate, imo... same 10 minute timer due to the short duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly what is the point of having the DA pally run in in your scenario? They can't attack or cast a spell, and a DAed person has next to zero aggo as long as they are DAed. But even if there was a point, it still requires teamwork and interdependence, and I think that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
Tank switches are not horribly difficult, if, as you say, you have a &quot;good healing crew&quot;. But this would make tank switches trivial, even with a crappy healing crew. Furious + Fortitude gives a way to build large amounts of aggro and not take any damge for 17 seconds, and then immediatley pop defensive. I think that's a little over the top.<br />
<br />
I don't think a 30 second &quot;cool down&quot; period would be a big deal, and wouldn't touch the current raiding dynamic much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point to the DA pally is to run in before everyone else, get the aggro, position the mob, while the clerics set up and get the cheal rot going on the MT... MT gets aggro just a few seconds before the first cheal lands.<br />
<br />
That scenario's good to use when you want to position the hard hitting, immue to slow or slow mitigating mob, and the cheal rot has a few second delay in getting started due to movement immediately prior to engaging the mob.<br />
<br />
Pally can still keep enough aggro with DA that as long as noone goes near the mob or generates aggro via bard song, heal, debuff, etc etc etc, that it works well.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm against the 30 second cool down between discs, but that's because I like the idea and don't see it being overpowering. A case can be made for needing that cool down period, tho... it's not really a big deal either way... the main thing is getting it to work that way to begin with, the rest is details and balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always was of the opinion, that offense/defense need linked...<br />
<br />
I dont think so Anymore. My general solution, is to make ALL disciplines create a Buff Icon, that lasts 4 minutes, this icon goes in the song box. make it so that no other 'disc' can be used as long as this buff is here. all discs would also have a reset time, thieir current timer..<br />
<br />
With all of the upgrades and all the power that casters have.<br />
This is in no way overpoering, in relation to what i see casters.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOE..<br />
<br />
Throw us a bone.<br />
<br />
The disciplines on the spell gems, has always been what I thought was the best approach. command line is just old and stupid. Like the people who insist on running command line OS's instead of a GUI interface, what benefit at all is there to the command line? Oh, you can put it in a hot key.. you can do the EXACT same with a spellgem, you can make a macro, you can do exact same with a spellgem. YOU need to type /disc to see how long you need to wait... no need with a spellgem, because it AUTO refreshes and its VISIBLE...<br />
<br />
Spellgems are easilly the BEST available option for fixxing Disciplines. <br />
<br />
Give us a...  Book Of Stategy &amp;  Tactics (ie. spell book).. <br />
<br />
this would make adding NEW discipline/tactics/strategies for melee So much easier to implement. SOE has admitted thru Absor, its a lot easier to fix spells/add spells than to fix a whole class... Lets make it easier to fix warriors.<br />
<br />
Now people are gonna BITCH, PISS and MOAN... if I wanted a spellbook, I would have created a Paladin...<br />
<br />
WELL GUESS WHAT.. YOU ALREADY HAVE A DAMN SPELL BOOK with frickin DISCIPLINES, they JUST are 100x harder to use, and less intuitive than spells. <br />
<br />
Yeah Warriors take the brunt of the beating in fights, but just because we are masochistic, doesnt mean we need to be sadistic, and do EVERYTHING the hard way....<br />
<br />
Immagine how much easier this would be to make new disciplines? something I am sure every warrior has at least thought about or theorized.. &quot;Boy it would be nice to do this...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to have some kind of reuse timer in there.  Otherwise someone could chain invulnerability, riposte, defensive and evasive in to a huge chain.  Go in on a mob immune to melee, position it, flip riposte and build up sick aggro, then hit evasive or defensive by which point the first CHs have probably already started landing and you haven't even been hit yet.  Wow, that sounds nice.  No way SoE would let that fly though.  Reuse timers cut down on the absolutely sick possibilities though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Hyardgune <br />

 <br />
My general solution, is to make ALL disciplines create a Buff Icon, that lasts 4 minutes, this icon goes in the song box, this icon similar to the Complete Heal icon from the Kunark BP. make it so that no other 'disc' can be used as long as this buff is here. all discs would also have a seperate unique reset time, thier current timer..<br />
<br />
the way this would work is, you can ONLY do a single disc every 4 minutes, and each specific disc would still have their own specific reuse timer.<br />
<br />
so at best you could <br />
Start fight...<br />
Disc defensive from start to 3 minute mark...( reuse time 6 minutes)<br />
 3 min to 4 minute.. no discs available while buff icon is up..<br />
Disc Evasive from  4 minute to 7 minute mark......( reuse time 6 minutes)<br />
<br />
 7 minute to 8 minute.. no disc available..<br />
<br />
at 8 minute mark, can disc again, but defensive is not available until the 9 minute mark..<br />
<br />
The buff icon times and the reuse times, etc, can all easilly be adjusted this way, so fine tuning of the system would be easier and faster.. This would also allow for faster implementation of new melee concepts and easier use by new players as well as making it more intuitive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if we had to limit it, gimmel's idea is the best, with the 30 second cooldown.<br />
<br />
the 4 minutes would kinda suck for fellstrike/charge/riposte/furious and the like, since the only last several seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that possible already under the current discipline use if someone has made hotkeys and using the timer feature?<br />
<br />
However on the topic spoken about, I like the idea. For warriors only that is. However I seriously think that would be but the first thing needed to do to assist with the warrior aggro situation. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zinj</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Along with the lines as discs on spell gems, why not impliment the mana bar for melee classes and have disc use up portions of this bar just like casting a spell.  In fact make it almost exactly like casting spells in the sense of recast times and stacking.. Granted they pretty much makes any class who uses that a spell casting class but hey we need something to do with all those unused mana bonuses on items.  As mentioned earlier it would be a snap to add new discs since that is the only way an classes gets improvements as whole anymore, through spells.<br />
<br />
Twas a  nice pipedream since nothing will be done in any way shape or form anywho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That has been kicked around too.  Make Stamina (yeah that other bar that appears to do nothing ^_^) mean something.  If you want to pop 5 moves in a row and you have the Stamina then knock yourself out.<br />
<br />
The original problem was that /discs didn't have this concept.  Without some other cost the only mechanism they could use was reset time and hence the screwed up system everyone hates now.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what is the point of having the DA pally run in in your scenario? They can't attack or cast a spell, and a DAed person has next to zero aggo as long as they are DAed. But even if there was a point, it still requires teamwork and interdependence, and I think that's a good thing. <br />
<br />
I can think of a number of examples where DA pulling is advantageous.  In some cases, having a FD class pull all them mobs, regardless if he has 10,000HPs, they cant out live all the godsmacks, dots, snares,  and 1k+ Harm Touches (ie bertox ring), thus have a DA class pull them to yous and eat all the HTs / nukes / dots for the pullers (you know they die all too much).  Usually though the DA dude gets burried as some mobs still summon even while DAd, and all that initial agro when running in is hard to get rid of, unless you can FD.  I guess you as a cleric will just have to a run to a room full of high level mobs (DA first) and find out on your own just exactly how mad you made the mobs.</div></div><hr />

There are other ways of restraining discs... open your mind up some...<br />
Warriors seem to be used to being this bad for far too long.<br />
<br />
-Unlinking discs is needed... ALL discs... not just offensive or defensive....<br />
<br />
-Discs retain their timer(after being tweaked) for themselves only.<br />
Not allowing a chain of the same disc.<br />
<br />
-Only one disc can be in use at one given time. duh<br />
<br />
-New improved Stamina bar comes into play(after removing the Zing line of spells).<br />
Using certain discs costs a certain amount of your stamina.<br />
<br />
-Give a new skill linked with Stamina, and offering aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've already made a post about this a bit before....<br />
It's even possible making it so Defensive/Evasive discs stay the way they were before, for not overpowered or underpowered reuse on fights like Xegony or other long lasting fights.<br />
<br />
<br />
It gives us an edge in dps AND tanking (give up dps and great aggro for nonstop defensive/evasive - suitable for unslowed mobs)<br />
It allows for future easy upgrading... disciplines almost use the same system as spells.<br />
It does NOT step on Hybrid toes... leaving them where they are, but bringing us up to where we belong. (Yes, paladins liked this idea as well... heard none of them hating it for unbalance)<br />
<br />
Disciplines finally mean something,<br />
you get to be good in damage if not tanking, or in tanking if not dealing damage. <br />
<br />
SOE said they wanted to change disciplines...<br />
there was a rumor about a new skill using &quot;juice&quot; being in the works....<br />
<br />
Hoping this is the idea SOE is working on,<br />
don't see how anyone wouldn't be happy with it.<br />
<br />
And no... it's not overpowering... not only it becomes very easy to tweak in case of existing overpower...<br />
but our most important discs already have a &quot;handicap&quot; implemented... so even if you could use it more often, you'de still suffer from that handicap.<br />
Except this time, without a retarded timer, rendering the disciplien sad and hateable.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Ummm, Why would you need to remove the Zing line of spells?<br />
<br />
Canni, Twitch, Bard songs, KEI, MOD RODS... All these either give mana regen or INSTA mana to casters... Why should our Discs Be ANY different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">zing gives you back full stamina at a tiny cost...<br />
it was put in when all stamina did was let you jump and maybe make you hit more/harder or something....<br />
it was basically to avoid a tiny handicap.<br />
<br />
With the new system, stamina would control your disc...<br />
with zing, it would simply remove the very reason of having a stamina/willpower bar sort of thing...<br />
<br />
What use would mana have? if you could refill it almost instantly at a low cost?</div></div><hr />

Would be like giving us spells and mana, but make ALL KEI spells uncastable on us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just make it regen stamina alot slower than mana.<br />
<br />
Because if we can't get it cast on us at all, than that kinda makes the tradeskilling (yes, some of us do) a bit harder. although the tradeskills are the least of our concerns. :)</div></div><hr />

Ohh the days...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axantur</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not really partial to this idea.  I'm sorry, I just don't like it.  Maybe I'm being silly just because it makes pure melee look like bards.  I have this nagging feeling that ultimately it would degenerate to that.  &quot;Dude!  Start twisting defensive and evasive!&quot;  I have real trouble imagining our ogre tanks dancing the mobs to death, although that would certainly be fatal.  The other nagging complaint is that bards have, in the past, had severe problems whenever spellcasting is manipulated by the devs.  They get treated like some special case stepchild, and their songs are always broken once or twice with every little tweak the devs make...for days.  I really don't want to see you guys in that boat...which you would be, if you weren't actual casters using spell gems, with all that common code implied, but rather some special case like bards.<br />
<br />
While re-using all that pre-extant UI real-estate is tempting, when i think about it, the one right thing is for melee to have its own part of the UI that casters find useless.  The opposite of the spellbook.  The opposite of the mana bar.  The opposite of the specialization skill.<br />
<br />
Because in addition to my nagging qualms above, I don't really think that a spellbook and spell gems really lends itself well to describing someone's mastery of combat.  You should not be limited to 8 choices, just because there are 8 gems, and to change them you have to sit down and read a book?  That is if you ever got more than 8 choices, which by level 65 you really should.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine Jackie Chan asking the bad guys to wait 5 minutes while he reads a book to remember how to kick their asses?<br />
<br />
So, this is the part where I should probably give an alternative.<br />
<br />
I have a humble idea (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=583.topic) of how I would attack the question of how to make pure melee scalably extensible with expansions, and give them more than one trick.  In effect, to give melee depth.<br />
<br />
In the link above, I outline a few ideas on a base system that would allow for SOE to produce new and different skills for each class with each expansion if they choose to, similarly to spells.  In which pure melee get an ability to excercise these skills, under a time limitation imposed by a statistic you can influence through equipment (unlike disciplines or /shield today), and have that ability augmented by items, and buffs...similarly to mana bars.  And an over-arching skill that, when finally in an environment where a warrior can choose wether to be better at one thing more than another, he can do so.  Similarly to specialization.<br />
<br />
This, to my way of thinking, is the Right Thing (tm), even if SOE will never devote the development time to it.<br />
<br />
Even if you aren't interested in the Right Thing (tm), but rather the Thing You Can Get From SOE Easily (tm), I hope I have at least given you a different direction from which different new ideas can be launched.  Because I don't think spellgems are it.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see something like that maybe for a new class ( a battlemage, with no spell but only stances) but I dont want to learn how to play my class at level 65 with already 2 years of game behind me. <br />
<br />
althought a new class will include new balance issues :p. but a stance based class will be cool, just like bard are differents, that would really be something original.</div></div><hr />
