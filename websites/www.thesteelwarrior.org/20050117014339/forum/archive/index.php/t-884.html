<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azon</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now ive been reading up on the GoT, and im pretty impressed.  Ive never really stuck with 2h weapons, as ive always thought 2 1h weapons will get more aggro.  I currently have a wavecrasher and either a frostbringer, or sarnak warhammer in offhand.  The sarnak warrhammer has a stun on it also, and im getting a new haste belt, or cloak, whichever is available for a good price.  Now im 54 and will be 55 soon.  Which should I get.  Im usually the MT in pick up groups, and if I stop taunting they will have aggro, is the GoT the way to go?</div></div><hr />

Previously I was weilding 2x Vengeful Honed Blade of Ykesha, which I loved. They put my frostbringer to shame. I can say I truely enjoy my GSoT and now the Yaks are going to the Bazaar. Almost the same proc, but there is definately an aggro diff. I didnt eat riposte on PoV mobs either. I give it a thumbs up and am glad I sold my Windblade. <br />

I am now having second thoughts on the Epic Redblade, because I honestly dont want to take my guild through hell just to get a status symbol, and I dont see myself dualwielding Tier 2+ unless I got SoD and BoC, both way out of reach atm. May have to sell my Red and Greenscale for a CoF + other slots, and MQ my Hand of Maestro to a guildie. I like the GSoT that much. Take of it what you will, but I bagged what I considered good taunters for this weapon.</div></div><hr />
