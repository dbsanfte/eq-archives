<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing anarchy online a lot lately, getting very fed up on eq and will probably not play much from now on.<br />
<br />
In anarchy the closest to a warrior i guess is the enforcer, at 21(max level is now 220) self buffed i have close to 1100hp(and my equipment sucks), but with levels these guys can get tons of hp, using perks(i see them as ao's version of aa's) i can add 9950hp and if you look at this (http://aodb.info/showitem.asp?AOID=223113) hp buff it is very nice, shurely it slows your movement to a crawl but then if you need that much hp i bet you won't run around a lot either way, say tanking a boss.<br />
<br />
Now the perks and that buff alone adds 26k hp on top of the 10k+ hp the enforcer allready has, as it is now the poor docs(clerics of ao)get very bad aggro for ch usually ending up dead since nothing can taunt the mob of em, and with this kind of hp 2 or 3 &quot;complete&quot; heals are needed, and these can be insta cast but think there is a small recast time.<br />
<br />
Would love to see my ogre war with that kind of hp :) then a druid can heal me versus the time boss :)<br />
<br />
Guess a buff like this would give warriors a nice hp advantage over hybrids :) but then might trivialize many encounters <br />
:D</div></div><hr />

crats are a bit out of the loop now with shadowlands, crowdcontrol more or less requires new nanos(spells) and the new ones are bugged :) crat board is filled with bad vibes not many happy posts right now.<br />
<br />
Tried to root a low level mob(max i seen him is 12 lowest lvl 9)with my lvl 35 nano-tech(wizard), he resisted every attempt :mad:<br />
shadowlands have introduced mobs a heck of a lot tougher so a green con in sl is not the same as a green one in the old world, got killed by 3 light green ones, mostly because killing one took forever since they have a lot of hp.<br />
<br />
I have heard 2-4k hits from some mobs :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well missions are a big part of the game i guess, but it's always nice to be able to get going without spending 2 hours lfg, i do missions, kill dyna bosses for phat lewt :) ahh well maybe not but good xp, exploring shadowlands and doing quests for various stuff in sl, also working on tradeskills and i have fun for now, eq is just *bleh* right now.<br />
<br />
Not shure when you quit but you also have the condemned subway dungeon, temple of three winds and name slips me right now some high level dungeon that is fairly new.</div></div><hr />
