<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=9001">New Titles - How do you earn them?</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razorback - BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Took a look at the new titles available to me (hit Shift-T to bring them up if you haven't already done so).  Some are easy to figure out, like a new title for 100, 200, and 250 skill ranks you have in a trade.  Others, well.. I have no idea what I did to earn them.  One in particular that I liked and chose, Oppressor, would love to know what I did to get it.  I suspect it has something to do with PoP AA points (I have almost 300 AA spent, and only 45 of that is from GoD, 5 from OoW).  Also have heard that every class gets titles for 1.0 epics, presumably the later two as well.  <br />
<br />
  So, thought I'd start a thread detailing when people notice when new titles become available and what they did when it popped up.<br />
<br />
***EDIT***  Added the list of titles available to me at lvl 66, not including tradeskill titles.  Some are pretty obvious, others have me wondering why *we* have them.<br />
<br />
Baron<br />
Dirge<br />
Duke<br />
Lord<br />
Marauder<br />
Marshall<br />
Master<br />
Myrmidon<br />
Oppressor<br />
Overlord<br />
Veteran<br />
Warlord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe the title Oppressor is 24 AAs in class category.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rtfm ;)<br />
<br />
Its all explained in the manual that you would have downloaded with the OoW patch - have a look for .pdf files in your EQ directory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Razorback - BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You mean they actually put useful information in the manual?  Damn..   :P  Will have to actually look at the thing then, see what it has to say on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What is the Epic 1.0 Title?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is the Epic 1.0 Title?<br />
<br />
Champioin supposedly but I have my epic and no champion title, I use Duke so people will group me thinking I'm a pally. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Razorback - BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't have that title and I do have my epic.. Maybe I need to dig it out of the bank for it to realize I have it.  But that was NOT listed in the PDF file.  May be others that are hiding out there too.  Bet there's titles for epc 1.5 and 2.0 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't have champion on my list, and have epic too.<br />
<br />
I never did the hand-ins to get rid of scarab, and have epic augmentable either, so maybe it is looking for that version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caelidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did the turn-ins to get the augmentable epics, dug them outa the bank, equiped them, and still no Champion option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nothing for hitting 70 either, which is kind of dissapointing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Read the manual?!<br />
What an absurd idea.<br />
Next thing people will be telling me to stop at service stations to ask directions when I'm driving around lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have 3 characters with epics and 2 of them had them equipped at the time OoW was installed.  My 65 Druid has the title Naturewalker, which isn't in the manual so I assume that's the epic title.  My 51 Rogue only has the title option of Swashbuckler and tradeskill stuff, so I assume that's the epic title also since he has no AAs.  Maybe it's a one-time thing and you needed to have it equipped when OoW came out.  My warrior is like everyone else in the thread and had his epic in the bank and no title options other than the ones listed in the manual and tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is a thread on the SoE forums, one of the SoE Comunity halflings (Ash) said they were looking into the Warrior and Monk epic title seems it looks like it's looking for the wrong item to check the availability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've had my epic in the bank for years and I have the title.</div></div><hr />
