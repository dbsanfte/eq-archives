<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I cant find any of the old guides that had all the different trials detailed out.<br />
<br />
I want to get a bunch of people flagged for 7th hammer to help out some epic monks, but I cant find the infoz on google, safehouse or here.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if a guide was kept anywhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Don't look for a guide, just get 5 guys and steam roll it.  POJ trials should be no problem these days, you should have a lot of fun figuring them all out.</div></div><hr />

I hear you, but I think I get one night of doing this and I am trying to roll through as many people as humanly possible.<br />
<br />
I have a total of 7 nights while my wife and baby are gone to play.<br />
<br />
A couple of those will be taken up by poker and visiting friends.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I have the luxury of screwing this up, especially considering I havent played in months and I am going to be asking lots of people i USED to know to come help.<br />
<br />
I would rather just do my homework. Even knowing what to do , I still gotta execute :) (no pun intended)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They're all easy at 66+, all revolve around killing 4 waves of 4 spawns then a boss. <br />
<br />
Flame kill mobs before they hit center pillar, you get hit with svf ae's at various stages of the event<br />
Lashing kill mobs that spawn spirits, kill spirits to despawn lasher<br />
Stoning kill mobs that run through doors, archers will fire at prisoners and you<br />
Exe, self explained, kill kill kill<br />
Torture, run to centre room with the prisoners, kill all mobs + banshee at end each wave<br />
Suffocation kill spirits of suffocation as they spawn or prisoners die. Kill SoS, normal mob, SoS, normal mob.<br />
<br />
I did them all last night, not knowing much other then exe in 2 hours including a couple fails from not knowing what to do, in a 2/4 boxed group with only 3 real sources of dps. (War rng wiz enc sha clr). It was easy.</div></div><hr />
