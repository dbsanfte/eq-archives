<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">when you use the group or two to face those certain mobs which one would you guys say is harder. cuz if we do that one then we can easily do the other. or our they equal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have done BoB with 4: warrior(58), cleric(60), rogue(60) x2<br />
<br />
Have done Draconic with 2: warrior (60), Druid(60)<br />
<br />
Most important thing in both is the pull.  Either a druid for Harmony or cleric / enchanter for pacification and you're set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there both in WW right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah...<br />

Draconic Pauldrons is really easy.  Zone into WW, veer left coming out of the tunnel and theres 2 big rocks on the ice.  2 NPCs at each who are KoS to CoV (no faction hits on them tho).  I've never been to WW and not seen them up, and I had a tracking mule in there for the scout for a long time, so either they aren't farmed overly or they have a quick respawn time.<br />
<br />
The first 2 NPCs are a cleric and a warrior (may be a paladin, can't remember).  Single pulled both can be duo'd with a druid.  <br />
<br />
Next rock has a erudite wizzy and a barbarian beastlord.  Both pretty easy though the wizzy nukes for over 1k so he was by far the nastiest when I did it.  Single pull them with harmony / pacification again.  Root the BL's pet so you dont have to worry about it.<br />
<br />
BoB quest is triggered by Scout Charisa.  She spawns above and behind the mouth of the cave that you zone into.  Something like a 12hr spawn and she hangs around for a while after the quest has been completed so check her hand - if shes holding a bag then the quest has been done and she won't trigger it again until she has despawned and respawned again.<br />
<br />
After you hand her the scout tools to trigger the quest a giant captain and a bunch of giants spawn further round to the left from where the draconic pauldron mercenaries are.  The captain has a fair few hps and hits reasonable hard (400ish I think), but hes not too scary DPS wise compared to PoP stuff.  Don't think hes slowable but then Ive never done him with a slower there so Im not 100% sure on this.<br />
<br />
Harmony / Pacify his guards and then pull him.  Last time I did this I used my druid twink (lvl 45ish) to harmony (of nature) the guards and then pull him to where one of the other ppl in the group tagged him and kited while I camped the druid and logged back to my warrior to tank.<br />
<br />
You can pull the captain all the way to the zone in (so all you see in the tunnel is his legs with his torso disappearing into the roof) that way any KoS to CoV ppl who come dont have to worry about wurms or wyverns adding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The part about the Captain's legs only being visible.<br />
<br />
If you pull him into the tunnel and push him into a wall or do the above, there is a chance he will warp under the world and start summoning your people and killing them.<br />
<br />
Just pull the captain out wide till he runs straight into the tunnel and make sure you dont melee push him into any walls :)<br />
