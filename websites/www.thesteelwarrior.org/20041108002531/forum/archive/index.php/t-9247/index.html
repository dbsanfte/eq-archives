The additional hate generated from using the new OoW Bellow was noticeable yet during raid clears to mobs with fast kills, I'm usually near 30%-40% endurance by the time we get to our target.  After Furi to get into position, and defen once in position, I've had defen drop early on more than one occasion since I've run out of endurance.  Some decent endurance regen AA's need to be implemented indeed.  I'm decently geared so I'm fairly confidant that my gear isn't the issue.<br />

I have HE3, before OoW my standing regen was 33 (23 when fighting), I'm 100% sure of it, and now it's 30 or 31, it seems it's not the same with each tick. Thought it was just me...</div></div><hr />

You know when GoD came out, I could swear I was running slower until I got the running AA's. I could swear I was regening slower then too. I remember hearing what I guess would have been called an urban legend, that when they intruduced new caps and AA's that the original caps and AA's were nerfed. How about casters/healers that never had many fizzles all of a sudden getting fizzles after getting AA's to reduce it, or healers getting aggro more often with aggro reducing AA's?</div></div><hr />

Endurance Regen since OoW release: bugged or nerfed?     <br />
 <br />
I bought Heightened Endurance 3 from GoD, with the recent ability to see your amount of endurance on the UI I saw it was 33 per tick when not fighting, 23 per tick when I'm fighting. Since OoW has come out it's less, it's 31 per tick when standing and 21 when fighting. Was endurance regen nerfed or is it bugged?<br />

I'm really getting sick of this bullshit.  Introduce a new expansion, then make the old cap the new cap and nerf everyone down to make it look like they're progressing.  It happened with PoP too, and I know for a fucking fact it happened with Stalwart Endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Herkimer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have 1 level of Endurance Regen AA.<br />
<br />
Before OOW I was getting 31/tick outside combat.<br />
<br />
I'm now getting 29.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I never actually checked my regen before OoW because I simply never ran out. Now with the new discs, one on a new timer and one on a rarely used timer (even if they are shite you use them sometimes, &quot;Just to see&quot;), I am running low regularly. Buffed I have c.5500 endurance and regen at 30/tick out of combat, 21 per tick in combat - with HE2. Those figures tie in with what everyone else is getting.<br />
<br />
Quite simpy it is not enough. Even without using the new discs in a fast exp group where you bellow regularly, stonewall often to save cleric mana and furious when that cleric falls asleep for a moment or two, endurance runs low or even completely out. Add in mobs with AE Endurance dots and it gets REALLY bad.<br />
<br />
Now I know that mana and endurance are not the same and maybe cannot be compared well but to a warrior the endurance pool is analogous to a mana pool and if the casters in my group can have 131/tick mana regen standing vs my 30/tick endurance regen when they have a similar pool to refresh - and indeed most of the time in that good group I'm at 21/tick... it doesn't seem right. Of course a caster without mana is just a punchbag whereas a warrior without endurance sill maintains much of his or her functionality.<br />
<br />
No, 131/tick would be very excessive but Sony needs to look at what a warrior might reasonably spend in Endurance every hour (cover all possible discs refreshing) and base our regen on that. Then the AA's that increase it will allow for a more generous use of discs in the same time. <br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
The reduction for fighting should be lower or there should be a bonus for sitting.<br />
Jumping should not cost endurance. I don't see that casters would be happy to pay 50 mana to jump.<br />
Running should have no penalty (if it does indeed have one as mentioned above). Mana regen for casters isn't hampered by it.<br />
Possibly... spells like Pot9 or Steeloak that contain both hp and mana regen components could have endurance regen components too. Or maybe Bard HP/Mana regen songs could. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't want to see endurance regen so high that you could just chain your discs every time they popped and Bellow every 30 seconds for ever but with the AA's and potentially with buffs, see above, it should be possible to use our discs generously rather than gratuitously and not run completely OOE!</div></div><hr />

Exactly the same here. <br />

After OoW we receive 2 less endurance a tic. I dont care if its intended, its WRONG. (Not to start on how wrong our new skills are, useless and expencive)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hm, maybe since endurance can be roughly assumed to be a form of energy or strength, maybe we can have tradeskilled food that restores Endurance? I'm sure that'll really sell, giving tradeskillers a chance to earn money while giving us the regen we need. It could come in the form of force feeding, or just an effect that works like the current stat foods that are currently available.<br />
<br />
I mean, there are stuff that directly modifies mana and HP, so why not endurance?</div></div><hr />

It is working as intended.  The reason they don't post it is that it's a fucking nerf, and they need to do that shit to make it look like you're progressing again.<br />
<br />
It happened with Stalwart endurance in PoP...I used to almost never get stunned all the way thru luclin, PoP came out, and I was getting stunned like mad.  I train SE3 now all of a sudden I'm back to never getting stunned again.<br />
<br />
My shaman fizzles level 51 and 58 spells that she uses constantly...seven and FOURTEEN levels lower than her.  Funny, don't remember fizzling that much until OoW came out and the level cap raised.  It's fucking ridiculous, it's fucking bullshit, but good luck EVER cornering anyone from SoE on it, because they're gonna deny it even if you ask them anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">well, if it's a nerf, they probably won't change it. But if they really think that no reduction has occured, they should look again.<br />
<br />
END regen is something I think they should really take a look at. They also ought to go through a review of END on gear, the possible role of an END regen disc, and END augments.<br />
<br />
At some level, obviously, warriors need to have to make a choice about what discs they can afford to use, or the game becomes less interesting. However, if regen/gear is such that effectively you only use the same very small number of discs in the same order, then in fact the warrior isn't having to make a choice anyway. Either extreme reduces any element of skill/thinking that might otherwise adhere to the system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The thing about endurance regen is that now with numbers showing crystal clear what your current endurance is and what it is 6 seconds from now, it's absolute reality.  <br />
<br />
At level 65 in Gates, Endurance regen was 31/tick standing with heightened Endurance 1.   This was based on the logical deduction and convluted mathematical principle of... standing, looking at yo endurance, watching it change, and going &quot;What's 5030 minus 5000?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Using the same advanced logical mechanics, at level 70, I use the exact same conditions, dont' ask me how I was able to match such difficult to manage conditions of.. not moving, there may be an NDA violation involved, but I was able to.<br />
<br />
This time, it was 29/tick, with heightened endurance 1.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that you're saying &quot;But Frodlin, how can you be SURE that 31 isn't the same as 29?&quot;, and I want to assure you, it's not.    <br />
<br />
I guess what I'm getting at is the implication that this is something that can be chortled at in the same vein as &quot;jboot nerfs&quot; and other subjective nonsense is that the default UI provides the numbers themselves.  Theres nothing subjective about seeing yourself regen endurance 2 points per tick slower than 5 levels earlier.   <br />
<br />
It doesnt' take hours long parses to see this, there's no fluctuations involved, I regen 2 points of endurance, or 6.2% more slowly than I did 5 levels ago.</div></div><hr />

100% agree - as of OoW, between my brothers bots and mine we've noticed that our shaman and cleric have fizzled spells a lot more. We've also experienced a lot less crits on nukes and healing. We're both maxed for those aa's up to OoW. I've noticed the same symptoms with past expansions.<br />

This is fine with Mastruq, it takes 275 endurance, so you need 27.5 endurance regen per tick to keep up with chaincasting it. At 33 endurance regen pre OoW I had no problem with that, I had room to throw out the occasional furious or fellstrike. With Bazu taking 350 endurance and me being mysteriously down to 31 regen per tick I simply have no room to do anything in a good group, I'm happy if I don't have a net endurance loss. Even with Fitness at 3 I would only have 34 per tick. And with mobs in Riftseeker's dealing out the damage they do I would very much enjoy having the room to use a defensive disc now and then. <br />

Although if they did have a clue we would be regening about 50 end a tick to go with our upgraded oow discs and abilities to balance the shit out.

This is fine with Mastruq, it takes 275 endurance, so you need 27.5 endurance regen per tick to keep up with chaincasting it.<br />
<br />
For chain pull exp, I think mob will die before your incite up<br />
so you might need 275/5=55 reg per tick to keep up the endurance<br />
and 1 more thing, fight will decrease the reg too</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I have alot of the same problems depending on what mobs are being killed. In a group where mobs die before Bazu wears off, and you have a chain puller bringing mobs to you, it is simply impossible to kill for a long period of time without running completely dry on Endurance.<br />
<br />
So, I usually adjust. I simply tag w/ arrow and taunt. Then I sit back and hope that proc aggro takes over lol. Generally, if I alternate this method and the arrow + Bazu, I can hold up endurance regen just fine until someone goes AFK, etc and I can regen to full or near full.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's much of a problem to have insufficient regen on endurance. Does it suck on raid clearing? Yes. But, generally a good guild will be clearing and killing faster than you can even Bellow at each mob anyways  ;) ...I'm lucky to get a Bazu Bellow in every 3rd mob or so.</div></div><hr />
