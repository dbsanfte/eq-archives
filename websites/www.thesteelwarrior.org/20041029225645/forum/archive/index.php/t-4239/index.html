<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aryl Paingiver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen on a site about LDoN ( cant remeber wich one) that the 1492 ap plate armor from Tak'hisz or however it is spelled has 2 slot #2 and 1 slot #3<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this or dose it have 1 slot 1,2,3 like most ofhter pieces?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pre-nerf armor still do have 2 slot2 and 1 slot3.<br />
<br />
The armor now has a 1 2 3 slot type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just curious, but what do slot numbers mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jobned</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it means nothing considering the mix up of slot and type. slot is only an indication of the amount of slots while type is the type of augment you can use to fill in the armor. <br />
<br />
whowever it has type 1, 2 and 3 now. <br />
<br />
Type 1 for this particular item is the junk slot where you fill in some crap loot from ldon. 6 sta or 6 mr or something similar. (since the 10 ac augments is only useable for neck waist, back, shoulder and face)<br />
<br />
type 2 is the one you put in the 40 hp augment. Pre nerf you could put in 2 x 40 hp in this one. <br />
<br />
type 3 is the effect one. vengeance, haste, see invisible, ultravision, enduring breath etc. (vengeance III would be a good option if considering farming the bp since there is a type 3 vengeance III augment for only 510 points in one of the camps) (haste would be nice for the helm since the haste augments are range, waist, back and helmet only)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you're looking at a cost vs effectivness ratio yes.  But, if you're looking at what can be upgraded, and what won't in a longer period of time (and what makes you more uber per slot)  nro all the way.  <br />
<br />
Don't listen to the folks that want you to settle for less stats and less hp per item.  <br />
<br />
one of the real gems from nro camp is the bacer piece if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hard to argue with the sleeves, either....  well, at least for me it was.  Slapped that type 2 +40 hp aug on them right away...loving it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Side Topic: I did an excel spreadsheet for 1492 vs 760...can't load here but I'll copy and paste as best I can:<br />
<br />
Deltas of Upgrading to 1492 over 760 by Slot (I didnt categorize resists very well please ignore):<br />
<br />
Head:  4 ac, 1 str, -4dex, 3sta, 6 agi, 15hp, +2 resist<br />
Legs: 4ac, 10 str, -8sta, 10 agi, 15hp <br />
Arms: 3 ac 1 sta, -5 dex, 15 hp, +2 resist <br />
Boots: 3 ac, -5str, 5sta, 1 agi, 15 hp 1 resist<br />
Bracer (x2): 3 ac 15 hp 5 str 4 sta<br />
Gauntlets: 3 ac 8 str, 1 sta, 1 agi, 15hp<br />
Breast Plate: 6 ac, 25hp, 13 sta, -10str, -9 dex, 3 resist<br />
<br />
Net:<br />
<br />
AC: +29<br />
HP: +120<br />
Sta: +23<br />
Dex: -18<br />
Agi: +18<br />
Str:  +12<br />
<br />
for (8*732) = 5856 additional points<br />
<br />
Question: If you could buy 1 additional piece of armor with these stats for that cost would you?<br />
<br />
Or would you rather spend those additional points actually outfitting the 760 gear (each piece needing roughly 2200 pts to finish off)?<br />
<br />
Other Side Note:<br />
<br />
Why the nerf so badly hurt the casual/non raiding player:<br />
<br />
Pre-nerf your difference would have been more like:<br />
<br />
AC: +29<br />
HP:  +440 (assume +40 mod in lost type 2 slot *8)<br />
Sta: +23<br />
Dex: -18<br />
Agi: +18<br />
Str:  +12<br />
<br />
for (8*732) = 5856 additional points<br />
<br />
A *completely* different calculus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Takish is the Best.<br />
Miragul has the best RvR.<br />
<br />
Remember a 60 foot Cruiser Yatch is a LOT more expensive that 40 foot + 50%.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the armor. <br />
IF you want the best of the best be ready to pay for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That and Takish is the only armor that is better than ornate for us. So you could end up wasting all those points in the 760 armor only to upgrade it with soem ornate later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was underwhelmed with most of the ornate. Sure, it's good stuff, but wasn't the Upgrade I was hoping for.  The &quot;true sight&quot; on the helm is especially embarassing.  And the &quot;regen 3&quot; on the gauntlets. Lovely.  I like the bracers and boots, and of course the BP.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Tak v Mir depends on how likely you are to fully equip yourself with either.  If you don't play enogh LDoN to get a full set of Mir in under 6 months, then it may be your best choice - a better benefit-over-time, if you will, than waiting forever to get Tak armor.  If you load up with Mir in 2 weeks, then maybe you should have bought Tak instead.<br />
<br />
I suspect the best choice is a mix of ornate, Mir, and Tak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tak no doubt, makes the difference between decent armor and ubber. If u dont have elemental access the only thinguie that get closer is ornate, and that cost 250K the mold. Nah just be patient and save 1492 points u wont regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aside from the BP you're basically paying 700 points for 15hps per item. That's 14 adventures per piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">700 points extra per tak item I should say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The thing you gotta remember is that augments cost points also. IMO, it is a waste to buy either armor and not put the hp augment in the type 2 slot. This being said, the Tak armor starts to look a lot better if you make your basis constant HP. <br />
<br />
Tak armor is 732 points more per piece for 15hp + ac + resists. <br />
<br />
However, you can put 25hp augment in the type 2 slot for 510 points as opposed to 1150 for the 40hp. By doing this both the Tak armor and Mir armor have equal HP with Tak armor having additional AC and resists.<br />
<br />
So now you have Tak armor with equal HP, and about 4ac and 6 resists more then Mir armor for only 92 extra points. Most people are willing to pay 510 points for 10ac at MMC, I don't see why you wouldn't pay 92 points for 4ac and 6 resists. <br />
<br />
Going this route also gives you the option to upgrade to the 40hp augment if you so desire down the road without buying a completely new piece of armor and augment. You simply lose the 510 point 25hp augment. <br />
<br />
Fynepisa<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm not saying that putting 25hp augment in the Tak armor is better than just putting the 40hp into the Tak armor, but I think if your plan is to buy Mir armor and then put 40hp into it, you are better off buying Tak armor and putting 25hp into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Fynepisa, interesting post.<br />
<br />
I did some spreadsheet work, and I find that the less often you STA is maxed, the better Tak armor is for you.  With full STA buffage, the Tak is nominally better, like &lt; 100HPs.<br />
<br />
This chart shows the differences in AC, STA,  unbuffed, and buffed HPs, assuming 6 HPs per STA.  For example, if you have Tak arms, you'll have either 21 or 15 more HPs that if you had Mir arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
                    (unbuffed)  (buffed)<br />
	AC	STA	HP 	  HP<br />
Arms	3	1	21	  15<br />
Legs	4	-8	-33	  15<br />
Feet	3	5	45	  15<br />
Bp	6	13	103	  25<br />
Wrist	3	4	39	  15<br />
Hands	3	1	21	  15<br />
Helm	4	3	33	  15<br />
<br />
<br />
First, the BP should always be Tak, Mir BP is lame to the point of looking broken.  The Tak legs also look broken to me.<br />
<br />
So it's kinda paradoxal.  The more casual you are (less buffed) the better the Really Expensive Tak armor is (except for legs).  Blah!<br />
<br />
In summary, excluding leg armor, if you run around unbuffed, your Tak armor will yield around 300 hps more than Mir armor.  If you're buffed to max STA, it is only about 115 more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Assuming someone wants to buy a full set of Tak armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yah, I should have my full set completed by around Christmas, 2009.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you're buffed to max STA, it is only about 115 more. <br />
<br />
Which is a fairly good assumption.  With shammie buffs you only need roughly 250sih to max 305.  Even folks with marginal bazaar equipment can hit that.<br />
<br />
I still submit that with the nerf there is very little reason to buy the 1492 armor...unless you can churn points like a fool....which of course most casual gamers can't...which of course defeats the whole idea of LDoN.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line: it was an idiotic nerf.  There is small incentive to buy the &quot;best&quot; armor now.</div></div><hr />
