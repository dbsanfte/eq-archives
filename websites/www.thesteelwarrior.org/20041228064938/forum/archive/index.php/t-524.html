At low lvl doesnt really mater if your weapon is good or not as long as you taunt you keep aggro fairly well.<br />
So just look up in bazaar the 2hs weapons for sale in your price range and buy the fastest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Work up your 2hb as well.  If you don't, you are gonna regret it.  Best advice I ever got was to work on all my skills.  Currently I have 3 weapons on me:<br />
<br />
Shovel of the Harvest 50/43 2hb (free food and good dps when I am stealing aggro off the MT with the TSBS)<br />
<br />
Twisted Steel Bastard Sword 53/45 2hs (good dps and tanking weapon)<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder 31/30 2hb stun proc (ok dps, sick tanking weapon)<br />
<br />
If I ever get lucky enough to get the Greatstaff of the Four Winds off Auliffe (41/31 2hb) I'll bank the TSBS and have an entirely 2hb weapon set.  Considering that when I first started I figured I'd never even use 2hb, I'm kinda glad I worked up the skill.<br />
<br />
I don't even bother with one handers since my guild is a long, long way from AoW or the Ssra named.  I have max skill in all 5 melee skills though.<br />
<br />
Good 2hb weapons are the Sarnak Battlehammer (30/40 War only) for like 100pp.  Tae Ew War Maul (33/36 level 51 required) usually under 2k.  Poison Wind Censor is another I think, although I can't remember stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that sounds like a plan, my guild lets me tag along to ME even tho im a little low for it i can get my practice in there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't agree more, keep ALL of your weapons skills maxed. I have seen that here time and again and I always tried to take that advice. I always carried around extra weapons - Walrus tooth (easy to get fast 1hp), BABS, shovel, etc. But for some reason I always neglected 2hb while keeping all of my other skills maxed. Maybe it was the lack of really good 2hb, who knows. At any rate, I realized how big of a mistake I had made when I got my grubby hands ons a Greatstaff of Thunder. My skill was 34 when I got it. Luckily the thing is fast so I was able to use it to get my skill up relatively quickly, skill is up to 205 now after a solid 4 or 5 hours weilding it.<br />
<br />
Nothing worse than getting a trully awesome weapon and not having the skill to weild it effectively.</div></div><hr />

I currently have that and a centi hammer when I want to go all out 1hb (usually to kill a casting mob, blunt weapons seem to disrupt casting more, may just be all in my head like all those voices)<br />
