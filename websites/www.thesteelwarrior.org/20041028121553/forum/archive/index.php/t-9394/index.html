What weapons should I be looking to move into?<br />

Have about 900 EF LDoN points - going for Hate aug.  Also have a little over 1000 BB Ldon points, and about 800 N Ro points (Going for the Royal Attendant BP).<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What's your budget?<br />
<br />
Your weapons are fine until you can get much more expensive ones or CHSD, GBoS, BoC, etc.<br />
<br />
1000 (+20) BB points =  2 10ac augs, get em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you're on exactly the right track with hate augs and the BP. The BP is a much cheaper way to get AC &amp; hps than the augs (until of course you get the BP, heh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hofbrau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you get over a certain number of wins at a specific camp, then you can use points from any other camp to make purchases.<br />
<br />
I believe that number is 29 wins at a camp.  I know I am grinding wins in Tak so I can then use my other points to pick up a few pieces of Royal Attendent.<br />
<br />
The tough part will be dragging people to the Guk LDoN for the Ykesha Augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After getting the Anger III and the N Ro BP, I was thinking of using the BB Points for either the N Ro Legs, or the EF Legs.  Was also thinking about camping BoT for the Ornate Bracer molds.  Also am going to start doing Guk LDoNs for the Ykesha aug.  <br />
<br />
With OoW out, and leveling up to 70 now available, I'm wondering if it's better to level, or do AA's: have 19 AA's and I could start working on Area Taunt instead of leveling... just not sure which is the better course to take right now.<br />
<br />
Also have about 55 K in the bank, and can generate about 1k per day, so if it's worth just buying ornate molds, I can do that.  I can generate money by a combo of farming and buy low/sell high, but I'd rather play than be an accountant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gave the profile a once over.  Here are a few suggestions that popped into my head that are not ldon merchant armors:<br />
<br />
Neck- Amulet of Mummy wrappings, Shell Inlaid Collar, Serpentine Necklace.  All are droppable and shouldn't cost too much in the bazaar.<br />
Ears- Mosquito Leg Earrings or Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement.  Both are good ears, if you feel like camping one (Mos. Leg) or paying good plat for the other.<br />
Face- I'd reccomend picking up a Mask of Frozen Mana (dropped from EF ldons) or a Mask of Flourishing Fungus (dropped in Guk ldons) and moving your 10ac augment on to that.  You won't lose any AC and you'll gain some HPs.<br />
Finger- Replace your Flesh Eater's Ring with another Valorium one.<br />
Shoulders- You could go to Plane of Mischeif and camp a Grand Pauldron of Study with 2 or 3 partners.  I have one in my profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stonewood Compound Bow would be a nice upgrade too.</div></div><hr />

If you can find one, I would recommend either a Blazing Eye Skull Mask, dropped in CoD off of the Carpin Cycle or an Amy Mask.  The first has better AC but about 20 HP less, and the second has less AC but more HP.  Both would be much better upgrades from the previous two.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but the two that were mention can be obtained for free or 1k at the most. The CoD and Amy mask can be quite expensive.</div></div><hr />

The two masks mentioned by Kiya can go for 5k-8k each on drinal....... maybe they are in higher demand here but unless he can get the drops on the first two, they're gonna cost him some cash anyway.<br />
<br />
If you can manage to get a group in WoS for a while and take some named down...... it's possible to get a rune drop and sell it in the bazaar for 50-100k depending on the server.  Then just use that cash for upgrades.  Besides, our 66-68 discs are either crap or non-existant.</div></div><hr />
