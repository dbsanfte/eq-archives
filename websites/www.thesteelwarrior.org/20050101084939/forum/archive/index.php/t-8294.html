<br />
At 40, I beleive I had a mix of Trooper Scale, probably some Imbued Cabilis Armor, and around the 40's or 50's started picking up Champions and the stuff from Icewell Keep- Frosted something or other? Royal Frosted Velium?<br />
<br />
Your stats don't seem bad, where are you fighting? I'm fairly certain it's against harder stuff then I leveled up on, did a lot of time in Guk and SolB, a few trips to DL.<br />
<br />
For weapons, I don't rightly recall, I might have had a wurmslayer, but or that might have been a little later, I also played around with Lamantetion and Jade Mace, but again that might have been a little later. <br />
<br />
By getting beat, not sure what you mean, you feel you require too many heals? I can't imagine a blue con to a 40 eating 2k hp faster then a cleric can heal?</div></div><hr />

<br />
armor is the bane of every tank. just keep looking for stuff with more hp and ac and you will eventual get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarg</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need more info on what you're fighting and where. It makes no sense if all you are saying is that you are getting beat on...that what warriors do...get beat on...<br />
<br />
Go find a sarnak warhammer or a silken whip of ensnaring - when I was a young warrior way back they served me well. Use your taunt, kick, and disarm skill fro agro. I know kick sucks but it is much better once you hit 55. I never had agro problems much and I grew up well before warriors were given all these new agro discs. Don't mash taunt, you need to use it with skill. I'm drunk...that's all I can manage to say right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">40s are the worst stretch for a warrior, but it will get easier by the mid to late 50s. you really just have to stick it out. 40 is about where you really need a group to advance further unless you're a solo class. sounds like your better equipped than i was at 40. i couldnt/didnt leave kunark until about 45 so my gear mostly consisted of trooper scale with random filler slots from droga, CoM and the like. <br />
<br />
the armor out now should be alot better, considering i couldnt even wear half of it and the bazzar makes it easily accessable as well as cheap for the casual person. what you want to look for are fast weapons (around 20 delay), or heavy weapons that'll do a lot of damage on the first swing (wurmslayer). that combined with your provoke ability should be decent at holding agro. luckly, tash and slows wont be big agro until around lvl 50, by then you should look into getting a weapon with an agro proc like copper hammer, sword of the bloodsword or reinforced sandstone-hilt sword. the yak you have is a good start, but most people now will have weapons with a much better damage/delay and will simply take agro from you by putting out more damage. <br />
<br />
armor, as mentioned before, you should just surf the bazaar and look for what you can afford or work up the cash any way you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 You have good gear forr your level and every otther warrior out there (except supertwinks) have the same problems that you are having. When I was your level I had just finished my Trooperscale breastplate and was using weapons from Dhalnirs :(  <br />
<br />
We Iksar warriors are a dying breed  Which in the Highend makes us more unique then the droves of Halfelffy Innky swarms that infest the 65's <br />

It gets better and it gets funner <br />

Used more or less full PoHate ikky armor and a lammy + venomus axe of the velium brood. Dont recall having many problems with aggro or being able to survive there.<br />
<br />
The planes were hard tho, at 55. Hang in there, search the bazaar and you'll get there :)<br />

All warriors around your level are having the same problem as you are ( Well, most atleast. ) You are decently equipped for your level, I am a 65 iksar warrior now and back then I had crap for gear. Just push on and it will get better. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are probably playing with alot of people's twinks rather than other players appropriately geared for your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rakul Dragoman</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One item that you might look in to getting in order to help hold agro is the Pride of the Legion.  It is the Iksar Warrior weapon quest final item.  The quests as a whole isnt that hard, only hard part i would say is camping in droga.  If you have a few high lvl friends that can help you camp the area there it would be a piece of cake.  The item itself is pretty good, can be used as a weapon or as armor, 15 ac and 75 hp might help you out a bit.<br />
<br />
The good thing about the weapon is that it procs a stun and 100 dd.  This should help get agro.  Think the stun affects up to lvl 61 mobs, but not to sure.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29722 <br />
<br />
As for armor, once you get to lvl 46 you might wanna think about going up to pohate and farming the Legionnaire armor from there.  These pieces are a bit better than the gothic armors and imo they look better.  The Legionnaire armors are random drops up there so you could just zone up with a cleric + slower and camp the zone in.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/searchdb.html?iname=legionnaire+scale <br />
<br />
Hope this helps ya out, and hang in there.  Iksar Warriors are a rare breed in the upper levels.  I always get a kick when people mistake me for a shadow knight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing I would do if I were you and something I did do. Is look up everything you can. Read the boards daily. Learn all you can.  The more you know the better a warrior you will be. I am an Iksar warrior and the MT/ST for my guild not becuase of my HP or AA's but becuase I have know how and the ability to react faster than most. Dont get lost in watching your dammage or typing too much. Watch your groups health. Watch the push get it off the wall make shure its back is to your group members. Rogues will love you for this.  The more you know and the better you handle things in a group the more often people will be sending you tells to group with them. Even if your lacking in the HP.<br />
  Make a magelo for us bro. I do not know what gear your talking about. When I was in your lvl I used the etched velium My wepons were Cinti short sword and the sarnak backstabber. I also used the velium ax of the brood thingy for the proc. Your haste is good. If you can get a group to go to the small town like thing in Droga you can camp the named that is in the safe room. He drops a dagger and a nice haste belt.  LDON's are probably a good way to get some upgrades. Everfrost has cheap but still good upgrades. Takish has the best plate armor.<br />
  Are you in a guild? Where are they in content? Also like everybody said your 40's are rough. I lvl'd in Sol B. Great XP and only mobs that have alot of HP are the spiders. Plus as an iksar you dont have to be shrunk in caves  :D <br />
  Like I said tho the main thing you can do is learn all you can and the gear will come.</div></div><hr />
