<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Dark Elf</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So today I am sitting around and talking to a warrior in the top guild on my server. He tells me I should get the shieldblock aa and use a shield when tanking on raids. Then he told me that in general he feels 2h weapons are better than dual wielding with the proper aa.. <br />
<br />
Was just curious if any others agreed with this or not. Qvic / Riftseekers is where my guild spends most of its time if that matters.</div></div><hr />

If you hold aggro with a shield, by all means use one. It's gonna improve your survivability (especially with shield block), no two ways about it. <br />
<br />
If it means your clerics or nukers start dieing, the tradeoff isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainingvodka</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it all depends on what you have to wield opposite the shield and your aggro generation in light of that.  the other night I had a pretty sorry group in WoS (assassin camp). Where before I'd never had a problem tanking that camp, this group was on the verge of wiping constantly =(  I threw my loyalist shield of honor up and replaced my backslot with a shroud of the fallen defender to nudge every AC and such I could...<br />
<br />
still never lost aggro.  I mainhand a BF + A3.  <br />
<br />
For raids...works a lil different cuz MT will have a few seconds on furious to generate high aggro.  IMO, if you have a proc mod wpn with hate, like the BF...go for it with a shield and try it out...personally I've never ben MT to anything hornery enough to worry about needing a shield...<br />
<br />
if it doesn't work out eh...never gonna know till u try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on the crew you're tanking for.Obviously,less aggro can be made to work.It just depends on whether it's a good trade off for you.Less aggro and a little more mitigation.I don't use them for raiding,rather have wizards nuking harder hehe.Lotsa luck involved with this though.I remember a DBOTW/SOS shield war on a named in p5 tanking until about 80 pct when I engaged with my BOW.I'm often busy playing rl/gl and don't always engage these days cause typing is like enough challenge for me hehe. :) Anyways. my BOW was a3 augged then still and I was MAX MELEE.I mean really max,like edge of outa range msg.Tank was corner tanking with mob on his head.At about 50 pct the mob turned and started wumpin on me.Yeah proc luck.Imo shields suck.Similiar things have happened since I started raiding.MT's using shields have often had aggro problems.They can be made to work,but, they mitigate warrior aggro a lot.I can see a good bet made for them if you were low on healing AND dps running a close endurance fight.Generally. the differance between keeping me up with a shield or with a weapon offhanded is much smaller than the differance in aggro generation imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only times I've really felt the need to swap to a shield is after defensive goes away, and furious is down (either it wasnt up to start with or I used it on inc to build aggro with a huge two hander, &lt;3 twisted steel!) when I'm trying to get every little bit of protection between me and mr./ms. meanie thats beating me up. After defensive goes away, generally speaking my aggro is pretty set (though there are a couple of wizards that I've grouped/raided with that are experts at taking it away) and I do not have to worry about losing it. <br />
<br />
That said, I would not suggest shield tanking. Furious bash is a worthless focus as it stands right now. The ac bonus + soft cap raising properties, as well as the stats (my aegis of the earth has better stats than my offhanded BoC by a good margin) are good if you can afford to lose the offhand aggro. I have tried using it in group situations and I've faired usually well with it, but most of the time my finger is constantly hovering over AE taunt because of the reduced number of procs.<br />
<br />
Granted, it has its uses. Xegony for instance. If you're the main tank, I find this to be an effective way of keeping yourself alive more consistently. Not to mention you do not have to worry about losing aggro quite as much since there's only one other person hitting her for the entire fight.</div></div><hr />

Ive MT with a DBOW and EOE both A3 augged with CE30/WA5 and lost aggro to others.  Its all a gamble, do what works best.  If you loose aggro consistantly then go with what works best.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Shield block and shields are good, they give an additional boost in hp or ac, dependant on your shield. Blackstone Buckler from ikk3, Aegis of Earth from Arb, Aegis of Midnight from qvic, theres a few nice ones out there with good shielding/hp/ac.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Just build up aggro with normal aggro weaps, then halfway in the fight switch to shield, use Spirit of Rage disc then use your bellow if you lose aggro while with your shield wielded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackmoonx</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a shield for better damage mitigation. From both the AC boost and the shield block AA. I pop furious to build agro and then pop defensive. After a few good procs, I will switch to shield.<br />
<br />
If you see agro starting to bounce (which is rare for me) just hit area taunt and switch back to duo anger proc weapons til you have rebuild agro again. Just try to be back on shield before defensive falls. Its nice when you shield block a 2k+ hit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the smaller player base I normaly get &quot;Hey you&quot; requests from higher end peeps to tank stuff I really shouldnt be tanking with my craptastic gear.<br />
<br />
I ususally build aggro with stonewall/defensive then switch to shield when it wears off and pray to the aggro gods that my AA can hold it.<br />
<br />
Ususally however I tank stuff within my range or have suffecient healing power.<br />
The two factors I take into account before swapping in a shield is<br />
1.) Can I hold aggro with the current group/raid make up?<br />
2.) Is the mob so far over my gear that I absolutly have to thow AA's and shield at it to survive.</div></div><hr />
