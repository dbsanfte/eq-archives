<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wanlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well... I think it's time I made some upgrades to my equipment. I just made level 62 and I'm able to enter tier 3 zones, and I think I may be the SA (maybe even MA) for my guild..<br />
<br />
I need some tips on what I could upgrade and with what. I have a 63 enc friend with DC and a 50 cleric on my account , so I may be able to camp a few things, but I have no cash atm...so..let me know what you think http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190535<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh btw - Im not 63 yet , just made the profile 63 to see how many hp I would gain..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 things kinda leaped out at me.<br />
<br />
1:  Haste.  RBG or Soulscream should both be campable by you easily, and would upgrade both your haste, and stats in waist slot.<br />
<br />
2:  Weapons.  Look at maybe farming the new agro weapons out of Droga(good agro weapons are not cheap, and you say you are broke).  If you know a troll smith, maybe get a smithed Ykesha made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wanlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah .. my haste sucks. I've been trying to camp the soulscream belt , the RBG is mega rare isnt it ?  I may be getting a willsapper with the help of my guild , I dont know if I want one , Im sure there are better taunting weapons that are just as easy to get (right?)... thanks for the info - any other ideas ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey bro, glad you got to this board!<br />
<br />
We should camp the new revamped Droga for their nice 1 handers.  Let me know how much cash you got to spare so we can purchase some upgrades.  Keep trying the new Velksar for the soulscream belt and your stats will jump a notch.<br />
<br />
Also good earrings are the Solstice Earring and you can buy all the stuff yourself at the bazaar for bout 5k.  But we should def hit Droga as I see that to benefit both of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wanlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Lorre :)<br />
<br />
I could probably make a couple k pp in seb , if I get my cleric a seb key...  I would love to camp the Copper hammer thing in Droga , I hear it has lots of taunt. Maybe we should try and get a group together to camp it , talk to me in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wanlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hear WMBS &amp; GSoT hold aggro very well .. if I can save up 10k , should I buy a WMBS or GSoT or keep saving up for a 1hd weapon with good agro proc ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WMBS is good dps, but DPS can only hold aggro for so long.<br />
<br />
Now, the GSoT is really good aggro, anything that stuns=good aggro. The DPS of it is not bad either, and the thing procs too often for its own good =P</div></div><hr />
