<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not for it's abilities.<br />
<br />
Not for the 3% crit gain with 10% damage penalty.<br />
<br />
Not for the fury tree that is supposed to augment it.<br />
<br />
But rather, for that ugly as all hell dwarf head that floats above you when you switch to it!<br />
<br />
Battle Stance: Crossed Maces. I would have used axes or maybe swords, but maces get the point across &quot;I am here to fight!&quot;  Defensive Stance: Shield. Iconic representation, couldn't have done better myself. But what in the hell were they smoking when they picked that particular ugly ass face for berserk? It doesn't even look mad, seriously it's just kind of looking dead ahead with some beady little eyes and more hair on its face than a tauren has on his back. <br />
<br />
Does that inspire Fear of battle prowess? Does that inspire Awe of destructive capability? <br />
<br />
No!<br />
<br />
What it inspires is a churning in the stomach (and to a lesser extent that creepy feeling of when you are being watched) but nothing more!<br />
<br />
What it should be is an iconic representation of Rage, not the iconic representation of an ugly drunken midget!</div></div><hr />

<br />
the zerker stance nerf was annoying though, usta give 10% haste instead of 3% crits... it was hawt... when they changed it, a little bit of me died that day =\</div></div><hr />
