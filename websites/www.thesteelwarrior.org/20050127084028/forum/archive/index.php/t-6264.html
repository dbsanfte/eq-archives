<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey,<br />
  I am currently considering transfering server either to Morden rasp or another one.  I am currently on Tunare Server and I really not liking the server anymore.  The thing is I am not happy with the server I never was to begin with the only reason I stayed there was because of my real life friends played there but now since they quit EQ the only real thing that is holding me back is my friends that I made on the server.  <br />
<br />
  I am not looking for uber loot or looking for a better guild I know I could find that on Tunare I am nor sure what I am looking for I know at my present time I am not happy with Tunare in general.  <br />
<br />
<br />
  There is two things that is holding me back from transfering servers one is my friends and the other is my guild. My guild is small very small so small if  four people are logged on at the same time it is considered a special event.  I am the only level  65 in the guild and sometimes I am the only person who would be logged on for days.  The guild is four years old and I am afriad it is on its last legs and if I did transfer I am afraid that will just disappear altogether.  <br />
<br />
Would you transfer to a new server or would you stick around merely for your friends and guild sake.  No matter what how unhappy you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
stay and not be happy<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
move and maybe be happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Irmingnomers, fellow tunare here.  Wow I didnt know pigmy col was still together.  <br />
<br />
I would say do whatever makes you happy.  You're playing this game for fun so you should be having fun.  It looks like your guild has pretty much deteriorated so I see no reason to stay if no one is there.  I mean you've stuck around for this long and theres no one around.  As far as transfering to another server, do you have friends there?<br />
<br />
Tunare has plenty of guilds that raid a lot and it seems like all you need is to join an actively raiding guild.  That should spark some new interests and hopefully make this game fun again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is hard for me to leave my guild no matter how bad my guild gets.  I do not know what I am going to do. I don't like Tunare so ifI do decide to leave the guild I am not going to another guild on Tunare it will be to another server.  I know that probably doesn't make sense to you but that is the only way I can explain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oddly, people say that Torv is a really nice server. I really don't know, it's been too long since I was on a different server. I do know my guild just had half dozen people transfer over and comment on it though... Your best bet, if you have the funds, is just to transfer over to a different server and make new friends and get a new guild. If you're not happy now, the best thing to do is make a change, and starting fresh isn't a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm torn between two servers ( Test and Terris ) and can forsee a bit of the future for ya...<br />
<br />
Terris Thule. My server I played most on. Guild was a bunch of friends, now just a shell of the original; rest moved on to new combo-guild ( in time now ) and I see them maybe once a week or so, if at that.<br />
<br />
Test. Fun server, friends I know exclusively from TSW and invited me over to hang out. Being a lower population server; levelling as a solo or limited group type player makes it hard without 2-boxing. My friend's guild there is pretty well-established and I wish I could level more just to hang out in the zones with them.<br />
<br />
When I'm on Test; I talk to friends on Terris (serverwide guild channel ); when i'm on Terris; i'm 99% of the time farming greens or poking around on an alt ( old guildmates are euro and in bed by the time I log on )...so, basically....<br />
<br />
Keep your friends. Trying to go cros-server and trying to keep in touch with everyone you know from both servers will more than likely cut back more of your time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or it could be the best thing for ya. Just do what keeps you happy. Guilds come and go but friends are friends.</div></div><hr />
