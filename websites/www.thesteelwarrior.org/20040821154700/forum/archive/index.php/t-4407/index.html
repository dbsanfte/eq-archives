<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen alot of ideas about what we want Sony to do for us melee types. I am only going to discuss Warriors since this is a Warrior board. Below is the Class Description taken right from EverQuestLive. I have bolded the parts I think that needs to be restored by Sony to the warrior. And placed comments in blue that I think are reason enough for them to 'fix' us.  <br />

Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class 200 HP difference between Warriors and Pally's is not FAR hardier . When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics Warriors are masters of ALL weapons. Our weapon skills, ALL of them (with the exception of archery), should be higher than any hybrid - Pally's and SK's included. . Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents,making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, Once we gain agro on a MOB, no one should be able to pull it off of us.   allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.</div></div><hr />
