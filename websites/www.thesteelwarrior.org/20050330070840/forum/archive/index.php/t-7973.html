<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so we have done this event a while back. ( I was asked not to post about it on anyboards for its highly contested mob on our server)<br />
We did all the named in SSRA then moved to Cursed. We had about 50-60 people did all the named and only had one hicup when the MT died but i took over and all was good. We pulled cursed into the corner under that platform with the healers on the other side of the wall. We all engaged when told to. Everything was going good till the MT died. Healers said theat he was spiking way too much and they couldnt keep up. (like 4-6 clerics and some druids we do alot with the few healers we have loged on at one time)<br />
  Is there anything we could of done differnt? I think people got charmed and thats why the dammage spike was so huge.<br />
  Oh ya I took over as tank furios and shortly after that was dead. no heal. had 2 clerics in my group along with MT...... they plain and simple feked that up. So we wiped when cursed was at 40%. Fairly good IMO for our first raid on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalthanan</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just killed Cursed last night on our 2nd attempt with about 43 people I think.  We had all the healers on the opposite side of the wall to avoid the AE.  We had a designated corpse dragger.  We just had good clerics that kept up well and changed healing targets when the MT died due to death touch, or was feared.<br />
<br />
Also, we tried to get people's resists up for the fight.<br />
<br />
It really helps when the raid leaders explain the situation and make sure everyone is prepared for what is going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuddar Raddut</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a ranged fight on Cursed to deal with charm.  Put your tanks in a group with a bard singing Psalm of Purity to pump disease resist and have a necro DMF the raid for additional disease resist. His charm is disease based with no modifier, so pumping up your disease resist should allow you to resist this often. Normally I tank him by entrance to where the taskmasters/mines are in a little corner by the doorway and rest of raid is by the little walled area in the middle of the room where you enter the basement. Healers check their range on me before starting the encounter, and then when I have Cursed where I want them raid nudges up to where they are in range to heal me/nuke Cursed.<br />
<br />
His other AE is poison based and short range. With a simple CH rotation it's not even worth bothering to try to resist. Other tanks just call out when they need heals. If MT goes down next tank in line just AE taunts immediately to prevent Cursed from running to the raid and healers switch to new tank.<br />
<br />
If he gets into the main body of the raid, chaos supreme will reign, although it's funny as hell when it does happen.  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fight him ranged.  His dps isn't really that spikey my guess is someone forgot to reslow.  His dps is very low once slow is in but if your debuffers forget to reslow he can drop you fast.  Flurry can make it spikey at times I suppose but with 4 clerics it shouldn't be a problem doing a rot where they stay FM the whole time.  Long fight but the clerics will gain mana over time during it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This fight is cake, theres 2 ways you can handle the dots/charms;<br />
<br />
<br />
A. Gather bards, have one in each group - give everyone DMF and tribunal.<br />
<br />
B. CALL THE AE's! (thats right, their timed), for people to come in and out of attacking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did it with 20 non-elemental, non-vt equipped people. It wasn't the fastest kill. But it wasn't hard either. We've done it with 40'ish aswell the bard strat works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have one bard sing an AE resist song and have little trouble with charms, although it seems to me that all of the mage pets /con scowl by the end of the fight. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ding ding ding!  Cursed is fully slowable, but he will annihilate you if you forget to reslow him.  His dps is actually quite low - like 275ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience healing the AE or timing the ae isn't worth the hassle.  His AC is pretty damn high and people meleeing means you have to deal more with balancing the push and also backup heals for people that don't run out fast enough.  Get a bard grouped with wizards&gt;mages&gt;rangers for rizlona's/muse and keep a big ds on the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do this fight with under 2 groups, but It'd take a LONG ASS TIME, trust me =p<br />
<br />
Fight him ranged, don't even have melee attack except with a bow.  Next to XTC, this is the easiest RvR in SSRA.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a bit ballsy, and people tell you they can dodge the AE you can do that as well.  But with a large number of people, in my experience, they can't count and dodge the AE.. too complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You did have your MT using Evasive, yes?  Far more effective than defensive on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">defensive/evasive if anything at all shouldnt matter his mele dps should never be an issue. Its a long ass fight and 3 minitues of defensive/evasive means dick all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we always had troubles with his dmg on the posion ae , the charm is weaksauce<br />
<br />
1 cleric with FT15 can keep a 10k tank alive all day with bard singing mana, a druid can take over when disc is up. Cursed DPS super low, after slow and cripple. Don't dual wield. :p<br />
<br />
you could time the AE, but it doesn't matter really, long as he's kept reslowed and crippled, the biggest DPS on him is the MT's dmg shield.</div></div><hr />
