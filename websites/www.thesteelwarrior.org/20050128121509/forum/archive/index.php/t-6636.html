I already looked over Brutul's post, but my guild has this silly rule about one piece of AHR loot per person, so I can't exactly take advantage of her loot as I would like to.  Goin to post my magelo, my idea of what I'd like to obtain is under &quot;few months&quot;.  If there's any other upgrades I missed, I'd appreciate it, thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the haste neck from VT ... saving your aten loot for the gloves? or get the aten neck ... and then look for: the cloak of the black winds. Or the haste bracer from Earth rings.<br />
<br />
Then just start looking at Raex's molds. You've got a lot of slots there that can be upgraded in the elemental planes. Just take it slow, and have fun. You're gonna see some huge jumps in stats over the next few months. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BabaHanz</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too would love the AHR neck/PoE bracer combo, but it just isn't happening.  The officers basically only award that neck to casters for the FT.  So I figure the gloves are the next best thing for the proc.  If not the gloves, I'm guessing the neck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or the mask! There isn't a better one for a long, long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for the BP since you won't see an upgrade until Rathe or by getting an ornate bp.  Seru or Curse bp is also another option if those are still targets.  I don't agree with your guild distributing the neck to casters only, considering how easy it is to leave VT with 15 FT.<br />
<br />
50AC on the crimson runed mask is hard to pass up, too.  Since you have the EoP, the face slot would be a good upgrade.  As far as the gloves, the proc is nice but plate gauntlets drop often in the elementals.  You'd still be able to bag AHR gloves but orb of the sky is another option, though the 10 sec cast time blows.<br />
<br />
Face &amp; neck slot upgrades are plentiful in PoP so they can be upgraded easily.  Other than that, your upgrade path seems fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I was gonna mention the mask. But it's soooooo rare sometimes. Heh. My guild has yet to see it drop.<br />
<br />
I'm with the others here who think the aten neck is ffa. It's a huge upgrade to tanks, casters, melees, whatever. The thing is just designed sooooo well. Having the DS upgrade and the HP regen on someone who doesn't get hit at all is about as useless as having the FT on a tank, you know what I mean? The item has a great perk for anyone that equips it.<br />
<br />
But eh, your guild is your guild. And there's some great Aten alternatives, like the mask, or the gloves or the breastplate. I didn't mention BP because of what Derricts says ... Cursed BP or Seru BP, or heck, even BP of speed would rock the house until time.<br />
<br />
Anyways, there's a LOT of good stuff to be had in the elementals. So I wouldn't worry too much about missing out on Aten goodies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general, VT is best for non-visible slots. Cloak of Icy Shadows will take care of you until Time, especially if you pick up a gorget of superiority for haste. In EPs, get molds and hopefully a puresteel mantle. If you can't get AHR gloves, get an orb of sky. It's worse for sure, but it's a heck of a lot better than nothing. An extra 2 procs per minute of stun is nothing to scoff at. Get an orb of satisfaction (35ac 100hp) if you don't mind switching in your bow. If you have a shot at an umbracite bracer, you should probably pick up one as EP bracer molds are heavily contested. Personally, I wouldn't worry about the BP from AHR as much as the mask, gloves or earring. An ornate BP is fairly close, and comparatively the other AHR loot is a much bigger upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Suggestions aren't what you can obtain in raids as much, but figured it would fall in the category as things you might as missed.  I hope you don't mind me adding it =)<br />
<br />
Depending on how much time you want to do questing you could have a few upgrades.<br />
<br />
For your shoulders you could get a 100hp item (strength of the elements)without using any DKP or rolls from your guild.<br />
<br />
Also you could go for Spirit Wrack Coords.  This item would give you another 100hp item  that can be worn in several spots (arms,wrist,shoulder)   This will also result in a 85hp ring.<br />
<br />
Finish your dain ring also.  I see you got a nice start.<br />
<br />
My guild is currently doing VT/lower PoP.  Check out my magelo.  I think I am doing decent at my level in the game.  It may help you out a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for the mask off AHR. Like Nilana said; a lot of other slots can be obtained by quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree.  I went for the neck.  I will probably never replace it simply because I'm a huge DS freak, plus 35AC on the neck is killer for quite some time.<br />
<br />
AHR neck is a nice piece, and obviously the effect is what makes the item.  Lets break it down . . . <br />
<br />
Attack: +20 - Easily the least significant portion of the effect, +atk is plentiful in the EPs.<br />
<br />
Regeneration: +8 - Second most important attribute, regen isn't nearly as easy to cap as mana regen.<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration: +8 - This is only above atk because this much on one piece is uncommon, however FT is SO easy to max its rediculas.  If you're going to award based on the mana regeneration though, this should be a hybrid item, not a caster item, since they have a much harder time getting mana regeneration, and so much in a single piece is much more significant for them than casters who have such a WIDE selection of quality FT items.<br />
<br />
Damage Shield: +8 - Without arguement the most significant portion of the effect.  Not only does this have the most WornDS in the game, its one of only FOUR items in the entire game that has WornDS(see my DS Items List (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5677) for all 4! items with wornDS on them).<br />
<br />
Ultravision - Negligible importance<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone that disagrees with me on this is just fucking wrong, that is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regeneration: +8 - Second most important attribute, regen isn't nearly as easy to cap as mana regen. <br />
<br />
  I definitely disagree on this point. I don't give much importance to regen. It's above nothing, for sure, but it's not big for me. Remember: Regen is every 6 seconds. If you're gaining 100hp every tick, you're doing really well. Sure it's cumulative, but it's a nearly negligable effect for a MT imo.<br />
<br />
plus 35AC on the neck is killer for quite some time. <br />
<br />
  Actually, it's not in this case. The talisman isn't augmentable, and there are necks with equally as good of ac in VT.<br />
<br />
  That's not to say that I don't think it's amazing for all classes, I surely do. It's just that it's not the end all people make it out to be. Compared to a 60! ac augmented mask with 125hp and 30atk, or a nearly insta-click aggro buff (One of 3 obtainable atm, two being in VT and one in Time), I'd have to say I'd go with a different option than the neck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pick up Seru's Torque, a Torque of the Wurmlord, or a Faded Skull Medallion and stick one of the 10ac augs from MM on it.  <br />
<br />
Leave the FT8 item for those with a mana bar.<br />
<br />
Cloak of icy shadows, belt of mastery, and crimson runed mask are the items to shoot for imo.<br />
<br />
Don't bother with VT haste, as it's fairly easy to get haste from elementals.  Flowing moss mantle and bracer of earthen energy come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pure casters taking a neck on need-of-ft-basis is a joke, hybrids tho are good fits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a raid leader for my guild and hate Aten for this very reason - Everyone gets really personal and pissy when *THEY* don't get a specific drop or such and such item doesn't go to their class.<br />
<br />
The neck is great for every class.  There's a reason it's All/All, you know?  The fact is, no class will ever find a replacement for the Aten neck until Time.  Warriors benefit immensely from the 35ac/125hp/+20 all svs.  Hybrids, especially Knights, benefit from every single stat.  Necros benefit enormously from the regen/ft.  You can pick any class and there will be something on that Talisman that is just downright freaking awesome.  <br />
<br />
And that's why I hate it, hehe.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, if I were to have to pick just a single piece of Aten loot, my vote would go to the face, which I did (Crimson Runed Mask in my magelo).  The Great Shadow Platemail is amazing, but Seru/Cursed BPs are very comparable.  The Earring of Eradication is awesome as well, but with PoP having the Signet of Might quest and with the Sigil Earring of Veracity being pretty easy to do these days, there are some nice alternatives.<br />
<br />
But the mask?  Sure, there are some really nice masks in the elementals, but none have *NEARLY* the amount of AC you find on the Crimson Runed Mask.  Inny (Hate) drops an 18ac 115hp mask called Rusted Wicked Faceguard.  One of the Avatars in Air (Can't remember which) drops an 18ac 140hp mask called Fine Hammered Faceguard.  Then there's the Solusek Ro mask (Baroque Half Mask of Solusek Ro - 20ac 135hp) and Great Mask of Flame off Fennin Ro (20ac 150hp).  Imho, while these masks *ROCK*, I don't think they hold a candle to the Crimson Runed Mask because of its sheer AC.  Since you have the opportunity of getting one, that's what I'd go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice on Aten is take what you can get.  Her loot table is so big that you can't count on anything dropping.  My guild had exclusive farming rights on Aten for several months, and still do it once a month or so, and we have a total of 2 masks, 2 (I think) earrings, and zero gloves.  Of earring, breastplate, neck, mask, and gloves, I'd take whatever drops first and be happy with it.  If you hold out for one item on her, you may never get anything.  Of course then after you do take something, the thing you really wanted will drop.<br />
<br />
Defaulting the neck to casters is pretty silly considering that all of your casters will max FT with or without the neck before you leave VT, and it becomes even more trivial in the future.  Hell my cleric bot has zero raid loot and will be FT14 soon (is at 11 now).  You can make a slightly better case for hybrids, but it should really be for everyone.  That said, the lack of an augment slot on the aten neck really hurts it.  It is still probably the best till time, but if you buy a magma neck in fire and put a 500 point augment in it it gets pretty close in ac/hps and all you're really losing is the damage shield.  You're still short 10 ac, but if you compare it to the alternatives to the mask, your overall ac will be better with the mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regeneration: +8 - Second most important attribute, regen isn't nearly as easy to cap as mana regen.<br />
<br />
I still stand by this statement.  It was made based on the availability of worn regen vs FT on good gear, not switching in that fungi or zlandi heart during downtime.  MOST of the regen in the EP's are from Aura of * effects, thus coupled with atk and usually wearable only by melee or awarded to melee, this is great for monks, but doesn't do jack for shamans and necros.  I could really care less about hp regen personally, I have a clericbot that I'm never without so I don't have to worry abou it.  However, for classes that are regen happy, usually necros, shamans, and monks, this is pretty huge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage Shield: +8 - Without arguement the most significant portion of the effect.  Not only does this have the most WornDS in the game, its one of only FOUR items in the entire game that has WornDS(see my DS Items List (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5677) for all 4! items with wornDS on them).<br />
<br />
I don't just stand by this arguement, I'll spend hours defending it.  First off, I'm a DS freak, and on this subject I am pretty well versed(see link above), I have the best of every worn or clickable DS item preTime/Kod'Taz(I'm working on that range though) with the exception of the Tunare belt, which frustraights me greatly I assure you.  With the exception of a gimp ass shield that has no place in a warrior's hands, and the Shield of Pain 3 aug from LDoN raids(very limited availability, especially with most guilds probably skipping LDoN to go straight to GoD), there are only FOUR, yes FOUR items in the game with wornDS.  One is from Hard Takish and has the lowest wornDS as well as the worst stats.  One is from Time, off Quarm no less.  One is from Kod'Taz trash, kinda rare, and unfortunately shares a slot with Symbol of the Planemasters, a superior item for both hp/AC, worn mod, and click effect.  And the final one is this neck, which is also the highest wornDS of any item in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone that disagrees with me on this is just fucking wrong, that is all.<br />
<br />
Sarcasm mixed with strong feelings about the issue at hand.  I'd be a raving lunatic if I didn't expect differing viewpoints on the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pure casters taking a neck on need-of-ft-basis is a joke, hybrids tho are good fits.<br />
<br />
Bingo!</div></div><hr />

Stone-Worked Pauldrons has a fiery might effect, 5hp/ds, shoulder slot, drops in Ikkinz 4 raid (altar).  Though, you will be happy to see the fiery might augs dropping in the Yxtta Primals while the guild moans and groans.</div></div><hr />

They have a pain in the ass time getting FT, more so than any other class. Mana regen spells/songs don't work on them either, and a very low meditate skill, so they really need the FT.</div></div><hr />
