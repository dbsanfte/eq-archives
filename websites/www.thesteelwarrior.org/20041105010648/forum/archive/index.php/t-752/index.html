<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I finally got my first MT role at a raid.<br />
<br />
Tanked Vindi, then Statue of Rallos Zek (Our first attempt at him)  last night with 29 people - 1 cleric, four druids on chrot, with one last cleric showing up when statue was at 25%.  I had just under 6200 hp buffed, with 1352 AC.  Only one death .. a 61 SK.<br />
<br />
But alas, I am an alternate character, and was not awarded either of the two BPs that dropped =(  Oh well, they will have to give me one sooner or later.  <br />
<br />
I do have to say though, that was the MOST fun I've had playing EQ in a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, those encounters, being melee-only mobs and not requiring anything more than a basic CH-rotation, are quite a huge boost to the warrior tanking :)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, when you get into the higher game with a big guild, you find that only 2 or 3 tanks really do the tanking, and the rest of the warriors kinda play benchwarmer (&quot;Okay, our star QB is down, where's our 4th string dude?&quot;).<br />
<br />
And no matter how they put it (&quot;Everyone's here to help succeed&quot; or &quot;DPS is DPS&quot; or &quot;We're not about ego, we're about success on mob attempts&quot;), it's the same old story of having loved and lost, when you're not the front line dude.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your time in the spotlight, and get one of those BP's :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, all those days of playing second string to pallys/sks in exp groups are made up for when your THE man standing toe to toe with someone like vindi. Not sure what the loot distribution system is in your guildl but at least now you know you can do vindi, you should be able to farm him until everyone who needs it gets a BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unfortunately, when you get into the higher game with a big guild, you find that only 2 or 3 tanks really do the tanking, and the rest of the warriors kinda play benchwarmer<br />
If your guild is putting all of thier eggs in 1 basket (or 2 or 3 as you suggest) then you are doomed to fail. When your &quot;star quarterback&quot; gets called up by the local uber guild you are screwed.<br />
<br />
I would think that the majority of the high end game guilds are quite the opposite and ANY warrior in the guild can take over tanking duties at any time. I know in my guild it usually comes down to who has defensive/evasive up when tank duties are assigned.<br />
<br />
Anyway, grats on your first MT duty, it is a total rush! Hang in there for a BP too. Since you are an alt (even though you MT) you should be low on the list after all the mains that can use it have one, but Vindi is an 8 hour spawn and the BP is a common drop. You are bound to get one sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grats, that is quite an accomplishment at 58.  I tanked Vindi at 59 but only after the two 60's went down first in short order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for your replies and support guys.<br />
<br />
Yeah, we've actually been farming Vindi for a little while.  I hadn't been bringing the warrior because I am usually organizing things and its hard to play two boxes (65 Druid main) and lead.  Not only that, but I have wanted the BP of Eradication forever, so I don't even &quot;bid&quot; on the Vindi BP.  We use a Loot Fairness Council btw (officer distributed loot).<br />
<br />
Our guildleader was leading last night though, and we had no other warriors on except another alt that has average equipment (I was about 125AC 450-500HP more than him), so I was asked to MT.<br />
<br />
It was great fun, and I'm looking forward to killing the Statue often.  Its only right that mains get considered first, but I'll get a BP eventually ...</div></div><hr />
