I know there is a elf warrior out there that wouldnt mind im sure though:)</div></div><hr />

SoE is scared shitless of WoW.  They've never been one to initiate change, other games initiate it for them.  I don't think it's gonna work this time.  They had damned near 5 years of a cornered market, and they didn't do shit with it.  No sympathy from me now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing since Dec 2000 (Don't laugh at my &quot;main's&quot; level, I have Everquest ADD, I can't keep playing one character or on one server more then a month usually), and I always looked forward to being up there 'with the big boys' but now, is it even worth it? Someone tell me that the game is fun, and worth playing even with everything that has happened. Please bear in mind I've never zoned into such places as Kael, Sleepers, ToV, VT, Ssra, Plane of ANYTHING. Things that I am getting into now, are fresh for me, and exciting. Will it be worth it on down the road? Or should I just cancel my wife and I's account and go play another game?<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

 If you're looking  for &quot;an end game scenario&quot; to log off and feel some kind of closure&quot;; than quit EQ now and believe me there isn't no &quot;end game scenario&quot;.<br />
<br />
if you play EQ to be part of a team; immerse yourself in a fantasy world; lead people towards victory, follow others as part of a unit towards victory, spend time making and creating things for others to either buy or use and feel grateful for, to build friendships, to chat, to forget about the woes of RL and &quot;put on another hat&quot; in a matter of speaking and relax and unwind; than EQ is fine for that.<br />
<br />
Worst thing you could ever do in EQ ( in my opinion ) is look for &quot;An End&quot; to it because it simply doesn't exist. Just have fun. When it's not fun don't play.<br />
<br />
No, i'm not telling ya to quit or anything. Just take a look at what you log on for. It's just pixels. And there's lots and lots of pixels out there to choose from that may or may not be more suited to your playing needs. <br />
<br />
This year should be farily interesting in terms of MMORPG's. I'm curious to see where people are come December.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well obviously I'm not looking for an &quot;end game scenario&quot; (I mean it's called EVERquest, right?)<br />
<br />
I guess, my point was with everything that is going on, and more and more people thinking about leaving (your &quot;December&quot; scenario) IS it and WILL it be fun by the time I get there. <br />
<br />
After three years or so of playing, will that time be justified? I've had fun so far, WILL I keep having fun? Or is there some kind of point of diminishing returns on fun, where the time invested is so much more greater then the enjoyment level (a &quot;fun&quot; soft cap, if you will)<br />
<br />
<br />
Odd questions, I am sure, but valid, I think, nonetheless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will be extremely curious to see what EQ2 and WoW do to the population of Norrath as we know it. I think some will go in one of those directions and I think some will remain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't let other people tell you that you're not happy playing a game.  If you truly have done as you say you've done, a character a month and your highest is 35, then I'd say EQ has a lot of life left for you.  EQ was a lot of fun when I was 35, it was worth every penny I paid for it.<br />
<br />
The problems start occuring when you're in your 60's and you run out of content to do.  My biggest issue was lack of content for 1 group of 60's.  I could basically do Chardok, CT, and ToV.  That's about it if I wanted to see any XP movement or accomplish anything at all, and that's retarded.  There was an entire expansion supposedly &quot;Geared&quot; towards one group content at the high end, and we all know how that turned out (cough 90 man Rathe cough).<br />
<br />
After that, we had some retards who actually PAID MONEY for things that we should have gotten for free, and a new gimmicky race.  I knew that was the end for me, because as soon as people start paying for nothing, that's when SoE lowers the standards even more and won't ever make anything I'd play in again.<br />
<br />
Lies, unfinished content, bugs and &quot;working as intended features&quot; are really all that SoE promotes these days.  I wasn't having fun with EQ, and I'll never buy another SoE product again due to the way they chose to conduct business.  They had the MMORPG market cornered for 5 years and they chose to milk the customer base for more money rather than making the truly great game that EQ could/should have been.  Money shouldn't be the bottom line if you're trying to make a video game...making a good game should be your focus.  Making a good game is Blizzard's focus, and that's where I'll be spending my 12.95 a month when the time comes.<br />
<br />
At 35, you're not going to even start experiencing any of these issues for a LONG time.  If you and your wife are still having fun, then by all means, keep it rolling.  There's plenty to do that you'll find new and exciting.  There's just not that much left for those of us in our 60's and we're sick of being dicked around and ignored while they fix doors in freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Course, they way we go, when we get bored at 60 I guess we will just start new characters. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice, and more power to you in WoW.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and I may join you there! Paying for EQ still of course LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously, it is called EVERquest. but I digress..<br />
<br />
Valid questions you ask? Sure; they are. It's your choice though to look at the things you like about the game and pursue them and put aside those which you disagree with.<br />
<br />
It's quite funny when you see people's responses on &quot;how&quot; they feel about something as compared to others; and what people tend to reinerate on as rebuttals to other's views when they see them. Find a few key words; ignore their thoughts..and boom you've got the reason you've been here all along. To prove to others how much &quot;You&quot; enjoy something which I feel is the last thing that needs justification. You play for you. You play to make others believe you're having fun than are you really having fun? Kinda seems like a lost cause.<br />
<br />
Every now and than I talk to some of my old friends and see what their responses are to those same questions and a few even still talk of an &quot;End Game&quot; that is somewhere out there and they keep reaching for...Baffling. They've gotten to be so hell_bent on reaching that point that all other aspects of &quot;playng&quot; the game become lost amidst the trail of dust behind them. Only one thing matters; chasing the carrot. <br />
<br />
But to each their own.  You and your wife Donnell seem to enjoy yourselves; and EQ fills the roles that you both need to enjoy yourselves. You're not in it for anyhting but yourselves and if you dream a little than who is to tell you differently? Everyone dreams of the things that are out of reach. It's inevitable. But as long as you know where you are and how the rest of the world is still around you than I can't see a single problem with you not being happy where you are in EQ or any other gamr that's out there.<br />
<br />
You never forgot what you play EQ for; which is one of the most common things people forget. <br />
<br />
Sheesh; I typed too much. Sorry :D</div></div><hr />
