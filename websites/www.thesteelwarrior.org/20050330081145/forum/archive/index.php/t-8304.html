<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey,<br />
<br />
I have had some really odd experiences fighting this mob.  Once, we were with a group and a half of friends just roaming around in Ferubi clearing for weapons to spawn smith, and on a whim decided to see if we could kill him.<br />
<br />
I pulled him on a bard, we cornered him near the pillars next to the Brawler spawn location, and I chain high sunned the pets the entire fight.  We wiped at around 75% because a cleric got too close and AE rampage ate him, but the tactic worked very well with cornering him and high sunning his pets.<br />
<br />
The next day, we went, killed Smith Rondo, then decided to try Zun again, since we had a full raid available, and repeated the pull in an exactly identical fashion, but this time Zun kept warping back into his lair with no reason, considering just yesterday we fought him this way and he would not warp.<br />
<br />
As far as I see it, there are a few ways to fight him:<br />
<br />
1)  Pull him + his pets, off tank the pets, burn him, then burn the pets (requires a lot of healing/people)<br />
2)  Pull him + his pets, off tank him, burn the pets, burn him (same as above)<br />
3)  Pull him + his pets, chain high sun the pets the duration of the fight, burn him + his pets<br />
4)  Pull him + his pets, chain high sun him, burn the pets, then deal with him.<br />
<br />
How do people do him?  We always used to do 3) and even killed him once earlier with that method, but what worked the first day, did not work the next day for no explicable reason.<br />
<br />
Any advice?</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming the &quot;Zun kept warping back into his lair with no reason&quot; was a teather? I don't see why you would need to pull him far, perhaps the steps down into the main hall is the farthest he can go. I don't see why you would need to pull him out that far, however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pulling him that far allows bards to high sun the pets for the duration of the fight, so you don't have to worry about it.<br />
<br />
It was defently tethered when we tried him with a raid, but when we tried it with a 12 people he did not tether, which I found really odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, assuming there are now tethering issues with Zun, how hard would people consider this encounter?  I'm guessing we'd fight in his room, corner him, burn down pets, burn down Zun.  There are a couple other guards in his room too.  I'm hoping there's a way to split those off and kill them before engaging Zun.  The hardest stuff my guild has done was killing MM for the first time (2nd attempt) last night and killing Bertox a couple days ago for the first time (2nd attempt).<br />
<br />
A big Ferubi raid would just be a change of pace from all the PoP flagging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using bards to gate is definitely easier as you put a druid to heal both of them, and an SK or pally to keep aggro on both and just chain gate them.  Thus the whole raid can focus on zun muram.  Once he's owned, kill one and then the other.</div></div><hr />
