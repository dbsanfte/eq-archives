<br />
I have a fungi, WB, and band-aid knife which would help, but no ToD.  Magelo on the left.<br />
<br />
Oh, also, I'm on a PvP server so anything off the beaten path is a bonus.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarrae Halliwax</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that's not very nice.   The fact is I'm working a different shift right now, and my play time is different than my usual friends.</div></div><hr />

You've got some nice gear for your relative level, but I don't know that you are going to be able to solo much, hence Tierleaf's comment. You can try haunting zonelines in places like Karnor's, L Guk and Sol B and see how it goes but...</div></div><hr />

We suck at soloing because mobs are designed to kill us :p<br />
<br />
And roll up a bestlord to solo with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check out the yeti caves in DL, in the snow-covered mountains.<br />
<br />
Sol A bats possibly if you can break them.<br />
<br />
Maybe chardok entrance with lots of downtime.  Probably tough without a ToD and I think they run so you'd want a snare whip.  Might not be worth your time.<br />
<br />
If you don't care about your faction then go con Felwithe guards and see if you can solo those.  Or any other type of guards.<br />
<br />
Go to the Fear port-in and camp Cyndreela, she should be soloable at your level with some downtime to bind wound/regen before she pops.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Even with a ToD I'm not sure it'd be doable solo at 53.  Stick to old world zones and kunark.  I'd say the entrance of LGuck should still have some dark blues, and they should be pushovers with your gear setup.  Some of the stuff in DL should be doable too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bugs and Bats in Naggys Lair (Sol B) will be mostly dark blue until 54 and very solo-able by a warrior in a fungi with decent weapons.  Then move up to LDCs (Lava duct crawlers).  They can take you all the way to 60 though it wont be fast.</div></div><hr />
