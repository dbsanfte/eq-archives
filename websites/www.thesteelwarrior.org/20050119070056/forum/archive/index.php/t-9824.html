<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LotharoftheHillPeopl</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, im level 42 and have been dieing to find a reason to well.......throw more money at this character.  Actually the real reason is that I keep getting schooled by my friends monk when we duel.  He is a real idiot and for some reason believes that agility (his is at 242) will win him absolutely every fight.  He beats me and claims that its all in his agility when in fact, being a monk, he should whoop me anyways.  But to boost his agility that high, he has poured absurd amounts of money into him and ended up with a character not as good as it should be for the money.  He believes he is doing very good because, after 75k of gear, his monk can beat me in a duel.  I need to really shut him up and am looking for a few upgrades.  I have been considering cultural armor for some of my slots but the Brell Serilis gear (I wish I had clicked RZ) is hard to find.  <br />
I am also thinking about investing in a soulscream belt.  He bought one and that extra 10% haste really puts him ahead.  I could probably find one for 13-15k on my server and am wondering if this would be worth it.  Are there any other upgrades you suggest.  My budget is about 20k.  Thanks!<br />

They will beat you because they dish out more damage than you.  The best thing you could probably do is to buy a shaman ds potion for the next duel.  I think the best one you can buy is your lvl / 2 for damage so for you it would be 21.<br />
<br />
More than likely though, a ranger or monk will waste you though at that level due to their higher offense and skill caps generating more dps.  Plus they typically will be able to have better weapons than a warrior.<br />

But how about gear upgrades.  I have been looking that the architect's bejeweled bp.  Would it be worth it more to upgrade my armor for more hp/ac, or should try and grab the soulscream which boosts some stats, my armor, my hp, and gives me 10% more haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrun</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grab the Soulscream first if you can afford it, it will last you awhile. After that work on replacing anything that does not have hps on it, you should be able to find gear with around the same ac as what you are replacing easily. At your lvl I would try to find at least 25-30 hps items, if not more. If it has some sta on it, so much the better. As far as the Architect's BP, if you can still afford it after the Soulscream go for it, its been running around 5k on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Always use DS potions<br />
- Get a Truncheon of Doom <br />
Tepid Deeds proc will slow his attack for 50%. (but needs level 50 to proc i think)<br />
Other slow proccing weapons are &quot;wavecrasher&quot; 20% and &quot;willsapper&quot; 35% (if i remember correctly)<br />
- Get a Herbalists Spade<br />
Paralizing earth proc will root him. Move away and shoot him with a good bow. (max your archery)<br />
- Silken whip of ensnaring/ Anklesmasher will snare him and allow you to kite him too<br />
- You can get instant clickie snare items too.<br />
  Fungusbeast gland (expensive), Scepter of the Forlorn (cheap)<br />
- During the fight dont stand still. Try to get in his back so he cant hit you.<br />
- If you kite him regen gear will help you of course<br />
- General suggestions:<br />
  more HP: you will last longer<br />
  more AC: you will take less damage<br />
- Get some tribute points. You dont have to use it at all times, but for a duel it can really help. I would suggest max levels of haste/regen/Attack/AC/Hitpoints<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh nos a barehanded monk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming that the monk is level 42 as well, his bare fists will be either 12/32 or 12/33, depending on his race. So even though his hit ratio won't drop or anything, his DPS will still be crushed if he doesn't see it right away. But watch out for it in return, monks can disarm pretty well themselves. <br />
<br />
Really though, you don't stand much of a chance at your level unless you just blow him away in gear. At 57 with my monk back in the day I whiped the floor with my warrior friend whenever I dueled, and I had crap gear compared to him. At your levels monks are still pretty damned good tanks, and they certainly dish out more damage. On top of that they have Mend. So unless you get some DS clickies or just get really really lucky, don't expect to beat him until you get some /discs to pull out.</div></div><hr />

Even at lvl 60, a monk's bare fists are 14/26 (9/16 with epic).  Given the weapons available now, I think its safe to say that he'd have less DPS barehanded.</div></div><hr />
