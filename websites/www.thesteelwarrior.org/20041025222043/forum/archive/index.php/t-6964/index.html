I hate the Goverment of the United States of America. Yes im American but i do believe that the government in this country is the most crooked political entity in the world. <br />

I for one think this is a load of shit if i've ever heard it. Dont think that by signing up for the reserves that your going to get a free ride, then when the shit hits the fan your crying home to mommy wondering how you got into the situation your in. <br />
For ALL you college, or soon to be college children out there get one thing straight. The reserves IS NOT A FREE RIDE! When your country calls, the country that you said &quot; ya i'll play army for a free education&quot; to. Your going to go, and if you want to cry and mope around thinking that you dont think you should have to go to war, thats something you should have thought about before you signed up for that &quot;free education&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as the vote issue goes, ones just as bad as the other. There both politicans and  politicians = crook.<br />
<br />
The one thing that leads me to believe this is when Kerry says he'll get the UN and other counrtys involved in the reconstruction of Iraq. What makes him think hes going to acomplish something that Bush hasn't in this aera? I mean the countrys that have said NO to us have not said no because its Bush in the white house vs. Kerry. The UN is another situation all together, they cant even run there own organization, there pathetic. <br />
If i was Bush i would'nt even bother trying to get them involved after they turned us down the first time. I would remember though, when another incident occures and the UN asked the U.S. for help, i'd have to say thanks but no thanks we'll stear clear. The same would apply to the countrys that have turned down the U.S. in the current situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh i agree they both suck, but your forgetting about Nader.<br />
<br />
anyhow i think bush will have a draft, but it will be stealth, such as this compolsery service bullshit, go and read it, anyone who is in the system can be pulled into war as easly as the reservists.<br />
<br />
calling a draft in your first year is politcal suicide, if he makes it to another term it will be the LAST election this country ever has, whats left of it will probibly be the cockroachs.<br />
<br />
people say that voting for someone who isnt in the 2 partys is throwing away a vote, but i say your asking for it in the ass or in the mouth, which would you hate more?(but there is a guy over there in corner that doesnt want to do eather to you, but he is a throw away the other 2 partys say, who own the media thru stocks)<br />
<br />
thing is selective service is FORCED, and even in college you are forced to do it if it goes thru<br />
<br />
being a reservist means your RESERVED for a time when your are absofuckinglutly needed<br />
<br />
something you should know about our 2 party system, they are related, are a part of the same frat(BHG:skull &amp; bones)<br />
<br />
to be honest, i think we will get the same goals from eather of them, thats why i say go the 3rd party route<br />
<br />
something else that may interest you, if enough of americans think ALL of our canadiates are scum, everyone can do the write in vote for none, if 2/3rds write that in then they have to throw out the current canidates and get a set of whole new ones, personally i think that would be best but i do not think americans will try it :/<br />
<br />
also i think that if kerry does win he will try to go for a draft in his second term as well, to do it in your first term is political suicide</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, let me say that if there was a draft I feel that every person drafted has an obligation to step forward and accept the responsibility.  And I say this as someone who served four years in the military voluntarily.  However, I believe that the draft is something to be used only in times of great national emergency when no other approach will reasonably work.  I don't believe that Iraq is such a situation.  And frankly, I think that the Bush generated cluster fuck in Iraq was a bad idea from the get go and it hasn't done anything but get worse.<br />
<br />
I for one think this is a load of shit if i've ever heard it. Dont think that by signing up for the reserves that your going to get a free ride, then when the shit hits the fan your crying home to mommy wondering how you got into the situation your in. <br />
<br />
I mostly agree.  If you sign up as a reservist is should be with the knowledge that there may come a time when your country has need to call upon you and you have a duty to fulfill.  However, I don't believe that reservists should realistically be expected to be pulled from their jobs, their homes, and their families to go off and fight a war that wasn't fully justified in a country that doesn't really want them there.  The evidence presented by President Bush and his adminstration prior to the invasion seemed pretty convincing.  Except 95% of it hasn't panned out.  If the intelligence services are so capable as to be able to detect and locate massive amounts of weapons of mass destruction, amounts considered to be a &quot;threat to the world&quot;, how exactly do they allow them to disappear so thoroughly and completely?  Answer is, they don't.  It's not logically consistant that these things could be tracked, located, and then so completely lost.  Something went seriously wrong somewhere.  And I happen to think it was within the adminstration and not within the intelligence community.  But either way, if the country can't be given reliable information which supports the major decisions of a President, how can we trust government to even know when to act or what to do?  Do we have the three Stooges, Bush, Cheney, and Powell, running things? <br />
<br />
Bottom line, when attempting to justify a WAR to the nation, you better be damn sure your ducks are in a row.  You're asking people to go off and DIE for you.  Americans are DYING every day in Iraq and apparently just to make it a &quot;better&quot; place to live since none of the &quot;threats&quot; turned out to be real.  Well, I hate to tell you, but you don't have the right to expect reservists to go off and fight and die to make another country a &quot;better&quot; place to live.  That ain't their job.<br />
<br />
If i was Bush i would'nt even bother trying to get them involved after they turned us down the first time. I would remember though, when another incident occures and the UN asked the U.S. for help, i'd have to say thanks but no thanks we'll stear clear. The same would apply to the countrys that have turned down the U.S. in the current situation.<br />
<br />
Well, in retrospect, it seems perfectly reasonable for the Nations of the world to have turned us down.  Bush was telling everyone that Iraq had a huge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.  Apparently these other nations had intelligence services telling them differently.  They appear to have been right, Bush appears to have been wrong.   And be honest, thinking back didn't it seem that Bush was a little too determined that come hell or high water America was going to invade Iraq with or without the support of other nations?  He didn't even seem to really want their involvement and didn't do much beyond a token amount of persuasion before just going ahead on his own.  It almost seems that Bush took a &quot;don't confuse me with the facts, I've made up my mind&quot; stance on invading Iraq before he had even considered attempting to involve other nations.  It was almost as though he had already determined that he would give Iraq &quot;a fair trial, and then hang them&quot;.<br />
<br />
What pisses Americans off is that they went to the world and said &quot;hey, could you lend a hand?&quot; And the world said, &quot;no.&quot;  It's more the fact that the other nations turned the U.S. down cold rather than whether or not the action we wanted them to help with was truly justified.  And before anyone makes the terrorist connection, there isn't one.  Saddam was suspected of supporting terrorists, true.  But so is over half of the Arab world.  Even our &quot;close&quot; ally Saudia Arabia has been suspected of supporting terrorists and no one is purposing to invade them.  Saddam was never shown to be directly connected to Osama, also ture.  Saddam was never shown to have been directly connected to the 9/11 attacks AT ALL.  Anything connecting Osama and Saddam has been pure speculation.  Plausible, but unproven.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy.  And I'm not saying that the world won't be a better place without him or that Iraq isn't better off without him.  Saddam was a horrible leader, a dictator of the worst kind, and a blight on the face of humanity.  But if those things alone are justifications for invading a country, there is a long list of countries we should be invading, and we're not.  Saddam was no better or worse than a couple of dozen other despots in the world who we completely and utterly ignore.  The big difference between Saddam and those other despots was Saddam ruled a country with large oil deposits, Bush Sr. had failed to remove Saddam from power previously when he had the chance, we knew we could succeed because we'd done it before, and Bush Jr. decided he had an ax to grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nader may be the best canidate but in all reality will he get elected? NO. <br />
Heres my theory of why Nader is running. <br />
<br />
He was told or talked into running to sway those precious few votes. If anyone dont think this could be possible for someone to be &quot;persuaded&quot; to do something like this, then you dont understand what the political system is really capible of.<br />
<br />
Again, for the CURRENT situation, i dont think there will be a draft. Now if something else pops up, like say ummmm...North Korea? then yes i can almost bet there would be a draft, but North Korea isn't as stupid as most think they are. If they started there shit up, we'd hand there asses back to them and they know that, they just like to &quot;test the waters&quot; every now and then.<br />
<br />
On the subject of Selective Service being forced Gerick, i dont mean to sound rude but where the hell have you been hideing? Regestering with the Selective Service has been MANDATORY for quite some time. I dont know about females but every male that reaches the age of 18 is required to register, i know i got the little card in the mail as soon as i turned 18, and had to fill it out and send it in.<br />
Maybe the laws regarding regestering with the selective service have changed? I'd have to do some research but i think its still a mandatory thing.<br />
<br />
On the topic of being a reservist..<br />
<br />
If your military (the one that YOU, and i can not stress the &quot;YOU&quot; enough, agreed to join) deems you as &quot;absofuckinlootly&quot; being needed. Then its simple....YOU go. <br />
Again reservist does not = FREE RIDE<br />
<br />
I seen this happen in &quot;90/91&quot; when i was in Iraq. So damn many little cry babys thinking that they should'nt have to go to war because they were a &quot;reservist&quot;. I heard alot of people whining &quot; I didnt join the Army reserves to go to war, i joined for an education&quot; WTF nonsence is that?<br />
<br />
Its really a simple equasion, let me clarify it...<br />
<br />
Reserves = Army/Navy/AirForce/Marines = United States Armed Forces = Posibilitys of war....<br />
<br />
If &quot;reservists&quot; cant figure that one out, i really dont know how to explain it any better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Reserves = Army/Navy/AirForce/Marines = United States Armed Forces = Posibilitys of war....<br />
<br />
Agreed.  There are really two responsibilities involved.  Reservists have the responsibility to serve if called and even potentially die for their nation.  Sometimes duty sucks, but it's what you signed up for.  However there is also a responsibility on the part of the government to use reservists reasonably and responsibily and not &quot;squander&quot; patriots on bullshit.  Patriots, people willing to die if need be to defend the nation, are a precious commodity not to be frittered away.</div></div><hr />

Common Sense is a precious commodity these days. I agree with you 100% and can only help swat those people in the head with you for even thinking that if you join the military reserves that...&quot;OMG THIS AIN'T JUST TUITION!!1! I MIGHT GET CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY&quot;.<br />
<br />
And yeah; i rememebr my 18th birthday and my dad dragging me down to the post office at 6:30 AM to wait in line to go sign up for the Selective Service. T'Was a Right of Passage back than.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not going to sit here and debate wether this war or that war was justified. Hell, thats something that could be debated till the end of time, but for you to say the above quote just boggles my mind  :confused: PLEASE make me understand what it is about the reserves that make them people think they should not have to go to war if there country deems it necessary?<br />
<br />
Is it the individual in the reserves that should determine if they should go help out? No, its the military machine. <br />
<br />
If you want to steer clear as much as totally possible from being directly involved in a war its very simple! Dont &quot;volunteer&quot; for the reserves.<br />
<br />
Maybe this thinking of just because Joe X is in the reserves dont mean he should have to help his country in a time of need is a generational issue? Probably not but it is defenatly Patriotic Issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the reason that men like me would tell the government to fuck off if they even tried to draft my ass.<br />
<br />
I've got no problems protecting myself, my family, and the land I live on, but you can fucking forget about playing international fucking peacekeeper and dying by the droves EACH FUCKING DAY for zero accomplishment.  Iraq is the Vietnam of our lifetime, and it's a fucking travesty.  I stopped watching the news reports of how many men have died in Iraq now, for what?  For jack and shit apparantly.  This administration is never going to accomplish what it thinks it's going to accomplish in Iraq, so why the fuck do we have men giving their lives for this cause?  Some people can say that their Grandfather died on the beach of Normandy liberating France...what the fuck are the kids in 20 years going to say about this?  My dad took an RPG up the ass in Iraq because the president was a trigger happy dipshit?<br />
<br />
This military action in other countries doesn't squelch terrorism, it fucking creates it.  It creates it every day when more people get the means to stand up to the Americans invading their homeland and trying to tell them how to live their lives.<br />
<br />
This sums it up nicely -- http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/tshirt.php?sku=a291</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hate the Goverment of the United States of America. Yes im American but i do believe that the government in this country is the most crooked political entity in the world. <br />
BUT! i do 1000% suport the men and women that this government send to wars. <br />
<br />
Agree with your position on this (I dislike rather than hate the current US gov though). The war is not the same thing as the people-soldiers fighting it.<br />
<br />
Please don't bash on reservists guys.  There is a huge difference in getting called up for active duty vs being kept out indefintely.  The 30 something crowd here can appreciate what it would be like with wife and kids to be gone that long.  Reservists are != regular troops.  Just becuase folks raise the point that they should not be indefinately deployed DOES NOT mean they are asking for a free ride.<br />
<br />
There will be a draft.  My opinion is based only on the basis of logistics.  The military structure we have is still based on post cold war principles...aka the reserves were exactly that reserves.  In order to keep a standing army in Iraq (which will need to scope up from its 125k man complement) more resources will be required. Also logistically there will be no solution to Iraq that will take less than 5 years to complete...again my opinion only.<br />
<br />
So with a 5 year+ window and a limited resource pool there really are only 2 alternatives; more US presence (aka draft as reserves will be exhausted) or increased international assistance.  With Rumsfeld, Bush and Cheney having effectively alienated/humiliated France, Russia, China, Germany, the UN in general over the last 2 years (old Europe anyone?) I would expect the second alternative to not be viable.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact the only reservist I can think of who got a &quot;free ride&quot; was George W. Bush (not his old man who actually flew combat).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 This military action in other countries doesn't squelch terrorism, it fucking creates it. <br />
<br />
Agree. For every person killed that leaves a 10-13 year old boy with no direction you create another enemy.  Wait 10 years until those boys will grow up.  Creating an army of future suicide bombers was exactly what this country didn't need.<br />
<br />
 PLEASE make me understand what it is about the reserves that make them people think they should not have to go to war if there country deems it necessary? <br />
<br />
I think the distinction is not going to war or not but being deployed indefinately.  The role of the reserves has traditionally been to do support and logistics during war (see Vietnam, desert Storm  etc) with a regular rotation.  The problem right now is that designed rotation is not occurring...this is the hardship being brought on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but you can fucking forget about playing international fucking peacekeeper and dying by the droves EACH FUCKING DAY for zero accomplishment. Iraq is the Vietnam of our lifetime, and it's a fucking travesty.<br />
<br />
I totally agree that Iraq is all a political game, just like Vietnam was and just like Korea was, but that dont change the fact that if you sign up, be it the reserves or full time military, that you HAVE to know that at some point in time you could be called to serve your country.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I am saying is this, when you give up your right to make your own decisions to the government, you have every reasonable right to expect them to make the best possible use of you and not be dumbasses.  Does that mean if they're being dumbasses you don't have to serve?  Absolutely not, you signed on the dotted line, you made the obligation, you should follow through.  But if the government is being dumbasses, it means we the voters need to give them a good swift kick in the head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If &quot;reservists&quot; cant figure that one out, i really dont know how to explain it any better?<br />
<br />
<br />
Selective service meaning the new bill, not what we have currently, i shall explain<br />
<br />
Under this new bill, everyone, women included, MUST do 2 years of military service OR, community service between the ages of 17 to 30.<br />
<br />
here are my beefs<br />
<br />
1) 17 year old to 21 year old cant even have a fucking beer, why should they be off killing? im sorry that you lost your leg in the second great bush war, but you cant have a beer lil trooper.<br />
<br />
2) Every single person has to be evalutated, have a medical record, have a phycological evaluation, and take all the shots the military thinks is healthy, when time and again it has been proven that overstimulation of the immune system can retard brain functions down the road, this is the key reason for the massive increase of mental disorders and learning disorders in the last 50 years, more manditory shots, my other beef in the same line of gold, is that who is going to pay for all this?<br />
<br />
3) even if you plan to do your 2 years of service at 29 and 30, you can and WILL be pulled in and made to fight if a war starts up, anyone in the 17 to 30 area becomes a recruit, this is why i say stealth draft, they dont even have to pull lotterys<br />
<br />
4) everyone will eather become nothing better than a criminal(community service is almost always a thing people have to do as punishment, spending my week end to be a slave laborer for uncle greed isnt my idea of a good country, they could make driving a bus, paving highways community service, it would start to cut into jobs people need for money) or have been force fed military indoctrine, i DONT want a sparta mind set, and i dont want my fucking kids to be forced onto one eather<br />
<br />
5) you dont get payed, you get small tax credits, unless you go into combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
This whole bill is to &quot;increase moral awarness, and make young americans &quot;pay a price&quot;&lt;aside, what the fuck are taxes dipshits?&gt;<br />
<br />

<br />
Let me start by saying that EVERY middle east country absolutely hates America. When you teach your children right from wrong, they grow up knowing what is right and what is wrong. They know that stealing is wrong and helping the little old lady across the street is right.<br />
<br />
When middle east children are tought right from wrong, there taught that hateing America is right, straping a suicide belt around there waste at the age of 18 and blowing up inocent people for the sake of there religon is right, and what we call radical Islam is right.<br />
<br />
How do you stop this spread of hatred thats taught to these children from a very early age, generation after generation?<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, i can see only one way, and it would involve another world war more than likely....<br />
<br />
Total ocupation of the entire middle east, set up &quot;political re-education camps&quot; just like the Japeniese did, and the Chinese still do, and make every individual mandatorly attend these camps.<br />
<br />
In simple terms, there brains are not wired up like most rational thinking peoples are. They keep teaching the same shit generation after generation. Thus the hatred will never stop. &quot;rewireing&quot; there way of thinking is the only solution, and politics and politicians will never convince them in any other way.<br />
No &quot;middle east peace pact&quot; or &quot;roadmap to peace&quot; is ever going to acomplish shit.<br />

I've got no problems protecting myself, my family, and the land I live on, but you can fucking forget about playing international fucking peacekeeper and dying by the droves EACH FUCKING DAY for zero accomplishment.  Iraq is the Vietnam of our lifetime, and it's a fucking travesty.  I stopped watching the news reports of how many men have died in Iraq now, for what?  For jack and shit apparantly.  This administration is never going to accomplish what it thinks it's going to accomplish in Iraq, so why the fuck do we have men giving their lives for this cause?  Some people can say that their Grandfather died on the beach of Normandy liberating France...what the fuck are the kids in 20 years going to say about this?  My dad took an RPG up the ass in Iraq because the president was a trigger happy dipshit?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, as a side note to all this, I see a very interesting situation brewing on the horizone with regards to constitutional law.  The Supreme Court of the United States will probably be hearing a couple of different cases involving the Bush administration and the long term confinement of people, in and out of the U.S.  Given the recent news regarding the abuse of prisoners held at Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, it will be very interesting to see how the Supreme Court decides.  Constitutional protections are in place specifically to prevent exactly the kind of abuses that are suspected to have occured.  Now, will the Supreme Court decide against the Bush administration and for due process or will it side with the Bush administration and open up a precedent where U.S. Presidents can avoid due process restrictions if they classify someone as a &quot;terrorist threat&quot;?  Doesn't that kind of sound like a blank check to arrest anyone you want as long as you call them a terrorist?  And I recently read in the paper that a guy was being charged with &quot;making terrorist threats&quot; because he was threatening to shoot someone.  So basically anyone who commits violence or threatens violence is now a terrorist and doesn't necessarily get due process?  A chilling thought to say the least.<br />
<br />
The Bush administration, as far as I'm concerned, has spit in the face of traditional constitutional protections that are fundamental to the very concept of freedom our reservists are fighting and dying to protect.<br />
<br />
The reason there are checks and balances within the government is because no single branch of government can be fully and completely trusted to always be run by reasonable people.  The founding fathers knew this, and it scared the bejesus out of them.  Which is why they went to such great lengths to place restrictions on all branches of government, including the executive branch, aka the President.  If Bush gets his way, a significant restriction on Presidential power will be very easy to side step.    The founding fathers very specifically did not want people jailed indefinitely without a trial and with no opportunity for bail.  Being locked away in a prison forever for unspecified crimes with little or no proof and without the benefit of ever having a trial was something they very specifically wanted stopped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree 100% with the above quote, BUT...is it your determination if and when you are needed? NO its the militarys.<br />

This makes me want to fuckin VOMMIT! Its all good and you like your freedom untill your country needs you, then you'll run for the hills. NOTHING is FREE, everything comes with a price, even your freedom that you so much enjoy. All i can say is have fun in Canida.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally agree that Iraq is all a political game, just like Vietnam was and just like Korea was, but that dont change the fact that if you sign up, be it the reserves or full time military, that you HAVE to know that at some point in time you could be called to serve your country.<br />
<br />
here is what makes me vomit, we WERE not and ARE not being invaded, therefor my country DOES NOT need me, or haass or anyone, if you want to start a war in another country you have to be willing to back off, not make troops commit suicide, this is why this is another Nam, forgive the slang and the bluntness but thats what it is, we are sitting ducks<br />
<br />
the draft is there for self defense, thats why it was written in, our country is one about keeping military power for defensive purpose, not offensive, and that is were the abuse of power is.<br />
<br />
so as you know, im not in the reserve, but i stand by what i said about being fucked, extended duty, being used in a none supportive role, unfair medical benefits(people are having depleted uranium sickness and not getting treated)<br />
<br />
thing is i see the stealth draft coming, just like i saw the patriot act coming, and like congress did the with patriot act they wont read the whole thing(they even have several people admit they didnt read it all)<br />

I'm sure you're right.  But I have to admit I've always found the inconsistancy to be rather interesting.  We can't trust our young men to have a drink if they're under 21 years old, but we'll let them drive a tank or carry an M16?  I don't know, but it seems to me that if you trust someone enough to let them carry military weapons or drive heavy armor you should maybe trust them enough to have a drink or two in public (outside a base)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Senate Bill http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:SN00089: was proposed by Sen Hollings, Ernest F. [SC] (introduced 1/7/2003) who is a Democrat<br />
<br />
House Bill http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:HR00163:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp; was propsed by Rep Rangel, Charles B. [NY-15] (introduced 1/7/2003)  who is a Democrat<br />
<br />
Both of these coming from the site listed in the topic starters post.  Both also introduced almost 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Rangel is an interesting man.  He proposed this bill post 9/11 on the premise it would force ALL american's to serve and not just minorities; his premise being that minorities are over represented in the armed services becuase of socio-economic issues (aka they are poor) and would bear much of the cost of any war's Bush would start.<br />
<br />
Not saying I agree with him but figure you might some context why he introduced that bill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Rangel is an interesting man.

<br />
Well it seems to me that if the issue is that more poor people join the military as a way of escaping poverty, rather than making rich, middle class, and poor alike all have to join the military, the easy answer is offer other ways out of poverty.  People should be joining the military voluntarily because they have the urge to serve, not because there are monetary incentives or because they think they'll get an education out of it.  I'm not saying those things shouldn't be offered, but if they join only because they want out of poverty or because they think they'll get an education, they're going to be really surprised when someone expects them to actually go out and shoot at people, and be shot at themselves.<br />
<br />
And some people just aren't cut out for the military.  They can never &quot;conform&quot; enough to make it.  Should we be dooming those people to a dishonorable discharge and a blot on their record for something they didn't even want to do to begin with?  Seems to be kind of counter productive to me.  Particularly with no national emergency on the table.</div></div><hr />

I was simply stating that im tired of beating the proverbial dead horse. There is no solution only opinions, and you know what they say about opinions?  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ragnarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My problem is that I believe a person ought to have a choice whether or not they join the military.  This country is based on freedom to choose and forcing people to join will in the long run hurt this country more than help it.  If they want to increase the amount of people in the military they need to look at increasing pay, better benefits for joining, and other incentive increases that make the military look more attractive.<br />
<br />
Another problem I forsee is how in the hell if something like this passed are they going to enact it??  Are they going to just ship half the country off to do military service at once.  How is this going to effect businesses and the economy with half the workforce having to take 2 years off to go into this??  How are dual income families like myself going to afford keeping a house and not go into a brankrupt state while either myself or my wife gets shipped off for 2 years making jack and shit in pay IF ANY??<br />

<br />
Now back to the original topic.<br />
<br />
Flair,<br />
<br />
I don't have a clue as to why Rangel introduced this bill.  I was relating this to the subject of accusing Bush of reinstating the draft when in fact the bills that everyone are using to attack Bush were in fact proposed by 2 Democrats almost 2 years ago.  I don't agree with alot that Bush has done, but I don't like people attacking someone else on false pretenses.  My thought after realizing that 2 Democrats proposed these bills was maybe they are pre planning for when Kerry gets into office and the plan he has on a topic relating to this subject here:<br />

<br />
No sir...that was why I posted why I did.  I was actually watching CSPAN that day (yes I am a geek).  I'm not saying Rangel is right either.  Just pointing out there are shades of grey to the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Personally, I support conscription only if there is no other choice.  And then I support a conscription process that would force all economic classes to participate (so the Bush &amp; Clinton girls could serve too).  The problem with the Vietnam era conscription is that it was biased; that getting a deferral was alot easier if you were rich and powerful (see Dick Cheney &amp; others from both political parties).<br />
<br />
To be honest, we will need conscription before this all is over with.  Iraq has an intertia all its own and short of us picking a strongman and propping him up (aka a Saddam jr or another Shah of Iran) there is no exit strategy.  We will not allow a religious body to rule and the only secular body that existed were the Bathists.  This leaves little ground for democracy to take hold.  However, withdrawl is not an option now either, to step out would make Iraq itself the martyr for every want-to-be terrorist.<br />
<br />
This is were the current leadeship of our country is wrong.  Ideals in this case are taking precedence over reality...the reality is that democracy runs completely against the grain of the society we are trying to &quot;pacify&quot;.  We have a world class military apparatus trying to play police man in a state we dont understand.  For every bit of collatoral damage we inflict we make our situation worse.  <br />
<br />
Yes this all sounds like the evening news.  But the reality is that someone needs to tell Americans that we will need to suffer-sacrifice much much much more before this is all over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I think that the whole thing about the poor is just and excuse, to make the poor think they can get a shot in at the elite of the country, to be honest it is really about making sure everyone gets under uncle sams eye, have a record, have their shots, and have a &quot;patriotic&quot; mind set, that or do community service(slave labor)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fear you may be right.  I'm deathly afraid that George Bush and Dick Cheney have gotten America into the deep end of the pool and we're not sure how to swim.  Everything seemed peachy when we were wading around the shallow end.  The justification for going into Iraq was tenuous and weak from the beginning.  And it's proven to be even weaker under close examination.  Yet, now that we're there, what do we do?  How do we get out without leaving a completely governmentally devoid wasteland behind where some strong man or religious zealot quickly fills the void?  How do we manage to leave Iraq at least marginally better off than before we went in, as at least some moral justification for the actions of our nation?  How do we leave with our national dignity intact?  And how do we do all this without sacraficing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of American lives on the alter of political expediency?<br />
<br />
I don't see an easy solution.  I don't even see a difficult solution.  I just see a 100,000+ American troops occupying a nation that will become more and more hostile to us as time goes on with no end in sight.  And that will form a rallying point for all the American haters in the Arab world for the forseeable future.  Every solider they kill they will claim is a victory.  Every drop of American blood they spill will be a sign of our weakness in their eyes.  Yet, short of killing them all, how do we somehow manage to negotiate some form of co-existence?  I really think we'd have been far better off if Bush had thought this through a couple of dozen times and then dropped the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

Up until 1982, active duty military personnel could consume alcoholic beverages, while on any federal military installation, regardless of state drinking age laws.<br />
<br />
In 1982, Congress passed a law which required military bases to comply with state drinking age laws, except in cases where the base was within 100 miles of a border with a lower drinking age.<br />

Huh?  I was never a big Clinton fan, but how exactly did the Clinton Administration start the invasion of Iraq?  How did the Clinton Administration mislead and misinform the public about weapons of mass distruction in Iraq and conjecture about Iraqi ties to Osama bin Laden?  How did the Clinton Administration initiate huge lock ups of people, some of which are American citizens, expecting to have no oversight by other governmental branchs and to be required to follow none of the due processes requirements that are a fundamental cornerstone to constitutional law?<br />
<br />
I certainly respect that you're currently serving in the military.  And you're entirely entitled to your opinion to vote for Bush over Kerry, that's your right as an American.  But I see nothing that seriously ties Clinton into the major issues of the day.  Bush made his bed all by himself.  At most he might be able to try and claim that the current state of the economy is Clinton's fault.  But when Clinton was in office the economy was reasonably strong, the national debt was on the decrease, and the yearly deficit was going down.  In comes Bush and the rich get a huge tax break, military spending goes through the roof, the yearly deficit is off the charts, and the national debt is sky rocketing.  Normally I'm not a real advocate of the democrats, but if they're supposed to be the &quot;tax and spend&quot; party, why is it a republican administration that is spending like there is no tomorrow?<br />
<br />
Sorry, if you want to lay this all at Clinton's feet your going to have to do a little better than that.</div></div><hr />

As for how this has to do with the Clinton administration, it was his constant pandering to the radicals, making sure nothing would happen while he was in office, to secure his place in history as a 'non-catastrophic' President, which didn't happen anyway.

George W Bush, while not the brightest cookie in the jar, or even the villiage idiot of the jar, entered his Presidency right as events were coming to a curb. It was only a year afterward when 9/11 occured... He entered in damage control, much like Gov. Schwartzenegger (sp?), and the faults of his predecessor followed him into office.

You certainly give a lot of credit for successful subterfuge to a man who couldn't even keep it secret he was getting a little oral gratification on the side.  If he couldn't get that swept under the rug, and he clearly tried, then why should we believe he was competent enough to sweep all the other things under the rug you seem to think he did?<br />
<br />
Bill Clinton was a liar and perjured himself to a grand jury.  He had many faults as a President and as a man, but  Bush Jr. has not been victimized by the evil mechanations of the Clinton administration.  He's very much a self made man. <br />
<br />
And speaking of Gray Davis, please note the Bush was of absolutely no assistance during the energy debacle in California.  The power companies systematically looted the state coffers of California and not only was Gray Davis unwilling and unable to stop them, he got bubkas in the way of assistance from Bush.  And of course it must be a complete coincidence that many of Bush's friends and associates have ties directly or indirectly to power generation companies.  The very same power generation companies that played the power market in California by doing things like intentionally closing down power plants for &quot;maintenance&quot; during periods they knew would be peak demands for power.  They intentionally manipulated the power market in a number of ways so they could make obscene and illegal profits and no one did a damn thing about it.</div></div><hr />

Bush didn't actually &quot;do&quot; anything, which is the point.  He said that it was a home grown problem requiring home grown solutions and washed his hands of it.  The Federal Energy Commission (I believe that's the right organization, forgive me if I've got the department wrong) could have stepped in and mandated that prices stabalize for a period of time while things were investigated and solutions determined.  It didn't.  Bush refused to tell it to.<br />
<br />
I recall during the recovery in Florida after one of the big hurricanes came through that people were trying to do things like charge $10 for a gallon of fresh water.  And when those people were caught, they were brought up on profiteering charages.  Dictionary definition of profiteering: The making of a large profit in an unfair way.  So when some poor schmoe wants to be a dumbass and charge $10 for a gallon of water, lets prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law!  But when power companies systematically do something similar to an entire state, lets look the other way!  Bush is supposed to be the head of the executive branch of the government.  His primary duties include the enforcement of law, enforcement of the constitution on which all law is based,  and the protection of the American people.  When he walks away from an entire state, without even an attempt to form a reasonable resolution, that's an indication of a real problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On contrare.  Congress controls the allocation of the budget.  Not the President.  The President presents a budget, but the final result usually only bares a vague similarity to his proposal.  So military cutbacks are the responsibility of Congress.  While the huge current  military expenditures are the direct result of the President commiting the armed forces to a conflict that Congress has little choice but to provide the money to support.  They certainly can't very well say, &quot;sorry Mr. President, but we won't provide the financial support for the 175,000 troops you've decided to commit to an ill adviced military action that has turned out to be poorly justified and kind of embarrassing.&quot; <br />
<br />
And of course Clinton had no reason to envision that military would need to be geared up in preparation for an Iraqi invasion and occupation.  He certainly had no way of predicting the 9/11 attacks and the Bush &quot;war on terrorism&quot;.<br />
<br />
You see, you do not normally keep an armed forces prepared for invasion unless you're an aggressor nation.  Is America supposed to be an aggressor nation?  Is it our intention to be prepared at all times to invade another country and maintain long term occupation of it at any time?  Or are we going to keep an armed forces designed to defend our national interests?  Which typically means limited military operations for limited durations in various parts of the world and having a military designed to support that?</div></div><hr />

Maybe because he realized that the appropriate way to deal with situations in the world is NOT thru a military operation.  This is a path that we shouldn't be going down.<br />

You're absolutely right, what goes on in the oval office is our business.  All of our business.  But that isn't much of an arguement supporting your proposition that Bill Clinton managed to leave behind the illusion of a Nation in relatively good order with a decent working economy when in fact it was a ticking bomb for incoming George Bush.<br />
<br />
I won't argue against the statement that Bill Clinton was unethical.  But Bill Clinton being unethical isn't proof that George Bush is a good President.  Bill Clinton being unethical isn't proof that he seriously screwed things up but managed to completely disguise them to the public and left George Bush holding the bag.  There are a number of very specific things that George Bush has done to make the situation as truly messed up as it is that Bill Clinton had absolutely nothing to do with, unless you're going to claim that Bill is using a secret mind ray to influence George's decisions?<br />

One of the major problems is that the system is corrupt, from top to bottom.  You can't do anything without significant amounts of money.  Most of the money comes from special interests, corporations primarily.  So if you want to be in politics you have to take someones money. And there is always a quid pro quo expected.  If you don't deliver, or promise to deliver, the money dries up and you have little or no chance of success.   Much of the time the choice for the American voter comes down to a decision as to which crook we want to see in office.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put simply, its to prevent the most populus states from running roughshod over the rest of the states.<br />
<br />
States - you may remember that our nation is an interesting entity: a union of independant states.  Why would a state want to join our union?  I can think of lots of reasons, provided that state gets a representative say in the government of the nation.  But if a state is given very little say in this government, why would it want to join?  Why should Wyoming join, if California is going to have 100X more power?<br />
<br />
If we moved to a strictly popular vote system, the top 9 states population-wise (18% of the states) would hold just over 51% of the power.  18% holding 51% of the power.. now tell me why you would want to join the Union if you;re wyoming, under such a system.<br />
<br />
If we worked under a strictly electoral system (1 state, 1 vote), then those same 9 states (18% of the states) would hold 18% of the power.  Wyomings happy, but now CA is pissed off.<br />
<br />
Under the current system, we have a compromise.. just barely.  Its almost entirely a popular vote, with a tiny concession towards an electoral system.  Under the current system, those top 9 states (18%) hold 47% of the power.<br />
<br />
If I were a popular-vote fan, Id keep my trap shut before people start actually looking at the numbres.  Because the current compromise is HEAVILY skewed in your favor.  Those 9 states deserve 18% of the power, but they get 47%.</div></div><hr />

This is a weak copout because of a weak argument and totally untrue.  God is an entity thats existence, or lack their off, can never be conclusively proven.  Faith, by definition, excludes concrete knowledge or fact.  Politics on the other hand are here and tangible.  People have many and various positions on politics, but it can be discussed and definitive conclusions come to.<br />
<br />
So you can say that you don't agree with someone elses opinion, or you can just give up and go away because you lack a strong arguement, but you can't say that it is pointless to discuss politics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">The reason for the electoral college is not something that can be expressed in a witty one-liner. However, this much can be said quickly - it doesnt have a damn thing to do with not being able to count all the votes.<br />
<br />
I knew there was a good reason for the electoral college to be setup the way it is, but I just couldn't think of what it was.  Something to keep in mind is this, the founding fathers, the guys who put together the Constitution on which our system of government is based were some of the finest minds of their time.  Many of them were extremely savy and intelligent men.  And they fought it out hammer and tongs to come up with the end result that has been used for over 200 years.  It works.  Tamper with it at your own peril.  Most of what's in it is there for extremely good reasons.  Once people actually start messing around with the Constitution, all bets are off.<br />
<br />
It's a relatively simple and easy to read document that can be understood by anyone willing to take the time to bother.  It covers a lot of ground.  And I do not believe that there is a comparable group of men alive today that could compete with the abilities of the founding fathers to foresee, predict, and account for the many possibilities they did.  Frankly, as government documents go, it's a work of art.  And no one would suggest that it was a good idea to go and improve the Mona Lisa, would they?</div></div><hr />

That's not completely true Haass.  States count for a lot, particulary in congress.  Congressmen are attempting to get just a bit more of the pie for their state all the time.  One of the big problems with pork barrel politics, where every Congressmen makes sure their constituency gets a big healthy chunk of money for their state, is it isn't about fair.  It isn't about reasonable.  It's about bringing home the bacon so you get re-elected regardless of whether or not that bacon is really something that state needs.<br />
<br />
And there is a broad broad difference in opinions from national region to national region.  The House of Representatives was set up to represent the states by population, but the Senate is there specifically so that every state has equal representation.  There are lots of things that would be law these days, probably to the detriment of the smaller states, if there was only the House of Representatives.<br />
<br />
For example, if the more populous states got together and decided to impose an additional tax if you lived in a state below a set population, how would the less populous states stop them if they didn't have an equal voice?  Checks and balances, it's all about checks and balances.  Even the electoral college.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glatius, first off, I respect you a lot, and I enjoy debating with you.<br />
<br />
Second of all, I'm aware of how congress works, but that's not how we need to pick &quot;The Man.&quot;  Congress passes laws, and for that purpose, the system is fine.  But we're not passing a law here, we're picking a figurehead and the most powerful man in america.  In that regard, I see zero tangible reason for the election of this man to be in the hands of the 435 (?  Been awhile) members of congress rather than the population of America, and as long as more than 50% of the population is not residing in a single state, there will be plenty of checks and balances.  People of a single state are not the people they were in 1750.  States aren't made of basically one village of people who decided to set sail for the new land, they're now incredibly diverse bodies of people who come from all areas.  Fuck, even somewhere as backwoods as minnesota has a heavy Scandanavian base, with plenty of Krauts to fill in the gaps, and on top of that, lately there's been an influx of african and hispanic immigrants to the area.  We're not talking about me and my family and the people related to and descended from my great grandfather getting a disproportionate say in the government here, we're talking about different people from different cultures with different ideas, all being spoken for by a handful of mostly wealthy white males.  Now where the fuck are the checks and balances in that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">It's interesting that this topic has begun discussing how things were during the founding fathers era, because I've been thinking that it seems like our country is turning into the very thing we were trying to get away from in coming here.  <br />
 <br />
I don't want to live in a country that makes drastic life decisions for me.  I don't want to fight wars for people that are interested only in their ego and their back pocket.  It sounds like I'm talking about Saddam huh?  I also want the right to my own personal privacy and I want the right to due process.  There is no way you can trust the government to give you these in the current conditions.<br />
 <br />
I have no problem fighting for human rights and freedom.  I have no problem fighting to protect what is mine or even what is my neighbors.  But I have a problem fighting for ... nothing.  Give me one good reason to give my life in this situation.<br />
 <br />
And don't give me any crap about patriotism.  There's a difference between fighting for your country and fighting for nothing.  On top of that, this country does not currently represent one that I would want to support.  Our morals are in the gutter, our constitution is being trashed by incompetent dunces, and our human rights are being systematically taken away.<br />
 <br />
Terrorism is doing exactly what the terrorists want it to do.  It's A.) making us unreasonably paranoid and B.) taking away our civil rights (indirectly).<br />
 <br />
The worst thing about this situation is that even if you could get enough of America to come to its senses and act upon the situation, the ramifications of what could happen is simply unstatable.  If we had a civil disruption in the U.S., terrorists would have a field day with us.<br />
 <br />
And about the electoral college ... you honestly don't think it's even in the least bit dated?  It is absolutely ridiculous that the majority of the country's votes were wasted.  It's stupid that we're told to excercise our rights and vote, but then you have a situation where my vote didn't mean anything.<br />
 <br />
Wish I could go to the Queen of Spain and say, &quot;Hey, I heard there's some good unclaimed real estate on Mars, can I have some cash and some ships to go check it out?&quot;  Maybe I'll name then the Nina, Pinta and the Santa Maria.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">What the fuck does it matter what im for? really...whos cares?<br />
<br />
I was simply trying to state to Gerick's totally wrong post that he seems to think just because its 2004 that we have means to tally votes correctly. We dont, the Florida fuck up is proof of that.<br />
<br />
I've been watching this post every day and here's what i get out of it.<br />
<br />
1. its pointless, arguing politics is always going to be pointless because everyone has there own points of view. Just like arguing religion is pointless.<br />
<br />
2. The majority of the posts including the opening post has been made by an 18 year old that (im sorry if i offend anyone) has absolutely no fucking clue. In his defence though i myself was 18 once and thought i knew everything about everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
im not wrong, i did leave a bit out, but the main reason for the electorals was because post was slow, it would be a royal bitch to get all the votes in one place, count them and then announce the new pres, once they thought up electoral colleges they thought to add differnt worths to them like we see today(and why we see the partys fight over florida but not new mexico)<br />
<br />
it would be rather rediculos for me to bring up the entire history of electoral colleges, besides, it'd make this thread another 4 pages longer<br />
<br />
thing is we cant hand count them, or use a punch card reader because they always claim human error, if you screw up your vote its your fault for being under educated, to claim someone has problems understanding how to vote because they are black is wrong, the REAL problem was JEB BUSH running the show over there, giving the voter purge list(one that shows who is barred from voting) to a private company who then upgraded petty crimes to felonys on their list on &quot;accident&quot;(even tho most &quot;accidents&quot; were poor black males, historly democrats)<br />
<br />
another accident was jeb personally putting illegable stamp on serveral hundred votes, also from poor young black males, even tho the votes were readable, and the person still had retained their right to vote<br />
<br />
anyhow we cant have ANY fair system till we stomp out this corruption<br />
<br />
there is a new version out of greg palasts &quot;the best democracy money can buy&quot; <br />
<br />
it explains the cliton smooth overs, the bush fuck ups, and the congressional grab ass going on, id suggest you take a look, me spouting little bits of it does no justice to the book</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">The Electoral College in Brief<br />
<br />
The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by Congress and election by popular vote. The electors are a popularly elected body chosen by the States and the District of Columbia on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November (November 2, 2004). The Electoral College consists of 538 electors (one for each of 435 members of the House of Representatives and 100 Senators; and 3 for the District of Columbia by virtue of the 23rd Amendment). Each State's allotment of electors is equal to the number of House members to which it is entitled plus two Senators. The decennial census is used to reapportion the number of electors allocated among the States. <br />
<br />
The slates of electors are generally chosen by the political parties. State laws vary on the appointment of electors. The States prepare a list of the slate of electors for the candidate who receives the most popular votes on a Certificate of Ascertainment. The Governor of each State prepares seven original Certificates of Ascertainment. The States send one original, along with two authenticated copies or two additional originals to the Archivist of the United States at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) by registered mail. The Certificates of Ascertainment must be submitted as soon as practicable, but no later than the day after the meetings of the electors, which occur on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December (December 13, 2004). The Archivist transmits the originals to NARA's Office of the Federal Register (OFR). The OFR forwards one copy to each House of Congress and retains the original. <br />
<br />
The electors meet in each State on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December (December 13, 2004). A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President and Vice President. No Constitutional provision or Federal law requires electors to vote in accordance with the popular vote in their State. <br />
<br />
The electors prepare six original Certificates of Vote and annex a Certificate of Ascertainment to each one. Each Certificate of Vote lists all persons voted for as President and the number of electors voting for each person and separately lists all persons voted for as Vice President and the number of electors voting for each person. <br />
<br />
If no presidential candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution provides for the presidential election to be decided by the House of Representatives. The House would select the President by majority vote, choosing from the three candidates who received the greatest number of electoral votes. The vote would be taken by State, with each State delegation having one vote. If no Vice Presidential candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the Senate would select the Vice President by majority vote, with each Senator choosing from the two candidates who received the greatest number of electoral votes. <br />
<br />
And:<br />
<br />
The States<br />
<br />
The United States Constitution and Federal law place certain responsibilities relating to the Presidential election upon State executives and the electors for President and Vice President. Neither the Constitution nor Federal law prescribe the manner in which each State appoints its electors other than directing that they be appointed on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November (November 2, 2004). The Constitution forbids a Senator, Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States from being appointed as an elector. <br />
<br />
In most States, the electors are appointed by state-wide popular election. The slate of electors for the candidate who receives the most popular votes is appointed. The slates of electors are generally chosen by the political parties. However, the States' laws vary on the appointment of electors. In Maine and Nebraska, two electors are chosen at-large by state-wide popular vote and the rest are selected by the popular vote in each congressional district. As a result, the electoral procedure in these States permits a split slate of electors to be chosen. <br />
<br />
After the general election, the Governor of each State and the Mayor of the District of Columbia prepare a Certificate of Ascertainment of the electors appointed (herein, the term &quot;Governor&quot; includes the Mayor of the District of Columbia). The Certificate of Ascertainment must list the names of the electors appointed and the number of votes received by each. It must also list the names of all other candidates for elector and the number of votes received by each. The Certificate must be signed by the Governor and carry the seal of the State. The format of the Certificate is not dictated by Federal law, but conforms to the law or custom of the submitting State. <br />
<br />
The Governor must prepare seven original Certificates of Ascertainment. One original, along with two authenticated copies (or two additional originals) must be sent by registered mail to the Archivist of the United States, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC 20408. The Certificates should be sent as soon as practicable after the election, but must be submitted to the Archivist no later than the day after the meetings of the electors, which occur on December 13, 2004. The other six originals must be delivered to the State's electors on or before December 13, 2004. <br />
<br />
On the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December (December 13, 2004), the electors meet in their respective States. The State legislature may designate where in the State the meeting will take place. It usually takes place in the State capital, often in the capitol building. At this meeting, the electors vote by ballot for President and Vice President. There must be distinct ballots for President and Vice President. The electors' votes are recorded on a Certificate of Vote. This Certificate must contain a list of all persons voted for as President and the number of electors voting for each. It must also contain a list of persons voted for as Vice President and the number of electors voting for each. The names of candidates receiving no electoral votes do not appear on the Certificate of Vote. <br />
<br />
There is no Constitutional provision or Federal law requiring electors to vote in accordance with the popular vote in their States. In the 1976 election, a Washington elector pledged to President Gerald Ford voted for Ronald Reagan. In the 1988 election, a West Virginia elector voted for Senator Lloyd Bentsen as President and for Governor Michael Dukakis as Vice President. But some state laws require electors to cast their votes according to the popular vote and provide that so-called &quot;faithless electors&quot; may be subject to fines or may be disqualified for casting an invalid vote and be replaced by a substitute elector. <br />
<br />
The format of the Certificate is not dictated by Federal law, but is determined by the law or custom of each State. Six original Certificates of Vote must be prepared by the electors. Each Certificate must be signed by all of the electors. One of the six Certificates of Ascertainment forwarded to the electors by the Governor must be attached to each of the six Certificates of Vote. Each of the six pairs of Certificates must be sealed and certified by the electors to be the list of votes of that State. <br />
<br />
The six pairs of Certificates are distributed as follows: <br />
 One, by registered mail, to the President of the United States Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC 20510; <br />
 Two, by registered mail, to the Archivist of the United States, National Archives and Records Administration, Office of the Federal Register (NF), 700 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20408; <br />
 Two to the Secretary of State of the State, one of which is held subject to the order of the President of the United States Senate, the other to be preserved by the Secretary for public inspection for one year; and <br />
 One to the chief judge of the Federal district court of the district in which the electors meet. <br />
<br />
Since there is a very short time between the meetings of the electors in the States and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, and the meetings of electors coincides with the December holiday mail season, it is imperative that these Certificates be delivered as soon as possible. After the Certificates of Ascertainment and Certificates of Vote are delivered to the appropriate persons, the States' functions in the electoral process are completed. <br />
<br />
The states are given a lot of leeway in how they elect electors and what those electors are required to do.  The founding fathers felt it was important to leave much of that decision making to the individual states.  Many people would argue that's still very important.  Even if you disagree with that, you have to admit that tampering with a process that works well far more often then it works poorly is something to do with caution.  Extreme caution.<br />
<br />
Edit:  And I respect you as well Haass, I hope I haven't seemed to indicate otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Zaknaafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">First of all I'd like to say I think this type of discussion is very beneficial, I'm glad Gerrick started it. There have been so many different aspects discussed here, I could probably go on and on with my point of view, but I'll just hit what's most important to me atm.<br />
<br />
I agree with Gerrick on the third party ticket, if there were a Libertarian candidate I might consider voting just to make a statement. As it is, with the electorate I really see no point in voting at all, as previously stated, Bush did not win the popular vote, the American people did not vote him into office, my vote is meaningless. <br />
<br />
I also agree with the point that incredible minds  put together our constitution, and wouldn't condone reshaping it on many counts, however there is a real problem with the electorate -- people (completely well versed on contemporary politics people) aren't voting. When the electorate was founded the public school system had not even begun ( I believe it was not until Jefferson's presidency that this was even seriously discussed if my history is correct), the majority of the country was uneducated and very willing to trust their more politically versed fellow countrymen to make these types of decisions for them. And those representatives did a good job standing up for our independence and freedoms. <br />
<br />
Now we have an educated America. There are ghettos in California as well as farming communities. There are urban communities and suburban communities. There is national mind control aka T.V. The  federal and state level senates and congresses represent the state. The president should be voted in by popular vote in this day and age.<br />
<br />
Now while I believe that my ballot vote is virtually meaningless, I do belive there is a way to have a real impact on change in this country in a direction each of us feels is important. Our real vote is ALWAYS with our $$. You disagree with deforestation of the rainforests in south america? sure casting a vote for the green party says something, but not giving McDonalds your $$ makes a much bigger statement! Everytime you spend a dollar you are supporting some type of influence in this world, pay attention to where your money go's and you will be voting everyday. <br />
<br />
Every time you spend money at McDonalds, you are supporting deforestation in south america to make room for cattle, on land that does not last more than a few years before it is used up and more rainforest has to be destroyed, this is a vote AGAINST the greenparty, and much more powerful than your ballot vote for the green party. This is the only issue that is widely known that i can think of atm,<br />
 but there are many more examples of how people vote for one thing on the ballot, but vote for an entirely different thing with their money EVERYDAY.<br />
<br />
anyway, that's my addition to this thread. My belief is your ballot vote is worthless, your $$ is your real vote!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The country has changed alot since 1776.  We're no longer exploring an unknown land, we have mass communication and media means available to us, and the majority of us are not uneducated farm boys.  We're the single most powerful nation in the world, and because of the policies that are allowing certain individuals to obtain positions of power in this country, we're going from a country to be admiried by the world into the schoolyard bully....we don't like you?  We're gonna come over there and change you until we do like you.<br />
<br />
The Simpsons put it very well during the Clinton/Dole election when they said &quot;It's a 2 party system, you have to vote for one of us!&quot;  &quot;He's right!&quot;  The system is flawed, I don't care how long it's been in place.  When it's broken, it needs to be fixed.  You can see it clearly in the rules.  <br />
<br />
If no presidential candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution provides for the presidential election to be decided by the House of Representatives. The House would select the President by majority vote, choosing from the three candidates who received the greatest number of electoral votes. <br />
<br />
Even if there were 3 (or more, for that matter) candidates whom america was split evenly on, it wouldn't make a lick of difference, because the election would imediately go to whomever's party controlled congress, no discussion necessary.  The majority of people in this country know that their vote doesn't mean shit, that's why they don't bother going to the polls in november.  If it was really as much of a grand ability as the PSA's would lead you to believe, people wouldn't be doing that.  But the facts are clear....the common american believes that no matter what he says, his voice won't be heard.  That doesn't sound like a democracy to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">The president should be voted in by popular vote in this day and age.<br />
<br />
You know, this actually can already be done and is done on a state by state basis.  If each state felt it was important enough that the President and Vice President be selected solely on the popular vote they can quite easily set it up so only the electors go who represent the candidates who received the majority of the popular vote.  And they can make it a state law that they must vote in accordance with that popular vote.<br />
<br />
The problem is not that the electoral system can't 100% reflect the popular vote.  The problem is some states have decided that's not exactly how they want to do it.  They've decided that they'll split the electoral votes and allocate them according to the precentage each candidate receives.  So if two states have 4 electoral votes each, one state might give all 4 of their votes to the candidate who got the majority of the popular vote.  While the other might give 2 to the one with the majority of the popular vote, 1 to the second, and 1 to a third, or some other division.<br />
<br />
Could a federal law be made dictating to the states that only the electors who would vote for the candidate who received the majority of the popular vote in that state be sent to vote?  Absolutely.  The problem is, that law wouldn't make it through congress.  Lots of states like how they conduct their process on selecting the electors.  Many of them don't want the federal government dictating to them how it should be done.  If they did, this law would have been passed decades ago.<br />
<br />
As far as tampering with the constitution to do away with the electoral process altogether, isn't that kind of extreme given that there are other solutions much more easily implemented that would obtain the same results?  Tampering with the constitution invites more tampering with the constitution.  It has served us well.  There are other approaches short of that which would accomplish the same goals if those goals are universally desired.  But I think you'll find that they aren't.  Maybe that's wrong.  Maybe the process should reflect only the popular vote.  If that's true, it seems to me that the place to start making that happen is in your own particular state, if it doesn't do it already.  Not only is that an easier place to make the change, it also leaves the federal government out of it and leaves the constitution untouched.  Both of which are, at least in my eyes, very worthy goals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Imo Kerry defines what America should not be - socialist. <br />
<br />
How is John Kerry a socialist?  Another term thrown around loosely with no context.<br />
<br />
Is balancing the budget socialist? Is demanding a concrete plan before voting for an Iraq appropriations bill socilaist?  Is working with other world leaders socialist?  Is not insulting any other nation that doesnt listen to us socialist?<br />
<br />
As for Clinton.  At least during the 8 years he was president I had a strong real economy to look forward to.  Old man Bush ran the economy into the ground as has his son.<br />
<br />
Also, as militaries take time to build/dismantle...whose military just blew through Iraq like a piece of wet paper?  Thats right its Clinton's military created in the 90's...Bush can't even find money to give them a pay raise.  <br />
<br />
Let's see what is Bush not accountable for:<br />
<br />
- the economy...blames Clinton<br />
- Iraq: blames Clinton<br />
- 9/11: blames Clinton<br />
- the intelligence failures: blames the CIA<br />
- the defecit: there is no defecit the economy is &quot;strong and getting stronger&quot;<br />
- social security: democrats in the senate (even though Republicans have control)<br />
- high oil prices: hrmmm hasnt blamed anyone yet but its not his fault<br />
- the abuses by US soldiers in Iraq: not his fault, its un-american but hell we dont need to apologize<br />
- UN: blames the UN even though we didnt pay them 1.5 billion in payments becuase of the good Senator Helms<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically Bush owns responsibility for NOTHING. The idea that the commander in chief is responsible for EVERYTHING under his command doesn't apply. <br />

Then his campaign spins the fact that Kerry has 3 purple hearts as an issue against Kerry.  The exact same tactic they used against McCain.<br />
<br />
I'm not claiming that Kerry is the most wonderful candidate...but the measure of corruption and lack of accountablility with Bush, Cheney, Rumsfield, Rice etc all is just mind boggling.  And now the bastards are coming to New York to have their convention right around the anniversary of 9/11.  Crap makes me sick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
The thing is Haass, if you're going to do away with a system of government, you need to have something to replace it with unless you believe in complete anarchy and I'll assume you don't.  So, what is better than what we have?  What could we replace the constitution with that would be less prone to abuse by men of ill will?  What could we come up with in the way of a governmental system that wouldn't have, at the very least, the same exact flaws which allowed self serving men to accumulate and abuse power?  Is there system of government in the world that works better?  On what will be base this new government?  And how do you eliminate greed, ego trips, and intentional manipulation solely to benefit ones self from the equation?<br />
<br />
I forget who said it, but one of the founding fathers said, &quot;the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,&quot; or something very similar.  That eternal vigilance isn't just external vigilance though.  It's both internal and external.  If we want men in office who won't use the power of the office simply for their own benefit, we need to be willing to kick men out of office who are that way.  But we're not willing.  We're uninvolved.  We're lazy.  We don't want to be bothered.  We figure if that politician does enough that benefits us we can look the other way.  And then we blame our system of government as being the problem.  But ultimately it's not the system that is to blame.  It's that we're not willing, as a population, to put forth the thought and the effort necessary to clean it up.  Tearing it down won't do a lick of good if we go right back to ignoring the next system of government put in place.  You can't mandate honesty, integrity, and self sacrafice.  It's just not possible to make a law that will impose that kind of conduct on people.  You can't legislate morales.  All you can do is legislate for or against actions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what I'm saying is that people will be people.  Changing our system of government won't remove corruption.  It will just show up someplace else in some other way.  To remove corruption you have to actually teach people, when they're children, that corruption is wrong, and mean it.  And that won't completely remove it, but merely minimize it.  We don't really do that here in America, although we like to claim we do.  But every time you have a sports coach who nudges his players to do &quot;whatever it takes to win&quot; or you let children see that &quot;winning&quot; is more important than &quot;fair play&quot; you feed into greed and corruption.<br />
<br />
We have social issues that would need to be addressed.  If people are inherantly honest, then corruption rarely becomes a problem.  If they're not, it shows up in many ways by many avenues.  In a capitalistic society there is a tendency to put results ahead of the methods.  The goal is more important than how that goal is achieved.   I'm not saying that capitalism is inherantly wrong, but rather that when more emphasis is placed on money and power over morals and ethics, then capitalism goes from being a system where those who are willing to work the hardest and the smartest reap the biggest rewards to one where those who are willing to work the hardest, smartest, and lie, cheat, and steal reap the biggest rewards.  Case in point, see Enron.<br />
<br />
Throwing out the constitution and trying to start over won't change how people have learned to be.  And if you teach people differently, then you don't need to change the system of government because honest people will make honest government.</div></div><hr />

Its not about 'Yay Nebraska!'  Its not about the evil Californians trying to keep Utah down.  Its about the very easily demonstrable fact that there are major differences between the different states.<br />

Why do you think those top 9 states have the highest populations?  Do you honestly believe its because they have the same type of people (in socioeconomic trms) as the others, but they just have more?  No.  Sorry, but that aint the case.<br />
<br />
The reason those top 9 states have more people?  Cities.  Major Metropolitan Areas.  There are two Americas... the Rural Salt of the Earth, and the City Dwellers.<br />
<br />
Rural states, which would be heavly disadvantaged (more accurately, they would have no voice whatsoever) under a popular vote system, have farms.  Mines.  National parks.  Water.  In short, theyre rural... they have all the resources, and they deserve to have at least some say, if not MORE say, in how they are used.<br />
<br />
Urbanized states (that top 9)... these are the consumers.  These are the animal rights wackos who ahve never actually seen a farm, and never actually slaughtered an animal, but think bunnies are 'omg sooo cute!'.  They consume massive amounts of water for their pristine little golf course like lawns in the desert.  They Think mining is 'omg just awful!', as if logging and hunting.<br />
<br />
Insitute a popular vote, and the top 9 states, the worthless city-dwelling socialists, mindless soccer mom suburbanites, and ghetto dwellers,... theyll dictate the fate of the country.  theyll strip water rights from rural states and divert rivers to urban areas to water their useless lawns.  theyll restrict hunting until crops are destroyed by the ravenous hordes of starving deer. Theyll mandate reintroduction of wolves, and ban hunting them, while the voiceless ranchers have to deal with packs of wolves detsroying their living.  theyll insitute ignorant policies regarding conservation and farming, dirving anyone who lives close to the land out of business.<br />

Probably a lot of people agree with you.  But some won't.  And if you're a citizen of the state of say, Nebraska, do you really want to feel like your state needn't even bother to vote in a Presidential election because the election will really be determined by how California, Texas, New York and so forth vote?

Well having lived in rural ny/vermont/texas AND LA/SF and NYC (writing this letter in downtown NYC as I speak) I can tell you one thing: that is a hopelessly narrow charcterization.  <br />

Characterizing all &quot;city dwellers&quot; as socialists, parasites and ghetto dwellers is as ignorant as people who call all rural folks uneducated, backward and simple.  It's just not true (maybe in the 1920's it was).

I agree, it was hyperbole.  However, the fact remains that there are MAJOR differences between rural and urban populations, and if we move to a popular vote the rural populations will lose all voice in the government.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe.  But in as much as the President is the single most powerful man in America, it seems to me that having some safe guards in place so that every American, even those in geographical reqions that aren't heavily populated, have some belief that their interests are going to be somewhat protected isn't unreasonable.<br />
<br />
The reasons for the electoral college are the exact same reasons for setting up congress in the fashion it was.  In fact the electoral college mirrors the congress in exactly the number of representives each state is allowed.  Two senators and however many representives for that particular state = the number of electoral votes.  The electoral process is meant to be representative, just like congress is representive.  If you want to argue that it's flawed, then you really have to wonder if how congress is formed isn't also flawed.  Why is it exactly that they don't do away completely with the senate and only have a house of representatives where each state is allowed a member based solely on the amount of population they have?  Because that system would be weighted far too heavily in one direction, towards those regions that are heavily populated.<br />
<br />
And if youi don't think that regions of America don't have differences on how things should be done, then you haven't been paying attention to recent issues with gay marriage, as an example.  Or abortion issues, as another.</div></div><hr />

First, step out of the 1800s.  Yes, we used to be separate entites, but several hundred years have past now, it's ok to keep up with the times.  It's exactly this attitude of we started out separate and we continue to be separate that is part of the problem.  I am not talking about the entire nation voting on local affairs here, quit blowing what I say out of proportion you drama queen.  Local affairs will always, and should be, taken care of by those living in the area.  But when it comes to things that affect the Nation as a whole then it is the right and the responsability of Americans to decide what is best for America, not simply suggest to a smaller group of people what they might like and then have those people decide for them.<br />

We are still seperate entities.  For example, some states have counties that don't allow liquor to be sold at all.  Some close down bars at 2 am.  Others don't close them at all.  Some don't have bars open on Sunday, others don't care.  Each and every state has the right to deal with their internal issues however they feel is right.  They are seperate  and lots of people like it that way.  For example, I know there are lots of laws in the deep south that I would completely hate to be subject too.  No thanks, I'll live in California where things are a bit more permissive.  If we are going to continue to allow individual states to make individual decisions, then they are going to have interests they want protected.  And they're going to want to feel they have a reasonable opportunity to have those interests protected.  All states are not the same.  All states don't want to be the same.  And the election of the President is setup in such a way as to allow as much protection to all the states as can be reasonably permitted while still allowing the majority of the population to have a significant voice in his election.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">I hate to sound rude, but could you miss my point a few more times? I realize that there are local issues and regulations and those are decided upon by the local people. I'm not talking about local issues anymore. <br />
<br />
You are missing my point, or choosing to ignore it.  The big picture is important.  But so is the little picture.  Everyone wants to feel represented, particularly when it comes to selecting a President.  Federal law impacts everyone.  Executive decisions can also impact everyone.  You don't care about the little issues?  Fine, you don't have to.  But some of those little issues are big freaking deals to lots of people.  <br />
<br />
You want to claim that the only reasonable approach is a popular vote?  You can do that.  But there are very good reasons why it is the way it is, representive, and one of the primary reasons is so that the &quot;majority&quot; won't be able to completely run rough shod over the &quot;minority&quot; because the minority's interests are somewhat shielded by the process.<br />
<br />
There is more than one side to this, even if you refuse to see it.  And you're claiming that your side is the &quot;right&quot; one and that if people in Nebraska or Montana aren't happy with the fact that their entire state can vote and have it be effectively meaningless, because New York and California have several times their population, that shouldn't be a consideration.<br />
<br />
Well I hate to break it to you, but it is a consideration.  Presidents make decisions that impact people's lives.  People want to feel that even if they don't live in one of the most populated states that their voice will still carry weight.  A pure popular vote won't do that.   And I seriously doubt that the system is going to undergo significant change because once in my entire lifetime we got a President in the white house that got there by losing the popular vote but winning the electoral vote.</div></div><hr />

No, what he's saying is that your &quot;Side&quot; is outdated.  If you walked around asking people what they consider themselves, the vast majority of people today would tell you &quot;American,&quot; from the farmers, all the way up to the business tycoons in the big city.  Very few would respond with some sort of state pride, because there simply is no reason for it to exist anymore.  The life isn't greener across the river over there, we just run things a little differently around here than they do over there.<br />
<br />
We're not talking about the south having slavery to support their economic livelyhood, and the North not needing it.  We're not talking about Puritans settling in this state and people of Germanic descent settling one town over.  We're talking about a big, country wide issue here, that effects everyone from the ground up, and for some reason, people are still thinking that what region you live in is important.  Got news for ya, it's not.  I'm just as American as the people living in Florida or Arizona or anywhere else.  And this is an AMERICAN issue, not a local issue.<br />
<br />
Put down the musket indeed.  This is a world of mass media and the internet.  We're not talking about the pony express here anymore.  Times have changed.  If we don't change along with them, we're gonna be left behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From there duty as a citizen of the United States of America. Thats what they'd be running from. Wether you believe a war is right or wrong is not the point. Wether you believe in this side of the political spectrum or the other is irrelivant. Its been a common fact since our country has been United that when your country calls for you, you go.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to validate the war in Iraq. Some say it was the right thing to do, some say it was completely wrong. My point is, when has your country ever asked anything out of you? other than pay your taxes like every other citizen.<br />
<br />
I volunteered before the first Iraqi war started, i was glad to go over there, why? Not to liberate Quate(sp?). I could give a shit less about all those fucks over in the Middle East. I was glad to go help my country when they needed me because for all the years i've lived in the freedom that my forefathers created for me....and you.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. dont blame it on....our country isnt being invaded by the Iraqis. Thats lame, how many times has this country been to war without a single oposable solder laying foot in this country. Quite a few.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe alot of this is a generational issue. Most people of my generation and before would completely agree with my statement on why its your duty to go to war if your country asks you. Alot of the generation after me have been taught in school, from a very early age that cutting down trees is a bad thing, eating meat is a bad thing, drilling for oil is a bad thing and gay marage is ok?, removing the pledge of allegance from schools is ok?<br />
Dont tell me im wrong about what they're teaching these kids these days. I have a twelve year old daughter, i know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Aldarion does have it right in 1 context at least; states at the time of the formation of the US had paramount power.  The rise on centrlized federal power came into play not after the civil war but in the early part of the 20th century.  Having lived in the deep South I can attest to the fact that there is a deep mis-understanding between how the Northeast/West and how the &quot;dixie belts&quot; still see this issue.  States rights is far from a dead issue.<br />
<br />
However,<br />
<br />
 if we move to a popular vote the rural populations will lose all voice in the government. <br />
<br />
Bro I dont know how to say this nicely but rural America has ALREADY lost this vote.  Corporations have bought out most of the family farms/ranchers...my wife's family actually got pressured into selling their farm in AR a couple decades back...there is just no way to keep traditional way of life going.  BTW this makes me immensely sad as well.  Lets not even get into what Wal-Mart has done to rural mom and pop private stores.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is when you talk about water rights, the need for rural folks to have a say in natural resources etc that its really moot (sadly) at this point.  As Haass said the argument is really out of date. These discussions really seem to boil down now to what corporation can have its lobbyed political views best represented against the other.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree btw that there is a difference in how folks in NY see the world vs how folks in OKC do...my point also is that they have alot more in common than certain political leaders want you to believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">Flair is right, look at this bullshit such as putting wolves back into rural area's and making it a crime to shoot them, basically the wolves get to have free lunchs off the ranchers sheep/cattle.<br />
<br />
Just an example but its happening localy in texas, so i get to see the government at work, or http://www.ranchrescue.com/ for example, that is why i am agenst illegal imigration and amnisty, because i see what these people do locally and how it is hurting the ranchers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">Ya but Gerick what cracks me up is that in this case the &quot;free lunch&quot; cattle are owned by conglomerates...yet they spin this to say its mom &amp; pop outfits that are getting dinged.  This raises the ire of local communities which still like to feel they are in control of their destiny.  Of course of the other side of the equation you have massive animals/env rights orgs that really don't try to take into consideration the needs of real people.<br />
<br />
My point is that both sides are playing us against each other to try to maximize their profits NOT our well being.</div></div><hr />

And I'm saying it absolutely is not outdated.  I'll agree that the differences between the states have narrowed to a considerable degree.  But differences still exist.  And those differences that remain tend to be some of the biggest hot button issues and the ones that get people the most wound up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't disagree with that, except that's an arguement against a two party system and really has nothing to do with the electoral process.  IMO one of the big reasons politics are as screwed up as they are is because there is no viable third alternative, that isn't a &quot;fringe&quot; group, that people can go to when the Repulicans and Democrats are being too extremist and not taking care of the well being of the nation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish they was an alternative to the two party system but for now I'll still vote for the lesser of two evils because the greater can cause so muc h more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Glatius, quit saying I'm dodgeing your issue or refuse to see it.  I have repeatedly acknowledge the differences between geographical regions in this country and the need for local governance on this issue.  But how the fuck does every Americans vote actually counting for something on NATIONAL issues, notice the use of NATIONAL here not LOCAL, mean that a specific region is gonna get screwed and so we shouldn't have popular votes.  Local issues are never going to be voted on by a national vote.  If anyone refuses to see a point, it's you.  I have repeatedly stated this over and over and yet you keep coming back to how states neede to protect their local interests when I've never talked about the entire nation voting on something that effects only 1 state or city.  Now if there is a National law that goes in to affect that a particular region doesn't like, tough shit, you are part of AMERICA not the Independent Republic of Ohio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Bourbon, I don't know how to make this any clearer.  I think maybe you need to step back, calm down and think about it.  First off national issues are not the only things a President has impact on.  Secondly, all national issues aren't always universally supported across the nation.  States have a unique identity as a &quot;population&quot;.  They want that identity protected and their interests represented on a national level.<br />
<br />
Lets say Georgia is anti-abortion, because the majority of the state's population is anti-abortion.  Do they want to see President after President elected to the white house who is pro-choice because California has a greater precentage of the population of the country and that population happens to have heavy pro-choice leanings?  Would they be comfortable seeing pro-choice being mandated on a Federal level while they had no input into it what so ever and couldn't even envision the possibility that they would?<br />
<br />
Another example, lets say Texas is very pro-guns, but California and New York have heavy gun control leanings.  Does the population of the state of Texas want to see President after President elected to the white house by California and New York and have their right to bare arms erroded as a result?  No, they don't.  They want to feel like that even when they don't have the &quot;majority&quot; population in agreement with them, their voice carries weight.<br />
<br />
If we went on pure popular vote it guarantees that every candidate for President and every President who was elected would make it a point to pander to the wants and desires of those &quot;majority&quot; segments of the population that would get them a slam dunk victory and to hell with every other segment of the population. <br />
<br />
You can't ignore that and make it go away.  You can't claim it wouldn't happen.  And you must take it into consideration if you want cohesiveness within the country.  If it comes down to nothing more than majority rule, then you'll find that the minorities get the hell out.  We fought a civil war, not over slavery, slavery wasn't the issue, we fought it because some states felt that their interests weren't being protected.  And it wasn't just the &quot;governments&quot; of those states that felt that way, it was the population of those states.  They weren't in the majority and they weren't feeling like they were being well treated and given a fair shake, so they revolted and attempted to break away.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm done here.  All you've done is continue to become more and more heated and border line insulting when I've attempted to discuss this topic rationally.  You apparently are completely unwilling to listen to a different perspective and won't be satisfied until you've brow beaten me into agreement.  I don't agree.  I won't agree.  I've stated my reasons for that.  If you don't agree with them or don't like them, there isn't a damn thing I can do about that.</div></div><hr />

First of Glatius, fuck you, you can leave this shit out.  Just because I don't agree with YOU doesn't make my point less valid or mean I'm becoming irrational.  I do see your point and up till this post you have handly ignored every point I've been trying to make with no real rebuttle.  I have read every word you've said and responded and again, up till this post, you've danced around everything I've said only focusing on YOUR point.  So get off your fuckin soap box.  And by the way, when I use fuck and shit, that's not me getting heated, that's my style of speaking, both in real life and on this board so don't attempt to belittle my arguement by saying I'm just irrational and narrow minded, I've always answered you in a concise manner.<br />
<br />
Lets say Georgia is anti-abortion, because the majority of the state's population is anti-abortion.  Do they want to see President after President elected to the white house who is pro-choice because California has a greater precentage of the population of the country and that population happens to have heavy pro-choice leanings?

<br />
Second,  this is indeed somewhat of a sticking point.  It more or less comes down to if you feel local government should have the power to over rule national government.  I personally don't.  In a true democracry every voice is heard and the majority wins, does this leave some people out?  Yes.  But so does having the issue applied on a state by state basis, there are still going to be people in each state that don't approve of the law, they just happen to be the minority in that particular state, but perhaps not in the nation.  If you allow each state to rule itself we become less of democracy and more of a feudal system and personal preference/opinion plays heavily into that.<br />
<br />
Maybe if people don't like the rules and laws of America, they should go found their own country, it's how America started after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is not the &quot;antiquated system&quot;.  The problem is that big money is able to buy influence.  Every politician is in someone's pocket to one degree or another, or so it seems.  If politicians were honest, reasonable, fair, and not up for purchase, I don't think people would care about the electoral college.<br />
<br />
I understand people are pissed that Gore lost even though he had the popular vote.  But Bush did have, in the end, 29 states and the district of columbia, wihile Gore had only 21 states.  And those 29 states would have been pissed as hell if they couldn't get the man they elected into office because their population wasn't large enough.  And the &quot;oh well, too bad so sad&quot; attitude doesn't cut it.  This is America.  We're supposed to be concerned about safe guarding the rights of the minority, even sometimes at the expense of the majority.  The majority doesn't get to have it all their way all the time.  Which is exactly why the founding fathers put together the system the way it is.  Everyone has a chance for their day in the sun.  It just so happens that Bush has turned out to be a really piss poor choice.  Well, people make mistakes.  The time to fix that is in November.<br />

Get used to seeing that photo. That pretty much sums up for many Moslems the US policy. <br />
<br />
To let it happen is absolutely criminally negligent. A country that would allow such an event to occur can not run prisons, reconstruction, or civil affairs. They are unreliable.<br />
<br />
A lot of this seems pretty predictable when you concider we maintain camps where we claim the prisoners are not entitled to US due process, the Geneva convention, or rights of parole and repatriation since we are not in a declared war with anyone.<br />
<br />
I don't have ANY sympathy for terrorists, but I seriously doubt the 40,000 prisoners in Iraq are all terrorists. I have even less sympathy for war criminals, especially if they wear our colors. You don't think mistreatment of prisoners, photographing them or parading them naked to humiliate them, beating them while in custody, sleep deprivation, 30+ hour &quot;interogations&quot;, are war crimes? Would it be OK if someone did those things to your son for months or even years?<br />
<br />
There is a mind set in the Defence Department and the Executive branch that has to be changed. Poor John McCain must feel sick inside to see stuff like this justified.<br />

<br />
Yes, given the time John McCain spent in a prisoner of war camp being tortured, it must seriously sicken him and every other men like him to see U.S. troops having anything to do with anything even remotely similar.<br />
<br />
It really is a horrible statement about the U.S.  Something that should never have happened.  Something we systematically claim our country and our soliders wouldn't do.  Yet for all our words, there it is.  Apparently our troops did it.  How the hell do you even pretend to hold the moral high ground after that?  Saddam deserved to be deposed because he tortured and killed his own people, yet we move right in and pick up the torture where he left off?  Horrible.  It actually shames me as an American, and I've never been ashamed of being an American before.<br />
<br />
The fact that it happened on Bush's watch, this alone with all other things aside, is enough as far as I'm concerned to remove him as President.  The election can't come fast enough for me.  He is ultimately responsible.  He should have made sure that those troops had leadership that saw to it that they were properly trained.  That they knew that such behavior under any circumstances was not acceptable.  He didn't.  He failed.  He needs to go.  As far as I'm concerned, our national honor demands it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">The fact that Rumsfeld tried to bury all of this, was caught and still has his job is just another sign of the quality of this administration.  They all need to be replaced, soon.<br />

This just blows my mind.  The entire war is based of removing a brutal dictator and then we do this.  I know what I think of our country right now, I can only imagine what the rest of the world thinks.  And people are so amazed and shocked when Americans are attacked around the world.</div></div><hr />

Now add to that a bunch of folks in the cabinet and undersecretary jobs (Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz) who have the idea that a Pax Americana by default includes the always given right of the US to do what it wants where it wants when it wants, and you've had an absolute disaster.<br />

Straight out of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Civilian Prisoners in Time of War with some added emphasis by me in bold:<br />
<br />
Article 1<br />
The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.<br />
<br />
Article 2<br />
In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. <br />
<br />
The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance. <br />
<br />
Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof. <br />
<br />
Article 3<br />
In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions: <br />
<br />
1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. <br />
<br />
To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: <br />
<br />
(a) Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; <br />
<br />
(b) Taking of hostages; <br />
<br />
(c) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; <br />
<br />
(d) The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. <br />
<br />
2. The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. <br />
<br />
An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict. <br />
<br />
The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention. <br />
<br />
The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict. <br />
<br />
Does it surprise me that there might be individuals within our intelligence community or our military that find the Gevena Convention inconvenient and do not give it the weight they are supposed to?  No, it doesn't surprise me.  Does that make it acceptable?  No it doesn't.  We as a Nation signed the Geneva Convention and expect it to be adhered to when our service people or other nationals are held by a foreign power.  If we're not willing to grant the same protections to those we detain, how is the Convention worth more than the paper it's written on and what kind of hypocrites are we as a Nation if we don't insist, demand, even compell our government to adhere to it?</div></div><hr />

Those dumbasses you see on the News do not represent the majority of us.  Most of us took our Sept 01 with pride and professionalism and did what we trained to do.

You can ask the PoW's of Vietnam what they liked and didn't like about their captivity all you like, it doesn't make what some of our soldiers did in Iraq right or any less of an attrocity.

While it may be impossible, it is something we should expend every reasonable effort to  accomplish.  And when it's not possible, when caught the ones responsible should be appropriately prosecuted.<br />
<br />

Probably because it didn't get much in the way of media play.  I sure don't recall seeing it reported in January, so the media coverage must have been pretty low key.<br />
<br />
It really comes down to what you as an individual believe is sadistic and cowardly. Alot of people would go as far to say that just being locked up in a 8x8 prison cell for 23 out of 24 hours a day is cruel and unusual punishment.<br />
<br />
Cruel and unusual punishment is certainly open to a lot of debate.  But I would argue that locking someone in a 8x8 cell for 23 out of 24 hours amounts to imprisonment.  You're considered a risk to society or you're reasonably being punished for a crime.  But having men stripped naked and bound to walls with underwear on their heads or posing naked on all fours while someone holds a leash attached to a collar around their neck would not by any stretch be defined as reasonable punishment for crimes or removing someone society because they're a danger.<br />
<br />
What was the intention behind these acts?  From what I gather is was intended to soften them up for interrogation.  Not as part of a legitimate legal confinement.  I saw one picture with an American solider in a T-shirt, camo pants, combat boots, and black rubber gloves, standing over a prone prisoner and my first thought was that he looked like a Nazi solider from a WW II photo.  I don't like the idea of our soliders causing me to think of Nazis when I see photos of them dealing with prisoners.  If I'm thinking it, I know others are too.  And it's just not justifiable.  The Geneva Convention requires humanitarian treatment.  This was not humanitarian treatment.  Those soliders were in violation of the Geneva Convention and probably could be prosecute as war criminals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Putting panties on prisoners heads isn't the only thing that's happened.  There are pics of prisoners being lead around on dog leashes, prisoners being urinated on, prisoners hooded standing on boxes with electrodes attached to their hands and prisoners dead from torture.  This isn't about a few people embarassing some Iraqies by putting some panties on their heads.  This is about a gross failure in the chain of command and violations not only of written law but also common sense and human decensy.<br />

Laws are meant to be applied equally, regardless of whether or not you're the biggest kid on the block.  Now, in my mind America has always stood for the rule of law as much as anything else.  Has that changed and we've tossed being law abiding out the window?<br />

The answer to that from the undersecretary of defense (forgot his name already) is that he was aware of abuses going on in prisons in january, but the scale and scope of those abuses was just recently learned. Basically all he got was a one line report saying &quot;Oh ya, and we're looking into some allegations of misconduct here.&quot;  Misconduct indeed.  The fact that he didn't question it then is wrong.<br />
<br />
Second, for those of you who just think what you've seen on the news and in the papers of prisoners being paraded around with underwear on their head is the extent of this, you are sadly mistaken.  One of the major national papers had a picture on the front page a couple days back of a unmuzzled guard dog being used to threaten an Iraqi prisoner.  What you didn't see was the next photo in the set of that same Iraqi writhing on the ground, bleeding from his leg. Other accounts of sodomy with broomsticks and the like are also available, and they make one thing perfectly clear.  This is not some fucking frat boy prank here, this is a real goddamned deal.  If this were happening under Hussein's jurisdiction, to Westerners, this would be a &quot;Crime against Humanity&quot; and we'd be bringing up what?  That's right, the fucking Geneva conventions.  And don't even try to argue that we wouldn't, because that's all we've been doing for fucking years.    <br />
<br />
Also in the congressional hearings, I heard one of our esteemed Senators from Oklahoma speaking.  To paraphrase, he was not outraged at the human rights violations being executed by American soldiers, he was outraged at the outrage.  His points were that before America came in, Saddam was using those prisons as torture chambers where people were routinely mutilated and killed in massive amounts, and he thinks that for every picture of American abuse of prisoners that gets released to the media, one should be released depicting Hussein's atrocities as well.<br />
<br />
FUCKING HELLO MCFLY.  DO YOU NOT SEE THE MASSIVE PROBLEM WITH THIS?<br />
<br />
We have just lost the right to EVER bitch about anything that goes on in ANY encampment in ANY area of the world, PERIOD.  Nazi's executing Jews?  Who cares.  Viet Cong prisoners in bamboo cages?  Doesn't matter.  Hussein's torture chambers?  Big deal.  If we blatently disregard the rules of war that we HELPED TO CREATE, then we are absolutely, 100%, no better than any of the supposed &quot;Evil&quot; people that the Bush adminstration claims to be against.<br />
<br />
America is the biggest kid on the block, of that, there is no doubt.  But we CAN NOT be walking around bullying people just because we are.  That's not what I signed up for, that's not &quot;Defending my country,&quot; that's not defending my freedom, and that's NOT what I want to be a part of.  The fact that Rumsfeld still has his job is a goddamned insult to every American, and it should be.  He knew about this shit in January and didn't ask the right questions to stop it.</div></div><hr />

No we haven't.  We have a few soldiers who are guilty of misconduct.  They must now be tried and treated as War Criminals.  Fortunately for us that is something most of this country will insist happens.  <br />
<br />
What does piss me off though is when the General in charge of the prison tells the news that she can't be held responsible for what happens in her own prison.  That's a bunch of shit.  It's her damn job to make sure things like this don't happen.  She needs to be punished severely.  There is simply no way she could not know that this was going on right under her nose.</div></div><hr />

The thing is tho, that if they aren't treated as war criminals, then yes, we do.<br />
<br />
Americans did this.  Do you think the rest of the world fucking cares how many?  IT'S THE AMERICANS.  That's all they think, that's all they need to think, and our reputation is tarnished for life. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">The thing is tho, that if they aren't treated as war criminals, then yes, we do.<br />
<br />
Correct.  But the Geneva Conventions says how to deal with soldiers who break the rules.  We as a country have not broken the Geneva Conventions unless we choose to protect those who broke it.<br />
<br />
And I understand that other countries won't care.  What difference does that make?  These are the same countries who already hate us.  They always have.  That's like these celebrities at the beginning of the Iraq war saying that Europe now hates us and we are ruining our goodwill there.  We never had goodwill in most of Europe.  I should know.  I spent half my life there.  France always hated us.  Germany did, too.  The few countries that didn't hate us still don't.  Nothing we do will change that perception for better or worse because hate makes people blind.  The mid-east is the same.  If we pull out, they'll hate us.  If we stay, they'll hate us.  If we bring in the UN, they'll still hate us.  They did before the war, the will after the war (I say after the War because it's not over, no matter what the leaders say).  It's not important to punish these soldiers because we are worried about what other countries think of us, which for the most part has always been bad.  It's important that we punish these soldiers because of what we think of ourselves.  If we can't hold ourselves to a higher standard then we already lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that it's important to punish the ones responsible for both reasons.  Granted, there are people and countries in the world who are going to hate America and Americans no matter what we say or how we behave.  But there are some who are going to judge us on our words and our actions.  It's important that we act consistantly with our words so that those people who can be influenced, are.  But, even with that aside, I agee that it's important for us as a Nation, for ourselves, to prosecute and convict those responsible.   What we think of our Nation and how we feel about it is even more important.<br />
<br />
Law abiding or rogue state?  A country that lives by its word or one that can't even trust itself?  How we deal with this situation is going to impact how America is perceived, by the world and by Americans.  It's important we do the right thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">The problem is not the &quot;antiquated system&quot;.  The problem is that big money is able to buy influence.  Every politician is in someone's pocket to one degree or another, or so it seems.  If politicians were honest, reasonable, fair, and not up for purchase, I don't think people would care about the electoral college.<br />
<br />
I understand people are pissed that Gore lost even though he had the popular vote.  But Bush did have, in the end, 29 states and the district of columbia, while Gore had only 21 states.  And those 29 states would have been pissed as hell if they couldn't get the man they elected into office because their population wasn't large enough.  And the &quot;oh well, too bad so sad&quot; attitude doesn't cut it.  This is America.  We're supposed to be concerned about safe guarding the rights of the minority, even sometimes at the expense of the majority.  The majority doesn't get to have it all their way all the time.  <br />
<br />
It still doesn't make me want to waste my time voting in a state where we haven't had the Democratic vote since the early 1900's. <br />
<br />
This thread is about voting in this election, and I stand by my opinion that it is sensless for me, as an individual, to even try. My vote will never count as long as I live in KS, but since I work in aerospace with Witchita being just down the road I have a secure future where I bought my home.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's like George Carlin said,<br />
<br />
The only people that actually have a right to complain about who's in office are those that didn't vote. Yeah, that's right! Did not vote.<br />
6 months after the election when everyone is bitching over the new administration we get to sit back and laugh.<br />

<br />
Why? Because he would be held accountable for the policy/vision he set for the military? That is his JOB.<br />
<br />
Because he was told by most military planners that an occupation would require 200k + troops and 5 years?  Because of this that cooks and truck drivers were made into prison guards?  Because of this military intelligence was &quot;outsourced&quot; to private contractors who SET THE DOCTRINE that middle-easteners are motivated by shame (rather than guilt which is a western phenomonon) and told the prison system there to utilize it in interrogation. Because under direct questioning from Senator McCain he couldnt answer WHO was in charge of the military prison system in Iraq?<br />
<br />
Listen this isn't partisan...I voted for Regan, Perot and I would have voted for McCain.  The fact is Rumsfeld is a hack.  He read alot of Tom Clancy novels and thinks he knows military planning and logistics. He has gone against the better judgment of career officers and surrounds himself with the most self aggrandizing yes men masquesrading as generals.  <br />
<br />
Its just sad that accountability is a lost American value.<br />

<br />
One of the camera phone videos that hasn't been shown to this point has a Iraqi woman being raped. The guy who runs the New Yorker magazine has it on his site (I will search for the link).  Edit: can't find the link now...this is the best I could find http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040510fa_fact  ...I'll keep looking.  <br />
<br />
Yeah its not cool that 4 good guys got nailed in that car...but that doesn't rationalize the rape and torture of prisoners...especially when the adminstration has taken the MORAL HIGH GROUND as a basis for being in Iraq in the first place.</div></div><hr />

You know what dude you don't contribute dick to the discussion other than trying to stir up shit, and then when people call you on it, you resort to insults which inevitably get the thread locked.  Your &quot;views&quot; are only things that you know will piss people off so you can start in with the personal attacks.  <br />

Excellent point.  I know alot of people feel their vote is worthless because the issues they vote for don't win, but don't just give up, if everyone who felt their vote was &quot;worthless&quot; actually voted I bet the results might be suprising to say the least.</div></div><hr />

Sigh...nice re-direction of topic.<br />
<br />
Ok let me re-state the point.  You state why would someone question your character.  I point out you are using an avatar a 13 year old pre-pubescent boy would (maybe you are doing into out of humor I don't know and perhaps I am wrong in understanding the context..hence my smile at the end).  <br />
<br />
Basically I'm stating that you are making a statement by using such a thing.  /shrug in the adult world thats the way the world works.  You make statements through the decisions you make...its called accountability.  When others observe these actions it isn't &quot;slamming&quot; or &quot;bashing&quot; its an observation. <br />
<br />
I've been married for about 10 years...I have a perfectly lovely set of boobs I sleep next too every night.  I'm rather confused what this has to do with what exactly? I'd really rather not continue along those lines.<br />
<br />
Again to re-direct to the conversation.  We can't agree to disagree until you actually state some facts.  If you chose not to actually pony up some facts please refrain from the conversation.  I respect your opinion of the subject...as a matter of fact if it can be proven that there was no direction set at the sec of defense level I will be the first to defend him.  I am however quite skeptical that this is the case based on what has come out (I watched about 3 hours on C-span the other night including members of both parties asking questions).<br />
<br />
Slov let me be very clear:  I have nothing against you in any personal way.  I am however VERY personally invested in this subject (I was in NYC on 9/11 and lost 2 good friends).  I currently work about 3 blocks from the WTC site.<br />
<br />
 I know alot of people feel their vote is worthless because the issues they vote for don't win, but don't just give up, if everyone who felt their vote was &quot;worthless&quot; actually voted I bet the results might be suprising to say the least. <br />
<br />
Yes sir this is why I still vote every damn time.  Even though we don't get the best to choose from we can still exert some power.  When people stop voting they abdicate their power to others; the current administation is an excellent example of unchecked vision.</div></div><hr />
