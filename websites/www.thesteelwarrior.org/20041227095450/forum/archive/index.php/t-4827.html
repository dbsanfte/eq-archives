I found it out the hard way.<br />
<br />
If this was intended it is a very large stealth nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szlia</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You learned the hard way fighting a mob that stunned you or silenced you? Because it was definitly possible to use disc while silenced on test.<br />
<br />
Not when stunned though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was fixed today in the patch to the patch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in PoAir and I was silenced by a mob and not able to use defensive, it clearly said that I could not use spells while silenced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tonight I was silenced by Aten Ha Ra.  <br />
<br />
Procs didnt work (like normal) but I was able to use mighty strike just fine (I purposely popped it while I was silenced in order to test this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Discs definately still work while silenced.  In VT against DXXT and Aten, I was able to trigger Defensive while silenced, and Incite repeatedly while silenced.<br />
<br />
However, you cannot trigger a disc while stunned, which is a stealth nerf.<br />
<br />
Monks in particular are complaining about this, as they used to be able to trigger Stonestance while stunned and no longer are able to, which of course makes monks die during pulls more often than before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You shouldn't have been able to pop a disc while stunned int he first place.</div></div><hr />
