Last night my guild killed Tallon Zek (the archer in case I got him mixed up with Vallon).  <br />
<br />
Anyway we decided to bow kite him so all of my damage was done via bow.  I use a Featherwood bow (24/24) and was using summoned 3 damage arrows.  I had a CoF plus SoV for haste and was sitting at around 1575 ATK buffed.  I stayed out of range of his AE so I never got hit with anything and never got my shots interrupted.<br />
<br />
I finally got around to parsing the fight just now and I did a whopping 2,524 damage to him at the blistering pace of 16.28 DPS.  Was sorta wondering how that compares to other warriors out there.  My archery is not maxed yet, though if this is going to become a common strategy for us I plan on maxing it soon.  My current archery skill is 176.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm only using a nightmarewood compound bow and usually summoned arrows. however, my archery is maxed @ 240.<br />
<br />
I'd love to give you a comparison parse, cept, I bet a lot of it has to do with the mob/ac. etc.<br />
<br />
would be a very lopsided parse if I were to do it vs any other mob heh.</div></div><hr />

You should max out your archery anyway... not like it is difficult to do.</div></div><hr />

My DPS on TZ would look something like 0 hehe. You probably could get some better arrows though if you were only using 3 dmg.</div></div><hr />

Get a collapsable fletching and get to work.<br />
<br />
Archery is 221 and fletching is at 194 atm. I make all my own arrows and use Class 6 Steel Silver arrows. Does make a difference on the DPS, nowhere near RNG DPS but alot better than a Spectral Bow and Summoned Arrows. ;)</div></div><hr />

I don't want ranger damage, but if tactics like this are common for PoP then I do think all classes should have the option of doing at least mediocre damage with a bow.

<br />
Warriors should be the second best archer in the game.<br />
<br />
Lets put it this way.. Rangers are FAR superior tanks than Warriors are archers.<br />
<br />
Archery needs to be recognized as a method of dealing real damage.  While only rangers should be dealing melee-level damage at range with a bow...  it would be nice if warriors weren't quite so bad at it...  (this should include all of the melee and hybrids that can use bows/thrown)<br />
<br />
There are a a decent number of ranged-fight mobs now...  why is it the other warriors, rogues, monks, and paladins are so bad at this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors can handle 100-150+ DPS with melee weapons at level 65...  why are they doing only 12DPS with ranged?<br />
<br />
Rangers can attain 150+DPS (non-TS) with bows under the right circumstances...<br />
<br />
shouldnt the game's second best be able to deal reasonable damage at range with a bow?<br />
<br />
All of archery/thrown needs a looksee...  it would be best for all if archery/thrown was make into a viable secondary method of dealing damage.<br />

Im 240 in archery and a 250 fletcher. With my Obsidianwood bow and Acrylia arrows (dmg 10, Dmg Bonus 13, with 4dmg to either ice, fire, or magic), I can do some nice dmg - usually in the area of 50 - 100 each arrow I fire off. Best arrow crit I did was for 285 using a Nightmarewood bow and an acrylia arrow. <br />
<br />
Although Warrior archery isnt perfect it's still a valuable tool available to us, and ANY dps is better then no dps imo.</div></div><hr />

im at about 120 atm with archery, using a nighmarewood compoundbow and class 2 arrows and i can go for a few days of exping without seeing a hit.<br />

<br />
now 1 last question - i was doing some digging  on seeing if i can make some magic arrows for myself. as my smithing is non-existent, i dont intend to go down the acrylia route, but i understand that silver tipped heads will turn the arrows into magic ones and that some vendors sell these heads.<br />

is this correct? <br />

An exp group I had there once suddenly became ranger/rogue/warrior and the ranger decided to bow kite for fun. I chewed thru 200 non-magic arrows and did no damage. Now I always get mage or ranger summoned ones or make my own silver tipped.</div></div><hr />

Silver tipped arrows are magical.  Hooked and below are not.  Or, if you want more clarification, if you get 10 arrows every combine, they're magic, and if you only get 5, they're not.</div></div><hr />

Personally I havn't been a big fan of bows because it took up your range slot which you could have a very good item in (I have Orb of Evasion which has a +8% to Dodge).<br />
<br />
Now that I have my bow, I wouldn't trade it for anything, it is absolutly an excellent item to have.  It's very nice to be able to pull a mob without having to get right on top of it.  <br />
<br />
I never have parsed it the DPS of a bow fight, but I've done Sol Ro with the bow and I expect I did about 30-40ish DKP vs. him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ranged weapons arnt a warriors strong point, they never will be, we were designed to get up close and personal with shit, not hide in a bush hugging dogs and shooting arrows.<br />
<br />
Archery is somthing i only break out when we do Cursed.  Dont wanna get in melee range cause i end up assraping teh clerics from gettin charmed, so i sit back with the rangers an plink...<br />
<br />
Not too worried bout archery.  Not gonna make too big of a deal about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh ... more clarification.<br />
<br />
If the mob can't be hit by the arrow you're firing at it, your message TELLS you.<br />
<br />
It says it's INVULNERABLE.<br />
<br />
Try this with some 1 damage arrows and a few will o' wisps.<br />
<br />
But, eh, the good news is, all I ever really use my bow for is pulling (occasionally I'll kite a mob or use it to play mini-Ranger). And even if the mob is INVULNERABLE to your non-magic, cost-effective arrows, you'll still be able to pull it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">an other problem to the &quot;invul&quot; msg : <br />
yes, it works that way , like it work that way for the non magic melee weapons .... <br />
problem is i guess most melee uses abreviated messages if they even have misses turned on, and abbreviated does not say &quot;invul&quot; , it gives the standard miss message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I raised fletching to 182 simply because that is the trivial level for class 2 wood Silver tip arrows. 150 range, Magic and I can make 20 stacks of arrows for about 90pp (If I buy components with cha gear, 137cha)<br />
<br />
And I can confirm that non magic arrows will not hit Scions. I used GD scion to raise Archery and I wasted lots of time with no hits and no skill ups before realizing I needed magic arrows.<br />
<br />
Bow damage is something low on my priority list of things Sony should be doing for warriors, still waiting on a imbue weapon with EB effect something like Orb of the Sky from VT.<br />
<br />
Orb of Raging Fury<br />
effect: Call of Rage (imbue weapons with Enraging Blow effect, duration 10 minutes) something like that would be suweet.</div></div><hr />

If I were to make those 10-15 stacks, that would be a minimum of 20-30 combines, and making even the cheeper of the magic arrows that have a decent range and dmg... (Fletching skill 193)<br />
the cost would be... aprox. 150-200pp. NOT worth it at all.  <br />

My damage with a bow is next to nothing, my archery skill is in 190 range, and I use a twisted long bow, which is not all that bad, but still. I will parse TZ next time we do him, and see what my DPS with a bow.<br />

I know with weaps with good buffs, I am well over 100 dps... but I bet with my bow, I would be in the 30-40 dps range at best.<br />

bog 150-200 pp not worth it? dont be shiesty and make ur arrows u do much better damage with them...  on a close fight ur 1 dps increase may save u and ur guild hours... for 150-200 pp... try ninja looting a blue diamond while exping to make up ur losses...<br />
<br />
when u reach the point in the game where u need to be using archery on boss mobs... spending 100's of k's on on buying/recharging snare gland/buying rez sticks/buffing reagents... why be cheap with arrows<br />

<br />
Actually, I was able to parse a sustained +/-50 dps on an elemental boss_01 about 5 different times.<br />
<br />
ATK: 1450-1550, depending on SK buff.<br />
Bow: Stonewood Compound 42/37.<br />
Arrows: 3 dmg summoned magician.<br />
Quiver: mage summoned, 50% bow haste.<br />
<br />
Do I think 50 dps is great - no, but its slightly better than standing there feeling sorry for yourself.<br />
<br />
Also please note that my ATK is somewhat low and other warriors that can hit the 2k+ ATK logically would see higher dps.</div></div><hr />

That's a lot more damage than I would have thought we were capable of with a bow using summoned arrows (I absolutely refuse to ever fletch another arrow).  I suspect my dps would be lower with my Featherwood bow since it seems that one was designed to take more advantage of Endless Quiver (IE high arrow damage).  <br />
<br />
40-50 DPS at least seems like enough to count as a contribution, though IMHO I think warriors should do more like 75% of our melee damage with a bow.  10-20 is low enough that I was tempted to just stand there and wait for the kill.  I guess I'll go max my skill someday to maximize my DPS.</div></div><hr />

I think it's 34/38 with 5 fire damage, 3 greater Akehva bane, and a +3% archery mod and a 110pt. fire based DD proc, and my archery skill is finally over 200 (don't mock me, I always used my Blazing Bracer of Fenin Ro to pull till I got a bow that actually had stats worth keeping in the ranged slot) and I see that I hit a lot in the 100+ range with my fletched 7dmg arrows, and crits well over 200... but I don't notice that much of a differance with the summoned 3dmg arrows. So I think if I actually parced it, and with a bow haste quiver, I might be able to get into the 50-75 dps range, which is not TOO far off of my DW DPS.....<br />

- mage quiver is 50% WR, not 50% haste : haste is WR/3 (= 17% for quiver of Marr )<br />
- yes mages dislike being changed to arrow bitches, and it can be understood if they have to cast it once every min for EACH melee in the raid. and rangers are happy they can forget  tolan bracer, cos really spending half your time to summon arrows so you cast spend other half to shoot is realy boring...

Melee all charged at 30 and I really didnt notice him drop any faster than with the bows - that fight is different to say the least. Semi - hard but - well..........</div></div><hr />

Or a special warrior only arrow that procs 10% of the time and the proc summons a stack of 20 more arrows of the same kind...  Yeah -- that would be truly awesome.<br />
<br />
(The proc better darn well put those arrows into my backpacks too!)<br />
Arrow of Endless War<br />
MAGIC ITEM, LORE ITEM, NO DROP<br />
Slot: Ammo<br />
Dmg: 12<br />
Range:  200<br />
Recommended level 61<br />
Effect: Summon Arrowofendlesswar (combat)<br />
Class: WAR<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Yeah -- that is what I would do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hulanta : great idea. Endless Quiver is under review for rangers( understand : they will nerf it one day.. but any nerf will make half the ranger community scream , and any nerf changing its current efficiency will make the other half scream too) , so u will *never* see it for other classes. <br />
but your idea is great. It would have to be a bow proc ( they can't put proc on arrows :/ ) and i fear item will appear on cursor, but that would be fun :)</div></div><hr />

...linking the hotkey to a joypad with autofire helps a lot</div></div><hr />
