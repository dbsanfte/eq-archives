Any suggestions? We had 5 chanters on, and only some of the mites were mezable. But heck when you have 500 of those buggers coming at you it gets messy quick. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to open the door and pretarget via wizy eye? Is there a trap that a rogue can disarm? /boggle....<br />

any tip/suggestion is help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karog</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it has been beaten, i wonder if it was just a massive amount of healing on a couple of AE taunt tanks/SKs with AE wizy. Or if there was a less messy way of handleing the multitude of adds. <br />
<br />
Kiting the adds is out of the quest considering they pop right ontop of the named. and there is only so much room in there. Pretargeting is a thought, but dont the mites spawn at the same time the door is opened? And does the door need to be opened by a PC for it to spawn the mites? <br />
<br />
Lets say we do pre-targeting and have the named pulled THROUGH the door, will the mites still spawn? having seen a screen shot of a Dead Unkun Bloodfeaster and not one mite in the shot, i'd gather theres a way to get him out of the room without having the mites with him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Ukun + his 3 dogs don't really put out that much damage assuming the Stonemites are either mezzed or stunned and the Ukun doesn't have that much HPs.  Of course if the stonemites ever get loose, then the DPS you take goes way up.</div></div><hr />

We've tried it a couple times. I remember the first time we did it. Guild leader (warrior) popped open the door by accident  and set off all the mobs. We had no idea what was going on, so we tried to pull them, and that obviously didn't work. So guild leader called me up, I charged in with Fort up, AET'd and moved them to corner. Guild leader ran in and we both shakerpage'd. There were a shit load and we got them to about 50%, but then we died horrible deaths. It was fun tho. <br />
<br />
If they don't repop you could try like 5 warriors with Earthshaker Rampaging them down...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Merely setup a stun bubble, whereas you have three enchanters permastunning the stonemites, preferrably in a corner away from the Ukun Bloodfeaster + the Ukun adds, every 10-20 % you AE the stonemites,  1-2 rounds of ae'ing easily kiills them all off. Rince repeat. <br />
<br />
Good luck :)<br />
