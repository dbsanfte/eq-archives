<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a Tier 4 warrior that raid buffed hits about 1890 AC and 9800 HPs with Focus of the Seventh.<br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh:<br />
Increase HP when cast by 544<br />
Increase STR by 75<br />
Increase DEX by 70<br />
<br />
I just got a Kizrak's BP (weird to have Raex in all Raex slots but BP and Legs and then UPGRADE your BP with a Tier 3-style BP) and can cast Shield of the Arcane on myself but would lose Focus of the Seventh.  I don't need the Strength.  I could get a Dex buff and fill up one extra slot for the small amount of extra dex I would need to get me to 305.<br />
<br />
Shield of the Arcane:<br />
Increase Max Hitpoints by 300<br />
Increase AC by 36<br />
Increase Magic Resist by 30<br />
<br />
With Shield of the Arcane instead of Focus of the Seventh I get:<br />
<br />
-244 HPs<br />
+36 AC<br />
+30 MR<br />
<br />
Which would put me at about 9550 HPs, 1920 AC and put my MR over 300.<br />
<br />
Is this a decent trade off for MTing?  For MAing?  For SAing?  For exp group?<br />
<br />
Just wanting some feedback on this.  Obviously this is a big win for an enchanter but no shaman group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since 30MR puts you over 300, I would say that you shouldn't count this when making your decision. Without it you are over 270MR so you can easily max MR with GoD and a bard. What id comes down to is do you think 36AC = 244HP. At 6.8hp/AC, I would say most of the time, you are better off with Fo7. Maybe against some heavy hitter bosses the extra AC might be worth it, but any time you are not MT I would say go for the HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I remember correctly from when I was using shield of the arcane instead of shield of the Maelin on my enchanter, arcane does not stack with virtue (or even aego I think) so the question becomes moot. :/<br />
<br />
Sorry. :(<br />
<br />
EDIT: I know Maelin does stack so its possible this was changed for the entire spell line. Let me know if you do get it to stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shield of the arcane stacks with virtue, and Po9 / kazad / Bulwark, it doesnt stack with Focus of 7th.  That said I always take Fo7 when I can get it instead of using my ornate BP clicky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had this same question at one point, but figured out the answer this way: 20ac (raw, on a piece of armor, X1.6 for apparent value) and 30mr vs 244 hp on a piece of armor. I have to say I go hands down on the hp there. Even with a 10hp per ac formula, I'd go with focus. Focus topping out your dex is just an added benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">9.55 HPs per AC on that...  <br />
36 AC (*10) &gt;244 HPs<br />
IF you say that 10 HPs = 1 AC, then 36 AC would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">36 ac from a spell is not the same number as 36 ac written on a piece of armor.  I think he said you take ac number on armor, mulitply by 1.6 to get your actual ac increase, like the 36 is from the spell.<br />
<br />
So actually, if the 36 ac from the spell came from a piece of armor, the raw ac on the item would be 22.5.  I assume this is the number he was referring to.  22.5 x 10 &lt; 244</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, i'd just go for the fos since it's more convenient on raids.  It appears there are no real magical ac softcap values.  I could see definately using it in a situation where you need MR and don't have a bard.  But all &quot;super secret&quot; formulas aside, it just comes down to what you think works better.  Just because someone says 10 hp = 1 ac, it's just made up.  And besides, I think it would be more useful comparing your actual hp and ac instead of numbers written on an item or buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I will check actuals and post them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's like one fight that comes to mind where you really care about the MR to make Shield of the Arcane worthwhile, otherwise stick with Focus in all cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with most.  If you really need MR for a fight (if you don't have a bard), then use the bp.. otherwise Focus is better imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1876 AC, 9769 HPs with Focus<br />
1911 AC, 9525 HPs with Shield of Arcane (301 dex 305 str)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Geez, with those numbers you could pick one based on which spell effects were prettier. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wonder if that Sham Tali ( not focus ) will stack with Arcane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Arcane and the lower level talisman spells don't stack either.</div></div><hr />
