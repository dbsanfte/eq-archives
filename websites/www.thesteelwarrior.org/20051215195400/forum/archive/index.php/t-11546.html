But I am still relatively new to the game of WoW and have a question I hope you veteran Warriors can help me out with.<br />
<br />
I had some friends on a server help me out with getting started on a PVE server so I have had a pretty easy time of it in WoW.  They are all Alliance and I lately have had this urge to strike out on my own as a Horde Warrior.<br />
<br />
I would really like a low pop server so that I can make some new friends along the way and hopefully join a very solid guild...<br />
<br />
I have been told that it is pretty difficult to if Warrior is your first character with no other character to help support which I think I can handle...but I am not sure if I want to add what I am told is constant pvp on the PVP servers while I am trying to level up...<br />
<br />
Can someone give me some perspective if faced with the same decision?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much.<br />

So long as you fight stuff your level and below, you shouldn't have any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cyberfire2k4</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the warrior is more reliant on gear imo than many of the other classes, specificaly priests and magi... <br />
<br />
though you will have it easy early on, it will start to get tedious when you have to wait for quests when you see a mage or shadowpreist doing the same quest 3 levels before you can even attempt it...<br />
<br />
In the end though, if you are going to be dedicated to your char, you will be able to get him leveled relatively quickly and will be able to solo effiecently with the use of first aid / potions... If your server is goign to be a new one, i would strongly suggest going skinning / mining and putting everything you can in the AH so you can buy upgrades for yourself... <br />
<br />
Upgrading... this is somethign you will need to do every 5 levels or so.... there are some exceptions, but when it comes to the warrior class, you will be very gear dependant... go for the best dps weapon for your level.... also keep all weapon skills near tip top... its a pain to raise 1hs from 35 when you are level 55 &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
Stamina is your friend.. but str and agi are important too... when buying upgrades... please for the love of god, mix in some str / agi gear too.. str and agi will help boost your dps... (agi will boost your dps through an increase in crits, it also helps give a b it of AC too...)<br />
<br />
i have not slept in the past 23 hours, so if thier are typos... &quot;oh snap&quot; ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soloing as a warrior is pretty easy, I normally kill mobs between 1 lvl above and about 3 lvls below for solo grinding. Just always keep a spare healing potion in your backback for emergencies and make sure you learn the first aid skill.<br />

Though it's down now it's a nice for seeing populations (although not exactly precise) it gives you a decent gist.  I play on Gilneas - there's one guild, Chaotic Tomb, that's pretty good.  Regularly do MC, but haven't quite gotten Onyxia yet, but from what I hear, they're close.  There are a lot of pretty decent upper end guilds that aren't as serious too.</div></div><hr />
