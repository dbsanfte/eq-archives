<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gerili</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So here I am working on the 6th ring, everything going great, I have to find some coldain (dont remember name off top of head) traiter that spawns shortly after an Rygor Emissary spawns (near the rygorr fort in ew).  I have only heard of him spawning once in the last week, right after someone did 8th ring war, unfortanutely I got there 1 minute to late &quot;ya I killed him, he didn't have anything on him...&quot; argh.  Hoping I will be able to snag him after patch, but does anyone know how to get him to spawn by chance?  Or how often he spawns w/o a zone reset?</div></div><hr />

<br />
camp the Coldain traitor named Rodrick Tardok. Rodrick spawns in the little tower that serves as a zone out of Crystal Caverns, at a location of -3400, +1050. However, he isn't on a timer, rather is triggered when the fairly rare Ry`Gorr Emissary walks up to the tower. When this happens, be careful not to agro the emissary, and wait a minute for Rodrick to spawn. You may want to ask the zone not to kill the emissary. He spawns in the orc fort and chances are he won't make it out alive. <br />
<br />
Once you have him spawned and killed, Loot his head, and his dagger, Dagger to be used in Ring 9 and if lucky you will also find that there is a Coldain Head on him as well for Coldain Skin Gloves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been camping doing this quest for a friend, and my wife, Rodrick is apperantly broke, I bumped into him 2 weeks ago coming out of Crystal Caverns he aggrod I slaughtered him, less than a min later he poped again and an SK running by needed his head, since then he hasn't been not seen, /petition. I'm quite sure hes broke as Icefang was a cpl months ago when I was doing that part. apperantly icefang would start running then poof and walk out of the hut and poof rinse repeat.. such a great quest and great item, its a shame seems theres always one step broke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea I got about the Emissary and Rodrick is..<br />
<br />
Emissary will spawn but will NOT respawn unless server reset .. so the only way to catch him is to camp him as soon as server reset.<br />
<br />
Sad indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm this. Rodrick and the Rygorr Emissary are busted and will ONLY spawn after a server reset. They will keep respawning for about a day after a server reset but after a day or so the spawn breaks and you have to wait till next server reset. <br />
<br />
If you time it right you should have no problems. It's not a rare spawn. When I did my ring I went after Rodrick a few hours after a server reboot and there was like 4 of him spawned.</div></div><hr />

I had read this part was broken so I didnt even try this part since I knew there was a patch coming up.</div></div><hr />
