<br />
I found myself facing 2 hours of time in which I had nothing to do that would have any actual impact on my life/future, so I had to find SOMETHING to do! So, seeing the thread of &quot;discontent&quot; (not general, but it was there) over the warrior epic 1.5's right click + focus, I sat down with my sketchbook, and started to draw out another, alternate if you will, epic to the first one. I'm in the process right now of writing a new story behind it (since frankly, the one for the 1.5 as it stands is kind of...weak as in: oh I had another vision, go and beat this guy up plz kk tks, oh wait time for some variety! go pick this random piece up off the ground!) As of right now, I just have the start of the quest, and the clickable effects + focii (for both 1.5 and 2.0)<br />
<br />
If there's enough interest, I'll try to finish some of the pencil sketches I have been working on. Also, input on any of this would be much appreciated, as well as constructive criticism. The 2.0 effects and stats are not set in stone yet (neither are the 1.5's for the matter, but they have a comparison to go against) Also, some of the stats have been omitted (weight, rec/req levels) since they're not really the point<br />

<br />
Ruined City of Dranik - Tiorpat Tornwing<br />
<br />
You say &quot;Hail, Tiorpat Tornwing&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing looks at you out of haunted eyes. Gesturing at the ground around him, he replies in a quiet, rumbling voice &quot;Have you come to witness my folly human? Leave me be. You cannot (understand my pain).&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;How come I cannot understand your pain&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing glares at you. &quot;Insolent -race-! You did not watch (Discord) twist your world into a black, foul world that killed its people at the whim of one!&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What is discord?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat laughs derisively. &quot;You must be young to not know what Discord is. Discord is the antithesis to everything any thinking, logical being strives for. Discord is chaos, anarchy, (destruction)&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What destruction?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's sight cloud over, and he screams in terror. &quot;By the gods, I cannot bear to speak of it again, it (pains me) too much, even just thinking of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;How does it pain you&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat lifts one of his tattered wings and shows it to you. &quot;Look at my wings, they are not exactly functional as you can see. The wounds the incarnation of Discord itself, (Mata Muram), have left their mark on me. Speaking of them makes them flare to life anew. Pain that you cannot imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;Who is Mata Muram?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat stares at you in disbelief. &quot;Tell me you have not heard of Mata Muram, the great despoiler? If you do not know his name, then you are naive and unknowledgable indeed. Mata Muram is the reason my world is in the state it is in now. He is the reason Taelosia lies in shambles. His armies are feared as being relentless, ruthless and willing to go to any length...aaaaahhhh!!&quot; Tiorpat's words are cut off as a spasm of pain racks his body. <br />
<br />
Tiorpat fixes you with a plaintive look, barely in control of the pain flashing through his body. &quot;Help me...(potion)...&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;Potion?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat nods slightly. &quot;Find...Aauuughhh! Muramite...grand...healer...labyrinth...&quot;<br />
<br />
Muramite Proving Grounds<br />
Find Aneuk Grand Healer <br />
Kill, loot Discordant Cure<br />
<br />
Tiorpat takes the potion and drinks it down, and wheezes as it takes effect. &quot;The cures of Discord, made from  Discord to protect them from it. Disgusting, but effective on the (wounds) inflicted by Discord.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What type of wounds?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat sighs. &quot;Have you forgotten what I had said before? No matter. The wounds inflicted by a weapon of Discord never fully heal, and you carry them forever, scarring your body and your soul. Mata Muram (did this) to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What did he do to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat shakes his head. &quot;It would be better to recount the story...from the beginning. The time of the Dragorn. Take hold of my hand *player name* and I will show you the doom of my people.&quot; Tiorpat takes your hand and calls up a billowing cloud of black smoke around himself.<br />
<br />
Entering City of Dranik (Pre-Mata Muram)<br />
<br />
Tiorpat spirit shouts &quot;This is my home, as it was once. Nearly nothing remains of it today, and what does has been pillaged and destroyed by Mata Muram's legions. It was ruled by the Dragorn Council. Oldest, fairest, wisest and just of our people. Here the story begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
*positioned looking down the cliff at where Tiorpat is normally in RCoD*<br />
Dragorn Councilman spawn (x7)<br />
<br />
Tiorpat spirit shouts &quot;The council made sure all dragorn lived in peace, from the mountains of our city to the plains of what is now known as the Bloodfields, to the now horrible ground known as the Wall of Slaughter. When arguements arose, they sat in moderation and picked the solutions that best served everyone. It was harmony, pure and simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Crimsonwing spawns in his normal spot in front of the not-so-ruined tower.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat spirit shouts &quot;I was known as the Crimsonwing once. I was charged with protecting the Council, and ensuring that their will was carried out exactly to their degrees. A position of high honor to be sure. I was astounded when they called on me to be their guardian. I still am to this day.&quot;<br />
<br />
A dragorn messenger spawns at the bridge and runs towards the council.<br />
<br />
A dragorn messenger shouts &quot;Councilmen! I have dire news to impart to you, forgive my insolence in approaching without consent! The legions of Mata Muram have appeared out of the Blind Shadow guarding our world! They have already established a foothold in the Hills of Dranik's Scar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Crimsonwing shouts &quot;Councilmen, I request the honor of preparing our defenses. The armies of Mata Muram must be turned back at all costs, or we risk the same fate that befell Taelosia.&quot;<br />
<br />
A Dragorn Councilman shouts &quot;Go Tiorpat. You have our permission to do everything you to defend our home. May Dranik's spirit be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Crimsonwing starts running toward Bloodfields.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;To what is now known as the Bloodfields young one. There, the story continues.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit begins to cast a spell (Spirit World: Bloodfields)<br />
<br />
Entering Bloodfields (old age)<br />
Positioned on the bridge where keeper spawns, looking toward Ruined City of Dranik.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;It was here that this once beautiful plain became known as the Bloodfields. Here, the armies of the Dragorn and Muram clashed for the first of many times. Innumerable Dragorn fell defending their country, and they would turn in their graves if they knew what became of their valiant efforts in defense of this land.&quot;<br />
<br />
12 Dragorn Soldiers spawn<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;The legion of mata muram gave us no respite. Even before we had fully massed our militia, they struck. Many on both sides fell in the initial sortie.&quot;<br />
<br />
4 Muramite Soldier (noc)<br />
4 Muramite Soldier (mastruq)<br />
4 Muramite Soldier (ra'tuk)<br />
4 Muramite Soldier (Ukun)<br />
spawn and run toward Dragorn Soldiers.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;The sheer brutality and abandon of Muram's legions astounded us. They fought with sheer ferocity but we fought with desperation on our side. We did not want to lose our home to the Despoiler. The strength of the Muramites may have been great, but they underestimated our own strength. We turned them back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragorn Soldiers and Muramites meet and fight. 3 of each type of Muramite die, as well as half of the Dragorn. The remaining Muramites flee and despawn underneath the bridge.<br />
<br />
12 more Dragorn Soldier spawn, as well as Tiorpat Crimsonwing.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;They were determined not to let us win in the opening stroke of the campaign however.&quot;<br />
<br />
16 Muramite Soldiers (same distribution) spawn, as well as Mata Muram, The Despoiler and charge the Dragorn. <br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;This time Mata Muram himself lead the attack. Locked in mortal combat, once again we turned the legion away. Mata Muram was seen staggering from the battlefield, battered and beaten, defeated for the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragorn kill all except Mata Muram, The Despoiler.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Crimsonwing shouts &quot;You have lost Muram! Turn back and never return or you will die by my hand!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mata Muram, The Despoiler shouts &quot;I will return Dragorn. Be assured of it. This plain that you have fought so hard for will be for naught. You will all die, and your world will be twisted by the powers of Discord until it is not even a shadow of its former self.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mata Muram, The Despoiler and Tiorpat Crimsonwing despawn.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;Ominous, no? My power is exhausted. I cannot continue let us now return to the present.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit begins to cast a spell (alter dream)<br />
<br />
Entering the Ruined City of Dranik<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing seems drained by the effort of creating a vision of what happened. &quot;I cannot go on. Not without some sort of (focus) for my already weakened power, otherwise I run the risk of spending my soul in telling you the story of my folly.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;a focus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing nods. &quot;A focus in Dragorn dream magic is a reminder of those times. It would allow me to continue my story without risking losing myself forever. Can you (find) one?&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;I will find one for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing smiles a draconian grin. &quot;I'm sure you will have to kill someone for it. Go to the Noble's Causeway, and find the Ikaav Spiritcaller. Bring me her head. That should serve me well enough.&quot; Tiorpat Tornwing seems to relish the thought. &quot;Take this stone with you. It appeared in my hand when we left the world of dreams. You may need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Recieve Resolve (Diamond icon)<br />
<br />
Noble's Causeway<br />
Find Ikaav Spiritcaller (and murder her)<br />
Loot Spiritcaller's head<br />
<br />
Tiorpat takes the head and smiles sullenly. &quot;She's finally dead. After all the (pain) she caused my people, she is finally dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What pain?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat looks up at you. &quot;I will show you. Let the dream continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering City of Dranik (Old Age)<br />
<br />
Dragorn Councilmen and Tiorpat Crimsonwing spawn in their usual spots. <br />
<br />
Ikaav Spiritcaller and Mata Muram, The Despoiler spawn on the hill and walk down towards the Council + Tiorpat, escorted by several Dragorn Guards.<br />
<br />
Mata Muram says &quot;We have been defeated. We have come to make terms with your people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;We actually did think we had defeated them. In truth, we only defeated a portion of their legion. They came under the banner of truce to put knives in our backs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragorn councilman replies &quot;Why should we believe you despoiler of worlds? When have you actually left a world intact, and not twisted by your cruel power?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mata Muram glares. &quot;You do not believe me and take me at my word? I will leave your world alone. Your people have defeated me. I honor that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Crimsonwing growls. &quot;What do you know of honor demon? You simply rage, and destroy that which you cannot have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mata Muram smiles glibly. &quot;I will leave. Your world is no longer mine for the taking. Come, let us depart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Councilmen turn and walk away.<br />
Ikaav Spiritcaller begins to cast a spell, Councilmen are enveloped in dark shadows.<br />
<br />
Mata Muram chuckles. &quot;Fools.&quot; <br />
<br />
Councilmen, Ikaav and Muram despawn.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;Then the problems began.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two dragorn councilers spawn. <br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;The council, always unified in every decision, began to argue. They could not agree on anything. At first I thought nothing of it, but one event made me think differently.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragorn councilers attack each other. Tiorpat Crimsonwing walks between them.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;Two of the worst afflicted tried to kill each other. Never before had a dragorn raised arms against a brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
(zone message) The dream world fades away into darkness.<br />
<br />
Entering Ruined City of Dranik<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing looks up in surprise. &quot;What? A focus of such power should have allowed me to continue the spell for much longer. Something is wrong. Bring me another (focus) and perhaps I can combine their power. Also take this, it appears to be the dream crystallized into this stone. &quot;<br />
<br />
Recieve: Treachery (Black Sapphire Icon)<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What is the next focus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing shrugs. &quot;Bring me some trinket from the greatest of Muram's lieutenant commanders. He is currently training with his soldiers in the labyrinth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lt. Commander Nak'Muram in MPG<br />
Kill, loot Muram Lt.'s sword<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing takes the sword and shudders. &quot;This blade drew the blood of many. Through their deaths, I shall bring forth that pain and recreate the vision of our final days.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing begins to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
Entering Old City of Dranik, edge of doom<br />
<br />
12 dragorn commoners spawn<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;The infection of discord spread. None save a few escaped its grip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragorn commoners begin fighting each other.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit shouts &quot;Nothing the council could do saved them. We tried all the charms in our possesion, every spell, nothing worked. Nothing. That was not the least of our problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragorn commoners despawn and Councilmen + Tiorpat Crimsonwing spawn.<br />
<br />
Councilman &quot;We are running out of options. Soon our entire population will be consumed by this chaotic force.&quot;<br />
<br />
Councilman &quot;Remain firm and believe in the faith of Dranik! He shall save us in our time of need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Councilman &quot;We would be fools to put our faith in a dragorn long dead. We must find another course of action.&quot;<br />
<br />
Councilman &quot;You abandon our god? Heresy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vengeful Mata Muram spawns.<br />
<br />
Mata Muram &quot;You will die now by my hand!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Crimsonwing &quot;Councilmen! Danger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mata Muram begins to cast a spell<br />
Tiorpat Crimsonwing runs toward Mata Muram, but is stopped by a paralysis spell.<br />
<br />
Mata Muram runs towards the councilmen and kills them all.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's spirit &quot;The dream is fading. I'm losing my strength even more rapidly. We must withdraw.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering Ruined City of Dranik<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing's scales take on an ashen pallor. &quot;I know what is wrong. Discord itself is ripping into the spirit world of the Dragorn. We must stop it, before it grows too strong. Bring me the final, most powerful (focus) and we can face it together. Take this, you will need it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Recieve: failure (pearl icon)<br />
<br />
You say &quot;What is the final focus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing smiles a toothy smile. &quot;Bring me the belt of Muram. You will find it in the possesion of the Keeper of Chaos in the Bloodfields. Hurry. Time is short. When you return, bring all the allies you can muster. You will need them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bloodfields<br />
kill Keeper of Chaos<br />
loot Muram's worn belt<br />
<br />
You say &quot;Hail, Tiorpat Tornwing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing looks at you grimly. &quot;It is time. Give me the three dream crystals and the belt and we can begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand in the 3 crystals (resolve, treachery and failure + Muram's worn belt) <br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing &quot;Take hold, let us finish this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing begins to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
Entering Shadow of Chaos<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing spawns, along with Incarnation of Mata Muram<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing looks around, startled. &quot;I have not seen this place since it overlayed my world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Incarnation of Mata Muram shouts &quot;Come Tiorpat, insolent worm! I should never have allowed you to live as long as I did!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing shouts &quot;It's time to face your sins Muram! For my slain people!&quot;<br />
<br />
Incarnation of Mata Muram aggros the warrior at this face in epic.<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing tries to assist but will be killed early in the fight. (scripted)<br />
Kill Incarnation, loot Shadow of Discord (jacinth icon)<br />
<br />
The Incarnation of Mata Muram staggers as it falls to the ground, bereft of the Discordant force driving its arms. &quot;Damn...you...I will always remember!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing's spirit rises from where his corpse was.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing's spirit looks around in astonishment.<br />
&quot;You have done what I could not. You have set my soul free, I am free of the power of Mata Muram and his curse that he cast upon me and my people. Give me the 4 stones representing my failure, and I will take them into myself. Perhaps I can begin to free my people's trapped minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand 4 stones to Tiorpat.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's aura glows, and then goes dark.<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing's spirit staggers. &quot;Their power is great, but free of my corporeal weakness I control them. I shall forge them into a blade, controlling the plague they can unleash, and instead of being consumed by it you may wield it as a weapon of justice, or destruction. The choice...is up to you.&quot;<br />
Tiorpat Tornwing's spirit fades away. Hanging in the air is a sword, perfectly crafted but hiding the taint of evil.<br />

I missed that intro paragraph and went right for the stats . . actually went so far as to look em up on allas cause i thought it was real.  Very cool idea, I'm not so thrilled with the current 1.5 myself, even though i'd sell my left nut for it and use it in a heartbeat. : p  Keep going with it, very good so far, would be interested to see what your sketches look like.</div></div><hr />
