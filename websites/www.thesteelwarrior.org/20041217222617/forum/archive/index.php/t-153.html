<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Previn</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I do not know if anyone has done this before, or recently, and I'd like to do it because I am a very bored person....<br />
<br />
What is It, precisely?  Well, I intend to track my aquiring of items as I level, and update this thread each time I level with new items I have found/bought/tradeskilled.  I am an untwinked level one gnome warrior right now.<br />
<br />
I know it will hold no signifigance for the vast majority of you, but I just hope it might interest a person or two to watch the advancement of a character in this day of EQ as opposed to how it used to be oh so long ago when a .5 ratio weapon would be insanely nuts =)<br />
<br />
Hopefully, in some small, gnomish way, I help someone...<br />
<br />
GEAR AT END OF LEVEL ONE:<br />
Primary: Short Sword* (1HS, 4dmg/29dly)<br />
Chest: Torn and Ripped Tunic* (3ac)<br />
Other Notable Items: Watchman's Mail Assembl (Gnome Warrior quest armor combiner)<br />
<br />
PS. This will be the layout of how I list my things, once I start getting upgrades instead of just filling slots, I will list what I had, and what I upgraded too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">honestly it's a neat idea; but maybe better served on a private website of your own ? i think there are a few free websites that can host it; plus even put in a few pics ( say..like every 10 levels or so ) of how you look and other stuff plus your own little bio about yourself and your adventures<br />
<br />
i'm not knockin' your idea at all; but on a message board maybe your idea isn't the best solution. most things here have a 1-2 week lifespan than usually end up lost  behind pages of chatter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to continue this project (but maybe you don't know anything about web page authoring) send all your info to me, and I will put it together for you. I like this idea!<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work<br />

(If you need contact info, PM me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Previn</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thankyou for the advice, I'll discontinue this then, a private webpage would be more of a &quot;Hey look at me!&quot; thing than a thing that might help someone randomly browsing about for warrior information when starting up, as was my intentions with this lil post hehe, ah well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Previn</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have my own private webspace (family webpage area), but I have absolutely no Idea how to program a webpage hehe :)  Just trying to figure out a way to be a bit helpful to other warriors :D<br />
<br />
But i could still do it, maybe just put a link in my signature to my little webspace and title it A Warrior's Equipment History or something like that.  Hmm, it is prolly a lot better to do it on my own private space</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea is actually very good and it would certainly remove alot of the many gear questions that are asked here, but I do not think the forum is the right place to present it.<br />
A website with some search functions and some way of comparing the profiles would be great.<br />
Of course it should be more than just your own profile. Get 20 profiles or so and it will be usable.<br />
A profile should probably consist of some levels, like<br />
15-25<br />
26-35<br />
36-45<br />
46-50<br />
51-55<br />
56-60<br />
61-65<br />
<br />
Keep on working on the idea! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope it works well for you and as you see there's plenty of people who can help steer you in the right direction !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Previn</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will :) its about time I figured out webpage making anyway =)  Ill just shove a link into my signature.  Thankyou all for your advice hehe</div></div><hr />
