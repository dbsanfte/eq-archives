How hard are the MPG group trials to tank? Just a rough idea as to how hard mobs hit, or anything else like many rampagers or AEs or whatever. And what hp/ac would be sufficient to at least be able to tank, let alone win?</div></div><hr />

Depends, we tank the adds, so its demanding, in theory you can avoid them.<br />
The boss at the end is rather nasty 11000+ Buffed would be good numbers.<br />
 <br />
Realms (Inguenity): Clicky <br />
Boss got beefed up or i got really unlucky at 14500/2900 he often uses DI<br />
and we have very very close calls with a cleric Chain CHing.<br />
<br />
Power (Destruction): 20 mobs to kill in 15 minutes :<br />
You could tank easily, everything hits up to 500 and is full slowable<br />
<br />
Mind (Fear) : Mobs to CC with Fear &amp; Kill<br />
This one is hard expect 1K hits from the trash, probably more than 10000/2000<br />
<br />
Arcana (Efficiency): 4 waves of 3-4 mobs in kill en 4 x 4 minutes &amp; AE debuff <br />
Same as destruction, easy mobs are fully slowable and dont hit too hard.<br />
<br />
Body (Weaponry): Need INSAAAAAANE melee dps (unwinnable)<br />
Bosses arent that hard, but this trial is impossible to do.<br />
<br />
I think you could tank 2 of the trials, of course it would drain mana, and require<br />
some pretty high DPS group, but i have Time+  Wiz/Ench/Mage tanking.<br />
So a 7500/1700 unbuffed warrior should have zero problem with these.<br />
<br />
My guess ? Destrucion &amp; Efficiency should be easily tankable.<br />
Notice : I said tankable not winnable (you need some serious DPS to win them).</div></div><hr />

Power for sure, I tanked it w/ about 8.7k.  Of course we didn't have the DPS to win, but I tanked it and didn't die.  :p</div></div><hr />

I'm one of the weaker warriors in my guild, having joined around 3 months ago. We usually have good dps, with most melee's finishing up their 1.5's and/or having top notch ele or up to p5 time weapons. I'll have to give a few of these a shot once we have some nights off.</div></div><hr />

Imho the only way is to dodge the mobs invis .  Also what happens when you are tanking them all get the req # of coins and suddenly the boss is on your rear w. about 20 adds?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding is that you're not supposed to tank the mobs in subversion unless something goes wrong.  Object is to loot the chests without agroing.   Think of it as a 6 man metal gear mission.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Weaponry is very winnable in current state.  Classes need to have well balanced set of weapons and it isn't terribly hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only tried Weaponry and Destruction so far.  <br />
<br />
Destruction was easy even with a fairly low DPS group.  You fight up to 3 mobs at a time and they all hit like pansies so we just had the shaman and the beastlord OT adds.  The boss was a joke.<br />
<br />
Weaponry mobs don't hit very hard so it's easily tankable but as others have said you need MASSIVE melee DPS to win.  I went in with a caster group the only time I tried it and we ran out of time on the 2nd mob.  I think someone parsed it and calculated that your group needs to average around 3k DPS to win it.  That's 500 DPS per person including the healer.  I averaged a bit over 700 DPS so it's quite doable but you need a group specifically tailored for melee DPS unless you've seriously overgeared for it (my group was all time geared).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you've to 2.6 million damage or so in 15 minutes to win Weaponry.  The hard part of Weaponry comes from doing enough damage to Steelshock with most of your damage coming from melee.<br />
<br />
Pacification makes avoiding adds very trivial in Subversion.  Use Pacification, not Placate (the OoW one) because Placate has a much larger aggro range (1 versus 10).  <br />
<br />
I don't remember Fear mobs hitting that hard, I think the ones that hit hard are the ones you're supposed to fear, but they shouldn't dual wield unless flagged to (they're light blue).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Destruction is very easy indeed; boss is a wimp. If you have the dps to kill the 15 mobs then you have the dps to drop him well before defensive is over.<br />
<br />
Tried Subversion today though. We utterly owned opening the chests. No mobs aggroed, no traps triggered. Boss spawned and proceed to kick me 14 shades of black and blue. I was hurting badly, swapped in my shield for 2200ac/12k hp and our cleric ran oom when he was at 45%. Disc dropped at 55%. <br />
<br />
I'm told the boss has 750k HPs but I'm not sure how much more dps we can eke out for this trial though. We had a time geared wizard and a barely elemental rogue for dps, me to tank, cleric, bard and shaman. Someone's got to pacify during the chest hunt and mez the adds during the boss fight and neither bard or chanter are ideal to do that whilst adding good dps. The shaman spent a lot of time healing me on the boss and opened chests so swapping them out for a beastlord for slow/dps isn't a realistic option either. I'm slightly stumped but going to try a few more times and hope for an enchanter over a bard; we didn't get the best start on the adds. I went furious but one if not both of the dragorns were hitting me from outside the arc I could riposte for a while and the bard got a lot of resists on mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well tried it again ... my comment : impossible without a handpicked group<br />
<br />
Warrior 73/33 Slash, 64/39 29/25 &amp; 19+1/20 Blunt ,  32/28 Pierce<br />
Ranger 44/22 Slash; 19/19 &amp; 26/28 blunt, 32/20 Pierce<br />
Rogue 30/26 &amp; 16/20 Slash,  23/20 &amp; 20/19 Pierce,  29/25 &amp; 16/20 Blunt<br />
Wizard<br />
Cleric<br />
Bard  22/20 &amp; 16/20 Slash, 26/23 &amp; 18+3/20 Pierce, 32/26 &amp; 16/20 Blunt<br />
<br />
And we failed miserably aroud 50ish % On the last mob.<br />
Next time gonna drop the bard &amp; cleric get a Ranger/Warrior + Shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman Warrior Wiz 3 Ranger + Ench Drood isnt a &quot;rational trial group&quot;.<br />
<br />
PS : Maybe still not patched on Euro servers, but unless they add Spell dmg x4<br />
On steelshock i dont see how you could do this without the &quot;perfect group&quot;<br />
Which is 3 rangers (so as to dps &amp; have nukes vs steelshock)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Slowed &amp; with Qvic+ Gear its simple to tank them &amp; use Exilir / Darb / Slow.<br />
And kill a couple of them in the process.<br />
<br />
At 280 just rush to the back, all adds will follow, at 300 they will poof &amp; the boss+2 guards will activate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never tried to mez anything in Fear, but without mezzing it has the potential to be reasonably demanding on the tank. In Ingenuity, you tank the boss for the duration, and it's probably the only trial where you can honestly say you'll need x_hp and x_ac to be effective. The rest of the trials are cake in the tanking department, and knights or rangers with relatively weak gear can MT with no problems.</div></div><hr />

Any truth to that?  My sped tank in there went in and dragged it down the ramp while I was pulling a trash mob and I took a few ~2k rounds too many &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

You can pretty much walk right past them with the aggro radius of 1 due to Pacification.<br />
<br />
Of course, it'd help if you at least try to keep some distance.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've noted he doesnt Ej, ingenuity boss does not ignore defensive and go for casters. I used furious on him to start out (probably a mistake, but then again we went in with a silly strat.)  and he hit me for around...2000 or so without furious on. When I switched to defensive he was hitting for around 1000-1100 max. It reminded me of trying to single group Rydda'Dar. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can get away with a FD class aggroing the Ingenuity boss and then (gasp) FDing.  That way you've got everyone else that can get weapons and healer(s) aren't pissing away mana on a mob that you're really not doing much dmg to.  I guess it's a toss-up.  If you've got a decent dmg shield and both the cleric and war have nice gear, you could tank it the whole time, but we found it easier just to do the FD routine.<br />
<br />
The adds in the Trial of Subversion at the boss pedestal are pacifiable.  When the boss goes live, pacify the adds and pull the boss single.  Or better yet, let your enchanter use the un-nerfed Command of Druzzil to charm one of the guards.  They hit for like 600+ or so, great dps on a mob that has a fuckton of hp and stuff.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Trial of Fear - What's the deal to winning?  I've heard that you have to kill so many dark blue mobs and that the light blue are illegitimate kills.  Also, I guess you can cast banish &lt;type&gt; on the mobs for a quicker kill then fear and not have to worry about when fear's breaking and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Subversion boss doesnt have that many HP, just has a really high regen.  His regen is about equal to the rogue and myself beating on it non-disc.  Make sure you bring some good burst dps to help finish him. <br />
<br />
Charming one of the guards would be great but I've never had it work.  The chanter just bounces a few mezzes and gets owned by the 760 quad procs.<br />
<br />
Master of Subversion hits for 2800 by the way.  Hes the toughest of trial bosses.</div></div><hr />
