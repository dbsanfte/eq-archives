<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all-<br />
<br />
Here's the concept: how about suggesting some melee &quot;re-balancing&quot;  given the following assumptions:<br />
<br />
1).  changes must be consistent with existing game mechanics, including extensions of existing code, but precluding massive recoding.<br />
<br />
2).  any item changes should be algorithmically determinable (is that a real word? ;) ) as opposed to requiring individual human review, with very very few exceptions.<br />
<br />
3).  Changes should not unbalance the game further than it already is; for instance, improving warriors to where knight classes are now just makes a broken situation worse.<br />
<br />
4).  Minmal changes are &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; massive nerfs.<br />
<br />
Those groundrules sound reasonable?  Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Anyway, some ideas, mix/match any of the ones below:<br />
-make +hp/+AC/+mana items work less well for knight/hybrid classes.  Code exists that trims down stats on items (recommended level) and checks for class (check to equip an item); modify this to either remove either HP, AC or mana from items when used by hybrid classes.  Depending on implementation, may require item updates, which would need to be automated.<br />
<br />
What this does: corrects the imbalance from itemization where the same item helps hybrid classes significantly more than parent class.  Items which have +hp +ac +mana should have been hybrid ONLY, and rare.  They weren't.  This fixes it.  <br />
<br />
Note: IMHO this imbalance was perhaps the BIGGEST screw up in EQ over the last few years, and I'm quite unhappy to say I TOLD YOU SO VERANT!!!  (see archives at eq stratics warrior board from, oh, about when knights first got &quot;un-nerfed&quot;.  YEARS ago.  This was TOTALLY AVOIDABLE).<br />
<br />
-make hybrid classes have channeling = to pure melee (i.e. none)  Easy fix, code exists for this (i.e. war/rog/monk).<br />
<br />
What this does: removes ability to reliably chain cast during melee, eroding the aggro lock ability which destabilizes the game.<br />
<br />
-remove all aggro generation from cast spells which are resisted due to immunity.  Coding change, unknown complexity but conceptually simple.<br />
<br />
What this does: limits aggro generation by chain casting stuns or similar fully resisted spells.  May (negatively) impact some weapon procs as well...<br />
<br />
-set hybrid mana regen = to bards (i.e. one point + any FT).  Code exists (i.e. bard regen).<br />
<br />
What this does: Makes spell casting ability a UTILITY instead of a STAPLE of hybrid classes, making hybrids much more melee centric than currently, and thereby &quot;balancing&quot; them better vs. pure melee (as well as pure caster).  Has minimal impact on &quot;boss mob&quot; fights, but has much greater impact on &quot;grind&quot; situations.<br />
<br />
-Make warriors a sub-class of bards, able to use any self or group only (no AE) and voice-only (no instruments) songs, perhaps limited to only combat-oriented ones (i.e. no charms/mezzes/etc).  Code exists, but *major* changes needed.<br />
<br />
What this does: nothing for the other &quot;pure melee&quot; classes, but gives warriors some significant utility.  And more buttons to push. ;)<br />
<br />
-Make distance modifier/multiplier for aggro higher for warriors; coding change, unknown complexity.<br />
<br />
What this does: makes holding aggro easier for warriors via proximity, offsetting some of the hybrid aggro lock advantage.<br />
<br />
Any more ideas?  There have been tons of threads about this, so I figured one more with more explicit guidelines/assumptions wouldn't hurt any...<br />
<br />

<br />
This is probably the only realistic one.  <br />
<br />
The channeling one... I think it is a little off, I'm going to assume you haven't played a caster class.  I would even say ok to it... If.;) Warriors were willing to apply that to proc'ing weapons aswell. IE- procs off weapons have the same cast time they do for the normal spell and you have to channel it while getting beat on for it to go off.  Think about it this way, If you can honestly say ok to any spell nerf when applied to proc'ing weapons, go for it.  <br />
<br />
While I agree itemization is a problem, I think warriors tred a delicate ground there.  If knights shouldn't be allowed to have warrior-like gear to absorb damage, why should warriors get knight like procs to hold agro?  There is no logical reason to justify it, other then from a balance perspective (which would have to apply to knights aswell), and to say that its ok.  <br />
<br />
The mana regen nerf for bards, well, if you truly make it bardish then its very bad.  Utility is gone then, absolutely.  Warriors would have to forfeit EVER bringing up paladin buffs or heals, no paladin could ever afford to cast them.  <br />
<br />
If you want to ruin agro in the game, we need to decide thats our goal.  Destroy every tank's agro.  No spell, effect, or proc should help get agro, it should all be taunt.  Because when you decide to nerf stun or an sk's agro spells, be sure you are willing to lose them on your weapons.  And as bad as you think your agro is now, do you really want to lose them?  <br />
<br />
Personally, I would simply remove the knights ability to get essentially to the same place as a warrior statwise.  Lose the buffs and fix the gear.  Also, increase the meaning of that stat difference.  While ac differences may be noticable, make them more so, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mana regen is really a problem for all caster balance, not just knights.  KEI and FT are a large part of the reason why casters are so far ahead of pure melee.<br />
<br />
Nerfing KEI would go a long way towards balancing the entire game.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;knightemization&quot;, I don't think a straight ac/hp nerf across the board fixes things because it really screws lower level knights who are still wearing kunark and velious gear.  I think adjusting mitigation tables for high end encounters is a more balancing solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Removing channeling would remove the ability for hybrids to cast on mobs *only* when they are getting hit.  That's the destabilizing part that needs to be removed imho, it doesn't limit their ability to cast any other time (any more than it does pure melee types using clickies anyway).  Applying casting time to procs wouldn't work w/ the currently combat system, unless I'm greatly mistaken...  Basically, removing the channeling goes a long way to removing the aggro lock ability, which is one of the big problems imho.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes, how do you reconcile your statement to the fact that, for most gear, warriors get HP and AC, while knight classes get HP and AC *and* mana?<br />
<br />
A reduced mana regen would make hybrid spells ONLY for utility, not for primary use- the way they were probably intended originally anyway.  By not hitting the mana pool, but rather the regen rate, it wouldn't destroy utility for single (relatively short duration) boss-type fights, but would greatly balance out vs. pure melee over long term exp grinds, for instance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Destroying&quot; aggro isn't the goal, unless you really like killing debuffers. ;)  What is needed is the removal of the &quot;aggro lock&quot; ability that knights currently have, OR the removal of their ability to deal with the dmg output when they get such a lock.  Having the ability to do both, over long periods of time, is what is really breaking the balance badly.<br />
<br />
Again, all just my opinions- what would you suggest as specific changes that would better balance things?<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
<br />
P.s. also- was not suggesting a straight AC/HP/mana nerf, rather that a choice be forced between them- i.e. better faster cheaper, pick any two.  The problem is that knight classes get all 3 on a LOT of items, which melee classes only get 2 from the same item.  Hrm.  I suppose you could convert warrior mana pools (I have over 1k in mana easily) into hp instead perhaps?  Perhaps as a rune effect?... ;)<br />
<br />
p.p.s. wow, lotsa typo's, fixed now (I think..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;As far as gear goes, how do you reconcile your statement to the fact that, for most gear, warriors get HP and AC, while knight classes get HP and AC *and* mana?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is, naturally, a problem.  There are two solutions, either make mana+hp(knight gear)=total hp(warrior gear) assuming like level.  Somewhat like how epics were done, 100 points total for hp/mana to split.  This, is not my preference.  I would prefer: Forcing paladins to choose.  They can upgrade their tanking at the sacrifice of their casting or vice versa.  This would mean that whenever you come across two similar level bp's (for example), you would strip the caster bonus' off one and reduce the melee bonus on the other.  Warriors would naturally go for the melee one, and paladins would have to pick which is important to them.  <br />
<br />
Ft and focus effects should never be on knight equipable gear.  Neither should melee effects (+dogde for example, though there are many).  Or, rather, they can be on there..they just can't effect knights.  <br />
<br />
So-<br />
<br />
-Strip buffs like &quot;Aura of the Crusader&quot; from the knights so they can not close the natural gap between warriors and knights as easily.  <br />
<br />
-Stop ft/focus effetcts/melee effects from working on knights. <br />
<br />
-Make knights choose whether they want to boost their mana pool or their hp/ac with a given item.<br />
<br />
-Make the absolute best piece of pure tank gear warrior only-though, the &quot;pure&quot; tank version for knights should not be a world apart from it...though, not close either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i'm a big fan of the warrior group/self abilites along the skill trees of Diablo 2. if i get thrown a bone I don't mind it also being gnawed on by the group.<br />
<br />
maybe along those lines incorporate the useless stamina bar to be our &quot;mana&quot; per se for the abilities to do thse things ( someone might actualy use them invigorate spells again /hint hint )....bring things to the gorup like a +haste and atk; some overall resists; and even I'd like some stupid eye candy like massive crit strings and abnormal chances to do like 4X the crit damage minimum of what's available now.<br />
<br />
For raids; etc. I still think we're okay. <br />
<br />
But dammit when I want to join a group I want to be more than just some fool getting hit all the time ( hopefully if I appease the RNG god ); or just halfass DPS when not the tank. and before anyone else says this; no I don't want to be a bard nor do I want to be a plate hybrid. I like my class. I just want to offer more to the populus whenever I could. Shit; I still remember the days when my friends would cannibilize and I would BW them back up...it didn't mean much but it was something. Little things like that bring versatility. Would be a shame to not increase versatility for Warriors in this stage of the game. Hybrids are so over utilized that any small changes to grouping dynamics won't be devastating nor game breaking. I mean, from a total roleplaying point of view; you got some Warrior class combatant as your group leader, leading a hunting party somewhere; shouldn't him/her be a type of morale booster ( read:haste and atk ) and help gain confidence ( read: fearless ) and help to keep the battle going and be the person whom we're all trying our damndest to keep going and protect everyone in the group ( read: warcries )? <br />
<br />
for the channeling skill; maybe just cut it in half for plate hybrid; god only knows i love the ability for pal/sk to be the safeguard of erroneous casters and the poor person casting slows/debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">[i]I suppose you could convert warrior mana pools (I have over 1k in mana easily) into hp instead perhaps?  Perhaps as a rune effect?... ;) [/B] <br />
<br />
That's an oustanding idea IMHO.  Instead of a rune though, I think warriors should get 1hp for 1mana &quot;last chance&quot;.  What I mean is that once a warrior runs out of hp, he dips into his mana, using them as hp.  These would only be &quot;healed&quot; through medding or normal mana regen.<br />
<br />
So, say a warrior has 1k mana.  Partway through the fight, he runs out of hp, so he dips into his mana.  The mob does 500 dmg and then a CH hits, restoring all of the warrior's hp.  He still has 500 mana remaining in case he runs out of hp again.<br />
<br />
As for the channeling thing, knights are SUPPOSED to have agro lock, or at least they are supposed to have greater agro than warriors.  I think any changes need to come by either increasing warriors' ability to take dmg or decreasing knights' ability to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your changes are suggested only in the context of knights, and you complete ignore the effects on rangers, and possibly BST/Brds.<br />

<br />
Then you better boost ranger DPS by about 25-30%, since a decent portion of the rangers DPS comes from our nukes, and in my opinion, our damage is about where it should be, if not a touch low compared to Warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Removing channeling would remove the ability for hybrids to cast on mobs *only* when they are getting hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
At least you clarified it some, but thats going to make Jolt really damn hard to cast, as well as DA versions of spells for paladins and shadowknights.  In addition, its going to completely destroy a BST ability to act as the sole slower for a group... 1 resisted slow = no more attempts.  Stupid suggestion.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;-make +hp/+AC/+mana items work less well for knight/hybrid classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rangers are supposed to have more HP than Rogues... thats why rangers have a higher Sta to HP modifier than Rogues.  Again, you are aiming a change at altering the separation between knights and warriors, and not considering the impact on other hybrids.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;-set hybrid mana regen = to bards (i.e. one point + any FT). Code exists (i.e. bard regen).<br />
<br />

<br />
Uhh... again... Nukes are a staple of ranger DPS, and part of the balance between our melee and warrior melee... do this, increase ranger melee DPS 20-30% to keep us where we should be.<br />
<br />
And... I guess this means you don't ever want your raid to have nifty things like Spiritual Dominion, Ferocity, SoP, CoR, Brells, etc... or you like waiting 15 minutes for mana to regen after buff periods?</div></div><hr />

And I think this is one of two things that must change. Give Warriors 15-20% more HP and mitigation and up to standard aggro. <br />
<br />
Knights should be able to Tank, but taking into account only their Tanking ability less desireable than a Warrior. If this happened, how could you save Knights? By making their spells and utility a REAL benefit to the group. Forget an SK's 50AC debuff, make it 10% of a mob's AC. Give Paladins DI, a really expensive to cast LoH, etc. and let them be a Holy Warrior doing miracles on the battlefield. Make SK's more like SK's and Paladins more like Paladins. Don't make them more like Warriors or Warriors more like them.<br />

This is because removing FT hurts the higher end players (the target) and not the lower end ones.

Removing FT, hinders higher end hybrids without hurting low end/level ones.</div></div><hr />

SKs have always had better agro than warriors, right back to when we could gain massive agro by casting level 9 disease cloud for 5 mana.  A warrior asking for more agro is a warrior asking to be more like a SK.</div></div><hr />

Hi dumbass...  Rangers get these two nifty spells... Jolt and Cinder Jolt.  You know what those are used for? Dumping aggro when we are getting hit and want to turn the mobs attention back to the tank, usually warriors.  It our version of the Rogue's Evade, except mana based.<br />
<br />
Like I said, casting that spell is going to be really damn hard to use with 0 channeling skill, as would be FD for SKs (their aggro dump method), DA and Harmshield, etc.<br />
<br />
And you know what this will change?  Nothing for aggro.. hybrids for the most part can lock aggro with 1-2 casts before the mob even gets to them and not have to worry about casting again during the fight to maintain aggro.  Knights will still have superior snap aggro followed by equal long term aggro to warriros.<br />
<br />
And unless I'm mistaken, the biggest complaint I see is about warrior snap aggro and regaining lost aggro... both of which are issues when the tank isn't the one getting hit... so if they aren't getting hit but want to, then this rule doesn't apply and knights can still snap aggro/regain better than a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Actually from levels 1-8 Warriors had more aggro. So, right from the very beginning.........<br />
<br />
The idea the SK's should have more aggro developed by accident and a little not thinking by Verant. One of my sons played an SK (until that class experianced a few months of neglect). As I recall, Disease Cloud generated aggro because it put disease counters on the mob, shut off it's regen (Whoops!!), and DoTed it  (kinda useless for aggroing a mob off an Enchanter, neh?) After a bit the shutting off regen feature was discovered and fixed (and SK's called THAT a nerf). Because SK's were pretty upset with the &quot;nerf&quot; of Disease Cloud the developers left in the inappropriate amount of aggro as a consolation prize.<br />
<br />
So, you're right. Because they neglected to totally fix a broken spell SK's accidently got better aggro control. Since SK's were unable to Tank like a Warrior or DoT like a Necro they decided to let it stand and make it a SK feature.<br />
<br />

I didnt know PoP was beaten in january...<br />
<br />
<br />
You act like the encounters in PoP arent designed around high mana regen. They are. PLease, go and cut mana regen down to half. Xegony will probably become unkillable.<br />
Other PoP fights are so very fast that mana regen is not an issue, because you wont regen enough mana to make a difference anyways.<br />
<br />
PoP was beaten so fast because guilds got so very good at what they are doing. Not because of KEI, i mean please.. comeon.<br />
<br />
I can tell you who will be hit hardest by a KEI/VoQ nerf though. the lower end 60 crowd classes that dont have alot of self mana regen. Those will have their damage plummet. And dont tell me wizards rock on raids, a level 63 one will probably care as much about that point as a 63 warrior that cant get a group cares about &quot;warriors tank on raids&quot;<br />
We might just as well nerf Speed of Vallon to 50% haste, add a couple of 50% haste items for Endgame zones. As its the same that KEI is, the best haste with a long duration. So unless you have 50% haste, no cap for you.<br />
<br />
Hey, while we are at it, just pointlessly nerf the shit out of everything<br />
SoV to 25%, Turgurs to 30%, KEI to 5pts / tick, Virtue to 400 hps and rebalance the mobs around these numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't know whether it actually shut off regen, but the agro from disease cloud came from the disease counter it placed on the mob.  These same disease counters made casting slow a death wish (hell, I'd be pissed).  When the agro from disease counters was lessened, Disease Cloud was technically &quot;nerfed&quot;.  SKs were mad, especially since Absor said they shouldn't be using a level 9 spell to gain agro when they have higher level spells to do so, just costs a bit more mana.  I often wonder why the double standard exists between SKs not supposed to be using a level 9 spell, and Pallys being able to...<br />
<br />
As for Bsts tanking, I do it a lot.  But sometimes it does feel like I have no channeling skill, especially when I BLOCK one attack (rest are misses) and get interrupted on flat ground.<br />
<br />
And no, a warrior asking for more agro is not asking to be more like a SK (bring your ego down to earth)...it's asking to be like every freaking class in the god damn game that can possibly tank (I don't mean tank classes on raids, I mean classes that can tank at all, i.e., ALL of them).  There is no reason whatsoever anymore to forbid higher agro to warriors.</div></div><hr />

How do warriors have more agro from levels 1 to 8?  Both classes have the same taunt caps at those levels.  Not that levels 1 through 8 matter, since you can PL through those in a half hour now.<br />

Absor has acknowledged that the disease cloud &quot;nerf&quot; was an unintentional side effect of changes that were made to disease counters in order to decrease the agro that shaman/chanter slow spells caused.  The current sk agro spells were a very belated fix to that nerf.<br />
<br />
Besides, disease cloud or not, SKs could always out-agro a warrior using other spells.<br />
<br />
The real issue here is that if you take away both SK hp and agro, what are SKs left with?  Our so called utility spells?  Please, utility is nice but I didn't start a SK so that I could self invis and tap back 1% of my hp.<br />
<br />
Warriors are always complaining that they play warriors because they want to tank the biggest mobs and it's wrong that knights can do the same thing.  Well guess what, I started a SK because I wanted to be efficient at holding agro over dps classes in an exp group.  I have no problem with warriors being superior at taking damage; let them have 30% more hp than me or better damage mitigation.  Agro is why I'm a SK though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just a minor correction, BB: Disease does not 'shut off' mob regen, it merely does damage. It never did. Most early disease dots were so slow to do their damage that they had little effect besides counterbalancing regen by damage. For a quick test of this, all you have to do is go drop Disease Cloud on Cazel. All of the aggro on this spell came from the disease counters added. Eventually, the executive decision was to place disease counters on slow spells so that slows would be cured with cure disease, rather than dispell magic. Great idea, but for about three days, they left the aggro on the slow counters the same. Enchanters and shaman were getting spattered for slow, and only a Shadow Knight had, at the time, a prayer of out taunting it. The aggro was then completely removed from disease counters. We grumbled about it, then moved on, using AC debuffs for aggro, until they revamped the spell engine. At this point, we screamed in rage, mass /feedbacked, and got terrors. Terrors are distinctly inferior to snare/Fear, so we just don't bother with them now. <br />
<br />
And Remf, while I respect your intent, removing our channeling skill completely would do little to solve the issue, as well as a failure to be able to regenerate mana. It would instead be severly punative. I do not cast lifetaps as a means of dealing damage, they're my way of patch healing myself. The primary use of Light of Nife will be similar. A stun that lands is an excellent way of buying an extra 2 seconds for a real healer to do the job. In theory, -this- is where our parity as tanks should come from. I should get railed on by a mob. In turn, I should be able to lifetap to space out the real heals. A paladin should be able to use stun to bridge the mitigation/avoidance gap between our classes. In turn, your ability to soak a beating should be significantly more reliable than ours. Your damage, from the front, should be even and reliable, and significantly higher than ours in terms of pure melee. My melee damage should be lesser, although I should be able to bridge that gap with burst, mana based damage. My lifetaps are an order of magnitude less effecient than real heals, and casting them cuts my damage output significantly, the same way meleeing from the front cuts yours. My spells have kept pace with the mobs I fight. Your skills, however, haven't. All of us are fighting under Kunark level skill caps. This is Post PoP. Something needs to change here. Our gear no longer reflects the differences in what we bring to the table. Something needs to change here. Aggro Lock aside, completely destroying me as a tank and a caster is not what needs to change. <br />
<br />
I would suggest starting with the following: <br />
AA: Planar Focus: <br />
Pure melee only equivalent of Planar Enlightenment: Phys stats to 355.<br />
AA: Planar Enhancement:<br />
Pure melee only, 2 more level of Physical Enhancement.<br />
NonAA:<br />
Add a byte to the skills, like the stats. Pure Melee all cap out all weapons/Offense/Defense at 280, 5 points a level post 60.<br />
Hybrid caps stay right where they are, excepting ranger offense/weapons to 280. Juggle Dodge/Parry/Block/Ripo as needed. Warrior taunt to 280, and make it mean something clear up to a geerlock-equivalent modded 305.<br />
Add melee focii to pure-melee ornate/Elemental gear, besides vengeance. <br />
Find a way to restore the gap in survivability that I'm supposed to have to, you know, somehow manage to use the utility that I'm bursting at the seams with, bridge. I would like to see +int/wis perhaps granting bonuses to avoidance, for pure melee only. After all, a cunning warrior should outlive a dumb one. I do like the 'Mana as an unhealable reserve HP pool' idea, so long as KEI/FT/Mana Pres work on this pool as regen/Bulwark of Vie might.  Perhaps the full benefit of the mana on warrior's gear could be put here, with an additional, say, 25% of it going straight to your HP pool? <br />
<br />
Massive changes are needed. With PoP, they proved they were able and willing to alter otherwise hard-coded caps. This needs to happen again.</div></div><hr />

And no, a warrior asking for more agro is not asking to be more like a SK (bring your ego down to earth)...it's asking to be like every freaking class in the god damn game that can possibly tank (I don't mean tank classes on raids, I mean classes that can tank at all, i.e., ALL of them).  There is no reason whatsoever anymore to forbid higher agro to warriors.  <br />
<br />
Before this gets any more out of control, let me clarify.  I was originally commenting on the suggestion that SKs are defined by their taps and debuffs rather than agro.  The fact is that SKs have used spells more for agro than for the minimal tap/debuff effects since the beginning of the class.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to say that warriors shouldn't get more agro.  I do take offense to the suggestion that SKs should be defined by their ability to ac buff the group rather than agro though.  If I wanted to buff the group, I would have been a shaman or cleric.</div></div><hr />

I don't know whether it actually shut off regen, but the agro from disease cloud came from the disease counter it placed on the mob.  These same disease counters made casting slow a death wish (hell, I'd be pissed).  When the agro from disease counters was lessened, Disease Cloud was technically &quot;nerfed&quot;.  SKs were mad, especially since Absor said they shouldn't be using a level 9 spell to gain agro when they have higher level spells to do so, just costs a bit more mana.  I often wonder why the double standard exists between SKs not supposed to be using a level 9 spell, and Pallys being able to...<br />
<br />
As for Bsts tanking, I do it a lot.  But sometimes it does feel like I have no channeling skill, especially when I BLOCK one attack (rest are misses) and get interrupted on flat ground.<br />

There is no reason whatsoever anymore to forbid higher agro to warriors.  <br />
<br />
And  thankfully, they use that higher level spell now. It's called Fear, level 15.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why Shadowknights rarely use their Terror line of spells - the same spellline we have on our only form of aggro (EB weapons et al.) - because they have BETTER, CHEAPER, MORE EFFECTIVE, and FASTER forms of aggro from other spells. Nerf those spells so they have to exclusively rely on those Terror spells for aggro. Cease, Desist, Stun - Nerf the fuck out of them so they generate a maximum of 1 point of aggro. Scale up aggro generated from Stuns/Root and other cheap ass forms of aggro to scale up to a max of 25-50 points of aggro on IMMUNE mobs and NORMAL hate generation on NON-IMMUNE mobs. Make them ALWAYS want to use their best, most mana expensive stuns. Make Divine Stun a staple for Paladins that want to taunt better in the 'end game.'<br />
<br />
Coversely, grant Warriors superior aggro generation abilities in all situations. ALL. Ranging from on-demand/on-command snap aggro linked to a 'concentration bar' which is linked to the +mana on items, to innate DoT aggro abilities starting at level 25. Add in new bash abilities for Warriors, make them innate, and add in new bash AA's that DO SOMETHING. Tie them in to the concentration bar. <br />
<br />
Cap this off by giving warrior innate AC/HP bonuses to all gear worn to counter Knightemization (which is far too deeply rooted in this game to retro nerf). 20% across the board. Then go back and readjust the handful of WAR items in game so they are on par with Hybrid Knight gear (so as not to cause an overinflation in gained HPS/AC).<br />
<br />
Done deal...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Clarify on bash; various bashes that do different things, i.e. a form of short duration Snare; +Damage +Hate Generation Bonus (equivalent to the SK Spear line, 30 second refresh); 1 second/level 68 stun equivalent to Divine Stun, similar refresh; 2handed Bash/ DW bash. Etc.. etc...<br />
<br />
A lot can be done to make warriors appealing without nerfing Knights too much (aside from what I've listed here to their spell line).<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: Because I know this will be brought up by simpletons; Cap the aggro generation of Warriors versus Uber Mobs via their snap aggro generation abilities. Make Ubers immune to certain abilities outright - conversely they would be totally immune to Knights cheap ass tricks. <br />
<br />
This would set up interesting scenarious however, as in these situations an SK could theoretically chain enough terror spells to keep a pretty firm aggro lock (at the price of losing a HEFTY amount of spell generated DPS - the way it SHOULD be IMO), while a Warrior would have firm aggro but would have to rely more on his bash abilities than his innate snap aggro. Basically, it would create something long since gone - balance. <br />
<br />
I'm not against Knights tanking - never have been... I use them exclusively matter of fact for 95% of the things my guild does in game. All I want is to get that number down to 50% Knights 50% warriors and have good reason to use both in any experience situation and sometimes exclusively in uber tanking situations. Give me these things and I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

As a SK, I use two spells for agro almost exclusively, my biggest spear and my biggest terror spell.  Spear is pure DD, which is legit dps based agro.  Terror does exactly what it should.  The only time I use darkness for agro is when I'm out of mana and I would gladly use a lower level spear and get the extra dps but I only have 8 spell slots and need to keep darkness up to snare runners.  Basically, it sounds like I play my class exactly like you suggest it should be played.  There may be other SKs out there who don't do this but I could care less if you nerf their way of doing things.<br />
<br />
I can't say anything about palys, I've never played one.<br />
<br />
I also agree that itemization is out of whack.  Give warriors a hp bonus, I don't think there are many knights who have a problem with that.</div></div><hr />

I think trivializing aggro generation in groups is a non issue. I think that if you are given a choice between a Knight with aggro generation and a Warrior with aggro generation, you'll choose the Knight 99 times out of 100 because of the PLUS that they bring to the table. I feel that if you give warriors some warriorly PLUS (see my previous post) it will make the three classes much more interchangeable in experience settings. You would take the Paladin for a more defensive Tank, the Shadowknight for a more offensive tank, and the Warrior for the more balanced tank - each bringing something to the table that is worth grouping said class.</div></div><hr />

For the most part using your DPS spells and dots works fantastic for hate generation. Why you would use an actual hate spell for grouping/exp (either of you) is beyond my understanding. There is a time and a place to use said spells, but even then Fear supercedes their use.</div></div><hr />

I don't use dots because mobs die too fast in my group for them to do any real damage.<br />
<br />
I use spears for hate almost all of the time because they give dps plus they are fast casting so they are rarely interrupted.<br />
<br />
I only use terror when I don't have a spear available (spears have 45 second recast), a mob is on a caster, and taunt fails.  You don't see the utility in that?<br />
<br />
I don't use fear soley because it might actually do what the spell is supposed to do.  I use my SK primarily as an LDoN tank and sending the mob charging off through the dungeon feared is a sure way to fail an adventure.</div></div><hr />

Blood of Hate is definitely worth using. I don't know what crackpipe you're hitting. Top that off with a Spear of Decay then Spear of Plague and you've generated some very respectable DPS and some excellent aggro. As far as I know there isn't a single mob in any LDoN adventure that IS fearable (for level 65's). I still wouldn't mem Fear, however, except on raids, as its totally useless to me except when I absolutely must have aggro lock (read: Raiding). I always -ALSO- have the 'taunt' button to fall back on *gasp*. I would also probably have Festering or Cascading up for an emergency snare/snap. The point being, I STILL wouldn't have a Terror spell taking up a valuable spell slot when I could be using my slots for actual DPS. Totally pointless. Like I said, there is a time and a place for them, and that time and place is likely never during normal experience grinds. Which is wrong IMO. You use them, as you say, but you're simply being inefficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As an SK, I can say that I have read things that sound reasonable, and read things that sound unreasonable.  I can agree, as all do, that itemization is not correct in game, and that level 65's using spells from 29 and below spell circles is not how it was meant to be done.  However, I don't agree with the warcry from some members of this board to &quot;nerf knights back to Kunark.&quot;  I can't honestly know what that means, since I haven't been playing the game since its inception like many of you.  But from what I've heard the two knight classes (although I do not like to put Paladins and Shadow Knights together as a group in ANY discussion) had it pretty rough.  That being said, it's no excuse to use that as a reason as to why knights have a lock on XP group tanking.  It's been my experience that as finding a tank goes, people look for Paladin first, SK second, and Warrior third.  I know every time I am looking for a rep I am told to find a paladin, but when not told I honestly look for the first rep I can, whether it be any of the three classes.  Now that I've strayed from the subject, let me come back to what I was saying :) .  There are a lot of intelligent people who post on this board, and there have been a lot of great suggestions made as to how to fix the existing problems.<br />
<br />
*Ideas I have read that are good*<br />
<br />
1. Changes in itemization:  Changing itemization so that there are more class specific items would not be a problem, since we can all only work with the gear that we are given and can use.  If an item is WAR or PAL/SK only, then only those said classes can use it and there is no argument about it.<br />
<br />
2.  Altering Aggro Generation:  Changing the aggro effect on lower level spells so that they do not adversely (IE make them give little or no aggro generation) affect the mob's focus would not be an issue, as there are higher level spells that were MEANT to be used at high levels, that is why we get them.<br />
<br />
3.  Utility:  Giving warriors new skills that allow them to provide their group with added bonuses (IE fearless ability, higher attack, etc)  would not be a problem.  It affect's neither an SK nor a Paladin's ability to tank.  This would also give warriors utility when not MT, either in XP group or on a raid.<br />
<br />
*Ideas I have read that are bad*<br />
<br />
1.  Nerfing Skills:  Nerfing a knights channeling ability, and mana regeneration rate is not good as far as I can see.  If a knight has 0 channeling skill, they will never, I mean NEVER be able to cast while being attacked.  This means as an SK I can never land a lifetap to save my own ass.  That is worse than the warrior having to rely on the RNG for procs, because with no channeling skill it's guaranteed that I can't cast through attacks.  Nerfing mana regen will only guarantee that a knight never again tanks for a group.  If we can't regen mana during a fight, by the end of one fight we have no mana left, and then have to sit for around 5 minutes to regain mana for the next fight.  This will be especially true if you want to nerf the low level spells most knights now use for aggro.  Not only will they be required to use the high mana cost/high level spells to gain aggro, now they will have little to no way to regenerate the mana they used during fighting, and last time I checked most groups don't stop pulling to let the tank med.<br />
<br />
     Those are the main points I have seen as of recent, or at least the only ones I can remember.  If I have missed any I apologize, I don't claim to be the all knowing master of the situation.  Any feedback would be appreciated, but be polite please, even though this IS the outhouse.<br />
<br />
EDIT I fixed a few typos I made, I hope I got them all this time :)</div></div><hr />

Terror spells cost about 50 mana.  Cascading Darkness Costs 300 mana.  That's why I use terror for agro rather than Cascading Darkness.<br />
<br />

<br />
You are right, Blood of Hate is nice but I don't have it yet.  All of the lower level SK DoTs are pretty outdated for dps purposes (unless you're soloing).</div></div><hr />

It would instead be severely punitive. <br />
<br />
Hola-<br />
<br />
The intent wasn't intended to be punitive, rather to address the symptoms (as opposed to the root, which is imho horribly poorly considered itemization over several years) of the problem; i.e. knight classes tank way too well compared to their ability to generate and hold aggro.  <br />
<br />
Getting rid of channeling would make combat casting (i.e. casting while you are getting beat on) a thing of the past, which would go a long way toward reducing the aggro lock knight classes currently enjoy, while still leaving their snap aggro generation intact.  Some combat-type spells (jolt, FD) might need some modification (i.e. shorter cast time compensated by longer recast perhaps), but basically it'd just reinforce the need to control aggro by making the alternative a Real Bad Thing, actually an improvement imho.<br />
<br />
Reducing mana regen for hybrids by instituting bard-like regen would remove a good chunk of the &quot;extra&quot; ability that hybrids enjoy from a large mana pool, FT, KEI/songs, and high +mana items, *without* removing the utility of their spells.  They'd still be able to cast all those nifty utility buffs, OR do group heals/cures, OR dps/debuffs/aggro generation... but not ALL of them, consistently, over long periods of time.  In other words, they'd get a benefit commensurate with the relatively small deficit in tanking ability (hp, AC, dps) they currently suffer from, instead of being hugely ahead of the game.  This used to be compensated for by the hybrid spell cost penalty and other limits, but these were (unwisely) removed by SoE WITHOUT compensating changes in itemization.  Time to rectify that, and unless they want to go thru the DB and nerf/fix a truely staggering number of items, this seems to be the easiest way to do it.  I suppose you could implement a &quot;flag&quot;, player set somehow, that switched gear from adding HP OR adding mana, but that'd take some rather inspired coding...<br />
<br />
Basically, the ability to tank and/or melee DPS well is a HUGE benefit, and needs to be balanced out with significant drawbacks- ones that currently don't exist for most hybrid classes.  About the only &quot;adequately&quot; balanced hybrid class I'm familiar with are rangers, and they are STILL hugely better than warriors from levels 1 to 50+ (when a warrior is basically a ranger w/o a spellbook), but that's another topic entirely.  <br />
<br />
Plus, my RL wife plays a high end ranger and she'll kill me if I suggest any really hardcore ranger nerfs. ;)<br />

Which is why I pretty clearly stated -at level 65-. If you're not at level 65 and you actually rely on hate generation past your spears and (again no clue what level you are so I won't make assumptions as to what you can cast reliably in regards to dots - although you should probably camp Blood of Pain) something that generates DPS, you should use Fear over whatever Terror spell you are using. Disregard this if you are level 54 and do most of your experiencing in Velious.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think the original posters ideas have tunnel vision.  There is more of a problem than just hybrid vs pure melee.  I do agree with your criteria for plausible changes sony will make.<br />
<br />
1) Fix ALL classes hps.  Casters hps are way too high as well.   <br />
<br />
Pure melee get 100% of hps from items AND buffs, Knights get 90%, other hybrids get 80%, healers get 75%, casters get 50%.  Those numbers probably aren't perfect but it shows I feel every class needs to be modified.   <br />
<br />
2) Fix warrior aggro.  I would suggest a direct aggro added to the taunt key even on a failure that is usable at range.  Nothing amazing but enough to consistantly get aggro over slow at the top end.<br />
<br />
3) Nerf mana regen in some form.  Its reached the point where its simply broken.  I do not know a realistic way to do it.  Personally I think buffs should be group only and should fade if you leave group unless MGB was used.  Yeah this would be annoying for raids but would cut down on KEI abuse somewhat.<br />
<br />
4) Mitigation is broken as well.  They really messed up when they added the defensive AA's and gave the same levels of them to all classes.  Spread it out more.  only give casters level 1, give hybrids/healers lvl 2, give knights and pure melee lvl 3,  give warriors a level 4<br />
<br />
There is more but thats a start at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The issue with Blood of Hate, Furor, is that at one cast per minute, it consumes  162.5% of the mana regen given by Voice of Quellious. Spear of Decay is 112.5% of VoQ at one cast per minute.  At one cast per minute, Terror of Thule consumes 30% of the mana regeneration granted by VoQ.  Again, at one cast per minute, Fear is 20% of VoQ. Clinging Darkness is 10%. <br />
 While Mental Corruption is superb at bosltering VoQ, it is unrealistic to mantain a Blood + Spear on every mob while sustaining Z-Bite and sufficient mana to patch heal via Touch of Innoruuk/Volatis at FT 2-5 for the majority of Shadow Knights... Especially in groups so damage heavy that you'll be killing LDoN mobs every 30-40 seconds. I will grant that it'd be pretty solid aggro, but I just can't keep it up. So, I use Fear/Clinging Darkness.

Remf, when I signed up to be a Shadow Knight, I didn't want to be a warrior. I didn't want to match your tanking, I didn't want to out DPS you. I wanted to be able to take a hit, yet put out reasonable damage with black magics while doing so. You'll note I said reasonable, not 'paralleling a necro'. Your suggestions would make me either a warrior with a nifty self proc buff, or a Ranger with extra HP/AC. Any time I'd enter combat, I'd become a warrior with an aggro edge and less dodge. Restore a REAL gap in our tanking ability. Something that makes a cleric sit up and notice, say.. 20%. Unless they raise Warrior skill caps and start tweaking the way you use gear, chances are, that means a nerf to me. Give warriors aggro suffecient to do their job. I've seen a billion suggestions on how to do so. I'm not a warrior, I don't know precisely what you need. But make me /actively/ use my spell book to bridge the gap between you and me. Make me a Shadow Knight. Don't turn me into a lesser clone of you that can also happen to snare on incoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hola again-<br />
<br />
Hrm.  Well, how do you suggest they balance the ability to tank AND the ability to cast spells?  The two most obvious options that occured to me were to make sure you can only do one OR the other, and not both at the same time (i.e. remove channeling), or to limit the extent you can do one WHILE doing the other (i.e. limit mana regen, or mana pool).<br />
<br />
Being able to tank AND cast basically non-stop has the benefits of pure melee plus the benefits of being a caster (on top of class specific abilities no less).  That's just not even remotely balanced.  Casters can't really tank.  Pure melee can't really cast.  How can it be balanced that hybrids can do both, quite well, AT THE SAME TIME?<br />
<br />
In my honest opinion, warriors and other pure melee are about where they need to be RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER; it's the hybrids that break things currently.  Note: rogues and monks have what look like legitimate gripes vs. dps caster classes, but I'm not trying to fix them, melee vs. pure caster balance is a whole nother subject. ;)<br />
<br />
So anyway- the best way to improve things, in my opinion, isn't to buff warriors up to knight status, it's to force knights to decide if they want to melee OR cast.  It's the ability to do both at the same time, enabled by the stupid itemization that let's them tank adequately, that's the real core of the problem.<br />
<br />
So- pally/SKs without channeling wouldn't be able to aggro lock like the currently do, or bust out heals/taps during fights.  That's a problem exactly why?  If they are tanking, they really shouldn't be casting anyway.  Knights with limited mana regen would have to med between fights (like regular casters do, for instance) if they want to cast a lot?  Okay, why exactly is that a problem?  If they want to cast, why shouldn't they have to med?<br />
<br />
Yah, both of those changes are quite ouchie, and will significantly affect current play styles, but they are a). simple to implement; b). really strike at the core of the imbalance, without causing further imbalance by changing other classes; c). make a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
People wanted to play hybrids to be able to melee and have spells to cast- but there's really no reason to expect to be able to do both at the same time.  Before the itemization totally screwed up the tanking disparity (i.e. post kunark), maybe it made sense or wasn't a big deal, but now the damage is done.  Time to do some triage and stop the hemorrhaging.<br />
<br />
As always, just my opinion-<br />

<br />
Yes, I know about the AAs and spells I'm missing out on right now.  After I finish all of the 55 AAs, I will probably level to the top of the next LDoN level bracket and work on the next AAs.<br />
<br />
I agree that warriors need a boost; or, more correctly, a complete overhaul.  SKs are a little overpowered compared to the environment but warriors are still sitting two expansions back.  I think the warrior problem goes much further than comparisons to the knight classes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">And those changes also: d) Invalidate the existance of the class. You are in effect telling me that I must play as a warrior, or that I must play as a Necromancer. In that case, why bother trying to be a little bit of each? It's the same as playing a warrior who's being asked not to tank. <br />
<br />
We should NOT be able to BOTH quite well. We can, and should, suffer a significant disparity in terms of melee ability when compared to a pure melee. What I can do with a sword should be absolutely decimated by what you can do with that same sword. I should be using my mana, which can, and is used in a vastly inferior fashion to the necromancer class, to make up that significant imbalance. A necromancer can sustain approximately five to six times the damage in mana that I can, not to mention the difference in pets. That's really about where it should be. 20%. <br />
<br />
What went wrong in Kunark is that my ability to cast failed to bridge the gap, significantly. What's wrong now is two fold: First, My melee ability has increased too far, because of itemization, and the relative trivilialization of the pure melee in the face of massively ramping mob damage output and clerical healing power. I'm sorry, but chealing every round of combat is /ludicrous/. Second, my spells are now far more than what is needed to bridge the paltry gap between us.<br />
<br />
Finally, on a completely seperate issue, because of ramped mob damage as well as massively ramped caster damage, aggro by warrior DPS has become insufficient. As a class, Warriors are still designed for Kunark and Velious. The basic system through which a warrior gains aggro needs to be overhauled in the face of mobs that are capable of turning an enchanter into a bloody sack of silk on the ground in less than a round of combat. Immune spell aggro probably needs to be nerfed significantly as well: Such a change would probably ramp my mana consumption for by 2-4 fold, and 8-10 fold for a paladin.<br />
<br />
Restore the disparity between our ability to give and take Melee combat. Make it so we are forced to use our spell book to catch up, not to gain ground. Give warriors effective exp group/raid trash aggro. Give them toys too. All the classes should be functional and fun. Right now, Warriors aren't functional or fun. You'd make me very unfun to play.  Give me real differences from you, not cookie cutter classes.</div></div><hr />

Problem is, knight classes are pretty much broken.  Warriors are about where they should be (i.e. can tank pretty much what they need to be able to).  Increasing warrior stats/skills/abilities would just make them broken too...  I didn't think this way for quite awhile, prefering not to cry &quot;nerf!&quot;, but I honestly think it's time for one. :/  Those two, in particular, seem to be the easiest and most effective, without totally ruining the classes getting hit.  You'd still be able to be a necro sometimes, and a warrior other times- just not both at the same time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Remf I really don't think you know what you're suggesting.<br />
<br />
Knights are their own class, just like beastlords and bards. They work by the synergy of using all their abilities together in the more complex game EQ has become.<br />
<br />
They aren't there for ppl who want to play a warrior-lite or a caster-lite different parts of the day... If I wanted to do that I'd make a warrior and a caster.<br />
<br />
The real problem IS with warriors. There you have a class which is just defined by bigger numbers and so is constantly fighting mudflation in a game like EQ where items input directly to the most basic stats (like HP).<br />
<br />
What honestly is the difference between a paladin soloing a dragon or a warrior + healer killing the same beast? It's not like sks and pallies are able to solo for exp at any decent rate at 65.<br />
<br />
If they don't give warriors added depth (basically more fun) and just leave them as point and press 'a' with bigger numbers... then these numerical advantage are going to be - have to be- pretty slight (but still appreciable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">You need to accept that the enviroment that we are all fighting within is  *going* to have to be changed.  You are looking at too small a piece of the puzzle and its making you unreliable when it comes to finding a real solution to the problem.  Its already been proven by the ranger who came complaining about Jolt.  Think about what you are saying, fully. <br />
<br />
You say Knights are broken compared to warriors.  This is true in some respects, I do not believe in necessarily the ones you have keyed in on though.  BUT, understand that what you are saying follows along a longer path then you realize.  You &quot;fix&quot; knights by breaking them.  Ok, good.  Now, you already stated that &quot;monks and rogues have a problem with dps casters&quot;.  How exactly do you think that is going to be resolved?  The same way you have advocated dealing with knights because &quot;I don't want to boost warriors and have the whole game messed up, lets just mess up a small number of classes&quot;.  Ok good, that worked well.  Now, monks and rogues take up their cause against casters.  Casters get nerfed.  How exactly are you going to make it through pop without the burst damage you've been relying on?  Granted, not all encounters play to caster strenghts, but there are several that do.  Ok, now we have a bigger mess then the warriors were hoping for.  What needs to happen?  Well, because we wanted to ruin as few classes as possible (worked well didn't it?) we now have to retune the game to compensate for the lessened power of the player base as a whole.  Glade we sidestepped that problem!  &quot;Fix&quot; the three classes that &quot;need&quot; it.  Then boost the content, its just so much easier.  Its been done before, remember the rod nerf?  Player base as a whole lost power, content had to be redone.  <br />
<br />
Having different definitions of what classes are supposed to be doing is killing any discussion on the topic.  How are things supposed to play out?<br />
<br />
-Warriors universally the best, hands down, no one will ever want another tank?<br />
<br />
-Warriors and knights tank roughly the same, but using different tools to accomplish that goal?<br />
<br />
Ok, once you decide that, pick what kind of roles you think are fair-<br />
<br />
-Warriors are raid tanks, no one else is capable of filling that role period.  Content must be static and boring to accomodate this wish.  Knights only job is to (a) sit and watch (b) not be there to begin with (c) offtank IF a guild cannot field enough warriors to both MT and offtank with them (d) knights are offtankers, they are tailor made for this job and are the best at it, but warriors get the Big mobs(e) role changes depending on encounter, ones that require the best damage absorption belong to warriors, ones requiring very good agro (but not the best absorption) belong to knights.<br />
<br />
It saddens me that many of you seriously want A-C to be reality and claim to do so in the name of balance.  <br />
<br />
I suggest some of you go talk to a real caster before you try to decide how to balance spell casting, its painfully obvous that *some* of you have no clue about what is going on with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Hola again-<br />
<br />
When knight classes couldn't tank adequately, it made sense to allow them to cast while fighting, or to basically continuously cast w/o medding due to high mana regen.  Years of rotten itemization has changed that tho, and knight classes are now quite adequate tanks.  Warriors, which have ALWAYS been slaves to itemization, are also about where they need to be, and are able to tank about as well as needed, without making the game (more) trivial.  So, since buffing up an already adequate class (warriors) to match two classes that are currently significantly overpowered would only result in *3* broken classes, I think it makes more sense to bring the two classes back into line instead.  This has lots of precedence (necros when kunark shipped, monks getting shaved down during luclin, etc.) and, while quite painful to the affected classes, was good for the game overall.<br />
<br />
Since eliminating the ability to adequately tank would greatly cripple the knights for grinds AND boss mob fights, I figure hitting their casting ability both makes more sense and would be less painful in the long run.  The two most efficient ways I could think of to do so, that still allow the knights to do the snap aggro thing AND maintain the utility of their spells, was to hamper casting during melee (i.e. no channeling, also convert the channeling AA skill to fizzle reduction, or refund), or to cut back their mana regen to make casting spells a distinctly secondary skill compared to their melee.<br />
<br />
Neither of those changes make knights unappealing for their raid roles, or for exp grinds- it just brings them back closer to parity with pure melee classes.  All the stuns, heals, buffs, debuffs, etc. will still work, it'll just be more important WHEN and how often they are cast.  Would that change play style?  Sure- that's the whole point of making the changes.<br />
<br />

Given how much warriors are complaining about their current roll, I don't think I want to be a scaled down version of a warrior anytime I tank.<br />
<br />

You say you want knights to still have snap agro and the utility of their spells but how are we supposed to accomplish either if we're constantly OOM?<br />

Honestly, I don't understand why any warrior would want to nerf knights at all.  I would think it would be FAR preferable for SOE to give warriors better stats and/or new abilities.  I know I'd rather get a new toy for myself than have one taken away from someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">You are still suggesting changes that target 2 specific classes without fully thinking the impact it has on the other classes that also use those skill systems.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
&quot;to cut back their mana regen to make casting spells a distinctly secondary skill compared to their melee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casting isn't a &quot;secondary&quot; skill for rangers, and I suspect not for BST, and is part of our balanced place as a DPS class.  Make it so I can only maintain my nuke DPS for a couple fights and you have destroyed the balance between my class and rogues/monks/warriors.<br />
<br />
The average 65th ranger probably has about 3k mana... 3k mana = 6 nukes (3 of Freezing and 3 of Brushfire), or about 3 exp group fights.  And once OOM, the average ranger, with probably FT3 would take 10 minutes to regain enough mana to cast another Freezing Wind.<br />
<br />
That of course means not using any buffs at all.  Just casting our level 65 buffs (PoTW, Cry of Thunder) would mean spending nearly 850 mana.  Thats 28 minutes worth of FT3 regen to replace that mana so they could nuke., which again, is part of why rangers are balanced.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, your comparison is flawed.  Look at the number of songs a Bard has that actually use mana, and their mana regen abilities aren't nearly so crippling.  The other Hybrids all use mana for everything.<br />

I agree that mana regeneration is a large part of what unbalanced the game in the first place.  However, at this point, so much of the content has been created with mana regeneration in mind that it can't be taken out of the game.<br />

The problem with nerfing knight casting abilities to make them &quot;part time&quot; is that knights aren't part time casters, they're full time casters.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Hi again-<br />
<br />
First, I do want to be clear that I don't think BOTH changes are needed, or that either one by themselves would be necessarily sufficient.  Hope I didn't mislead.<br />
<br />
Having said that, with the mana regen change, you'd still be able to buff, cure, tap, stun, whatever- just not as often.  With bard-style mana regen, FT still works, just no songs/rods/crack.  So if you wanted/needed to play a pure caster role, yah- you'd have to med a lot, just like the casters do.  If you wanted to melee, you'd have to be careful what ya cast and when, saving mana up for need rather than continuous use.  You'd still be able to melee full-time, with very good DPS and/or tanking- but you'd have spells to fall back on if/when needed.  Kinda like how it was supposed to work methinks.  I.e. a decent tank with added utility.<br />
<br />
For the channeling change, it'd ONLY affect you if you were getting hit/ae'ed; otherwise nothing would change at all (aside from annoying interruptions from client-says-I'm-stopped-server-thinks-I'm-still-moving situations).  Yah, you'd take a big hit in DPS and/or aggro lock when getting hit- that's the whole point of the change.  Operative concept is snap aggro = okay, aggro lock = bad.<br />
<br />
Hope all that makes sense, even if it isn't terribly palatible.  Sure, in a perfect world it'd be nice to never have to nerf anything, but I honestly think something has to change w/ hybrids to keep the game healthy.  There's currently no significant drawback to  playing a knight class, and ALL classes should have significant good AND bad points, both fundamental and relative to the other classes.<br />
<br />
Also, I wouldn't worry too much about either of these changes being actually done- SOE only seems to nerf things I *don't* want them to, and I'd warned about just this type of problem (brought on by stupid itemization) years ago...<br />
<br />

<br />
See, that's where SKs differ from other caster types (although I'm sure other casters have instances of this as well actually); many of our spells are only useful if they are cast over and over.  Take lifetaps for instance.  At level 57, my biggest lifetap is for 150hp.  That's about 3% of my normal buffed hp and less than 1% of most exp mobs' hp.  What utility is there in casting that a single time?<br />
<br />
You'd still be able to melee full-time, with very good DPS and/or tanking- but you'd have spells to fall back on if/when needed.   <br />
<br />
Just as Ladas mentioned that spells are a large portion of ranger dps, they are also important for SK dps.  Nine out of ten spells I cast during normal combat are spears (SK nukes).  If you nerf mana regen, dps goes down too.  So now you've decreased our mana regen, tanking ability, and dps.  Good thing I can still buff the group for 24atk points once every half hour, if I've spent enough time medding.<br />

The pure melee need to be given depth and bredth (and those fun things they see classes with mana have)... we don;t need to nerf the other classes to the same one dimensional level.<br />

One of the changes would prevent casting WHILE GETTING HIT ONLY, the other would remove the typically unlimited mana pool that currently exists.  Neither would remove their ability to dish out DPS, tank, grab snap aggro, or cast their utility spells; i.e. totally adequate tanks + utility.  How's that so severe?  <br />
<br />
About the only other real alternative would be to go through the entire item/augument DB and remove most of the mana and FT/focus from all the non-hybrid-only gear.  Pretty much the same net effect, but much more painful both for SOE and the players involved...<br />
<br />
In short, hybrids really shouldn't be allowed to tank &quot;adequately&quot; AND cast while fighting/continuously; removing tanking ability would limit them far more than limiting the casting imho.<br />

Reducing a rangers mana regen to FT only, for the average ranger, it would reduce his DPS ability to 1 nuke every 10 minutes after the first 6 casts.<br />

That would essentially reduce a ranger to warrior levels of melee damage without the tanking and without any utility other than tracking (no mana).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Brax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Remf, I think you fail to understand the fact that an SK is NOT a warrior sometimes and then a necromancer sometimes, he's a little bit of both at the same time, hence why he is a hybrid.  The SK is not meant to CHOOSE which he wants to be at a given time, because one side does not function without the other.  Most SK spells were meant to be cast DURING combat while TAKING damage.  And if you haven't noticed, an SK doesn't regen mana nearly as fast as a necro does, not at all.  SK's were not meant to be Warriors with utility, they were meant to be SK's.  I'm not saying that there aren't things that need to be tweaked, but what you are asking for is too much, regardless of it's simplicity in changing coding.  If you're looking for simplicity in coding, why don't they just delete the code completely, I bet that'd be really easy for them to do.<br />
<br />
     I don't want to outtank a warrior, I didn't start tanking in groups until I was in my 40's, and even then I didn't realize what it meant to be a &quot;tank,&quot;  I was just the guy who was taking the hits and getting healed.  I think most SK's would gladly give up the role of tanking, it opens our spell slots for a lot more interesting and less used spells.  But on the other hand, I don't need to bow down to my &quot;parent class&quot; as I have seen many times on this board.  I am NOT, and NEVER have been a warrior.  I was bred an SK, I was born an SK, I've lived as an SK, and on more than one occastion :)  I've died an SK.<br />
<br />
     I'll cede that there are things that need to be done to create balance, but I will not give in that I MUST be compared to a warrior for the sake of saving the warriors.  We don't work the same way, we just have parallels.  You do things your way, I do them mine.  I'll not be reserved to choose to cast or melee, one or the other, it doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
     I've read posts by other, Furor, Haass, etc., where there are suggestions that make more sense to bring all of us in line with each other without nerfing anything severely.<br />
<br />
     I wholeheartedly agree that spells that are resisted, or the mob is too high of a level for should not generate aggro, make it so they don't.  This increases a knights mana usage as they are forced now to use the high level spells that they were intended to use.  That alone will cause them to be more sparing with their usage, as overuse will cause OOM.<br />
<br />
     Problems with your ideas for an SK:<br />
<br />
-Remove channeling:  Lifetaps, and Stat taps become useless, they are only cast during combat, and if I'm tanking I can't cast under your theory, making spells that are at the core of an SK useless.  If I'm not tanking I don't need to lifetap, cause I'm not taking hits.<br />
<br />
-Remove mana regen:  All hybrids operate on the same mana regen table as I understand, and to say that knights mana regen is too high is to also say that other hybrids is too high, and most have clearly stated that they feel the other hybrids are well balanced.  Removing an SK's mana regen will make them use their utility more sparingly?  If I got no mana from the last two pulls, how am I supposed to lifetap, etc on the next pull, cause last time I checked the tank doesn't get to sit during the fight like the casters do to med.  And also last time I checked, groups don't stop pulling to let the tank med, even if they need to.  I can 't count how many groups have continued to pull while I'm OOM, and the only thing that saved my ass from killing the casters is what mana regen I have while standing to tank.  I don't have uber FT25, I don't have 7k mana in my mana pool.<br />
<br />
     These nerfs may work on the Time level SK's to balance vs. Time level Warriors, but on the ground floor where I stand, I'm still busting my ass to keep aggro and keep mana, and I'd say I'm working just as hard as the warrior standing in the next group doing the tanking over there.<br />
<br />
     My apologies if this is kind of jumbled and all over the place, but I wrote it down as it came out in my head.<br />
<br />
     In conclusion, if a nerf is needed, I pray it is something that makes sense, not &quot;let's just do the easiest quick fix we can to this situation.&quot;  They did that to warriors with EB items to fix aggro, didn't it piss you off that your disparity was cast to the side so easily?  The only thing you're going to accomplish by the nerfs you want it to make us all pissed off, and feel worthless and dejected?  I bet you could understand how that feels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I'd be opposed to removing the channelling skill because of a few factors.<br />
<br />
1.  It seems to me that a 'combat caster' (i.e. Knights, rangers, BL's) would necessarily be adept at focusing through a spell during melee combat.<br />
<br />
2. There are many many many instances of spells which need to be cast during combat which do not affect aggro.    Things I can think of off the bat are...   Group member being beaten upon by a second mob while a CH is in progress on a paladin.   He turns and heals that party member.   Paladin is soloing in Lower Guk (hardly a new thing), gets somewhat low on health, casts root, backs up and heals himself, and re-enters battle.     These are just a couple examples of the strength inherent and absolute NEED for channelling by knights.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty vehemently opposed to the route of affecting channelling for hybrids, as it's inappropriate because the affected target is far too large and encompassing of their core strength as melee who can cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Y'know, it's funny.<br />
<br />
 For years Knights complained that they couldn't tank, and the spellbook didn't compensate.<br />
<br />
 Now they can tank, and the spellbook is even more powerful than before.<br />
<br />
 Ideally, I'd like to see hybrids choose how melee/caster centric they be with every gear choice. Up your caster side, lower your melee side, and vice versa. That won't happen. Neither will boosting pure melees past hybrids enough to make up for that spellbook.<br />
<br />
 IF you want to nerf anything - get rid of aggro lock, and make Knights less of a tank, but not enough to be obsolete.<br />
<br />
 EDIT - No, I don't recommend eliminating channeling, or cutting mana pools/regen. I purely recommend that you not tank almost as well as us. Right now the difference is too low to be even bothered with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Hi again-<br />
<br />
Does anyone disagree that the root of the problem is horrible itemization?  Or that warriors are quite adequate tanks up to the endgame, and don't really need more ability/capability EXCEPT when compared to knight class hybrids?  If so, please elaborate!<br />
<br />
If not, then there's basically 3 solutions I see:<br />
<br />
-RETROACTIVELY fix itemization.  VERY ouchie from SOE *and* player point of view, and would negatively affect both melee/tanking AND casting by hybrids.  Probably the best fix, but also the hardest.<br />
<br />
-Make it so that hybrids aren't adequate tanks anymore, most likely by nerf to AC or HP or mitigation/avoidance.  To make a difference, this would have to impact existing content, not future expansions, and would return knights roughly to where they were during kunark, albeit with much better casting ability now.<br />
<br />
-Make it so that hybrids CANNOT function as adequate tanks AND casters at the same time, by removing some spell casting functionality.  Possible changes are mana pool, mana regen, or ability to cast while meleeing.  Reducing the mana pool enough to have the desired effect would greatly impact knight usability during end-game fights, which is why I thought the other two made more sense.<br />
<br />
Of the three, I think the first would be the best but most unlikely to be implemented, and the third (in some form) the most straight forward and (in the long term) least painful.  Removing the ability to tank adequately (i.e. be able to take hits and hold aggro) would make those classes unviable again, a Bad Thing.<br />
<br />
The arguments I've heard by knight classes seem like something I've heard described as &quot;Russian Negotiation&quot;... basically, &quot;What is mine is mine, what is yours is negotiable&quot;. :)  If yall really don't  like the options above, I'd love to hear other ideas, based on the criteria I'd posted at the beginning of the thread, that also result in a meaningful, concrete reduction/limitation in the knight classes current capabilities.  What, exactly, SHOULD be the drawback in playing a hybrid, if it isn't significantly compromised tanking, casting, or utility?<br />
<br />
BTW, I'd posted this in the outhouse deliberately, cause I kinda expected to get badly flamed; thank you all very much for disappointing me and being quite civil. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The current problem was brought about by two things:<br />
<br />
1) Bad itemization<br />
2) Neglect of the warrior class (and pure melee in general) during recent game upgrades.  Casters (hybrids included) got AA, tons of new spells, focus items, and FT gear.  Pure melee only got comparable AA.<br />
<br />
At this point, I don't think it's worth fixing the items because they will all be outdated as future expansions come out anyway.  Maybe the very high end items can be retooled to fix the PoT problems.  Then, in the next expansion, SOE should do itemization correctly, giving warriors more ac/hp to make up for the mana that knights get (or making knights choose mana or hp but not both).<br />
<br />
The main thing SOE needs to do, however, is break down and update the pure melee classes.  They need new abilities similar to what every other class has gotten in the last few expansions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">My god, I'm going to agree with Partha. :o <br />
<br />
As I understood it when I sat down at the computer and agreed to that &quot;Very Difficult&quot; character, I was going to be an inferior tank to warriors, but that I would be able to fill the role adequately. In return, I'd get compensated with my spell book. <br />
<br />
Once upon a time, back in the bad old days, my spellbook came nowhere near bridging the gap between me and a warrior. However, and I hate to break this to my brothers in arms, Kunark is over. Our spellbooks are real, up to date tools which actually function in the environment we hunt in. Yeah, my 470 tap isn't -that- much of the 7k HP I buff to in my exp group, but, you know, it's a hell of a lot  nicer than the 15 of 1000 I used to work with.  It's also superior to Chloroblast.. assuming I can get it off while getting wailed on. Lots of the time, I can't. If I really want, I can go fucking nuts with Dot/Nuke DPS. With my 30 AA HT, I can do things that make wizards wince. Shadow Knights are now balanced against the environment that is the Planes of Power. We're probaby even over balanced, but more than small mitigation/Avoidance/HP nerfs, and we can't tank adequately at the high levels again for exp groups or for offtanking purposes. You can have Quarm and the gods, but I'd kinda like the occasional chance at my own 3 minutes of glory, even if it's all of 5% of the encounters out there.<br />
<br />
Therefore, it must be time for the warrior to get something that makes him stand out as a first class tank again. A cleric should fucking well notice the difference between healing an SK and a Paladin and a Warrior, slow or no slow. And that margin should not be pissed away because the enchanter slowed too early and drew aggro or had to wait so long to slow the difference was a moot point. And while we're at it, you boys need some toys. <br />
<br />
So, sorry, Remf, we're going to have to agree to disagree. You state that knights are 'brokenly overpowered', and while I will agree that certain portions need tweaked downwards, I believe that the pure melee are so horribly and hideously crippled by having not grown since Kunark that no amount of nerfage to a hybrid can restore your class to a healthy state.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to know exactly what you mean by this.  Do you mean that knights can choose to melee OR cast, but NEVER both?  Or do you mean that knights can use ther magic to augment what they lack (in respect to warriors) while tanking, but not make use of other spells.  Ie-Stuns and (self)heals to help mitigate the damage we naturally take more of (or should), but not things like root or heals for group membrs?  My personal feelings are this:  The spellbook should make up for what knights lack in comparison to warriors in regards to tanking, nothing else.  The spellbook should be all about tanking.  In this vein, I think things like self heals (obviously rudimentary ones like light of nife or chloroblast, though they are not currently self only) and stuns should be acceptable.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, all the spellbook should ever, ever be good for is to help a knight tank.  Is that an unacceptable approach?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Brax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I disagree, I don't want my spellbook to be nothing more than a way to make up for lack of not being a warrior.

An SK's spellbook wasn't designed to give him the abilitiy to equal that of a warrior, they were to give him abilities like that of a necromancer.  At this point the ability to hold aggro like no other was just a nice side effect.  If they wanna take that away then so be it, just as long as I can still play the game like an SK.<br />
<br />
     So by all means, you stick to wanting to be a warrior with spells, and I'll stick to being an SK.<br />

<br />
That doesn't really make all that much sense.  There are three tank classes.  Its not really about being a &quot;warrior with spells&quot;.  The point is that, for lack of a better word, all three classes are trying to be a &quot;tank&quot; class.  They have different means of doing that.  Its not that knights are trying to be warriors.  We are trying to fill the same role with different tools.  From that perspective, it only makes sense that those addictional tools that each class recieves be bent towards fulfilling that role as best as they can.  <br />
<br />
If I followed your logic, wizards wanting to be good at dps are just &quot;rogues who want to cast spells instead of use a dagger&quot;.  Its far too simplistic an approach to be realistic.  There are a limited number of roles in everquest.  Each role can be adequately fulfilled by several classes.  Just because this is so, doesn't mean that every class trying to fill that role wants to be the paradigm of that role.  I want to play a paladin, which means I want to fulfill the role of a tank with the tools a paladin possesses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Hi again-<br />
<br />
Okay, this quote seems pretty reasonable, and seems to be a pretty common thread:<br />
 want to play a paladin, which means I want to fulfill the role of a tank with the tools a paladin possesses.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the way it is now, both knight classes are fulfilling the role of a tank with the exact same tools a warrior possesses PLUS the additional abilities of their class.  In short, a they can tank (hold aggro, deliver DPS, take hits) very nearly as well as a warrior can- WITHOUT casting any spells!  Where is the drawback to playing a knight then?  <br />
<br />
If what I'm hearing is correct, you'd like to remove that capability, so spell casting was absolutely *required* to tank adequately?  That doesn't seem to be all that good a trade to me, unless I'm missing something?  <br />
<br />
Here's a thought- try playing for an hour or so (say one LDON mission) WITHOUT casting any spells, even self buffs.  I think you'll find that it's very do-able; warriors do that all the time after all, and it's quite adequate for most non-raid tanking purposes.  That's balance, where the challenge is pretty much consistent with the capability.  Adding spells along with the ability to tank like that isn't balanced at all, in relative or absolute terms.  For instance, a fairly high end pally I know does LDON hard missions and runs 90-100% mana through the entire duration while tanking/buffing/healing, fully taking the place of a warrior who'd *just* be the tank in the same situation.  <br />
<br />
Point of all this: right now, casting isn't needed by knight classes to tank adequately (i.e. as well as an equivalent warrior), and allowing them to do both tanking and casting, quite well and essentially simultaneously and continuously, is perhaps the most egregious example of the current imbalance in the tank classes.<br />

 HP can vary from as little as 500 hp to 1k, yeah. At lower levels it's a bit more of a pronounced thing.<br />

 If they did my fixes, I don't think it would significantly affect Paladin and SK ability to tank - they've still managed to get plenty of HP and AC out of the gear that's there now.

<br />
Casting while tanking allows:<br />
1). trivial aggro lock, arguably a Bad Thing for balance/the game in general<br />
2). significantly enhanced DPS and/or avoidance<br />
3). utility PLUS tanking at the same time.<br />
<br />
If those were balanced out by other drawbacks, none of them (individually) would be a big issue.  They aren't tho, which is.<br />
<br />
That explain it?  If (and only if, obviously) you consider warrior's ability to tank as &quot;balanced&quot;, then being able to do that *plus*  cast is, by definition, unbalanced.  I don't see &quot;giving up&quot; the ability to tank and cast as &quot;breaking the knight classes&quot;, unless you consider warriors &quot;broken&quot; already.  I.e. they can do everything warriors do now, without spells, plus the things I listed above and more.<br />
<br />
I'm not really wed to any particular &quot;fix&quot; actually, I just haven't seen many other realistic ones that 1). didn't involved &quot;overbuffing&quot; warriors up to knight status, or 2). REALLY breaking knight classes by making them back into non-capable tanks.<br />

<br />
Something mentioned by Djjinn in response to some new warrior skill idea's i posted, sounds fairly 'interesting' to me and I wondered how much opposition knights might have to it?<br />
<br />
His idea was that whenever he casts, a knight should take a 15 second hit in the mitigation department, roleplaying justification being that the knights concentration was split at that time. <br />
<br />
If we accept that poor itemisation has lowered the warrior mitigation advantage from where it was supposed to be this has the advantage of leaving a knight where he wants to be in relation to a warrior when performing as a warrior whilst when calling on his caster side there is a trade off in noticeably worse tanking for a short period. <br />
<br />
This removes some of the controversy with aggro lock, since if a knight wants it then he can do so, understanding that he will tax the healer that bit more. Or he can use less lock and tank that much closer to a warrior. <br />
<br />
It reduces the itemisation wrangling since when using his 'plus' over a warrior, his mitigation is more in line with where it should be if itemisation was on par. <br />
<br />
It also adds an additional element of judgement and 'atmosphere' to when a knight casts plus encourages knights away from using 'immune' spells.<br />
<br />
How would the more moderate knights here view this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Hmm as an extreme example, how would people (warriors and knights) feel about non casting knight = 100% warrior mitigation,<br />
casting knight = somewhere between 60-80% mitigation. Basically a knight suffering penalties similar to that found in a warriors aggressive discipline for a short term after casting.<br />

Equal tanking with a group accepting that a knight be that much more 'spikey' in his damage absorbtion if he casts.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I'm pretty sure that avoidance already takes a hit when you are &quot;casting&quot;, the same as if you are ducked, facing the opposite direction, or sitting, and that it seems to be modified by channeling ability.<br />
<br />
With a warrior, try using a long cast clicky while getting beat on by a green mob, and compare the &quot;hits&quot; you get vs. when you just stand there letting it beat on ya.  Do the same with a caster.  I've tried the above with high and low channeling ability casters, (tho I didn't parse the results, doh!) and empirically concluded the above.  I don't know if mitigation is similarly affected, but it's quite possible...<br />
<br />
Having said all that, balancing that type of change out would be fairly tricky, and I'm not sure how compatible with the combat system it is, but it's not a unreasonable idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Avoidance skills during cast = 0 would make for an interesting change, as well as perhaps a lowering of our ability to get 'misses' during this time. For RP reasons, Avoidance goes down when concentrating: The sum total of my armor and the innate 'hardness' of my body doesn't. After all, I trained much the same way you did, just when you hit the kegs at the end of the day, I hit the books... And when I was sparring with my master, my blood was probably on fire while I was puking my guts out. I would, however, suggest that any 'post cast' penalties don't last significantly longer than the cast time/reset time of the spell gems. It's enough for hurtful spikes, especially against higher mobs, while wisely chosen casts can go a long way to reducing it... Further, for me, 15 seconds isn't exactly 'spikey', it's a third the fight. I probably shouldn't spend more than 20% of a fight in this manner.<br />
<br />
And Partha, you'll note that I'm consistantly in favor of restoring a real gap between our tanking abilities. Since because of the nature of PoP, mine can't go very far down, that means yours needs to go up. The simplest way to do this is to rework skill caps. They proved they could extend the integers with PoP stats going to 355, let's see where punching your Defense Skill to 275 or 300 puts warriors for defensive. I suggest 'toys' as well because I feel that warriors need active skills they can use every fight to alter the course of the battle. As it stands, the class is entirely too passive and dependant on the RNG. There needs to be more of a way for a warrior to be a 'good warrior' as opposed to a 'lucky warrior'. <br />

I want situations, preferably common ones, where it makes sense to take any one of us over the others. Don't have a slower? Take a Warrior with the brute force tanking to survive anyway. Have a slower and a cleric, but got shit for damage?

Your two core ideas are terrible.  The result would be far worse than the status quo.<br />
<br />
1) Removing the channeling skill means that I can't FD and can't lifetap during a battle.  These are two of the most basic shadowknight abilities.  See Frodlin's post for other good reasons.<br />
<br />
2) Destorying my mana regen must sound good to someone with zero mana, but how does it maintain hybrid balance against pure casters?  (Hint: it doesn't) <br />
<br />
If either one of your ideas was implemented, let alone both, I'm fairly sure the game would be a lot less fun for me and I'd cancel my EQ account.  Gratz on all the groups you are sure to get, with far fewer hybrids bothering to log in anymore.<br />
<br />
Improving taunt for warriors, adding new skills for pure melee, and forcing knights to work harder for aggro, are all concepts that I support.  Lots of suggestions have been made for implementing these concepts, and I won't bore you by rehashing them in this thread.  All of these can be accomplished while preserving the fun and uniqueness of hybrid classes.<br />
<br />
There's simply no reason to advocate the destruction of two classes because you couldn't think of anything better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SKs can tank like warriors do now, due to their enhanced AC, HP, and mitigation; you no longer NEED to be able to cast during a fight to tank adequately, therefore the &quot;loss&quot; of that ability has already been compensated for.  You could still do everything you currently do, just not while you are taking a warrior's place tanking.  Warrior's can't do those things while getting hit either, after all.  How is that unbalanced?<br />
<br />
2) Destorying my mana regen must sound good to someone with zero mana, but how does it maintain hybrid balance against pure casters? (Hint: it doesn't) <br />
<br />
Pure casters cannot effectively melee when they run out of mana, hybrids can.  There's your balance.   Any type of melee vs. pure caster rebalancing MUST involve changes to melee, otherwise the pure melee classes are screwed even worse than they are now.<br />
<br />
Knight classes have been buffed up, via itemization and skill/ability improvements, to be within a hair's breath of a warrior's capability in pure melee.  To *start* to rebalance this, either they need to be made back into inadequate tanks (via mitigation/hp/dps nerfs) or they need to have their casting ability while tanking seriously toned down.  Both those changes mentioned remove significant capability from hybrids, but leave them viable as tanking classes AND with the utility nature of their spells intact.  Not such a bad deal imho.<br />

<br />
I 100% agree!! I don;t think boosting warriors will break the game it will just mean we have to bring less clerics to the table on raids (which is more of a blessing than anything else).  Some would argue that it would make raiding trivial, but comeon a 0 second CH chain is just stupid.  Boost the warriors so you can move it to a 1 or 2 second chain is hardly breaking the game.  <br />
<br />
Only nerf i would like to see is aggro lock because that really is making the game trivial.  The only thing that brought warriors aggro problems to bear is aggro locking of knights.  I'd like to see everyone stuck in the same boat where the group/raid actually has to work on aggro control rather than chain nuking and watching to see who can crit the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Okay, my 3 real suggestion for eliminating aggro lock were:<br />
<br />
-eliminate channeling: no chain casting during melee, but snap aggro still works.<br />
<br />
-reduce mana regen to make it infeasible to indefinitely chain cast during melee.  Retains snap aggro, and short term aggro lock.<br />
<br />
-make &quot;immune to&quot; spells zero taunt; probably should be done anyway actually, makes no sense the way it is.  Downside is it might impact weapon procs.<br />
<br />
Other ideas on how to eliminate aggro lock that are (relatively) simple to implement, that doesn't break current content, and is relatively consistent with existing game mechanics?  I'm all ears.<br />
<br />
The problem with buffing up warriors significantly would be how much it'd trivialize existing high-end content; current difficult for things like time-level LDON raids and potime endgame mobs seems about right, very challenging.  Thoughts on that?<br />

Do you even understand just how fast a SK depletes their mana bar (and just how amazingly slow bards regen their mana... I can't believe that you do), or how they NEED to be able to be getting hit and casting to help CC for ring events and bad pulls etc.<br />

For the CC thing I think warriors definietly need some tools to help them function there (AE taunt just isnt enough as it stands).</div></div><hr />

Just fyi, I actually do have a very good feeling about the impact of both of those particular changes, as I've played a warrior with zero channeling since, well, eq went live (and I happen to love clicky items), and I currently play a twink bard for fun.  <br />
<br />
Basically, either one of those two changes would force hybrids to play like a warrior *when taking the place of one*- NOT an optimum solution, granted.  But not a totally unreasonable one either, and a lot less painful then re-itemization or tanking nerfs would be for those classes...<br />
 <br />
As always, just my opinions- and I do tend to agree with whoever it was that said that there's no way SOE would make these types of changes, no matter how reasonable/realistic/well considered they are, so don't worry too much about it. ;)  Academic exercise.<br />

     Knights shouldn't have to feel that they are trying to fill a warrior's shoes when they are the tank in a group, cause that's not how it is.  Does that mean when a knight isn't tanking he's taking the place of a DPS class??  Does that mean he needs to be balanced versus those classes as DPS output goes??

     I'm sorry, but you don't seem to understand what you're talking about with the changes you want.  Regardless of what changes do take place, you still need to understand that an SK or a Paladin is NOT A WARRIOR, nor are they warrior wannabes.  It's like comparing a shaman to an enchanter as slowers.  They can both slow, but they do other things as well.  The problem in the comparison of Warriors to SKs/Paladins is that the warrior class inherently has no utility, so if they are not filling the role of MT, then they are just auto attacking.  Have you ever looked into the idea that warriors be given some kind of utility that is on their class and their class only?  I don't think this would be game breaking or raid content destroying.

I am not saying you are rite or wrong here but have you thought this one through with regards to other classes and the implications? <br />

I know my enchanter would love to have negligible aggro on immune charm attempts, mobs  immune to stuns (when ae'ing), and in particular resisted slows .....life would be so much easier if he could chain cast slow till it landed with no risk of gaining aggro.

IMMUNE spells should generate effective +1 Hate, no more no less... BTW if a mob is affected by part of the spell, say the KB part, but not the stun effect, full aggro on that.<br />
<br />
RESISTED SPELLS = 1/3 normal aggro... why? because I know that when a goblin casts a spell on me and I resist it over and over.. doesnt mean that he is the highest target on my list, because hell I know I am resisting his spells, so I can assume I will resist most of them.<br />

CHANNELLING - I dont have much of a problem with for Knights, they are designed to fight in combat.<br />

MANA REGENERATION / ATTACK / REGEN - IS something I believe needs fixxing. Actually i think that the worn FT, Atk, REGEN caps all need to be looked at and balanced. What do I mean by that? Well Its not BALANCED if all classes have the same CAP, the PURE MELEE are at a huge disadvantage here, the pure casters also lose some, while HYBRIDS Make huge gains. I also believe that a 'HYBRID CLASS'  ie. a caster/melee class should NEVER get the same effect out of mana regen spells as a pure caster,  personally I think the mana regen cap for hybrids needs to be hard coded, because the current situation is WAY to easy for a hybrid to regen more mana than they expend in virtually any situation. The tradeoff for casting and melee abilities doesnt exist.</div></div><hr />

What class(es) do you think they might be discussing?... ;)<br />
<br />
Obvious conclusion: if a hybrid tanks like a warrior does, which is *ALL A WARRIOR CAN DO*, then it *IS* taking the place of the warrior.  In that case, there's no need for a hybrid to have any more &quot;upside&quot; benefits in a melee situation, since it is already equivalent to the &quot;baseline&quot; for that function.  To slaughter a metaphor, you can't have your cake (be able to tank well) and eat it too (be essentially a fully functional caster).  Pick one.<br />
<br />
If you REALLY don't like a channeling and/or mana regen nerf, then figure out how to make hybrid knights FUNDAMENTALLY UNABLE to tank adequately when not using their spells.  If a hybrid can tank &quot;as well as&quot; a warrior *without* casting during end-game encounters and regular exp grinds, then they are broke and need fixing.  <br />
<br />
Sorry for the repeated horse beatings, but I still haven't seen any other really feasible, reasonable and sufficient ideas about how to nerf hybrid knights back to parity with the pure melee classes.  Buffing warriors up to their level would just result in 3 broken classes instead of one...<br />

<br />
Have you read the study on melee aggro?  f you have you will notice a miss still increases aggro. Since a melee miss give aggro why shouldn't a resisted spell? Now as for how much aggro is created by a miss or resist should be in sized to fit the attack of the forum of attack that was being thrown. Also lowering spell aggro has the same trivalizing effect as raising raise class taunting ablilites. As far as immune goes, I don't what kind of aggro is gained off an immune melee attack, so I'm not sure what to think there until I know. <br />
<br />
Current gear in gome does have it's problems. I don't know enough about the high end game to comment on that one.<br />
<br />
As for removing channeling, If you take that away from hybirds you do serious damage to the class. You take alot of the option away from the class if they wish to tank. Knight a harder time holding aggro then Warrior due to lower skill cap and will alot of there abilites to migrate damage what so ever from 9 through 65. As well as decent amount of are spells become very limited in usefulness or pointless. This removes the main raid usefulness of an SK as an add tank. Damage to them that far is the same as asking those class be removed from game. <br />
<br />
As for moving us on to bard mana regen. How do deal with existing mana regening self buffs? If you leave Pact of Hate in game then you void the point about us not being able to have mana regen off the chanter line.  Beside that if we had bard mana regen, then spell mana cost need to be scaled taking this into account. What % of bard songs cost mana? Doing that just makes the imbalance worse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Limitation of focus effects to level 3 or below is a bit silly, Landrain. At that rate, we have access to full focus effects... until level 61? When we've actually started to gain real casting abilities? Much of the reason casters don't cry about them is because, unlike AC/HP, focus effects are strongly tied to the spells being cast, in the same way haste is strongly tied to the weapon being used. <br />
<br />
For the easiest example, Improved Damage. Outside of HT, my largest general nuke is Spear of Decay. On average, my ID4 ring adds 60 damage to my 600 point nuke. Meanwhile, Mr. Wizard gets an average bonus of 274 to Strike of Solusek. If we switch over to Mana pres, I save 11 mana on average on that spear. The wizard conserves 32. They're nice added bonuses, yes. Over time, they add up significantly, yes. But because of the percentage nature, focus items are truly unique. They actually scale to the class using them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Sith-  If a mob is immune to an affect (stun, charm, snare, etc.) why should that effect generate any aggro?  I don't think it's a problem for the DD portion of a DD/stun combo to generate normal aggro, but a pure stun vs. a mob that's immune to it shouldn't do much of anything in terms of aggro (perhaps 1 point, just to minimize any potential sploits).  <br />
<br />
Also, removing channeling is SUPPOSED to do &quot;serious damage&quot; to the class- it'd be a big nerf, no questions about it.  And the whole point of limiting mana regen would be to reduce the effective mana pool; there'd be no reason to reduce spell costs, that'd be counter productive.  I only suggested bard-type regen because it was already coded in the game, and didn't &quot;ruin&quot; any equipment already owned (i.e. wouldn't make FT useless).  I'd have to do some analysis to see how much focus effects impact net mana pool to see if they needed modification; my initial instinct is they wouldn't be a huge problem.<br />
<br />
These are all nerfs; have been trying to figure out what type of changes would make the necessary changes w/o totally destroying the classes or requiring huge amounts of recoding or database revision.  I still think these would work out pretty well (big ouch factor for knights, but not as bad as other &quot;effective&quot; changes would be).<br />

Your changes would render my class so stupidly unplayable that I would stop playing.  I've been around for years, and your changes make the worst times my class has been through look like a picnic.  You are very ignorant of shadowknights (I can't and don't care to speak for paladins.)<br />
<br />
We only tank as well as a warrior because we can cast while we tank.  We only do as much DPS as a warrior because we can cast while we tank.  So take the channeling away, and we are very sub-par tanks.  Now we don't mitigate as well, don't do as much DPS, and have no aggro advantages, other than a single snare before a mob arrives at camp.  Woo hoo!<br />
<br />
SKs are not fully functional casters.  Are you aware of the mana efficiency of our spells?  Our best DoT?  Our best nukes?  Our best lifetaps?  They suck.  We do not get spells with caster ratios.  It takes a lot of mana to do significant spell DPS or self-healing.  Naturally, you advocate nerfing my mana regen as well so I can't do either.<br />
<br />
Finally, the other possible use in a group is pulling (although I wouldn't want this to be my only use).  Thankfully you'll take that away as well, since I can't FD while getting hit.<br />
<br />
The choice between a gimped melee or a gimped caster does not equal a good class.  Your ideas have failed the test of reason.  Why do you continue to defend them?<br />
<br />
I agree that knights are very powerful.  I've never been able to do as much as I can now.  Although I've been reluctant to repeat what has been said in many other threads, I'll humor you since you are struggling to find some good ideas.<br />
<br />
1) When a mob is immune to a spell, it generates +1 aggro, nothing more.  Knights currently hold perfect aggro with a trivial amount of mana, by using spells that mobs are immune to.  If I had to work a little harder and spend more mana casting higher-level spells, I could live with it.  In conjunction with this change, I'd like to see SK terror spells tweaked to be more powerful, since they would become our only choice for snare- and fear-immune mobs.  The overall effect would be that knights could still hold aggro well, but it would cost them more mana (leaving less to use for dps/healing.)<br />
<br />
2)  Give warriors an ability that allows them to gain some aggro on demand.  I don't want to get bogged down in the details, there are many good suggestions out there.  The important thing is to add an ability that can be strategically used to generate a small but meaningful amount of aggro on demand.<br />
<br />
3)  Grant warriors an innate bonus to aggro generation.  Warriors should not be forced to rely on weapon procs for aggro.  Knights can choose weapons based on DPS, and augment weapons with dd and lifetap procs and still hold aggro.  Warriors should be able to do the same.  Dual-wielding anger III or EB weapons should not be a requirement for being an effective warrior.<br />
<br />
Currently on a scale of 1-10, I would say knight aggro is a 10 and warrior aggro is a 3.  I would hope the changes above would effectively make knight aggro an 8, and warrior aggro a 6.  I believe this would restore a balance between the classes, so that a 65 warrior and a 65 sk and a 65 pally would perform equally as well as a tank in an xp group situation.  Warriors would get a bigger slice of the raid-tanking pie again, which is fine by me.  That's their job.<br />
<br />
These are simple changes.  They don't trivialize content, and they don't destroy the knight classes.<br />
<br />
Although these changes would make my character less godly, I'm hoping they are implemented.  I have a warrior friend playing a cleric, two playing beastlords, one playing SWG, and another playing FFXI.  I'd like to see them have a reason to play their warriors again, while I still have a reason to log on and see them in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">As I said about mobs immune to spells, that should be balanced in a simular ratio to about of aggro create by an immune melee hit.  Since that goes into numbers I don't know, i'll hold my opinion until thos numbers are known.<br />
<br />
Removing channeling DOES destory the class. Look through spell list and look at how many spells there are, that are intended to be casted whie being beat on.  Now if you don't adjust mana cost of spells and with the huge nerf to amana, these are largely ruined by already existing spells that are designed to for regening mana. I don't know about rangers. But Beastlords, Paladins and Shadow Knight all have mana regen type buffs.<br />
<br />
These changes aren't realalist. <br />
<br />
Know as are for focus effects. The balance of focus effects between hybirds and pure casters is that they are based off level of the spell to the person casting it. Just because is a lower level necro spell doesn't mean we need a focus that would work for the level necros get that spell. We need one that effects the level we get that spells. Also there is a nice discussion on shadowknight.org about how focus gear. Said focus effects aren't always on the items you wan them to be on, same goes for flowing thought. You have to choose if you want the better ac/hp or to strenghten your caster side. SK.org currently giving server to busy message so I can't link the thread. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Hey guys-<br />
<br />
With respect to nerfing channeling:<br />
Answer me one question: can you tank a typical exp grind mob &quot;successfully&quot; (reasonable healing, able to hold aggro via dps/taunt/&quot;incoming&quot; aggro, weapon procs), without casting during the fight?  If so, congrats- you have as much functionality as a warrior does.  Anything beyond that point is (apparently rather tasty) gravy.  <br />
<br />
If you happen to do slightly less/take slightly more dps while tanking because you can't cast while getting hit, it's more than compensated by the ability to generate a nice chunk of incoming aggro, and the ability to &quot;snap aggro&quot; mobs back if they get pingponged, let alone the other utility your spellbooks provide.  You also DO lose the ability to permalock aggro, a Good Thing for the game imho.  Tank or cast, pick *one*.  You might also note that if you AREN'T getting hit, your spell casting ability wouldn't be impacted at all.<br />
<br />
With regards to reducing mana regen:<br />
All the sks and pallys I have asked (elemental level toons) run at 80-100% mana while MTing hard LDON missions.  That means they are able to aggro lock + patch heal/debuff/etc. while tanking for about an hour WITHOUT ANY MED BREAKS, due to regular mana regen + FT + mindbuffs + focus items, without even having bard songs.  Basically same issue as above- tank or cast, pick one- if you want to cast, then you should have to do it selectively OR take the downtime needed to med up.  Effectively infinite mana pools (due to cheap spells + full caster level mana regen capability), plus the constant baseline ability to do non-trivial dps via melee, is broken.<br />
<br />
Warriors are able to do everything we *need* to be able to do already; to me that says they don't need to be changed much.  Perhaps reduce some annoyance issues, or add some &quot;fun factor&quot;, but not more capability, unless they plan on re-tuning an awful lot of encounters...<br />

Warriors always love to talk about the &quot;utility&quot; that knights get well guess what, FD is one of the most important, if not THE most important, utility that SKs get.<br />

It would be more challenging to FD pull stuff- you'll need to FULLY stop and cast before the mob gets to ya.  IIRC tho, FDs a pretty fast casting spell, you'd still have a chance of getting it cast while getting attacked.  <br />
<br />
And, tho it's a side issue, that particular change would make monks a bit better at FD pulling/splitting (tho bards will still rule all at it, just can't beat lull/fade/highsun/root/snare/mez/invis/bardspeed movement all in one package!), and give both monks and rogues a bit of a lead in over-aggro control over SKs (i.e. no more feign blurring after chain casting spears, etc.).<br />
<br />
BTW, your need to med will totally go away once you get a bit more FT, a few more focus items, and some better mana taps methinks (this assumes your magelo is up to date).<br />

Um, as a paladin, I don't chain stuns unless I want/am prepared to have aggro if I'm not the MT.  I can't imagine an SK chain casting spears if he wasn't the MT for the same reason.<br />
<br />
If you take away my channeling, I can't fire off a HWoP to save the group/raid if I'm getting beat on.  Standing out of combat waiting for a need to fire off an arguably-inefficient group heal is a waste of the tanking ablities I've built over the past 63 levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Remf hate to break it to you, but most SK have to stop wait half a second for the game to realize they stopped then cast FD. Also run3 makings moving while casting harder since the of the casting being broken is your locchecked at start of casting and again at end. Corner a cleric sometime, start casting CH around for acouple seconds and get back in the corner before casting is finished and you will notice that the always goes off. Even with capped channel(no channeling AA's yet), I often find it hard to get FD off with multiple NPC beating on me. Remember FD was designed as a get out of jail card not a pulling tool. The imblance will be noticeablely lower in the saving the SK, yet while decreasing the usefull niceness of it in pulling, it would still be largely useful and in many we would still have advantage over monks due to one of the targets being snared(ideally). <br />
<br />
When refering chain casting spears, you are taking into account the 45 second recast time? and the noticeable drop from one to the next. <br />
<br />
Noctix - you may want look at what your using with mana to see which unneed to so you retain higher mana count during the adventure. MC normally provides more then enough mana regen to keep the mana at decent level if you aren't wasting mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Karreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Nerfing channeling just so warriors can be the one and only tank class is not, and I will repeat, IS NOT the way to do it.  What it does do is gimp Knights to such a degree that they simply are not playable. There are far better ways to balance the tank classes than to simply wave the nerf bat around.  There are far far FAR better ways.<br />
<br />
Examples<br />
<br />
Upgrade Warrior DPS<br />
Upgrade Warrior Damage Migration<br />
Upgrade Warrior Disc (ie longer duration and/or lower reuse time)<br />
Give Warriors a Hate Bonus on melee hits (greater than other classes)<br />
Give Warriors special attacks that upgrade from Kick (think monk special attacks, but without the Ogre in plate doing a flying kick)<br />
Revamp Warrior Taunt<br />
<br />
These ideas give warriors more, without taking away anything from the Knights, except MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I say let the knights stay where they are now, just make us a little better since we are their parent class and that is how it suppose to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Nah, SoE should examine paladin accounts on an individual basis.<br />
<br />
The paladins who crusaded for cleric nerfs in 2002 are obviously okay with classes being nerfed, so they should have their hp and ac halved, all stuns written into their spellbooks should automatically and immediately be replaced with True North, and all of their armour should be permanently and unalterably dyed flaming pink.<br />
<br />
The rest of them should be allowed to continue as is, with warriors just a little ahead in damage output and damage mitigation and slightly behind in taunt.</div></div><hr />
