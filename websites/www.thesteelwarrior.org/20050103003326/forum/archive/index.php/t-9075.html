<br />
What are you guys using it for?  The only thing I could remotely see using it for would be to add 2 extra generic tribute effects, but even that would only be working for roughly half of the people at any given time anyway (due to melee and casters needing different effects), so really..what gives?  Another useless bullshit gimmick like (cough) warrior discs and new titles?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abazagaroth</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its *extremely* expensive. At the moment we just have the hp one running on raids. Honestly, I think it would be best to just have the MAs and MT opt in and just run hp/ac ones. Hell, just the hp one is 21 per 10 minutes per player, so a 72 person PoP raid would be 8892 tribute per hour. Honestly, its like regular tribute and leader stuff. Nice to have, but not earth shattering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't looked over the list of effects yet, does guild tribute also have the flowing thought effect?<br />
<br />
If so, I can see that being pretty useful to activate just before a large enounter is engaged.  Maybe not for the end game guilds where almost everyone is already maxed at FT15 (or the new cap that OoW gives us), but for the smaller guilds it could be a huge mana longevity boost.  Have the entire healing chain and DPS casters all opt in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, then next question, which I guess I assumed the answer to.<br />
<br />
Does guild tribute stack with regular tribute?  I assumed no, but if you can stack the 150/150hp, and FT5/FT5 and likewise, that would make it marginally useful for non raiders who aren't even close to caps on that kinda stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you can stack tributes. With new 9 (steeloak skin) and guild trib, i broke 10khp last night for the first time ever, 10,088hp wuwu. Yeah the expense does add up per person, but there are plenty of items out there that are great for trib. Just get everyone to dump in 5-10k or more points and voila, 100+ hours of guild trib for a full raid. And actually, turning it on for a full hour isn't very realistic unless you're doing something like potime. Clearing 30 minutes of mobs, and then spending 10 minutes on the named/target means you should only have guild trib on for 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought you had to be standing right at the tribute master to turn on your benefits. Has that changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimic</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Follow up stupid question --<br />

<br />
Benefits can now be enabled and disabled anywhere.  Changing benefits still requires being in front of tribute master.  Only Guild officers/leaders can turn Guild tribute on and off. To enable guild tribute you must first &quot;opt in&quot; and this can only be done at tribute master.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info, Nimic.<br />
<br />
That would make it a hell of a lot more useful, then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has made it very useful.   I have only my tributes on when i go up against the big mobs.  atk/hp/mr(cod/bert/mm)/fr(for RZ)<br />
<br />
Same for the guild, only use it during the bigs mobs.   We only have the hp/end and the mana regen tributes going though when we do activate them.  Bert event drops alot of good tribute items too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking at some of the guild tribute (can't find an actual list anywhere of some of the effects, I was looking at my former guild leader's computer), and I've never seen some of those effects.  They added some combo effects.<br />
<br />
There's one that's FT5, Regen10, plus String mod<br />
There's another that's 50atk(?), brass mod, and Improved Damage<br />
There's another that's Haste 46%, drum mod, Spell Haste<br />
Another that's Mana Preservation, Improved Healing...<br />
<br />
Stuff like that.  Some really interesting combo effects, there's about 5 that gets you nearly every effect in there.  Didn't know the cost was per person, though.  Although I also forgot you can turn it on and off whereever you are (but you have to set it all up at the tribute master, right?).  That means for a more family guild, they can clear to a boss mob, but then when the major fights start up they can switch on all this tribute for extra power for those who need it.<br />
<br />
And of course, the best thing in the world...switching on Faerune so no one friggin dies from drowning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there appears to be a 2 tribute limit on guild stuff.<br />
<br />
That kinda limits the usage of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boub</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">500k max atm a tad low imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah two effects max atm.We actually had an officer port out and swap the hp to resists just before quarm last week hehe.They do stack and it does seem to benefit less geared folks more.Expensive though.Gawd,I forgot to turn both tributes back on before we engaged one of the Zeks.I'm button challenged though. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For now we have decided to only let the warriors opt in(and non-warriors if they donate themselves), or it gets too expensive.<br />
<br />
I also sometimes activate it if we are doing hard nameds during non-raid times(the benefit of having officer tag) :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not bought the expanshion and proablly won't for a while longer but one question...<br />
<br />
**To opt-in.. do you just have to give items to the tribute master??<br />
**What if your Opt-in but do not want it for some reason.. (IE they set it up for mana and resistes and well you have 400+ resist and your a warrior you do not need mana.)<br />
**Can someone that has never turned anything in get the effects??<br />
**When are the effects in use?? only during raids or any time. Can they be used across zones so say if you have 2 raids going at one time and both of you want to use the effects can you?? If your groupping and an officer is raiding in another zone or same zone and your not in the raid.. do you get the effects. This could happen in PoN with a raid doing teh hedge and your out exping here...<br />
<br />
sorry if these are answered in game or something but like i said i probally won't get the expanshion for a while as i have only used one GoD zone and am not elemental or time flagged..</div></div><hr />

Can you donate no drop stuff for tribute? I can't remember to save my life. My gut is no. If it was possible a lot of the rot stuff on raids could probably fuel a guild pretty well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guild tribute is way too expensive to turn on for the whole guild on a major raid.  About all it's good for is adding some hps to your main tank or something, or turning on for 10 minutes during an AE fight, but you don't even want to think about letting the whole raid turn it on and leave it on all night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the big question is: can you use it to pad your Magelo?</div></div><hr />
