<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tauk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started this ogre warrior a long ,long time ago, stopped him and picked up something else. At creation time I put 10 into str and 15 into sta so i think that gives me 150 str and 147 sta. Going to start playing him again at least till i level him to 60. My question is, should i reroll him and put all his inital points into sta, will that extra 10 make a big diff at 60 or 65th level. It would take me less then a week to re-level him to 47 so that is not a issue but all his weapon skills are now  maxed and if I PLed him that fast I doubt I would get to max all skills again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Atilette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldn't reroll him, you'll be maxed with buffs and armor by the time you'll hit 60 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, don't re-roll...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did much worse than you on starting stats.  It's really not worth it to reroll, seriously.  Would it give you a bit more hps until you cap it, yes.  Would it give many, no.  It would be around 70ish with ND3 and PE at 65 I think.  And at that point, you will probably be capping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only real downside to ogres is the time it takes for skill ups due to low int etc, as a warrior he'll be fine without any need to reroll. <br />

Much more hassle for a race with higher 'skill up' stats to build up  their stamina and strength to viable levels with gear imho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At least you put points into sta, more than what a lot of people did in those days. I certainly wouldnt think it was anything sufficently prejudicial to make you reroll. Heck with all the equipment out there these days, even if you dumped it all into agi and charisma you probably could get by. Remember that a lot of other races eve after putting points into str and sta are much worse off than you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're anal enough to contemplate throwing away 47 levels for that small amount of min/maxing, then yes you should reroll.</div></div><hr />

Hrrmmm....INT doesn't have ANYTHING to do with melee skill ups.&gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
The only real downsides to ogres are size (which is very managable now with all of the shrink options) and the EXP penalty...which sucks, IMHO, but is still worthwhile when compared to the ogre racial ability of being unstunnable from the front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Umm, you cant go over 150 in any stat at character creation, the game won't let you. 150str 147 is about as good as it gets, only problem might be your low dex/agi, but they aren't as imortant as stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yup, Nek is correct, you can't put all your points into STA at char creation for an ogre. You are only missing 3 STA points, not 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tauk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the info, if it boils down to 3 or so stam less the 50 hps  then I would certainly  will not spend the time maxing my skills again.  Once again thanks for the info, was not trying to be anal about anything but the 1st 40 levels are really pretty easy to get under your belt , for me 50 to 60 took so so much longer , I didnt want to level if in the end with proper AA I would have shorted myself hundereds of hp's . I pretty much play in a very small guild and will never have the TOP end gear, so stats are important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gartogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If your agnostic Reroll<br />

Having no cultural sucks big time, not to mention you can't wear those 80hp greaves and have to work way harder for gear that is only slightly worse than FH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agnostic is not bad...you can hold out with Champions or some similar armor for a while, then you'll eventually start getting HoT or better armor. The cultural armor is for people who want to twink out their warrior at 45. Sure, there is a few cultural pieces that are good compared to velious armors, but 40 less hp won't kill you. And of course, at some point you might start getting even better armor and the fact that you can't wear cultural won't bother you at all. Unless of course, you love RZ so much you can't live without worshipping him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Only Ornate (and only for some pieces) or better (PoP) and high end Luclin (Ssra+ level) armor beats FH armor.  Consider FH is buyable (and not even that expensive), that's saying a lot.  The gear advantage of FH is huge as long as you can afford it.  Is it possible to play without FH?  Yes, but having FH makes everything much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yeah, thats probably the only reason i would even consider rerolloing. plus the fact that you can avoid having to go on all those endless Kael/ Hot raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play an ogre and put my points into dex and agi, hasn't affected me too greatly so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you cant go over 150 in any stat at your creation...I think.<br />
<br />
im lvl 65 and did 120str 120stm 110agl. at lvl 65 i now have like 305str(430) 305stm(411) 285agl 282dex. unbuffed.<br />
<br />
later on str and stm are easy to get. with 120stm at lvl 60 i could get maxed stm with a buff easy. <br />
<br />
dont worry about it to much your str and stm are gtg. if I made a oger war I would probaly put everything into agl but thats just me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">INT does play a roll on how fast you learn some melee skills, just cast kei and add some int  gear to a gimp and see how much faster your defense skills go up.  A casters defense skills go up a lot faster then a melee and it is because of the higher int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My starting stats are 100 str/90 sta and i still max both out at level 65 raid buffed, and I don't have the best gear by any means.<br />
<br />
Don't throw away a near 50th level character for perceived bad starting stats.</div></div><hr />
