<br />
once upon a time yours truly was secondary tank in ldon. other tank was picked as main because she had better defense and better agro weapons. in one pull we our enchanter mez a few mobs and then slow them. then after that i cast an incite on one  of the mobs and went back to supporting the main tank on the active  mob. the main tank threw a fit and said to me &quot;why the hell did you incite the mezzed mob??&quot; are YOU mt?&quot;<br />
<br />
i incited it to draw agro off the enchanter of course. isnt that a secondary's priveledge? i was only healed something like twice in 80 MINUTES. thats because she held agro so well and i had regrowth on me all the time too. what is she afraid of me getting hit? SOMETIMES its appropriate for an offtank to grab a little agro to take pressure off a caster especially when there are several mezzed mobs that potentially  COULD break mez all at the same time. not only did i only get healed twice in the whole mission (both unasked for and both unneeded) but i had to taunt a LOT to take enough damage for even the regrowth spell to accomadate. the 20000 odd damage i took on the mission required nothing of the healers and saved the MT about four complete heals enabling the cleric about six extra nukes.<br />
<br />
ok .. more good ways to be secondary tank....<br />
<br />
taunt off caster until mob rooted and clearly agrod by said offtank. then back away from mob and assist MT again.<br />
<br />
save offtanking pets in danger of dying by assisting them.<br />
<br />
grab wandering add by being first to gain agro and then assisting main tank after mob mezzed.<br />
<br />
/shielding casters or even in some circumstances the MT.<br />
<br />
<br />
ways NOT to offtank...<br />
<br />
beating a mob for 3 minutes that is already root parked when you could be helping mt.<br />
<br />
beating ANY rooted mob when doing so would require you to be healed when there is only one healer in the group who is desparately trying to keep others alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
ways to mt ...<br />
<br />
keep your mob agrod.<br />
<br />
<br />
ways NOT to mt ....<br />
<br />
by getting on a trip that says &quot;if anyone ever gets hit besides me he is a newbie who knows nothing of the game. all damage is MINE MINE MINE!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
incidentally this warrior who was on the agro trip was one of the slowest pullers ive seen in a while. manna overflowed while people waited for her to pull.<br />
<br />
in contrast i grouped with a well equipped bard who could tank as effectively as me. he pulled he tanked. he transfered tankship to me to pull another which he tanked while i tanked the previous mob. more tank healing needed? yes. but with our enormous manna reserve it was THE way to give enough outlets to the casters to actually use all that manna. it was the PROPER way to MT in this particular circumstance. and when we were done he apologized to me for tanking and i said &quot;why?&quot; and he said because &quot;i wasnt mt you were&quot;. and i said &quot;we both were because we had too much manna for just one mob and one mt at a time&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Personally, if I am SA, I will taunt mez'd mobs until successful, then incite.  When I SA, I am constantly watching around the group more than normal, and spend more time near mez'd mobs when there are a lot, than I do on the main mob (success taunt / incite, next mob do same, etc).  In that regard, SA is sometimes more fun to be, simply because you are doing more.  On the other hand, I've found multitanking while MA to be quite fun these days =p.  Do it often in Yxtta heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: why not? MT will still pick agro on engage but if MOB clears mez early it comes after you rather than Ench.  Sounds like an idiot/ego driven MT. He does know incite doesn't break mez right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see the point to ever incite a mezzed mob unless you're going to tank it.<br />
<br />
Incite is nowhere close enough to get mez aggro by itself unless there was a successful blur, and even if for some reason no one ever mezzed the mob again and just let it break, you can be sure the mob won't be on the Enchanter (unless he's sitting next to the mob when it broke).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phant...all I can say is you play a different game. And you are wrong.<br />

<br />
Yes but it WILL be on someone...or do your mobs just wander at random after Mez breaks?  An incite *can* steer it to you (esp if you add a taunt on it both things taking under 1 sec for a skilled off tank).  Again, as I posted in another thread, you have no idea how much risk a moderately equipped char has in hard ldon/God.  Anything you can do to mitigate risk is helpful.  This works, I've seen it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the mob is mezzed, incite is tacking on more aggro while you are doing something else.  When breaking a mez, you should taunt the mezzed mob first, then incite again to get another boost on aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lens yes mechanically that is how it works.  <br />
<br />
The point is while you are second tank...and you have END why not drop an incite on a mezzed mob as an insurance factor?  There is NO downside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you taunt successfully then the Incite is wasted.<br />
<br />
If your taunt failed you're still behind the Enchanter on aggro and Incite is still wasted.<br />
<br />
The only case inciting a mezzed mob that you don't plan to tank can have any effect at all is if both the mem blur worked, and no one mezzed it again.  But you should really be asking why no one mezzed it again in the first place.<br />
<br />
I suppose you could taunt and then incite a mezzed mob, and then if someone was dumb enough to break mez before the MT gets there, it will be on you.  But again you have to ask why did someone break mez before the MT get there in the first place.<br />
<br />
If you want to help out controlling aggro on a mezzed mob, you taunt when the mez is broken, not before, unless you've reasons to believe someone will be dumb enough to break it prematurely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. incite is hate over time? right?<br />
2. incite doesnt break agro<br />
3. as a second tank you have surplus END<br />
4. If mez does wear off (different than break) then where you stand on the hate list matters?  right?<br />
<br />
You incite to get a head start on manageability (your job as second tank).  There is NO DOWNSIDE to doing this.<br />
<br />
Listen...I'm not going to change your mind on this or the ToD thing unless you TRY it.  But I'm not going to let you tell me I'm wrong about things that you clearly haven't tried and that are successful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phantron, seriously.  If you read what I said, I did say taunt then incite.  And you know, enchanters can have those odd things called &quot;resists&quot;.  Taunt after first mez, plus incite, mob usually goes after me if there is 1 resist, giving time for chanter to lock it down again.  Two resists and it will be back to him, however it's easy to get back with melee, or it gets locked down soon.  Also, it works great to overcome tash / slow aggro.  Combine taunting off of the slower and / or mez'er with incite, you now have a large boost over dps classes and slower.  That way if you fail taunt before breaking, or if it resists the first remez, or if it somehow breaks before it can be remez'd, it goes after you instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keeping a mob that an enchanter is trying to mez off an enchanter is the domain of Knights.  It'd be nice if Knights stop crying how they suck and actually do what they excel at (damageless aggro).  Incite alone can't even move a mob (though Bellow of the Mastruq + Raex BP seems to be able to).  Now if you don't have a Knight, then yes taunt &amp; incite is the best you can do, but it really won't do that much.  I've never had an Incite pull off aggro from a mez alone so you're basically relying on Taunt working, which is fine, but really someone else should be handling that kind of situation, not a Warrior.<br />
<br />
As for anyone after the Enchanter's aggro, it's not really my problem to deal with that.  DPS people are not important anyway.  Sometimes I wish they'd actually overaggro and die to save some more valuable members from dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">first off there were no knights in my groups so that argument doesnt apply. secondly a secondary tank often has endurance coming out his ears and it doesnt hurt to use it. thirdly the case in point there were three mezzed mobs and it was entirely likely mez would break on at least one before it was engaged. fourthly a secondary tank never &quot;plans&quot; to tank anything yet he finds himself tanking often in situations where there are many mezzed adds. fifthly when there are so many mezzed adds there is often a chance for a second or third incite to lock agro off all the casters. sixthly the main tank might not feel like taunting four times if his first three are resisted and if he breaks mez without it taunted particularly if it were remezzed he probably wont get initial agro. seventhly about who broke mez when he wasnt supposed to isnt my problem. my problem is to get agro rather than the caster when it does happen. finally anyone who thinks that a competent mt never fails to gain agro immediately and permanantly on any broken mez hasnt been reading all the complaints on these boards about the difficulty in holding agro.<br />
<br />
what it comes down to is inciting hurt nothing but the mt's ego. and that is not a good enough reason not to do it.<br />
<br />
ive seen parallels. for example ive seen clerics who hated druids who healed because they were jealous to do all the healing themselves. ive seen enchanters jealous over anyone who roots because they consider all crowd control to be their personal and priveledged domain. and what about mt warriors who rage when a bard pulls with slow song because the bard is gaining initial agro which &quot;belongs to the warrior&quot; ? then you have the nuker class who lands one more nuke knowing full well that it will draw him agro (from a slowed mob) and does it anyway because he's tired of being fom? and then the tank gets mad? people get very jealous over their roles and i believe this was the case i spoke of in the opening post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My two cents:<br />
I think of tanking along two lines. First, it's a verb: the MT/MA tanks the mob, which means select the mob, aggro the mob, position the mob, control the mob, make it possible for everyone else in the group to max the damage they can do to that mob.<br />
Second, tanking is a noun: it's a function, and a group function at that. Mostly, MT is the active part of that function, but other melees sometimes have to actively control their aggro generation, shamans have to time their slows, wizards their nukes, etc. <br />
A necessary component of this function is that the casters not get hit and go splat. None of the other components of tanking can happen efficiently if casters die. <br />
The original post here concerned a specific situation: a group with an enchanter, two warriors, and multiple adds. MT has aggro on active mob, enchanter has mezzed stacked mobs, SA has END and incite and taunt up.<br />
If I'm MA here, damn straight I want SA to taunt the first mezzed mob. If taunt works, go ahead and incite. I don't know that incite by itself after a failed taunt is going to help you enough to jump you over the enchanter on the hate list; I'd be inclined myself to save incite until after a successful taunt.<br />
Phantron is correct to point out that if all goes well, the SA will be dumping his taunt and incite down an empty rat hole. But, if all goes well, the costs of that appear negligable to me.<br />
Of course, things don't always go well. Ideally, all mobs wait patiently for the MA to get to them in a proper order. But if they don't, the next best thing is if those &quot;free&quot; mobs hit the SA--far better that than anything else they might think of doing, such as splatting the enchanter. I'm assuming here that in fact the SA can stand getting hit by these mobs for a bit if mez breaks/wears off--at least until mob is re-mezzed or MA finishes his mob and comes over and picks up the &quot;free&quot; mob.<br />
The only potential costs I can think of are that the time the SA takes to taunt/incite/run and then run back over to help MT will probably cost a round or two of combat damage from the SA; also, between the time SA taunts mezzed mob and the SA's taunt refreshes, theoretically neither of the tanks would be able to taunt an unexpected add off anybody. But I would think that in an LDoN these costs are a small premium for the insurance against (even the unlikely) chance that the enchanter will get hit.<br />
Anyway, the SA here wouldn't offend me as MT if he taunted the odd mezzed mob while I was busy. Now, if he keeps taunting the mob I'm tanking, or he runs into the next room and pulls some more mobs, or loots dead mobs in the middle of the fight, or just stands there motionless in the same place he's been for the last five minutes, or tells the enchanter or healer how to do their jobs in /g without having ever played a caster, or tells other group members that their gear sucks....well, you know there are a lot of ways an SA can bug me more than taunting a mezzed mob.</div></div><hr />

Be careful with this.<br />
<br />
Sharing aggro in an exp/LDON group is one thing. Ganking aggro in a raid situation is quite another. Both situations can apply to your little quote. I actively and passionately encourage clerics to let aggro gankers die on raids: in many cases that will teach them the lesson like no amount of /rs or /gu ranting will. <br />
<br />
As for the &quot;incite a mezzed LDON mob&quot; I agree with Phantron in that it seems redundant but wth... relax and have fun. Learn tricks from more experienced tanks, teach some to less experienced.</div></div><hr />

could have sworn i had made it clear i was talking about an ldon group.<br />

but do you really tell your clerics to let offtanks die when they incite a mezzed add while the mt is on the boss mob?</div></div><hr />

After all it is normaly a job I get in  raids and even xp groups sometimes.  Agro is always a fun one and is the real part of being an OT.<br />
<br />
-You should have just enough Agro to keep it but not so much it take to much effert for the MA to get it back.  But at the same point if you can OT the damn thing you can MA.  So just keep agro and Kill it.<br />
<br />
-If there is an Enchater in the group don't worry about OT.  That is what they are there for.  If you can do something else go for if not just beat on the mob.  Kind of makes a 2nd tank in a group pointless though.  Sucks don't it.<br />
<br />
-Now for mezzed mobs let the MA do all the Taunting and getting agro.  Just easier that way.   Now if you are in a group that the Chanter can't keep stuff mezzed and the MA can't get agro I think you might have bigger problems.<br />

-More fun with OT is if everyone is ok go pull something.  And if you are the MA and the OT is good go pull something.  :p   Really makes things interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dont see why not. the description of incite is &quot;it adds x amount of hate&quot;. this is different from taunt which adds a highly varying amount of hate which depends on how much hate you already have and how much others have. seeing the amount is advertised as constant for incite i would say yes.<br />
<br />
inciting of mezzed adds unmezzed adds wanderers boss mobs other mobs and group members is highly dependent on the situation at hand. in some groups there is so much manna going around you pretty much have to tank two mobs at once even to keep up with available manna. especially if the mt cant keep enough hate on the mob for the nukers to keep out of fom zone with his one mob. what about those groups weve all been in where killing isnt the hard part but getting enough mobs in the first place? say when competing with a nearby group for spawns? in short &quot;it all depends&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think inciting a mob is wrong, but there doesn't seem to be tangible benefits, and it is possible you confuse others while doing it (obviously the person MTing had problems with it, even though he shouldn't because you inciting the mob is really like doing nothing at all).  Some healers get confused rather easily as well and doing anything extra increases your chance of confusing them as well.</div></div><hr />

If I'm in a two tank group, I'm more often the ST than the MT.  Especially if it's LDoN and the other tank is a paladin or shadow knight.  I like how well their snap aggro gets me mah points that much faster.  And as far as that goes ... it's quicker for a knight to pull aggro off me than vice versa.  ST/OT is a lot of fun, even if all I do is protect the healer while the chanter locks down the loose MOBs.<br />
<br />
Of course I taunt/incite mezzes ... there is no-one in my group who would prefer that the enchanter gets hit when the mez wears or breaks to me getting hit.  It happens often enough that there are timing issues with re-mezzes (or a decision not to re-mez), or the chanter just runs out of mana ... none of the people I group with regularly think it's wasted.  Taunt is free, and if I'm not MT, then I've got END coming out of my ... end.  Enchanters who don't get hit are really cheerful about that.  So is the healer, who doesn't need to panic while the robe is dropping like a weighted stone - there's prolly plenty of time to wait for the aggro switch before they even need to heal me.  And finally, If the MT is also a warrior and I have taunted and Incited over the mez aggro, and they taunt and Incite over me ... that is one delicious double decker sammich of aggro - with extra mayo.  Not much payoff when things go smoothly, but it's luverly when there's a glitch.  And, it's essentially a *free* trick.  S'all good.<br />
<br />
In a p/u group, you never know who's gonna over-react or why.  And as far as it goes, I've chased aggro around the room enough times to know what a pain in the ass it is, and have felt my temperature go up when it appears that that *may* happen - which may have been the case for rysingsun's original example.   I've also seen the MT just lay into a mezzed MOB without any kind of *wake* strategy, in which case I pre-aggro each one I can.  I've been in more than one group where I thought *person X* was gonna skewer us all, only to realize later that I had misunderstood their style, or even their language.<br />
<br />
The ST is the second line of defence, and IMO a good one will be preparing to step up to the front, or at least prevent breakthrough to the back row, most of the time.</div></div><hr />
