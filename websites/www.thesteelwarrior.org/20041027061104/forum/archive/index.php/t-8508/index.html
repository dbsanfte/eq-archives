<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">and the first mob we try is Ukun Bloodfeaster. HAHAHAHA what a surprise! Named, pets and about a million stonemites, killed me through furious. What a nice wakeup call.<br />
<br />
I have to imagine that this mob is rarely done.<br />
<br />
At least this appears to be another fun zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stonemite event isn't that hard, just need to have Enchanters log on.<br />
<br />
I heard there's a way to deal with adds that doesn't involve mezzing but never figured out how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thats probably like the 3rd easiest mob in the zone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't mind having the 23/19 dagger, but convincing the guild to go back and do that event isn't going to be easy. Perhaps someone can tip me off as to why it's so &quot;easy,&quot; we've had a much easier time with the rest of the zone than we have with this bastard. Why's this in the Outhose btw? =p<br />
<br />
P.S.  i wouldn't call txevu &quot;fun&quot; ... unless you're one of those weirdos who enjoyed VT for something other than the quantity of drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you look at the Ukun encounter, the mobs actually puts out very low DPS (provided you can control the stonemites), and the named has very low HPs (4-5 minutes fight).  <br />
<br />
Besides the freebie Anueks, everything else in Txevu either does more damage or has more HPs, usually both.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed VT =x</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lies, there is super duper 120 mana augs off the 1st mob...</div></div><hr />

Hmm well with the small loottable this event seems to have, its a nice to gank it once in a while imo, at least if you have decent attendance(comfortable kill with 54-60, and I hear some guilds kill with 48 or less). <br />
<br />
We have gotten 3 of those daggers so far, in like 5 or 6 kills. As an added bonus, we could recycle tactics originally developed for this event, to one of the mobs in Tacvi, so time spent learning bloodfeaster event can definately pay off.</div></div><hr />
