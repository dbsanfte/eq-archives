<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a little pissed about the last patch leaving out key information.<br />
<br />
1) RZ script has been changed, now TZ and VZ come togeather!<br />
2) all monsters can now go thru teleport pads as long as they come out in the same zone (such as BoT named monsters, which are now kicking the crap out of CY groups constantly)<br />
<br />
Come on sony, this is IMPORTANT information and you leave it out?<br />
<br />
.i..  :mad:  ..i.</div></div><hr />

Our Agnarr raid found that out the hard way last weekend when someone trained Oreen and another wing named onto us........ took us a while to get all situated again all because nobody knew better.   :confused:</div></div><hr />

Found this out in Howling Stones the other day.  I ( warrior ) fell down a pit trap.  decided to just train to the teleporter up and hit the ZI.  Fiugured they dont follow.  camp , clear agro and run back to the rest of me (Druid,cleric,chanter).<br />
<br />
Well it didnt happen.   My little train of 30ish mobs popped up right behind me at the ZI.   Instead of training back to my group I just take the easy way and let em beat me down and sucked up a rez after the druid succored back.<br />
<br />
Adds a whole new level to a few old zones now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">maybe mobs are smart enougth to use teleporters now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">wait until the mobs buy the PoP expansion and start using the teleport stones....CT to PoK !! RUN MOTHERFVCKAZZZ!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">for that they need first to know that their zone are open and that they can travel from one to another instead to stop running sudently.<br />
well at least Kerafyn was able to port itself from zones to zones ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">..and a valid credit card..or a game_card.</div></div><hr />

Bro...Im busted out laughing so fucking hard, my boss (E-9) came into my office to find out  &quot;What the fuck is going on in here?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
I had to tell him a &quot;friend&quot; sent me a funny ass email.<br />
<br />
Caught me completely flatfooted.  Nice one.<br />
<br />
/salute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did some research.... they claim it was not a bug but I beleave there was a change in AI that caused this on accident and they are proud of it, reason I think this is a bug is because<br />
<br />
1) if you go to naggy or vox for the hell of it (like I do) and get punted out, naggy/vox will port to the zone out.... doing this means you can port vox or naggy to the zoneline to a waiting raid, ready to exploit and kill em... this also means vox can not hit her CH walls<br />
<br />
2) mobs in other zones with &quot;prisions&quot; can follow you to prison (trakanon can port into the trap he punts others into)<br />
<br />
Fairly funny bug....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh yea all 4 tower bosses at zone in would be freakin great. If anyone manages this PLZ get a ss of it. Can you imagine some poor sucker zoning in lfg hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I actually like this. When I am in BoT  normally go to the DS camp, and as most people know that camp gets a fair amount of unwanted visitors from people training it going to the teleport pads. Now instead of them staying with me, they will be going with their original targets, sound good to me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If they pass you, you get agro as well (and they come back to their spawns following the paths they took to get there)<br />
<br />
Chances are it will kill you on the backlash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yeah we learned this the hard way when trying to get some people up to xegony's island to corpse summon up the raid. <br />
<br />
cleric and necro click up to find that the bee is no longer tethered and every spider on spider island now has a xegony key!</div></div><hr />

1) coollll<br />
<br />
2) hahaha, funny as hell. <br />
<br />
this make me wonder if using CoH to summon the player would bring the Boss few second after. because if so you could ping pong the eavy AE hitter : you put a cleric and a mage in a safe zone and then when it's time for the AE, you summon the MT, the boss follows and land his AE, then you call back to the raid the MT and the boss follows again. this would (if the MT keep aggro during the CoH) let the raid be AE proof :)<br />
or if it's possible to make the boss get out of his lair so that the spawning adds won't aggro.</div></div><hr />

Ok, this totally owns.<br />
<br />
Friggin spiders were the hardest part of that zone anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>milloeq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For one thing, CoH wipes agro so nothing would follow you.  For a 2nd, the mobs that banish arent using a teleporter, they're using an ability, so Vox/Naggy wouldnt follow you either.  There's no teleporter that the dragons make you step on, they just say BEGONE! and you be gone...<br />
<br />
This is a nice new wrinkle, but doesnt have unlimited applications.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Vox/Naggy banish out out of the entire zone afaik. I KNOW Vox does, I tried to bum rush her 2 days ago!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am saying that for some reason, regardless of their abilities they can port around to follow players, I beleave the reason they end up at the zone lines is because to remove you from a zone they basically send you to the zone in, but drop you on the line that causes you to zone.... that'd explain why vox was waiting for me when I came back in!!<br />
<br />
By &quot;every spider on spider island now has a xegony key!&quot; did you mean they will follow you thru pads or did you mean every last one has a key that is lootable?</div></div><hr />
