<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semien</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shroud of Eternity stacks with everything.. also note that spells in same line as Dain Ring wont stack with CoR.. AC &gt; DS thats just my opinion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moved Shroud of Eternity to the worn list, thanks for catching that.<br />
<br />
One note about the coldain ring / cloak of retribution line of spells is that it won't stack with the ranger call of rathe line of spells, so it depends if you want the extra 10 DS over call of the rathe or the 34 ac.<br />
also note that spells in same line as Dain Ring wont stack with CoR.. AC &gt; DS thats just my opinion <br />
<br />
<br />
That info was already in there, just have to read those little titles above each set.<br />
Self only Clickable DS Line - Does not stack with CoRathe or DS potions (Note: clickies in this set tend to have stacking issues with much more than just CoR/DSPotions but only listing the DS spells they have stacking issues with)<br />
<br />
Mokor, I didn't add charged items that can't be recharged, same with potions.  Wanted items that stood alone, or didn't require another class to make or visits to the bazaar, otherwise the list would get too long.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please keep the comments coming, I'm as interested in this list as ya'll, in making it and searching Lucy for stacking issues I found the Reflective Orb of Energy and Cloak of Retribution . . . two items I wasn't even aware of and promptly went on my wishlist for when we break into PoTime.  And now with the Shroud of Eternity I'm not sure which cloak I want ;-P  Keem em comming.</div></div><hr />

Not clicky like the other's, but nice to bump that damage shield number a bit higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bone Chill Shield from VT.. 6pt self DS, warrior usable and clickable from inventory if you don't want to look silly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
( No you won't see it on my magelo, I don't have it..My Shammy friend does, he got the shield and got the aten shield a few weeks later... by then he became addicted to the DS and now clicks it from inventory.... :)  )<br />
<br />
Bone Chill Shield (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28970)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget all the Shield of Pain items like Earring of Sand Tides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mokor, I believe the Razor Fang of Xygoz (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24649) proc is basicly identical to the Mark of Karn/Kings line which overwrites a mob's DS. Could be nice if you do not have a cleric handy do strip a mob's DS, but doesn't actually give a warrior any DS. If anyone could clarify if that is correct, it would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Jaqyl, there are also Shield of Pain augments. At least 2Shield of Pain 2 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4220&amp;source=Live) augments. I also do not know the max stacking of worn DS. <br />
<br />
Thank you for gathering all of that info up. Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excluding Augs, Potions, Shields, and any item I'm unaware of<br />
<br />
I didn't include any of the above in my list and heres why . . .<br />
<br />
Augs - The point buyable type require that you have gear with type3 slots(LDoN point buyable gear) and at my current gear level none of the LDoN gear is worth the effort, so I didn't put any effort into researching them.  I know there are type7 or 8 Shield of Pain augs that drop from LDoN raids but lets face it the number of guilds doing those is pretty small, most guilds don't have the patience or drive to deal with them, including my own.<br />
<br />
Potions - These require you to use up lots of bag space and have plat to keep your supply replenished as well as time to run to the baz, thats too many upkeep factors imo.<br />
<br />
Shields - This was refering to shields with worn DS, like the LDoN hard drop shield I believe, limited availability and not very useful.<br />
<br />
Also add to that list nonreplenishable charged items, the ring from BoT is a good example.  I'm concerned with unlimited charges or rechargeable via mana batteries or quest turnins.<br />
<br />
<br />
UPDATE<br />
- Added Spined Chain Mail(I may have to organize some SoL kills since I never got the tunare belt this item would own)<br />
- Added Giant Thunderbolt Eyepatch with a note about its wearability<br />
- Added Bone Chill Shield with a note about the likelyhood of getting it<br />
<br />
Considered adding the Harnessed Flame Dirk with an unconfirmed warning but decided against it.  I would REALLY like to hear if anyone has confirmation about the ability for any class to inventory click this, unlimited selfclickable 35DS would rock my world.<br />
<br />
Also after discussing it with some guildies that killed SoL alot more than me, they say they've never seen the Spined Chain Mail, can anyone confirm it still drops?  Posts on Alla's suggests that this was removed from SoL's lootlist after the GE revamp.</div></div><hr />
