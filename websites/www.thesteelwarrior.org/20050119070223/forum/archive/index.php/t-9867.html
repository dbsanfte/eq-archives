So I was wondering if there's any other place for a lvl 40 warrior to go.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  :D</div></div><hr />

LDoNs are still good XP and the chance at augs/points. Other than that, I doubt much would beat CoMist.</div></div><hr />

They don't add when you pull them and there is a vendor to sell crap to there.  They drop Words, Pages, and Bone Chips to sell in the bazaar for 1pp per and change from 0-5pp each.  I usually brought a partner unless I was playing my necro or another solo class.  Anything would be good really.....<br />
<br />
Shaman - Slows, buffs, heals<br />
<br />
Druid - DS, STR buffs, better heals<br />
<br />
Cleric - Undead nukes, HP buffs, best heals<br />
<br />
Besides that, it's been soooo long since i leveled an alt that far, my memory seems to be failing me   :(</div></div><hr />

Was good fun plus you get to work on that thurg faction though with all the droppable stuff you can get in the bazaar these days, I'm not even sure that thurg armor is worthwhile anymore.  Really is too bad...the velious armor quests were a LOT of fun.  Getting that champ BP was one of my EQ highlights for sure!  :)</div></div><hr />
