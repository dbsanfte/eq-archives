<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">03-13-2005, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Doomhammer Azshara is THE place for gold farmers, most of which don't speak English.  In the main channel when they get something they'll usually link it and say something stupid, such as <br />
<br />
&quot;[Peerless Cloak of the Monkey] you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;[Peerless Cloak of the Monkey] you 6g&quot;<br />
<br />
Then someone will usually pipe up, something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to hell farmer&quot; or &quot;Learn English bastard&quot;<br />
<br />
Not only that, but they seem to be exceedingly stupid.  The horde ones will challenge me to duels (as if it would make me go away) and the alliance ones will flag and come close to a mob that I'm killing hoping that I click on them or something so that they can fight me..... but when I actually end up fighting them I end up slaughtering them no matter what class they are.  At 54-55 I would kill a 60 pally like nothing.  No shield, no heals, no nothing.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this problem or something similar on their server?  I go there trying to level up or do the bloodelf quests and it's usually fairly difficult to accomplish with 3-4 of them there at either the bloodelf camp or the satyrs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">03-13-2005, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Azshara is a kewl zone, and it's usually perma-camped by farmers, levelling bots or whoever. The grey items that drop off most of the mobs there are actually worth farming that gold, also because there are plenty for everyone (atleast on my server).<br />
<br />
That said, I really hope Azshara doesnt get nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">03-13-2005, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Azshara is good because the mobs have low ass AC, which attracts all the rang rang farmers.<br />
<br />
If you want some good consistent cash, try the yetis or the owlbeasts in winterspring. Nice, quiet place, good silver (5-9 per kill usually), and some useful greens.<br />
<br />
The highborne at the lake are good too, but the rang rangs have caught onto that =(</div></div><hr />

This is the reason I play on a PvP server, and the reason I wish there was a no-holds-barred PvP server like Mordred on DAoC. <br />
<br />
I haven't seen any farmers on Frostwolf.</div></div><hr />

They'll keep it up for about a month or so, then stop, thinking mission accomplished.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You like Creamofsomeyoungguy 10g yum yum&quot;<br />

Have a good time with some whispers and make the best of a bad situation.</div></div><hr />

And then you accidentally sent it to an English farmer, and they report you for harassment!</div></div><hr />
