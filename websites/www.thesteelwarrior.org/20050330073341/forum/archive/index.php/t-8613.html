<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwavlin</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would like to get advice on Pulling for various situs:<br />
<br />
1. Mob is stationary.  Is there a way to tell if its rooted or snared vs Mezz'd?  If mob is mezzed, I need to Taught/Berate first, but if rooted or snared should I use a bow until the mob breaks out?<br />
<br />
2. I prefer to pull mob further than where group is currently stationed, but there is not time for much communication.  In some situations I have no trouble pulling mob past them all the way to me, using a bow, but in others the mob aggros on a group member. Is there a list somewhere of all the reasons for why a group member might get aggro?<br />
<br />
3.  Pulling a caster, I like to get out of line of sight (LOS), so the mob has to follow and get LOS to cast, thus pulling them closer to my group.  After the mob comes within LOS, I will rush it to start melee.  This seems to confuse groups I have been with.  Are there other techniques when pulling casters?</div></div><hr />

if its rooted or snared, it'll be swinging or casting on you.  root has the added fun effect of making the mob hit who is closest to it reguardless of how much that mob hates you.  dd's will break root.<br />

afaik anything benifical done to you will cause the caster to get aggro.  Also letting the group know ahead of time where you will be pulling to helps.<br />

Get smarter groupmates? lol jk.  That is how you have to pull casters.  I'd suggesting sitting down after you have the mobs attention to make it come to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">May I ask why you are pulling the mob past the group?<br />
Whatever the reason, if you run a mob by a sitting caster, the mob might jump the caster.<br />
s far as using a bow on a rooted mob, usually not, I'd say. My guess is that the mob is being rooted for crowd control purposes and that there's more than one mob in camp. Kill the unrooted mobs first, then the rooted one, unless for some reason the rooted mob is a nasty caster. There are occasions when a caster might root a mob to allow for some sort of aggro control--the closest player to the rooted mob will get hit by the mob until root breaks, regardless of the mob's hate list. Generally, though, when crowd control is not an issue, it's best if the mob is not rooted, because a rooted mob will keep fighting until it's dead. If the mob typically runs at the end of its life, then instead of running it will stand there and beat on melee characters, causing more damage to the group than it would otherwise. <br />
As unclebong said, a mezzed mob will not hit you, so if you are standing next to it, it'll just be standing there, drooling. Make sure the group knows that you and you alone are breaking mez; taunt until you get a successful taunt, then hit your incite line, then autoattack &amp; slam mob &amp; call assist (the last being optional, since mostly people will join you once the mob starts hitting you). <br />
You are pulling casters the right way. If groupmates are jumping the gun, make hotkey that says /g Incoming %T PLEASE WAIT FOR MY ASSIST CALL BEFORE ENGAGING MOB!&quot;<br />
And then another hotkey that says, /g Please ASSIST ME in killing %T now.<br />
If you play with the people in your group much, they'll eventually fall into a pattern and you won't have to direct them so much. <br />
And, before pull you can always stand where you want to pull the mob to, and tell your group that you will pull to this point, and want to fight the mob here.</div></div><hr />

Should something go wrong early in the battle like someone going LD, (happened a few times in N Ro LDons), I need to understand what the optimal strategies are.  Pick-up LDoN groups in particular seem to stay close to me when I'm pulling even tho I specifically tell them where to stay.  They do not all wait for the call to &quot;move up to me, plz!&quot;.  So they get to close... LDons in particular are bad because the LDon gets tougher as you go in deeper, and people get over-confident (had an SK who insisted he solo in a hard ldon while the cleric was medding last night).  So, ya... I will pull the mob right into the group, sometimes past some group members.  But I wouldn't want to get anyone killed... (ok - ya, maybe the SK ... but no one else).</div></div><hr />

Meh, you can be kind of stuck if you tell your group where to stand and they just keep following you. At that point they're certainly not thinking about what to do as much as you are, and I'm not sure how you can get 'em to fight efficiently.</div></div><hr />
