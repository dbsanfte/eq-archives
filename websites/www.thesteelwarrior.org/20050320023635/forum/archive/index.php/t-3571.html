<br />
I've been away for awhile (and technically I am still away, cuz the wife and I can't play yet, RL constraints)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give a shout out to all those round here who remember me!<br />
<br />
Hey Shikarii, how's the test Warrior going? That's not him in your avatar is it? With the epics? Dang!<br />
<br />
Hey Azlana! Keeping this place sane? What about yourself?<br />
<br />
Brutal, Hussar, Haas, Varaho, Dobbo, Gnomers how ya'll doing?<br />
<br />
I will try and come around a bit more. The wife and I may be reactivating our accounts around Christmas and I feel a bit out of touch!<br />
<br />
Talk to ya'll later!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Donnel !! Naah, that's the old Shikarii; Kiadan on Test Server time went kaplooey after the /testbuff went active there ( it got swamped fast ) than my old guild kinda needed warriors but I never realised I can't play Euro-Time anyhow as that is my guild's main raiding time and RL took over ( BTW props to all my guildmates who have tried their best to keep me flagged and backflagged..i owe them big time ).... Actually my EQ time on any server is near done :( autumn is a busy time of the year for me IRL and i prob won't be back online for more than 10 minutes or so until mid-November or the first snow falls here.<br />
<br />
But RL is good :D going on 4 months being married now and each day makes it harder and harder to take time away from wife and i. we're really enjoying life and everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gratz on the marriage, I don't think that had happened the last time I was around. (at least I don't remember) My wife and I are up to 1 Year 4 Months now, so I know how you are feeling.<br />
<br />
I started a second job about a month ago.<br />
<br />
So I've got the Network Admin thing during the day, and then I sell hardware at Sears at night. Doesn't leave much time for anything as involving as EQ, although the wife and I have managed to work in some less involving games like Diablo 2, and recently I have been playing a Mod for Half-Life called Natural Selection, it's actually quite fun if you get the chance to try it.<br />
<br />
Good to hear from you!</div></div><hr />
