<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peddy</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, my name is Peddy :)   ...I have a problem: My hitpoints are not high enough. Or at least I think so. And the clerics. I myself think that my gear is good (I had a friend who quit so he gave me a ton of great stuff), but I need to get more HP so I can feel all strong and mighty. I only have around 500pp to my name, but I COULD sell some of my less necessary stuff to upgrade others. I also have some extra items that I could sell for around 2k total. <br />
<br />
My unbuffed HP at this level (55) is just around 2800 and I would like to at least break the 3k barrier. Does anyone have any suggestions for purchases/light quests (I'm not in a guild and I don't have many friends :( ) that I could attempt?<br />
<br />
Things that I have had an eye out for are Blood Runed Gauntlets and Earring of the Solstice. Also, I would shave my feet for a pair of those mosquito leg earrings but they're 15k apiece on my server :mad: <br />
<br />
Any commets are welcome.</div></div><hr />

Also, www.magelo.com is your friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gaw, never gonna get use to it being on the side like that.<br />
<br />
HoT= Halls of Testing. aka SS armor.  (SS = Skyshrine)<br />
<br />
In HoT unadorned armor drops, which you take to SS and turn in with according gems, only if you have ally faction.  A good bit of people sell this armor as it's easy to farm and plate drops easier than all get out.  Just get ally faction and a few k saved up and you should be able to buy most of the pieces you want (since you don't have a guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peddy</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ally faction with whom? And what is this type of armor called? (Gonna check it out on Allah)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">faction = Claws of Veeshan<br />
armor = Myrmidon's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peddy</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I see. How many people would I need to bring to HoT to be successful? I'd need to join a guild and my server seems to have a low supply of large guilds that allow my level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the experience of the group.  Personally I can go there with 4 people and farm the place.  Most guilds that are just starting halls of testing take 20-30 people.  As per your guild situation, guilds like tanks with levels.  More hp, different damage tables, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peddy</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay well thx info :P ...do I need to make some boring key quest or something, like with Sebilis? (not that it was hard but we spent half an hour looking for a tracker &gt;.&lt;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No.  The only restriction &quot;I believe&quot; is you have to be level 46.  I've never bothered to confirm this, only hersay from a friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peddy</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do I make faction with those SS guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SS faction is Claws of Veeshan&lt;sp?&gt;  which can be raised from killing Giants in and around Kael(in ew) it will take lots of increaces to get ally with SS, so be patient...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your magelo i can give you these easy upgrade suggestions:<br />
<br />
SS Gloves, Arms<br />
Orc Fang Earring (15hp iirc?)<br />
That 50ish HP necklace from ponightmare<br />
<br />
think that's all i can think of as cheap upgrades, oh yeah, don't forget quests, they rock for hp items.<br />
<br />
lates =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">draconic pauldrons quest in WW - get you a nice 15 ac 12 sta and resists item. only need less than  agroup to kill the 4 mobs and they are almost always up.<br />
<br />
also do the bracer of benevolence quest. thats another WW quest that you can do. a lot of warriors prefer these to even HoT bracers because of the HPs sta and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell that Belt of the Gimp Turtle to a ranger and get a Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide and you'll have enough left over for a skeet leg earring. Try to trade your cloak for Cloak of Flames, basically trading useless mana for HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say hit up UP and grab a Bracelet of Fortitude or wahtever its called the +15 sta one.  Then you can MQ the SS gaunts and that right there should get you about 130hp.  Then if at all possible get a Solstice earing 5sta 55hp is really nice and it has good sv's.  Also pick up a clattering bone necklace.  I know thats over the 2k or so you said but those are just a few options you can do. Also like alot of other people said do some HoT raids.</div></div><hr />

No.  The only restriction &quot;I believe&quot; is you have to be level 46.  I've never bothered to confirm this, only hersay from a friend.  <br />
<br />
Unless they changed it, all you need it is ally faction...<br />
<br />
Hail the quest giver, and if they give you the quest info, you are good, if not, get either more levels or faction.<br />
<br />
Pretty damned sure I remember peeps hydra-ing a level 1 toon for faction hits, and twinking them out in velious armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2800hp is a tad low at 55 I think, it's what you'd expect from a pally or a sk, not a warrior. Though the upgrade suggestions earlier are very good, you should be able to hit around 3200 relatively painlessly.<br />
<br />
I can't check your magelo from work, but if you don't have an earring of the solstice, get it. It'll run you 4k and net you some ac, 5sta and 55hp in an ear slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peddy</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This belt was given to me, and while I wouldn't mind selling it, it has - for some reason - dropped immensely in price lately. On Rodcet Nife, it's down to 10k or around that, and It's probably pretty hard to sell (Saw some guy trying to sell one for 10k for days)...that won't be enough to get me a mosquito leg earring, though I could get Earring of the Solstice, Blood Runed Gauntlets and Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide. I refuse to wear orc fang earrings however &gt;.&lt; I'm just not going to. As for trading the CoCW for a CoF, that's not quite possible. CoCW is 30kish on RN, while CoF should be at least 40k if my memory doesn't fail me.<br />
<br />
One thing that I'm pretty angry about is that lately, with the coming of PoP, people have become...lazy! I'm currently not in a guild but once in a while if it's a lucky day and there's a good bunch of my friends on, or of I'm in a really good group, I like to ask them if they want to go anywhere else than PoP (I really don't think those darn planes are much fun), but they're usually like &quot;naaah it's better exp here, I don't know that zone, I'm scared&quot; and so and so, I've had great trouble even convincing single groups to go to Droga with me (I was plotting to lure a group down to the Kings area to camp me a SotBS), and I doubt I can get three groups with me to ToV (&quot;Ooooh ToV! We'll have to travel real far and it's dangerous and it's more than two zones away from a bind spot/bank/vendor/kei bot!!&quot;)<br />
Seems to me that PoP transformed Everquest from an immensely big, seemingly unending RPG, and into a slot machine. I'm angry :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is really nothing new. Back when I started, in Kunark, people complained that &quot;ever since Kunark people have become lazy&quot; and don't want to leave the loio-fm-ot-dl-kc exp train.<br />
<br />
It's one of those &quot;in my day, we walked to school 5 miles, in the snow, uphill both ways&quot; complaints I think...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is nothing--To get to school in the morning, I had to run naked through boiling lava uphill both ways (because of all the vocanoes raising up the ground) being chased by rabid sabertooth tigers and dodging those giant dinosaur birds who would swoop down to try and get me so they could feed me to their babies on top of mountains.</div></div><hr />
