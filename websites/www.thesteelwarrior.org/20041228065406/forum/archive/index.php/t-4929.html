 I recieved the message that I could not use Incite because I was silenced (forget exact message,was busy). My defensive still was running though. <br />
<br />
 So not sure all the skills/discs that can be silenced. Either way, be aware.</div></div><hr />

You cant start a spell when you are silenced, but if you are already casting it then it will finish.</div></div><hr />

It would be reasonable (albeit annoying) to think that one cannot howl obscenities at a MOB when one is silent.  My ASL isn't very good, and my hands are full :p.<br />
<br />
Hokay.<br />
<br />
But at the same time I think it one should be able to &quot;assume a defensive fighting style&quot; while silenced.  Hopefully, if this is deliberate, this is how it's been coded.</div></div><hr />

One thing that is pretty fucked up is having endurance draining effects though. Having defensive or something drop because a mob is sucking your endurance is retarded.</div></div><hr />

How exactly is this retarded?<br />
<br />
I fail to see how in the realm of fantasy you cannot fathom a monster with ability to sap your endurance.<br />

Ever fight undead in D&amp;D or almost any other role playing game ever?<br />

Not sure why everyone thinks this melee revamp should come without any negatives. /shrug<br />

Not everyone ... I think it's appropriate; good design.  Whether the system is solidly established yet (vis a vis regeneration rates, foci items, etc) to implement that sort of MOB attack as well, I'm still iffy on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, and in D&amp;D games mobs can drain your levels too, imagine the outcry if they did that in EQ.  No valid comparison there.<br />
<br />
I also think it's fine that mobs can drain your endurance, it's logical.  But, on the other hand, then PC's should be able to replenish your endurance as well.  And they shouldn't be able to drain all your endurance in just a few ticks either.  I don't think endurance drain of that magnitude without some recourse against it should be in game.</div></div><hr />

Casters already deal with this to some degree with Feeblemind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I just had a great insight.  Maybe you are right, some mobs should cause temporary level loss, heck even permanent without restoration.  And there should be a vendor that charges a varying fee depending on your level and numbers of levels lost for a restoration.  That would suck some pp out of the economy.  :)<br />
<br />
Heck, add mobs that also drain str, or sta, or wis or int permanently with a different vendor to restore those stats.  :)  Or hmmm...  mobs that curse your gears stats that you have to take your gear to pay to get it fixed.  The possibilities are endless.  :)<br />
<br />
Edit: spelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't care about them draining endurance really, limiting incite and other future abilities used from endurance. What I don't like is having my tanking discipline prematurely run out when for the past 3 years its always lasted a set duration. Not that I disagree with your arguments from a roleplay perspective, because they make sense, but I just do not agree with anything that restricts the disciplines we have been using since Kunark.</div></div><hr />

Forest giants in Plane of Storms do this as well.<br />
<br />
Agreed, it's pretty gay for endurance draining mobs to kill our disciplines.</div></div><hr />

It's retarded simply because it is left over from before the changes went live. If they were implimented after the changes then it would be understandable.  However, effects are simply not supposed to be effecting endurance at the moment.<br />
<br />
Also, not that it has any real relevance but, in D&amp;D the only energy pool that was ever drained was a mental pool. Mostly due to the fact that players other than the completely optional psyonic (sp) classes do not posses them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in DnD we don't get disciplines that halve our dmg either = p<br />
<br />
The stamina drain is what has caused emp fight to be much harder for some folks, sure suprised some of the e-planes guild when they went to farm for some alts on my server hehe.</div></div><hr />

I think that's a little naive to suggest that. Such effects were designed and implemented into the game BEFORE the new endurance system without having such an impact. To have a game or strategy altering change as a side effect... that's retarded. Besides this is not D&amp;D, it's Everquest. Similar content but still a huge difference.</div></div><hr />
