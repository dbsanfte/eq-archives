<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkov</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, new forum, cool.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've been away from the game for over a year, I'm level 48 and pretty much kitted out in crafted, which used to be pretty good for my level... oh so long ago now.<br />
<br />
I notice prices have changed dramatically on most things and for less than Crafted cost back then, I could get a set or two of Cobalt now (minus those bracers). So the question is, what do I upgrade to?<br />
<br />
I have a high level bst which has been farming and some friends have donated to give me a total of about 75k... not much but I need something for every slot.. any suggestions? ty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, 75k eh? You're doing a clean sweap and requipping most everything? I'll assume with that you can get to 80k (prolly more).<br />
<br />
for a general rundown that will leave you with lots left to spend, but probably undergeared for your level (digging way back into my memory here):<br />
<br />
ears: 2x black sapphire engagement earring<br />
neck: spider fur collar<br />
face: <br />
head: crusty or SSB<br />
fingers: 2x velium fire wedding ring<br />
wrist: crusty<br />
arms: crusty<br />
hands: crusty or SCHW depending on Waist<br />
shoulder: crested spaulders<br />
chest: crusty or crafted<br />
back: spider fur cloak<br />
waist: FBSS or spider fur belt depending on Hands<br />
legs: crusty<br />
feet: crusty<br />
<br />
melee 1: frostbringer<br />
melee 2: black blade of tormenting<br />
range: goranga idol<br />
<br />
i dont think frosty procs until 50.. so until then either grab another BBoT or get a barnacle covered axe<br />
<br />
there are other, better options available these days but i think thats about what i had around level 48<br />
<br />
Also, an obviosu suggestion I missed, is cultural armor, if you happened to pick the tribunal or rallos zek you can get some really nice stuff, a full set would probably set you back the whole 75k tho (helanic tundra and fierce heraldric is the name of the armor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frosty procs at level 40, FYI.<br />
<br />
The previous post is very good for getting back on your feet.  However, if you can swing it, I'd reccomend a suit of cultural armor.  (However, that won't help you if you are an agnostic ogre or troll. :(  )  I would not touch the cobalt for everyday wearing unless you are getting yourself the breastplate or legs (both of which are still pretty pricey).  <br />
<br />
I'd grab some silver chitin handwraps for haste, they seem the most reasonable in price and will tide you over til you can camp higher haste or purchase it.  For aggro weapons, a frostbringer or a pair of troll smithed ykeshas should do the trick.</div></div><hr />
