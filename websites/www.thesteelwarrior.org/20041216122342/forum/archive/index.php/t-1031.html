<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something that has really been bugging me lately.  Secondary tanks, some of whom are warriors and some are not, and do the following:<br />
<br />
1) Stand right next to me at the mobs face, and edge me away from it.<br />
2) Don't stand at max melee range when they're not MT and end up getting proximity aggro.<br />
3)  Use high aggro, proccing weapons (sometimes the same ones I'm using) and steal aggro from me.<br />
4) Stun a mob and push it behind me and not give me a head's up about what's about to happen. &lt;you can't see/hit your target from here&gt;<br />
5) Once they get aggro, don't turn off auto-attack for a moment, back slowly away or anything just keep on doing what stole the aggro in the first place.<br />
6) Get BETWEEN me and the mob.  How do you even consider doing that to your MT?<br />
<br />
That having been said, I've been guild grouping almost exclusively lately, and most of the tanks in my guild are aware of stuff like this and take steps to avoid it.  If they slip a little, one friendly reminder will usually take care of it.  It's the few non guild groups I've been in recently where this really gets to me.  Anyone else have similar issues? :)<br />

/em pushes Beornegar into the the shit hole<br />

If you are talking about raiding then yah thats a valid point but if they are SA and get agro they will learn fast if you raiding anything other then orc pawns cause you will have CH chain on you and they wont. So SAs will go splat right away a couple of times of that and they will consider different strategy.</div></div><hr />
