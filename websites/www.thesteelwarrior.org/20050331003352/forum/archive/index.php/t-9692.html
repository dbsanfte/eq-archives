<br />
Pending Backflag Solution is in the Works <br />
<br />
I had the opportunity to speak with Lyndro, the developer in charge of creating the backflagging solution for the locked access zones, such as the Elemental Planes, Plane of Time, Qvic and Txevu. These zones will have an alternate method added that allows a different path for players to gain permanent access to the zone. In addition, there will be alternate paths to achieve access to pre-elemental zones. This solution is slated to be introduced to the game in mid December. It is important to understand that the actual methods of exactly how these backflagging paths will be implemented has not yet achieved full resolution. These details are subject to change; however, the concepts mentioned below are pretty much set in stone. <br />
<br />
I. Elemental Planes <br />
<br />
Currently, the method to gain permanent access to these zones requires the task of meeting a series of goals, in the form of a linear path of killing specific raid targets that ultimately grants the player permanent access to an otherwise inaccessible zone. In it’s day, the linear flagging for access flowed pretty well; however, as the content became less and less ‘new’, it became a chore to go backwards to reflag newer members to the locked zones. The Backflag Solution addresses these concerns. <br />
<br />
After the Backflag Solution is set in place, a player will be able to be shuttled into an elemental plane via the 15%/85% raid rule, and hail for the Elemental Gods’ quest piece as before; however, now that hail grants the player permanent access to that particular Elemental Plane. Example: 15%/85% raid into Plane of Fire, be present at Fennin Ro killing, hail projection… you now have permanent access to Plane of Fire (only PoF – you must defeat Coirnav for PoW access, Xegony for PoA access and the Avatar of Earth for PoE access. **NOTE: the decision on EarthA and EarthB access has not been finalized. EarthB access may or may not require the Mystical Arbiter key from EarthA. ). <br />
<br />
It should be noted, that this alternate access will have no affect on the PoP charm; meaning – using the alternate access path to the Elemental Planes and beyond will not enhance the stats on your charm. <br />
<br />
II. Plane of Time <br />
<br />
Currently, one could only gain access to the Plane of Time by being present at all 4 Elemental God defeats and gaining each of the 4 essences to combine into the Plane of time Key (quintessence of elements). <br />
<br />
The Backflag Solution for Time will allow for players to be shuttled into the Plane of time via 15%/85% raid rule, and now certain mobs in the Plane of Time will actually drop the quintessence of elements itself, for permanent access. It’s undetermined exactly which mobs and how many flagging opportunities will be available per trip. I got the impression that Phase 4,5 and Quarm kills will likely grant 2-3 flags per tier, for approximately 9 backflags per visit. Example: defeating Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, Saryrn and Terris Thule will trigger a mob/chest to spawn, which will drop 3 quintessence of elements; the situation would repeat in phase 5 (defeating the 4 gods), and then repeat again after Quarrm himself was killed. <br />
<br />
III. Qvic/Txevu <br />
<br />
Currently Qvic access requires Uqua and Ikkinz 4 raids (Ikkinz4 raid access is dependant on a series of raid encounters). <br />
<br />
The Backflag Solution will also allow for the 15%/85% rule to shuttle in players, and will have raid mobs (Zoo/Cynosure) who will drop 1-2 flag tokens to grant permanent access to the zone. There will be a quest associated with gaining permanent access to the zone, meaning that you will not simply be given access by 15%/85% zoning in, and looting just the item from here. There will be additional steps that can be completed with a group, outside Qvic or Txevu. The solution has an analogous scenario located inside Txevu that will allow the player to bypass the need for for reflagging through the Noqufiel event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had hoped the devs would see that this method isn't going to solve the problem. Guilds that lost members and have to recruit new people to replace them need those people to kill those gods. Making the piece drop off the gods themselves does nothing to ease the backflag burden since the guilds that actually need these quests to progress won't have the numbers to kill the gods to get the piece without actually backflagging them to begin with. These quest pieces should drop off the other raid targets in the zone that don't take so many people to kill or there should be a new mob put in each zone that will drop enough pieces to flag your unflagged people.<br />
<br />
I thought they were on the right track with these backflagging alternatives but it's apparent that these quests are only for the uber guilds to get their alts flagged rather than actually easing the burden on guilds that are trying to progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the purpose of this is NOT to allow easier elemental access to joe blow and his band of noobs. it is to allow guilds who have ALREADY COMPLETED things like time flagging, ikkinz4 etc to bring new guild members into the zones they currently raid in without forcing them to redo content they completed months ago. as an app to a qvic+ guild with few god flags i sure hope they institute this soon</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not trying to get something for nothing here, I've done a metric fuckton of backflagging since we got elemental, but we still have to replace people who leave for one reason or another and with WoW and EQ2 coming out it's only going to get worse. We're going to lose people even more who are sick of backflagging new recruits and can now just join a high end guild and get get gimped into Time and beyond. This is going to destroy mid-level guilds like mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sucky suck backflagging plan if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Well I suppose as a &quot;backflagging&quot; plan per se, it is probably fine, but sucks for those of us who want elemental access without going through the hell of flagging.  Personally I'll just stick to OoW and progress through there, screw PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It actually makes it easier for the mid-level guilds also,  Teir 1 and 2 flagging sucks and not having to redo something like all 3 hoh trials or Carpin to flag 2 or 3 new people will make life alot easier.  <br />
<br />
Most mid-level guilds I know dont raid more then 3 times a week.  So the more time they are able to work on progressing instead of backflagging is a good thing.<br />
<br />
EDIT: as a member of a mid-level guild I really dont want to have to kill behemoth for the 8th time to flag some people, I rather just get the drops in tactics as we kill the zeks at least the loot from them are still upgrades to some.</div></div><hr />

The ubers who already have access had to earn it in the first place.  Looks like non-ep flagged guilds (where I am at) will need to go through the same flag progression as everyone else did.  The only difference is once they have enough active members EP flagged they can now do will in's to get new recruits flagged.  <br />
<br />
All things concidered it does seem fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Findra</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My concern is whether or not this is going to help with &quot;mid level backflagging&quot;.<br />
<br />
Case in point:  My guild is not yet elemental (just RZtW left).  We have many people (~ half the guild) that will take months to get full elemental flagged because they've missed one or two steps.  Will killing RZtW, or Agnarr, or SolRo help them get Elemental access, or just allow them into those zones?  Are they going to have to go back and kill Behometh, do a Justice trial, the BoT key quest, Carpin cycle, etc.?<br />
<br />
These may seem like small, insignificant, trivial things - but they all take time, and many of them take raid time.  Add them up, and my guild could be doing nothing but &quot;mid level backflagging&quot; for the next 3 months and still not have enough people with elemental access despite having killed RZtW, Agnarr and SolRo several times.<br />
<br />
Make it so that if you're present for Agnarr and RZtW kills you get Earth/Air/Water access, and SolRo gives you Fire access.  Don't make us go back and do 50 raids to get my guild able to raid in elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spikela</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem with that Findra... you only need 1 flag and 2 keys to reach Agnarr/RZ. This would allow first-flagging through PoP to be AMAZINGLY fast. The approach given here means that guilds that have been farming these for ages don't need to do boring backflag raids with .25 DKP amongst 40 people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it might be a little simplistic but no backflagging changes aren't going to help you because you aren't to the point of backflagging. You are still in the middle of flagging people and yes flagging in PoP is a definite task. It could be worse. It could be no 85% rule and no out of order flagging allowed like it started at.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how many of the uber guilds will offer to take people on Fenin, or Cornaiv, or Xegony, or Rathe encounters to get them flagged?  Nope, they won't, they'll use this to get their alts flagged and do whatever they can to avoid making zone access easier for others.  Greedy bastages.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see anything wrong with the solutions above, and I noticed a small piece in there saying &quot;In addition, there will be alternate paths to achieve access to pre-elemental zones.&quot;. But as we all know this doesn't solve much of the headaches of a guild nearing elemental access.<br />
<br />
Things I'd like to personally see:<br />
1) make the 85% raid rule apply to Bertox's area<br />
<br />
2) let higher flag kills backfill in missing flags on a second kill. By this I mean if I kill Saryrn twice, the second kill i hail the projection and it fills in the lowest flag in the line of: pon maze, terris thule, grummus, carprin, bertox, kos. 7 kills of Saryrn and you'd have her entire line done. If that applied to each line of flags you'd mainly be able to repeat challenging content plus occasional mass lower flags to make the 'backfill' fill in more useful stuff.<br />
<br />
3) allow raid leader AA's to modify the 85% rule, if you raid leader has say a 6 or 8 point &quot;Planar Stability&quot; raid leader aa or something then instead of 85%/15% it could be 80%/20%. Perhaps allow multiple levels even. While that might make your raids dependent on 1 or 2 raid leaders it would still be less painfull than playing games of camping people out/in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mixed feelings on this myself. <br />
<br />
On one hand, its a bitch to go back and do the same event over and over and over after its become trivial, just for the sake of flagging people for progression.  PoP flagging is a pain in the ass that has been the undoing of many guilds, etc.. This might be the shot in the arm to help guilds get over that hump, increase access to guilds for people that are underflagged, open up end game content for more people, etc... <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Its been argued on the boards here endlessly that if you want X gear, get flagged for X like everyone else has had to and go earn it.  This has been the bedrock of the raiders argument in the &quot;raider vs non-raider debate&quot;, and has been argued to death. It's tempting to apply that argument here now and say &quot;People need to earn their flags like everyone else has in the past if they want access to Uber Zone X/Uber Gear X&quot;.  (My suspicion is that we won't hear that argument from any raiders as this change actually benefits them)<br />
<br />
Would also suggest that if they are going to make changes for PoP flags, Eles, Time, GoD they should consider doing the same to Emp and VT. It would be nice if the changes benefited as many people as possible.  This has the potential to either improve game play immensely, or totally eliminate the &quot;middle-class&quot; of guilds/players and totally dick things up. Personally, I hope it goes well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a sidetrack and wanted to keep it separate from my above post.<br />
<br />
Mellow out Ibithor. You have argued and argued your point about people having to earn their way into zones and gear like everyone has before them since you started posting here. Now that these changes could help you your all for em and want to make flagging easier.  To attack Telen like that about his prediction about how this will play out in game and start droppin the F bomb makes you sound like a chimp.</div></div><hr />

this is a higher end guild retune, quit whining it doesnt include you, you got an entire expansion (OOW) so stfu<br />
<br />
sony sees a problem in that they lose high end customers to new games, rl etc. guilds then must spend sometimes literally months reflagging for content they already were doing before new games came out. more people get frustrated and leave, its a domino effect. if the reflagging was a big enuff issue to the end game community that it was costing them customers, its in their best interest  to throw them this bone</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. And I also want to point out that not only the high-end guilds benefit.  Easing the difficulty of backflagging can benefit people doing lower content too. People leaving &quot;family&quot; style guilds to start raiding, unguilded single groupers looking to raid, people whose RL schedules have changed who now have time for raiding, actual new players, all might find a warmer reception from higher end guilds if the backflagging process wont be a total bitch. etc..All depends on how its implemented, and how it is used in pratice.  Will wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is good information, and obviously as stated, it was discussed at Fan Faire as well.<br />
<br />
Plane of Time, Kodtaz, Yxxta and several other raid zones are being made to follow the 85/15% rule.<br />
<br />
There will be single group or small raid force events that will flag you for specific zones. There will also be raid drops that essentially flag you for that zone. For example, an equivalent to the Quintessence of Elements will drop in Plane of Time itself and will flag you for Plane of Time (maybe after a short quest).  <br />
<br />
This is the fan fair report........</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what this is.  <br />
<br />
Findra wants free EP flags for half of her guild as soon as they kill RZtW.<br />
I say bullshit.  You want to progress, you progress as a guild.  If half of your guild is not flagged, then backflag.  Remember this, backflagging wasn't always an option.  Killing RZtW didnt mean shit unless you were completely flagged up to that point.  Now you have the option of backflagging.<br />
<br />
The only reason this is going into effect is because the 'ubers' requested it.<br />
Everytime someone applies to my guild, they have to sit on their ass for 2+ weeks until we get around to redoing old content so that they can raid with us.  This serves no purpose.  Not only does it waste our time, but it pisses off lower tier guilds (this isn't always a bad thing.)<br />
<br />
Now if only they implement this better then they did with Anguish keys~</div></div><hr />

First, I like what SoE did with OoW (if not, I'd have quit by now) and I think it was a huge step in the right direction.  If my comments appeared to bash SoE in general, then my apologies...that was not the intention.  However, I still feel like I got screwed out of half my money for PoP and essentially all of my money for GoD.  If SoE is going to leave the flagging in place, I wish they would just leave it completely alone and not keep bringing up changes to support uber raiders - all that's doing is taunting the non-uber raiding crowd.<br />
<br />
Second, you can take you're &quot;I'm better then you because I raid&quot; crap and...  (I think you know what's next.  ;) )</div></div><hr />

First off, a guild that is backflagging people for PoTime is not an uber guild ;)<br />
<br />
Second, if SoE is putting something in to help established guilds, and you take this as a taunt, then you need to take your meds.<br />

If you want to hear me bitch about the thousands of things that SoE has handed to casuals that blatantly negate endless hours of hard work that pioneers have put in, feel free to send me a tell and I'll share my opinions ;)  But you wont hear me whining about it here, because there's plenty of people that it benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is a large diff between 85/15 flagging into time and this easy access to EP that fenrinq was asking for.<br />
<br />
You missed my point, I don't want easy access to the planes for everyone, I want  the backflagging burden eased for guilds who have access to the planes. My guild  lost a lot of people to higher end guilds who snatched them up as soon as they got EP flagged, we're losing a lot to WoW and EQ2. We are in a  constant state of backflagging and our members are sick of it to the point where they don't log in as much because they just don't want to do it anymore. We can kill Fennin with the 45 people we can get into fire with 85/15 but that's not enough for Xegony, TRC or Coirnav.<br />
<br />
Not only do the new backflagging quests not help the mid level guilds like mine, they actually hurt us. How are we supposed to progress when people will just go join a Time guild and get gimped in there. People won't stay around for backflagging when an option like that is available to them and the mid level guilds will never reach time themselves because of it.<br />
<br />
The way it should work to be fair to all the guilds that have done the work to get flagged is have a mob in each zone, a raid target that spawns a planar projection that people can hail and get flagged for that zone as long as they keep the guild tag they have on when they hail it. If they leave that guild they lose the flag. That will alleviate the burden on everyone and keep people from getting a flag and them moving on up the ladder to a higher end guild.</div></div><hr />

dont take this the wrong way, but you say your guild cant keep people due to not being able to flag folks for elemetals. if you have flagged people leaving for other guilds, then sony doesnt care, they still play and they are excercising their right to choose a diff guild to progress. if you have non flagged peeps leaving, then thats their problem for not sticking with it, these are way tuned encounters and there are 5 more lvls and new gear to beat them with. when high end folks reach the point of frustration there is no other guild to go to usually and some encounters in god just suck period no matter how you are geared and even at lvl 70. for those folks there really isnt an option other than finding some new game or somthing else to do with their free time.  this is more about keeping customers who would definitely leave than it is about making progression easier for anyone</div></div><hr />

While its a fair system, its kinda late in the game to be changing the rules like this.  Will in to Time?  So like I dont even have to bother with the EP's, just kiss the right ass and get willed in? EQ has become be less and less a game of skill &amp; chance and more and more a game of politics &amp; socializing with this sort of change + OoW exp gear blowing minds the way it does.  Kinda sad, but nothing lasts forever. =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Findra</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's exactly what this is.  <br />
<br />
Findra wants free EP flags for half of her guild as soon as they kill RZtW.<br />
I say bullshit.  You want to progress, you progress as a guild.  If half of your guild is not flagged, then backflag.  Remember this, backflagging wasn't always an option.  Killing RZtW didnt mean shit unless you were completely flagged up to that point.  Now you have the option of backflagging.<br />
<br />
The only reason this is going into effect is because the 'ubers' requested it.<br />
Everytime someone applies to my guild, they have to sit on their ass for 2+ weeks until we get around to redoing old content so that they can raid with us.  This serves no purpose.  Not only does it waste our time, but it pisses off lower tier guilds (this isn't always a bad thing.)<br />
<br />
Now if only they implement this better then they did with Anguish keys~<br />
You miss my point, which is that backflagging is more than just an annoyance for pre-elemental guilds as well as those in Anguish, Ukua, Time, whatever.  For some of us, it's even more annoying than it is for you all that have been in Time for years now.<br />
<br />
While it will be nice for you all to no longer have a reason to zerg all the early PoP flag targets every other month or so (and thus denying smaller guilds the opportunity to get them), it still doesn't change the fact that we have members that simply can't make every raid, and will take months and months to get flagged for elementals.  While this isn't a problem for open targets (Agnarr, Zeks, HoHo trials, etc. can all be reached with level 62 or keys now), anything locked we have a terribly hard time getting enough flagged to seriously raid (Mith Marr, SolRo, Bertoxx specifically).<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it should be easy to get to elementals, but we are talking about content that is five expansions old (LoY, LDoN, GoD, Omens since PoP - right?).  It is long past the time that elementals and perhaps even Time should be logistically locked out from all but hard-core raiders.<br />
<br />
Yes, the changes as outlined so far will help - but the same mentality could easily be applied to earlier flag progression, for the same reasons.<br />
<br />
How many times does a guild have to kill every single elemental flag target to get a raid force into Earth/Air/Water/Fire?  One?  2?  5?  20?<br />
<br />
How about to get to Mith Marr?  Sol Ro?  Bertoxx?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never said anything about casuals vs non-casuals...I'm talking about raiders versus non-raiders.  The amount of work people put in has nothing to do with whether or not they are casual players - but it has everything to do with the reward they get for their time.<br />
<br />
Btw, yes, you are correct that PoP raiders are not uber by today's raiding standards - unfortunately they are still uber by the non-raider standard.<br />
<br />
Also, the reason I reply to posts like the one I originally quoted is the same reason I respond to threads about warriors now having &quot;agro lock.&quot;  I like EQ and I don't want to see the game screwed up for me.  I'm very happy with what I've seen in OoW, but if I sit back quietly and let the high-end raiding crowd get control of SoE again, I'll wind up being as frustrated as I was by GoD.</div></div><hr />

The way I understand it is: They would have permanent Time access, but no stats on their Intricate Wooden Figurine, and no access to pre time zones (Fire, cod-b, pon-b, Earth, etc.).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then the upcoming changes to backflagging should work great for you.  Just because someone has limited raid time due to RL, doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to join the rest of their guild that does have the play time to get flagged.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you said this:<br />
<br />
We have many people (~ half the guild) that will take months to get full elemental flagged <br />
<br />
Which is a far cry from the top quote.  If half your guild doesn't have the play time to get EP flagged, then you dont belong there.  This is what I was referring to when I said 'free EP flags' and I'll stick by it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, I use the terms 'casual' and 'non-raider' as synonyms and I should not.  I sometimes forget that there are actually people that have the time to raid yet they choose not to :p<br />
<br />
I just found it funny that they added something to the game to make backflagging less of a pain for established guilds, and all of a sudden people were questioning why they had to do the flags at all.<br />

---<br />
Edit: When I say they've already added it, I'm referring to the fact that this is already in game for anguish, and assume that it will work the same way for other zones.</div></div><hr />

First 2 sentences are the type of thing that piss people off. It is basically saying &quot;your problems are not as important as our problems&quot; . To me its the same damn problem but at a different level of content. (The &quot;problem&quot; being it sucks to drag people back through content they have done to get new people up to speed with guild).<br />
<br />
The last sentence is just bullshit.  You are leaving out the fact that player X will be able to go on one raid, loot a token and have PERMANENT time access.  In effect, enabling people to skip all of PoP but the goodies in Time. This is NOT what already exists with the current 85/15 system.<br />
<br />
I just found it funny that they added something to the game to make backflagging less of a pain for established guilds, and all of a sudden people were questioning why they had to do the flags at all.<br />
<br />
Now matter how it is spun, people with zero PoP flags will now be able to go on one raid, get their token, and have their fill of Time rots without ever having to do even a PoJ trial. It allows people to leapfrog through massive amounts of frustrating content and only reap the rewards of the end-zone of PoP. Look at it like a MASSIVE powerlevel, hehe. Expect a little frustration from people working their way through lower tier/pre-time flagging.<br />
<br />
For the record, I have already stated above that i think this change has the potential to help a lot of different types of players, and improve the game. I'm not attacking the backflagging change...but rather the way some people are arguing its merit and arguing against other players concerns or interests.  I don't think its good that people should have to spend their game time doing content they have beaten and are bored with. I dont think you should have to drag 50 people around to get a couple people a flag so they can &quot;catch up&quot;.  But don't be surprised if people apply that line of reasoning to their own problems and ask to be included in the solution.  And I could see that reasoning applied to Emp, VT, lower tier PoP, and on and on.<br />
<br />
Those were just some thoughts i had on the subject. Im sure as always opinions will vary :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem Findra has, Darkgecko, is similar to what most casual guilds have in PoP. It's not that they/we can't kill the content. It's not that they/we can't do it repeatedly. It's that Tower of Solusek Ro access is 15 flags, only 1 (Aerin'dar) can you 85% past and still be flagged. <br />
<br />
Fully Elemental flagged is only 8 more (to compare), and 5 of them (Solro mini's) can be 85% raided past. Any single important missed raid means your screwed until the mob rotation gets back to that, and if you miss that due to reasons like below, then you have even less of a chance for weeks/months. <br />
<br />
Compare that to 5 raids to make a new app Time flagged(4 elemental gods+arbiter). Yes Fennin Ro is tougher than Bertox, but I doubt in terms of time its longer for a Time guild to plow Fennin Ro's event,  than Carprin/Bertox for a Tower of Solusek Ro flagged guild. <br />
<br />
Forcing guilds to Bot people who are in the hospital or whatever really doesn't seem to fit with the EULA and everything.<br />
<br />
Essentially after a while Tier 1 -&gt; Tower of Solusek Ro access is a skill test of getting near 100% attendance, not a skill test of beating mobs.</div></div><hr />

It's been like that ever since the 85% rule was added, but it's 4 raids as opposed to 1.</div></div><hr />

You make very good points.  But my point is this:<br />
If your guild has killed x_mob_001 which allows access to Zone_A, and not at least 85% of your guild got credit for it, then you need to do it again, simple as that.<br />
People miss flags for perfectly good reasons.  They dont need to be flagged to raid with you due to the 85% rule.  What I see Findra asking for is instead of 15%, change it to 50%, and make it permanent as opposed to just for 1 raid.<br />
<br />
I dont really like the idea of flags at all, to be honest.  They are forcing progression on us, which serves a point...but the low-tier raiding guilds apparently aren't getting 85% attendance from their members, so they are hitting a brick wall when it comes to progression.  Don't get me wrong, I can understand Findra's frustration.<br />
<br />
Of course if there were no flags, every ass-hat and their little brother would be kiting at the GY in pofire.  Btw, WTB a flag requirement for Riftseekers :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other problem that seems to be rarely mentioned is that many lower tier guilds (such as ours) cannot take advantage of the 85/15 rule at all, ever, because we just don't ever have enough people present for it to take effect.  Not everyone wants to raid with huge numbers, and for those that do raid with smaller numbers, if they're still casual to the point where not everyone is present for flaggings, it means having to redo them that many more times just to be able to move to the next, unless you want to leave people behind in order to hit the next tier of mobs.</div></div><hr />

umm its not the same dude. you can ALREADY flagdrag 85/15 into EP's. you cannot flagdrag into time, you cannot flagdrag into uqua, you cannot flagdrag into qvic etc. if 85 percent of your guild hasnt passed the encounters to access a zone do them again and get the fuck over it or send them to get flags with a friendly guild. asking that 85 percent of your guild complete content is reasonable, asking that the guild have to redo all previous content every 3 months for a single new member isnt as reasonable. its not an issue of one problem is more important than another, its an issue of one problem is more complex than the other. If you get hungry at home, you can call pizza, go to mcdonalds or cook something. you get hungry while swimming across the english channel and thats a little more difficult to remedy, you have no choice but swim yer ass to shore and go get something to eat.<br />

<br />
as was already pointed out, this ability has been in place since day 1 of elemental flagdragging. the only diff will be is that now the upper guilds wont have to farm the 4 mobs that YOUR GUILD needs to get to plane of time. thus MAKING IT EASIER FOR YOUR GUILD to reach time. do you really want them to have to farm ep gods that you still need in order to flag new members? wont you scream cockblocking at them when in reality its just what they have to currently do to flag new folks and gear them. on a diff note, do you REALLY think that upper guilds will just start mass flagging total fucknuts and giving them phat lewts? dear god man, get a clue. the majority of people who will benefit from this are people who are in high end guilds that maybe had to take some time off for military service, illness, etc or people who are good friends with a lot of peiople in such guilds and for them this will be a way they can play with their friends (provided said friends have already busted their asses completing the content). also peope with multiple toons that might be burning out on a toon could benefit since their other toon could get flagged and they wouldnt need to quit guild and start all over at the beginning if they decide to change toons.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I understand that.  What I'm saying is that the entire PoP-flag process will now be skipped by going on a single raid for some people, while the same sort of &quot;catch-up&quot; mechansim doesn't exist for lower tier content.  Im not saying the proposed changes are not good, just that they may be too selective in who they help.<br />

so what it REALLY gets down to is that you are jealous that some people might get picked up by high end guilds and get to skip content that guild has already passed, meanwhile you are gonna stay in your guild still struggling with 4 expansion old content and be bitter. ok at least i understand your side of it now.<br />

im not sure where you dont understand that all the high end is getting is the very same 85/15 rule you already enjoy. if your guild cant beat the pre elemental pop encounters enuff to flag 85 percent of your guild, that is not an issue that sony needs to address. Thats an issue that YOU need to address. Having to drag everyone back for ONE count em ONE person is something sony needs to address.</div></div><hr />

As for the flagging, look at it like this. Guilds, like mine for instance, will benifit from this greatly, because now the loot that rots in time will go to alts, and the newer members of our guild who don't have flag will be allowed to get the flag without us having to take time out of Normal Raid(Ussually RSS,MPG,Qvic,Ink,Time, Epics, Day off atm). Honestly, going back and reflagging Uqua/Ikkinz4 last week through our entire schedule off. Being allowed to have people zone in, and loot these items will help out many guilds greatly.<br />
<br />
For lower tier guilds, this may not sound so good. But, if your guild is doing Fennin, yet 85% of your raid force isn't flagged for PoFire, you shouldn't have the capabilities to flag people through alternate routes. This is for guilds that are doing content with their guild as a whole, ot for guilds doing things with half of their playerbase.<br />
<br />
If people in Ele's complain, they are either ignorant to what this is doing for THEM, or they are whiey bithces who complain just to be heard. This is, in all reality, helping out Elemental guilds, because now guilds like mine won't have to redo PoP Gods every 3months, or Ikkinz4/Uqua every month just to flag 4-5 apps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Listen bitch: I'm not currently in a guild, I'm not doing old content, and I'm far from bitter, hehe. In fact I'm having the best times I've had in EQ. Get your shit straight.<br />
<br />
I agree there is a problem with making people go back and constantly repeat the same old shit, kill the same old mobs, whenever they need new people. It sucks, and I am happy to admit it and praise a solution to it. I have even said that I think this change has the potential to help a wide variety of people, including the currently unguilded.  If anything, this change can benefit me greatly if I decide to go back to raiding. I just think that they could have expanded the solution to help a wider variety of guilds, and that changes could be considered for content as old as EMP/VT forward.<br />
<br />
Im not sure what I have said that is confusing to you, but I can't say it any more clearly than i have here.</div></div><hr />

I see it as a blessing. If you are worried about folks leaving for higher end guilds, well guess what, they can leave you now for those flags if they wanted. If someone leaves a guild just for that, good riddance in my opinion. If they were willing to leave for that reason in the first place, no sense in keeping that person around anyway right?<br />
<br />
My guild has gotten some new recruits due to folks leaving for other games or just boredom. The recruits we get aren't nearly up to par with what we are tryin to do. I would much rather push them in and get them flagged than do sewers(rondo)/tipt/vxed/ikk4/uqua over and over again. Would be nice to hit time to get them a few upgrades without having to kill all the gods again and hinder those that are coming up.<br />
<br />
your guild has to have done the content already to push them in. No one is getting a free ride to the high end game if you haven't done it already. I don't see the bad side of this other than people thinking they will lose folks to the easy road and who wants a guild hopper in thier ranks anyway?</div></div><hr />

This is in no way addressing the guild's progression through PoP in the form of backflagging.  This is merely silencing angry newbies who are upset that the Time guild they just joined wont kill 8 gods or so to backflag them for elementals which the guild in question may or may not even raid.<br />
<br />
i.e. generating flags that's not needed for the guild, but for people to make xp groups in elementals.<br />
<br />
Great, you can flag people for X elemental plane by killing the resident God.  HOWEVER, isn't the purpose of backflagging elementals to GET the amount of people to kill X God?  If you can muster the forces to kill the God, who the fuck cares about the flags to that plane?<br />
<br />
Again, this address no progression issue. It's just a convenience issue and for whining softcores who want elemental but skipped too much content by joining a Time+ guild.<br />
<br />
If there was a way (like the alternate quests to get to HOH or CoDecay) to flag an individual or a group (again, like HoH/CoDecay's group-flag quest) for an elemental plane or more that didn't involve the plane in question itself, THEN it'd help progression.<br />
<br />
Think like the gate talisman. Require semi-rare drops from either trash mobs or boss-like mobs in a host of pre-elemental zones. Then allow that to generate an access-only flag (again, like HoH/CoDecay ones) for a group of people.<br />
<br />
Maybe like... Have a 100% drop rate item off of RZTW, Solusek Ro, and Lord Mithaniel Marr, maybe Agnarr too.  These are the 4 upper bosses prior to elementals.  So the Guild Leader or Officer or some other guild-designated person can collect these 4 pieces.  Then snag up 5 unflagged people, turn in or do the quest, and flag that group for elementals.  Again, it would be access only. No charm effects, no nothing. <br />
<br />
OR. Make that flag a new type of a flag. a Raid Only  flag.  Meaning you don't have to 85% in, you can enter regardless. But ONLY if you are in a raid (EQ's raid definition via Raid Leadership is 18). So that way they couldn't use the flag for personal use, they have to be in a raid of 18+ people.  But the amount of flagged people in the raid have no bearing since they have the special flag from the quest. Leaving the raid or the raid number going to 17 or below initiates the standard 3 minute boot.<br />
<br />
Something along THOSE lines would help with progression.  The current described thing does absolutely NOTHING for progression or backflags to help progression.  It just tosses out arbitrary flags to people to go XP Group with.  Again, if you can muster the force to kill the God, why in god's name would you need more &quot;Flags&quot;? Maybe I can see 1-5 flags total if 1-5 people couldn't get raided in yet you still have the force.  Either way, you'd have to go agian and kill the god. And you could've just swapped in the people who sat out last time with the people who got it last time.<br />
<br />
The Time one makes more sense though.  From the sound of it its not on Quarm only.  So mustering enough to get to X tier at least yields 3 keys for next run.<br />
<br />
Hell why not do that for elementals? Make elemental bosses drop 1 backflag.  Pops a little projection with 1 flag thats like they say, access only.  No charm upgrade.  May have to tweak which bosses yield one and which dont.  But this WOULD help backflag progression.<br />

<br />
Yeah, you missed one very important fact.  <br />
<br />
Games are supposed to be fun.  When the game stops being fun, people stop playing.  If you try to tell someone to raid in order to progress, and they don't want to, because it's not fun for whatever reason, you're telling them to go play another game.  <br />
<br />
SoE has a massive hard on for making people's lives difficult thru endless bullshit.   Now that there's a brand new competitor on the market who's game is actually fun, they realize that they're going to have to start making some changes to eliminate some of the fucking bullshit, or they're going to lose money.</div></div><hr />

Nor that it was bad.  I simply don't see what it is addressing other than whiners.<br />
<br />
I myself lead a guild in the elementals.  So this change directly applies to me.  As the leader, my mindset is not about &quot;How can I make Member05 feel fluffy and make his individual experience as bright and shiny as possible!&quot;.  My job is, how can I progress the guild and have things be done as a guild.  Not as an individual.<br />
<br />
This proposal promotes the individual and seperates from the guild mindset.  So you softcores and whiners who dont play at all yet feel they deserve elemental access anyways are all offended by my post.<br />
<br />
Not sure why, I didn't argue against it.  I argued for a better solution if what they are indeed intending to fix is backflagging in a progression context.  If they're looking to fix backflagging in an individual xp group softcore mindset, it's on the money.<br />
<br />
Again, I don't see the argument to NOT do this change. I just see the argument that it doesn't do what they're intending.  That it just caters to the softcore who never decided to login enough prior so they can XP and giggle in elementals alone.  That it has a very very minor benefit if any to a guild with progression on their mind.<br />

<br />
Ok I'll address this. My guild is in the elementals. We've just come off a 2 week run of bullshit backflagging to get everybody's alts, friends, and apps toons elemental flagged so they can raid with us. We sometimes have enough players on to gimp a few into fire, other times we don't, but we're still raiding there. If we could get all those apps flagged for fire alone just by doing FR it will 1. give us incentive to do harder content (FR) instead of trivial content(pre-ele pop flagging) and 2. save us from cockblocking the up-and-coming guilds trying to do the same pop progression we're bored of. Usually when we do Gods it's on the weekends and whatnot so we have a lot higher numbers, but they don't always hold out through the week.<br />
<br />
All that being said I'm a little apprehensive about the change because it will suddenly make it that much easier on the guildhoppers of the world since high-end guilds won't need to be so picky about apps since they can flag them so easily. Maybe it won't be an issue, but my fairness sensor is on high alert on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just don't really understand what you and apparently SOE are trying to push with this concept.<br />
<br />
The number one reason you backflag for elementals is to be able to kill their resident god.<br />
<br />
If you have the numbers to do the god(s), backflagging is moot and not needed in the context of guild progression.<br />
<br />
Thus why the proposal given does not assist in anyway with that aspect.<br />
<br />
It *does* help elemental level guilds get XP groups in EP's more easily.  It does NOT help with backflagging.<br />
<br />
Even if you got a newcomer to the guild who needs flagging.  What would a time guild do? 85 him in and get the God piece and say FU we're not killing all of POP again to flag you so you can XP in elementals.<br />
<br />
Basically what i'm saying is any guild who can kill a god, does not need the flags this proposal will give out in a guild sense.  In the sense of helping the guild as a whole, in progressing the guild as a whole.<br />
<br />
It merely helps the individual in XP'ing a bit and farming those 6 mannable drops.  Even then EP Zones are no longer the &quot;uber xp zones&quot; for 2 expansions now.<br />
<br />
SOFTCORE FLUFFY BUNNY DISCLAIMER: Once again so softcores don't piss and moan at my post.  I am not saying they shouldn't add this into game.  There's no reason in my eyes why it would be bad to.  After all, it is beneficial.  The argument is SOE is pushing this as a solution to backflagging woes when it does anything but.<br />

 With EQ2 and WoW grabbing players, and no hint of server consolidation, there may not be a choice - some guilds may lose the ability to clear Time through depletion, and there may be a shortage of 'qualified' toons already to replace them.</div></div><hr />

I would think that the developers understand this and will try to come up with a solution that spreads the wealth.<br />
<br />
2.  One frequent poster stated that this is a game, it is suppose to be fun.  As crazy as that sounds, he is right.   Anything in the game that causes tedium for any player of any level needs to be looked at and adjusted.  <br />
<br />
3.  Not sure about your server, but my server sure seems empty this week.   I believe some of the exodus is temporary, but not all of it.  The player dynamics on all the servers will change.  I am hearing rumours of large guilds taking big hits.  It appears a disproportionate amount of players leaving are the high end ones.  This is not surprsing since I am sure they are ready to move on to something new.  This exodus may make many of the raider VS non raider discusions moot points.   It may end up that many guilds who broke into Time will  loose there ability to back flag.   <br />
<br />
Some smaller or less advanced guilds seem to be taking less hits (including mine).  I believe it is because the players still want to beat the game and progress through it (This is the case with me, I enjoy EQ1, and currently love playing my warrior, and I am happy with how I am progressing, no complaints here.). <br />
<br />
4.  As for the the discusion that pops up in each thread about big raiding guild VS non raiding guild, uber vs casual.  There are valid points on each side, but also a bunch of #$#$@* being posted.  People will play the game the way they want to play it and that should be respected.  It is their choice as this is a game, not work.  Eveyone wants to be rewarded for the time and effort they put into the game.  Many people are in small guilds or non Time flagged guilds by choice, not becasuse they cannot get in a high end guild.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line is that Sony will either have to address the flaging issue, and other issues or huge amounts of content will just go to waste.  EQ1 is changing.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Edit 11/15/04  I am neither for nor against this proposal, I see it as part of the dialogue that is needed to progress to an acceptable one.  I am for easing access to old content to some extent.  Not sure how open flagging raids play into this as many people on my server have gotten most of their flags via open raids (every pop flag I have was gotten this way).   In regards to guild flagging, eveyone needs to keep in mind that many guilds are not permanent, membership shifts, leaders change, etc.)</div></div><hr />

Given that, what would you say to Haas? Haas is by NO means casual. He's one of the most hardcore EQers I've ever met. On the other hand, he doesn't raid. I'm not going to address a lot of the issues in your post, but I demand that you realize that there's difference between hardcore and raider. There are people who work their arses off to progress. In groups. Would you call them softcore because they don't raid? Take a look around you.</div></div><hr />

I agree.  But the proposed changes in no way help with that issue.  Helping guilds who can already kill a god flag for an elemental plane they clearly don't need access to anymore since they are able to slay that god does not assist.<br />
<br />
Chances are the guilds that will be getting these bonus flags are already Time flagged.  This means that those little flags wont even matter.  The only things that matter are the time keys that will drop straight up.<br />
<br />
Again, think it over, use logic.  The proposed change does not address the issue they're pushing it as.  If they want to address that issue, then they should.  But those changes don't.<br />

You seem to have some beef with the fact that people (even in your own guild it would seem) will be able to skip doing all that flagging?  I don't get it.   Did I miss your point?  So what?   <br />
<br />
We're not a mandatory attendance raiding guild.  We like to see as many folks as possible participate in raids.  We have just implemented a policy that we're not looking to go do Teir 1 and some Teir 2 bosses again, unless we're really stuck for attendence or a target.  Without this change, this means some of the more casual players in the guild get stuck not being able to participate in what we're doing.  With this change, they can.  What's the problem?  Pissed off that someone can get past all those crappy raids you had to do?  Did you have to walk uphill both ways in the snow to get to and from school too, grandpa?  :D  Personally I'm happy for them.  PoP flagging has to be the most divisive, (hardcore players vs. casual) stupid assed waste of time SoE ever put in the game.  It forces you to raid a hell of a lot in order to get into zones that you're paying for already.  I know every other expansion had a final keyed zone, but I think its safe to say that its recognized that PoP takes this exclusivity thing way too far.  <br />
<br />
Something like this makes sense.  Its a nice middle ground.  They're not opening up these zones totally like they did BoT and the rest.  (Tho I imagine it'd be an option, and one that I wouldn't really care about.  Just leave it so that you have to do the targets to get into Time.  Or most of your guild does, like with this change.)  You still have to be in a guild that has the major targets done.    <br />
<br />
I can see what you mean about always being able to drag in 15% or whatever it is.  All I can say is that in our case, every time we've done this, we've had to leave people behind.  If this change happens, the folks who come along won't have to be dragged in next time.  Don't underestimate how less of a pain in the butt this will make things. <br />
<br />
Besides, there's still places that people who give a crap about being 'top guild' or whatever can go and feel all uber.  Do other people have to lose out in order for you to feel good?</div></div><hr />

I don't get it. Did I miss your point? So what?<br />
<br />
Yes, you completely missed my point and your entire post you spent talking about something irrelevant that I had already discussed in my post.<br />
<br />
I do want to be able to skip a portion of backflagging.  However, this is not what this proposal does.  All it does is allow you to skip backflagging that does not progress the guild.  Flags you don't need, flags that have no relevance to your progression.<br />
<br />
If you can kill the god, then you won't need more people access to that plane.  Because they already have it.<br />
<br />
You said you were thrilled about it due to your guild almost going elemental, just RZTW short.<br />
<br />
Let me put this into perspective.<br />
<br />
You need to kill Manaetic Behemoth to gain entrance to Plane of Tactics, correct?<br />
<br />
RZTW is in Plane of Tactics.  My guess is you've used 60ish or more against RZTW.  My guess is that you already have flagged everyone you needed to get your entire guild to this zone.  Whether they're already flagged or 85'd in.<br />
<br />
So the setup here is, your guild is in tactics, ready to go attempt RZTW.  Your entire guild online is in there, because well like most guilds in EQ, without YOUR GUILD an attempt at RZTW wouldn't be feasable for you. (Again, don't know your numbers/blah blah this is for explination purpose).<br />
<br />
So let's say 60 people there, 4 are 85'd in, 64 people.<br />
<br />
Now putting this backflag proposal into place.  It's like SOE saying &quot;Sure, backflag help np!&quot; and saying that RZTW now hands out Plane of Tactics flags (Access only, no charm update, etc) for those who aren't Tactics flagged and hail his projection.<br />
<br />
What does this do for your guild? Flags the 4 people for PoTactics you raided in.  Does this help your progression to elementals? No. You already had the numbers to kill RZTW.  With or without those 4 flags you'd be able to do it again.  What did it do? It let those 4 people now able to come XP here in the future.  It did nothing for the progression of the guild.<br />
<br />
Granted if your guild has severely unreliable attendance and you somehow manage to kill RZTW, those 4 flags may help you 85 in some for RZTW next time.  That's the only benefit. HOWEVER<br />
<br />
My argument is that you're not going to attempt RZTW if you have 35 people flagged and 30 people unflagged.  Why? You can't kill RZTW! What do you do? Kill Behemoth until you have the correct numbers to do RZTW! What does this mean? More than likely, your entire guild save for 3-4 people will get Tactics flagged! So what does killing RZTW do for backflags? VIRTUALLY NOTHING!<br />
<br />
My argument in this situation is to move the backflagging elsewhere.  OUT of the zone the flag is for.  Or not for the end boss himself.<br />
<br />
Not the end boss, but remaining in zone:<br />
Such as instead of RZTW giving potactics access in this scenario, having maybe Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek and maybe a rare drop from trash as a quest.  Killing TZ VZ take significantly less than RZTW (especially if you've never won RZTW before).  Allowing you to flag up more for your RZTW attempt while not backtracking severely in progression to backflag.<br />
<br />
Taking it out of the zone:<br />
Imagine then taking out Terris Thule, Grummus, Saryrn, Bertoxxulous.  So four raid-encounters.  Then doing this quest by turning in the pieces dropped by the boss specifically for this quest. (Could be more than 4 and so forth) would flag your group for access-only to plane of tactics (i know there IS only like this for Tactics, but im trying to expand it to be balanced for elemental, trying to explain where im going with this).  Those 4 mobs are probably a bad example.  But my example for what'd you kill for EP access-only was RZTW, Marr, Agnarr, Bert was it? I forget.  So including those top 4 means chances are you wont get these 6 EP flags (flags your group) that are access only unless you already are EP flagged (since RZTW is in there).  And making it 6 at a time makes it to inefficient to try and progress by just killing these 4 gods over and over.  BUT, in the course of your progression you will pickup 1-2 sets of these and that covers backflags for most guilds.  Even then if you're just getting into EP (When you'd NEED backflags) you could still kill those 4 for gear upgrades and it wouldn't be that much of a hassle anyways!<br />
<br />
I hope finally my point has been articulated enough.  That people understand the current proposal does nothing for progression backflagging.<br />

The folks you drag in one time don't have to be dragged in the next time.  That does do something for us.  <br />
<br />
It gets members into the end targets of all this flagging without all of us having to go back and do piles of backflagging.  We're still at the point where one of our goals is to get people flags so they can get into places without being dragged in on a raid.  It will cut down on situations where you ask a question of someone in /gu like &quot;wanna go xp in PoF?&quot; and having them answer &quot;still need Aerin'Dar&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Er no.I'm not saying I agree with the changes, /shrug I usually hate change.However,your theory does not account for attrition.Backflagging is the suck.One of the worst positions a Time guild could find themselves in would be to wake up one day and find themselves without sufficient force to kill EP gods.I have little doubt that many Time enabled guilds have encountered this recently.In fact I know of some.In order to avoid this routine POP backflagging is often carried out.Having to go back and flag up lots of folks from the bottom up can be a drain on morale.Especially with new games competing for their attention.<br />
<br />
Rotations of 85's on EP gods for flagging is quicker and more profitable.Imo probably better for most guilds long term if competition for those gods is not too bad.85'n is the suck mind you.But at least you don't have to play games in Sol Ro this way.Luckily we're going strong.This does seem to have some potential to reduce grief for stressed guilds over time tho.I'm not saying I'm agreeing with the proposal,but, it has it's points.Crazy people made me guild leader awhile back and I gotta say ...backflagging is often the suck and rife with little complications.</div></div><hr />

Read my post.  Again, i'm saying they're peddling this change as a fix for flagging in the context of progression.  They're not saying it's a solution/help for xping.  Again, I never said its not a good and beneficial change.  I'm saying its not changing what they're claiming it changes.  It's doing all but that.<br />

Point made.  I had overlooked that aspect. That definitely is a an assist to a guild to help them from falling back.  But like I said, it's still not in the context of progression.  It's in the context of preventing regression.  But yes, that's another plus point for this change.<br />

<br />
I am ele/time flagged and in a post-time guild.  I realize that these flags being given away are flags that I once worked hard for.  However I feel this change is a good and sensible one.<br />
<br />
1. This will benefit the playerbase as a whole.  <br />
<br />
It opens up content to some people who might otherwise not see it.  If you look at other mmo's that have died down, i.e. Asheron's call, you'll notice similar patterns.  As the game grows older, and it's lifespan gets shorter, higher end content becomes more accessible to  players who would not have experienced it otherwise.  This is normal progression for a mmo nearly 6 years old.  This is something that will benefit the average player in a lower guild who wants to join a high end raiding guild but lacks both the flags, and means to get them under the current system. KT &amp; ele planes are pretty vacant these days as far as exp groups go, so no loss to the raiders there, and while a casual may be able to zone into PoTime, he's not getting anything done without a competent raid force.<br />
<br />
2. This will benefit the higher-end guilds.  <br />
<br />
No more backflagging.  No enormous time consuming WAVES of backflagging when people leave to play new mmo's that are coming out.  No more backflagging clerics because they get burned out (they do) end game clerics leave at 2-3 times the rate of other players because of the sheer insanity of running chain after chain after chain and never being able to go afk (safely) during raid hours.   Recently, 60% of my guild's clerics left within 2 weeks of each other, and it set us back about 2 months progression wise.  Never again, bring the cleric recruit to time and set him loose like a kid in a candy store.   This is a godsend.<br />
<br />
That's my take.</div></div><hr />

Thats all I can see happening with this change too.  You still need to get by the massive numbers cock block no matter what so not much changes for the lil guys.  Now if they actually implement quest access to the 4 EP zones, perhaps that would make a difference.  Even still, its a day late and a dollar short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sucana</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider a strong raiding guild which fields a force of 25 to 40, on rare occasion 50.  We have actually killed fennin twice with those numbers, but we usually don't have the force to attempt elemental gods, and several top players have retired, and a few have gone to the uberguild. <br />
<br />
What do we get out of this backflagging?  Does it help us get recruits into the elemental planes if we want more elemental armor molds?  Let me think.  NO.  <br />
<br />
If the goal is to allow raiding guilds to bring in recruits slowly and have them flagged in the content they are currently raiding, then any mini which drops an elemental mold should also drop a flag.</div></div><hr />

Which is fine since PoTime is candyland for new recruits.  40-45 drops in about 4 hours.  Good enough to make the new guys functional, fast.  Reflagging GoD isn't such a big deal as going back to EP's and getting apps earth b access then killing all 4 ele gods.<br />

Didn't say it would benefit EP and below guilds.  EP really isn't considered end-game content any more.  This will help Time+ guilds get people geared up fast, and help people to get into those guilds.  It opens up higher content to some that may not experience it otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And where are those people going to come from? I'll tell you where. They're going to come from the mid level guilds like mine, the people who are sick of flagging new recruits for EP zones and see an easier way to get into time by joining the Time+ guild that can gimp them in and get them flagged. I'll say it again, unless the EP flag comes off something other than Fennin, Xegony, TRC and Coirnav this will destroy MANY mid level guilds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sucana</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, I can't see any justification for providing Kod'Taz backflagging, when it can only be obtained by a single group, anyway, when there is no backflagging help for elemental guilds.  This is a case of requiring major guild effort on trivial raid targets for some kinds of backflagging, while granting flags to people who want to skip single group flagging runs. <br />
<br />
For the mid-level guild hitting elemental targets, there is NO help with backflagging here.  We're not asking for any easier means of progression.  We can progress ourselves just fine.  We just need a little assist with the backflagging.  <br />
<br />
Much of the backflagging effort used to be covered by &quot;pick up raids&quot; which we sent our recruits to, and sometimes assisted.  Of course, we would still have to do some of the harder mobs ourselves, as the pickup raids are too weak to handle them, but now pickup raid backflagging is dead.  There are none, and we aren't going to do them, either.<br />
<br />
Is this backflagging solution supposed to be a way to allow guilds to maintain their current progression?  If YES then there must be elemental flag drops on mold-dropping minis.  They can only be obtained by a small raid force of 85% flagged.  If NO then don't even bother with bullshit like &quot;1. This will benefit the playerbase as a whole.  It opens up content to some people who might otherwise not see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
ps, to Morf:<br />
You completely missed the point of the previous poster.  I don't entirely agree with the doom and gloom aspect, but his position was that the mid level guilds need the backflag love too, or there won't be mid-level guilds.  Thus, &quot;where they are coming from currently&quot; will be dead.  You failed to read the post, because you thought it was a &quot;whaa, I can't get a flag, gimmie&quot; post, maybe?<br />
<br />
The current state of the game is more likely to favor applicants with single-group obtainable gear (which is  competitive with mid-level raider gear) but who have never raided, and thus will either not know what to do, or will not want to raid.  They might have some mid-level raid gear from ebayed accounts or pickup, but they often lack the discipline and experience of the smaller but successful guilds.</div></div><hr />

Therefore, eliminating the need to assemble the majority of the guild (or a large number of people) to do EP god content  is helping the guild progress because it frees them to raid in PoTime or Ikkinz or wherever.  <br />
<br />
It *directly* benefits the few people who missed the prior flagging raids, but it *indirectly* benefits the rest of the guild by not asking them to repeat god raids over and over and over again, ad nauseum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
couple of things stand out <br />
<br />
Firstly   Casual Vs Raider <br />
<br />
Question does any casual player out there think they deserve the same reward as someone who plays 30 hours a week ? <br />
<br />
this is not having a go at casual players , this is just a question about work =reward <br />
<br />
Question 2, Progression , think first about question one , Then :- <br />
<br />
if you are a member of a guild that doesnt spend X hours a week killing XYZ , should you expect the reward granted to a guild that does ? surely ( to set the cat amongs the pigeons) if you don't , then , you don't .<br />
<br />
What flags mean to the players as a whole is simple with regards to progression , without progression , why bother to play in other then a social aspect ?<br />
<br />
simple fact is that these 'flagging arrangements ' do very little for anyone . least of all the hardcore raider who still needs to have 85 % able to get into a zone before they can add a couple of chars to access ,<br />
<br />
  &quot; I'm a casual player , i play mebbe three nights a week with a few friends , i enjoy the game , but i'm frustrated that i don't have the gear that raiders do , BUT i have three times the AA , surely i deserve something ?&quot;<br />
<br />
you do , you have three times the AA , and with the latest expansions you can get a lot of gear from the content that is designed for single group progression, it seems to be possible between Ldon and later expansions to really rock  :cool:  and thats wihout having to try and get 60 plus rampant extroverts to agree to do the same thing at once regardless of LD , attitude adjustment , egotistical opportunists and possible incompetence hithertoo hidden by numbers <br />
<br />
there are single group rewards (and flags ) that are accessible in more recent content , that raiders are proud to own  too  :                                         Qestion three , Is my guild Selfish ?The Diaspora has seen the guild I play with reduced from 70 time flagged to 20  :( , we are now allied with our ( long ago VT SSRA early POP content ) rivals who have seen similar player losses ,THE GREAT SOLUTION TO TIME BACKFLAGS . er , Nope not a bean  we have formed flag alliances with some of the top end guilds still playing so that we backflag their applicants , alts WHY , and can possibly get one or two of ours flagged in return .<br />
<br />
18 months ago we finally killed RZTW , to become elemental flagged for most of our guild , about 9 months ago we became Time flagged .<br />
 and now , we cant even get to phase two, and the current flagging arrangement is of no help to us , as a guild Or as an alliance in anyway with regards to progression ,so of course REGARDLESS , we will still be killing Quavonis Firetail and the other budgies to gear up ours and our allies equipment regardless of whether any smaller guild is in dire need , just as we will be trying to kill the EP Gods whenever we think we might just have a chance of doing so <br />
<br />
so the question is , Are we selfish , or just doing what's necessary to survive as a viable guild , we can tread water , personally i havent gained any progression at all for about 6 months other then looting Velitorkins Femur to replace my BOC , but i now am on first name terms with Criare Sunmane ( he's Charming , Really  :p )but it all needs to be worked on to see the reward <br />
<br />
<br />
So do i feel disgruntled if someone who plays half the time i do has a better reward ? actually i don't , i'm happy for them , after all , they are a possible recruit or EXP group member , the only thing that i find upsetting is when people who will NOT accept what is available to them then WHINE about others that work for their rewards , if i see a &quot;Casual&quot; player doing well it's Grats bro , nice gear ,&quot;  etc etc <br />
i KNOW that they've worked for it and earned it <br />
<br />
if i see a player of ANY description whining because XYZ can get ABC if they go do 123 , but i can only PMS , then i can only ask <br />
<br />
  &quot; Are you in the right game?&quot; <br />
<br />
GET OFF YOUR BUTT and EARN your reward , and believe me , you'll feel a whole lot better for it :)</div></div><hr />

I don't think casual vs raider was ever really the debate for 90% of the non-uber raider people that have posted here on the subject.  The debate was the rewards for uber-raider versus non-uber-raider.  For example, take 2 people that both play 40 hours/week - one is in an uber raiding guild and the other is not.  They both put in the same amount of time, but the reward per hour played are substantially for the player in the uber raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

I think this is an important distinction.  I am a &quot;hardcore&quot; player in terms of time and effort, but not in an uber-guild.<br />
<br />
The true definition of &quot;casual&quot; is someone who plays less than xx hours a week (not sure where the line would be drawn on the xx).<br />
<br />
For those of us who put in major hours, but not in high-end raiding guild the argument of &quot;get off your butt and work for it&quot; crumbles.  1-2 group encounters in OoW and instanced zones have been a boon.</div></div><hr />
