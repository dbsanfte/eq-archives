<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">More players group in LDoN than in any other environment. LDoN Easy is selected by the majority of these groups. LDoN is the only source of certain spells and all augments.<br />
<br />
LDoN is a timed event. Players are motivated to complete an adventure as quickly as possible. Even if they complete too quickly to start a new adventure immediately, the down time can be used for other purposes.<br />
<br />
Excess survivability is not required in LDoN. Any tank capable of absorbing the rather low damange produced by LDoN mobs without being a burden to heal can MT.<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro control was perceived as a deficiency in LDoN. Let's assume that the new Provoke Ability Line makes Warrior aggro control acceptable. Let's also assume that no benefit is gained by greater then acceptable aggro control.<br />
<br />
If Warriors are acceptable MT's in LDoN based on adequate survivability and aggro control, what motivates groups to select them when other classes also meet these criteria?<br />
<br />
DPS, Disciplines, and power-ups.<br />
<br />
Lets rate Warriors based on additional attributes that assist a group in completing an LDoN adventure efficiently.<br />
<br />
Warrior - 100 DPS, marginal effects from disciplines and power-ups<br />
<br />
Paladin - 85 DPS, buffs, heals, Root, ranged aggro on demand <br />
<br />
Shadow Knight - 105 DPS, snare, FD, ranged aggro on demand<br />
<br />
Ranger - 105 DPS, snare, Root, light heals, ranged aggro on demand<br />
<br />
Beastlord - 110 DPS slow, snare, Root, ranged aggro on demand<br />
<br />
Looking at this (and feel free to correct it), my perception is that when selecting a MT to do LDoN Easy, Warrior desireability will be very dependent on the impact of their power-ups.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly warrior desirability is not about what you may or may not have, it's all about perception.  If warriors are still percieved as weak then desirability will be low, otherwise i would suspect warrior desirability should increase some just based on the fact we are getting some new abilities.  Doesn;t really matter because in LDoN normal I think we could have chanters tanking all the mobs effectivly hehehe; it's all just about who you can round up, not who is the &quot;best&quot;.  I would think warriors would be highly sought after though because our DPS s fairly good for a tank class, and btw Rangers . . . tanking . . . . you can;t be serious . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>solinear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Beastlord - 110 DPS slow, snare, Root, ranged aggro on demand<br />
<br />
Um... my main is a 65 Beastlord.  No snare, no root.  Yes, I have ranged aggro and if I'm really psycho, I can pull aggro from an SK.<br />
<br />
However, my DPS is not 110, if you want to compare me to an equivalent Warrior doing 100 DPS, I'll be closer to about 125, not including my pet.  Add in my pet and I'll be closer to around 185.  I can push it up to around 210 to 215 DPS by adding in Ferocity and my discipline (forget the name, adds 350 attack and caps haste for a short time), but mostly I'm sitting around 150 with the gear that I've got right now, including my pet.  100DPS for a warrior is pretty darn good, they're looking at being Elemental, or very close to it, by the time they're doing that kind of DPS.<br />
<br />
My pet *does* have a snare proc that I can waste AAs... er... get if I want, but I know 3 BSTs that have it and they have all said to not bother with it.  My pet has a much more useful proc that stuns mobs for around 3 seconds every time it goes off and it goes off a LOT, so any mob's DPS will be reduced by around 25-30% if it is vulnerable to stuns and that's not including my 65% slow (only 10% less than Shammy slow).<br />
<br />
Tanking?  Maybe PoV with 100+ AAs.  I'm not there yet though, only at ~70 right now.<br />
<br />
Just curious, what the hell is a &quot;power up&quot; for a warrior?  Don't tell me you're counting anything that an equivalent geared tank of another class would have at the same level.  Not many &quot;power ups&quot; that I can think of that Warriors get pre-Time/Elemental that I don't get.<br />
<br />
BTW: Rangers at the point where they are doing 100+ DPS melee (what moron ranger at that point is meleeing again?), won't be able to take the damage the mobs are dealing even as well as my BST can.  They have about 10 seconds of tanking that is called &quot;Weapon Shield&quot;, then they start casting their rangergate, unless someone else pulls aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd be more worried about the monks tanking, since their DPS is higher than mine without pet (they can hit around 150+), as is their mitigation.  What do Monks bring?  FD pulling.  Of course, about the time they pull with FD, the rest of the group is hurting and they have no aggro generation beyond their very impressive DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Warrior - 100 DPS, marginal effects from disciplines and power-ups&quot;<br />
<br />
I think you really have to wait and see the changes live before you characterize warriors like you do above.<br />
<br />
You already classify effects from disciplines as marginal. And yet you don't know how the new system will affect the use of disciplines. What may have once been marginal, may now be quite useful.<br />
<br />
The biggest limiting factor on discs was that melee classes saved theirs up for some phantom time when they would absolutely HAVE to have the active.<br />
<br />
Monks would save stonestance for when pulls went bad. Warriors would save defensive for bosses, nameds, or some other oddity.<br />
<br />
And thus, the end result, neither class would use their discs regularly.<br />
<br />
The change to discs, is intended to get us to actually break that habit and use our discs. Use them even in casual XP group situations. <br />
<br />
So, give em a chance before you write them off.<br />
<br />
In regards to the power-ups ... well two of them already demonstrate a LOT of potential for the warrior class.<br />
<br />
Increased mitigation will help in XP groups a LOT. Even just 5%. It's noticable. And it's something a warrior can point to and say &quot;Well, I take LESS damage than Knight_01.&quot;<br />
<br />
That helps with both the perception issue and with the actual data of the situation.<br />
<br />
Then there's Provoke. Which I assume you classify in the power-up category ... BUT, if on your list you're going to have these other classes with &quot;ranged aggro on demand&quot; you need to really give credit where credit is due.<br />
<br />
Provoke is, also, ranged aggro on demand.<br />
<br />
So I would just hold off on classifying and quantifying warrior desirability in LDoN at least for a few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Err where's this huge obsession with Beastlord power?  I have never met a Beastlord that does anywhere close to my damage.  Of course my server doesn't have any Time capable Beastlords as far as I know (they're either a twink or they quit).  Have you ever sen a low end Beastlord playing the slower?  They don't even get to melee, they just stick a slow and then start medding.  And cast the Ferocity line?  Forget it.  As bad as mudflation is, we haven't quite yet reach the time where every hybrid off the street is pulling in super DPS with infinite mana regen.  <br />
<br />
Aside from enchanters, pure melees still rule LDoN by far.  Yeah you can't screw up as much, but then you could just replace a caster with a Paladin too and then no one has to worry about messing up.  A group like Paladin Warrior Warrior as DPS is usually more effective than say Warrior Caster Caster for all practical purposes.  Of course, it's really not important what a class is capable of doing as opposed to what people thinks.  If LDoN works by the way of having most effcieint groups every group ought to be shaman + 5 melee (ignoring charm for the moment).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and btw Rangers . . . tanking . . . . you can;t be serious . . . <br />
<br />
Well-equipped ones with the proper AA's do just fine.  I've seen a ranger tank hard mode before.  It isnt as efficient as a knight or a war tanking but the mission was a success.<br />
<br />
I don't expect rangers to use bows in LDON due to close quarters and terrain that includes lots of walls rocks etc.<br />
<br />
A war is a nice asset to an LDON hardmode.  Easy is easy, a lot of classes can tank easy.  Hell I heard of a BST tanking hardmode and they nearly won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Truth is a bst can tank on easy mode, at least with the right aa's . . . but why would you want to . . . same with the ranger.<br />
<br />
When's the last time a warrior lost the MT position to a BST or a Ranger?<br />
<br />
This whole &quot;preference&quot; thing is just silly.  I don;t find it that hard to find a group in LDoN easy or hard . . . and i am not in elemental gear or with 200+ aa's.    I rarely do pickup groups anyhow, because of the moron factor, and SoE can;t &quot;fix&quot; that problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's this monk I know, named Wubao, who's 5-0 tanking LDoN easy adventures.<br />
<br />
And he's pretty gimp.<br />
<br />
If he can tank, certainly any self-respecting beastlord/ranger/whatever can tank in LDoN. And many do.<br />
<br />
Phantron, you raise some interesting points about the usefulness of melees in LDoN, but I also think you get at the underlying point of what makes LDoN so much fun for a lot of people ... which Tharak states in his post above: &quot;This whole &quot;preference&quot; thing is just silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason you don't see 5 DPS + 1 Shaman in LDoN is because it's not about efficiency. You can go in with odd, less efficient groupings, and still win.<br />
<br />
And whether you finish your adventure in 30 minutes or 89 minutes, you get the same amount of points. <br />
<br />
Now, one could say that the 30 minute group is cruising through 3 wins while the other group has just one, but, we all know how time works in EQ.<br />
<br />
People have to leave after just one adventure. There's some shuffle here, shuffle there. People AFK for a bit. Etc. Etc. Etc.<br />
<br />
And the groups that POWER through LDoN, well, they're so well geared, and so well focused on powering through like 5 to 10 wins in a night, that again, efficiency falls by the wayside to a degree.<br />
<br />
So far, I've been rather happy with the way LDoN has aged. There's been less of a shift to &quot;we need X&quot; than there was in PoP.<br />
<br />
That's a good thing.<br />
<br />
But also, don't sell beastlords short. In LDoN, they're pretty damn powerful. They tear through stuff. Pet classes are good in LDoN. Melee classes are good in LDoN. Slowers are helpful in LDoN. Spot heals. They even pull very well with the right AAs. They kick some serious LDoN buttocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Beastlords are pretty powerful when they don't need to slow.  From what I've observed on random pickup groups, a Beastlord playing slower simply does not contribute very much damage and is certainly worse than a shaman in that respect.  Like I said, there are really no high end Beastlord I'm aware of on my server, but I'm sure with FT15/focus/etc a Beatslord can pump out some pretty amazing damage while slowing and so on.  But that's a high end one.  Maybe a one loaded with +mana buffs would do but LDoN isn't really about finding all the possible +mana buff before doing anything.  In the time it takes you to find the most efficient group and get all your buffs, you could've done a mission with a less than perfect group running without all the buffs.  I also don't understand why people would reject certain classes.  The time you lose by say taking an extra cleric for DPS instead of someone who really does damage is usually offset by the time it'd take to actually find a DPS person.  There are times I'm sure the group would've finished an adventurer earlier with just 5 people instead of looking for a 6th.<br />
<br />
I really can't imagine Beastlords out tanking monks on LDoN.  The high end monks basically don't take damage from LDoN trash if you just rotate Stonestance and Mend (and let anyone else tank when those run out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Phantron, <br />
<br />
I think you are selling Bst's short.  I play nightly with a bst he does the pulling and slowing (initially) and then I tank the mobs.  He doesn;t have all the &quot;best&quot; gear, but his gear doesn;t exactly suck either.  He has about 200ish aa, and can tank pretty well.  He plays well, and we always finish with around 30 - 50 minutes lef ton the clock (depending on zone, and mission).  I don;t know which bst's you are playing with, but I like having my buddy in the group for many reasons beyond his sense of humor.  Does he MT . .  no, sometimes he offtanks, sometimes he tanks while i get something from the fridge.  The beauty of LDoN is if 6 people work well as a team you are going to do well . . . it's less dependant on having the right classes as much as people who know how to play their classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, Phantron himself admits he's not that familiar with high end beastlords, as there just aren't too many he's grouped with on h is server.<br />
<br />
But in essence we three have all pretty much said the same thing about beastlords and LDoN and grouping and stuff. There may be a matter of degrees here, but I dunno, from what I read we all seem to be in agreement for the most part.<br />
<br />
That's a rarity on a message board. <br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heheh <br />
<br />
aye we do agree ;-)<br />
<br />
I think the real beauty of LDoN is that to be honest when forming groups up we take who we want reguardless if it fits the magical formula of the &quot;best&quot; group.  2-3 warrior, 2 shaman, no tanks, heck what ever you get throw it at the normal mob's and it'll probably be ok if the people can play well.  <br />
<br />
Of course if you ebayed your character . . . well i think there's another thread around here devoted to that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My fastest group so far = Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, Beast, Warrior, Cleric.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">no group I have ever seen can beat the 3 druid chanter warrior cleric group I ran in... completed 3 missions in under 19 minutes each.... long ass wait before we could take another mission lol.<br />
<br />
As to being selected as a tank in LDoN missions, I can pull off 110 dps constantly, and can hold consistant agro.  I may not be nearly as uber as some of the warriors out there, but with 8700 hps raid buffed I can hold my own when tanking in LDoN, even on hard.  As a whole, I have NEVER heard anyone complain about my agro keeping capability, and I often get invited back to group with people multiple times because they remember me.<br />
<br />
So whats the point of what he's saying, you ask?  No, I'm not trying to beat my own chest.  What I am trying to say is that I consider these recent warrior changes more of a bonus than something that is owed to me.  When I join pickup groups it's usually &quot;damn, you hold agro this well now, just think of how awesome it will be when warriors get revamped!!&quot;, and I agree with them.  I don't know Battleblade, maybe you cannot get groups atm in LDoN because your server is different from mine.  But I am not going to be relying at all on how &quot;good&quot; the warrior revamps are, nor is it going to trouble me too badly if they aren't what everyone is cracking them up to be.  I'll keep getting groups anyway, and so will other warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well Grendon,<br />
<br />
Yes, I'll still be playing and still /lfg and grouping even after these changes. And if a Paladin is in my group, he'll still be MTing. And when I join groups the Enchanter will still say the SK is MTing. And I'll still pay the same money each month as they do.<br />
<br />
The day after the changes is death day for my 53 Paladin unless (cackle insanely) my 65 Warrior can handle three blue mobs easier than he can when he MT's in a group. A week later, my inactive 62 SK account goes too.<br />
<br />
Ya see, I'm not blowing smoke. I play a Paladin alt and I know the difference between a Porche and a Model T with doodads welded on it by bicycle-shop repairmen.<br />
<br />
If Knights want to call it class jelousy, fine. But I know, they know, and Enchanters know that they out tank me in experiance groups and that a 30 second reuse aggro DoT isn't going to change it.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">BB, I am not sure what your issues are, but I share similar experiences to Gren.  I usually get comments on how well i can hold aggro.  I went on vacation for a week and my usual group rejoiced at my returning . . . they had a paly in my abscence (from outside our guild) who left a bad taste in their mouth.  I do not have overly uber gear, heck i only have 7600hp buffed but I definetly don;t have the problems you have.  I can't pull up your magelo, but what the heck are you using for aggro, and is it augmented?  I don;t want to trivialize your issues, but I am not having that bad of issues now, and the new abilities are looking mighty nice to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I frequently group with knights and the only times I am not MT is when I feel like cruising for an adventure.  A paladin not tanking can use their mana for heals, and SK not tanking can use their mana for DPS rather than agro / FD pull.  <br />
<br />
If a warrior is grouping with a knight unless the knight has superior gear then the warrior should tank.  Work together - have the knight agro the mob on inc and then the warrior taunt it off them for agro, then the knight is freed up to use their utility and the warrior has the agro bump that saves the slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tharak,<br />
<br />
10174HP's Edge of Eternity/BoC both augmented with Anger III.<br />
<br />
And I tell you true. With a Paladin in the group, regardless of equipment, he MT's either automatically or by direct Enchanter request in /groupsay.<br />
<br />
Now, the very best Paladins cheat this like crazy because it's patently nuts. They wait for me to assist and move on to a second mob. Or they just let me poach aggro and take the beating while they are freer to do other stuff. With 5+ in camp, they stun, Root, and toss light heals while I hit Defensive, AE Taunt, and multi-tank anything still moving.<br />
<br />
Now I don't mind sharing MT opprotunities in groups or in raids - in fact, I think it's fair - Knights are tanks and should MT often. But I most certainly mind knowing that if I'm trying to get some AP's in MM and I and a Paladin are lfg, IF I get a group (someone wants two tanks for some inexplicable reason) then he is MTing.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">All i gotta say BB is WOW!<br />
<br />
Maybe the problem only surfaces at the high end of the game, but from where I sit I am not having issues.  I also never group outside of guild unless i feel like getting a root canal done.  The chanters in my guild prefer my over knights unless it's one who has vastly superior gear.  <br />
<br />
I still have to say though . . . in LDoN normal anyone can tank . . . and i mean anyone.  If the chanters you group with have an issue with warriors tanking it's a personal issue, and there is nothing SoE can do to patch that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You know, if I'm in an LDoN group with a warrior and a paladin or a warrior and an SK ... I usually pull enough mobs to keep them BOTH tanking.<br />
<br />
And we usually win quicker.<br />
<br />
So, uh ... everyone's usually happy.<br />
<br />
Just a thought to keep in mind there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If your Enchanter demands having a Paladin to tank you would be wiser not to group with the Enchanter since there's a good chance the Enchanter will killed at the wrong time and possibly endangering the success of the mission.  A somewhat selfish policy that works pretty well when playing with Enchanters is only have them slow if they plan to be taking damage (and for bosses).  For 10K+ HP warriors slowing mobs with Enchanter is just a waste of time and mana.  The Enchanter is almost certainly going to get aggroed at some point and the mana you save by healing less because the mob is slower is lost from healing the Enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">ditto to what Phantron said.<br />
<br />
I think you just need to hang out with different people bro.  Besides the day is coming when paly stuns will get nerfed (or as i would put it fixed) to fair levels of aggro.  I cannot imagine that you are having aggro issues with your weapons, because All I swing is a GSoT and the enchanter, cleric, shaman I group with all think I am the best thing since sliced bread (and the melee changes are not even in yet?!).  Every once and a great while my chanter will get hit when i one taunt a mezed mob in LDoN then I /shield and get on with it. I don;t know though, sounds to me like the chanters you group with are reading to many message boards how warriors suck; get new chanters ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Phantron, for that kind of play I wouldnt bother with a chanter in the first place, get a shaman for AE slow and rock the place.<br />
Beastlords are quite capable of tanking, the 2 beastlords in my old guild on terris are both about 7k hp raid buffed and can tank in elementals just fine(and that was without elemental gear at the time).<br />
Due to lack of debuffs they might have more trouble landing their slow (depending on group setup) but agro is never an issue with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">True Gnomb. I often hear BST's are very effective in LDoN as are Paladins and in the undead zones - Necros.<br />

The truth is that I can do OK in LDoN and if I can find a pickup group that is only looking for a 6th I'm hired.<br />

Otherwise, the min/maxers have many better choices than a Warrior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Enchanters are used in LDoN for DPS via charm.  If you want crowd control, get a bard instead.  If you want slow, get a shaman instead.  It's not like you need to mez mobs when they're all 75% slowed anyway.  In almost all of my groups the efficiency goes up whenever you go from an enchanter slowing mobs to not slowing the mob (assuming normal, on Hard slow is necessary for efficiency).<br />
<br />
I'd prefer a shaman over a Beastlord unless you know of a high end one since low end Beastlords can't do much beyond just slowing mobs due to mana limitation.  Paladins are probably a bit too good in LDoN due to 2 out of 5 zones being mostly undead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I swear, some people are so caught up with having the most efficient grouping that they actually take longer to set it up than it would take to just go with whatever you have and give it your best. I can tank everything in LDoN &quot;normal&quot; completly unhasted and the mobs not being slowed. Hell, I can tank 2-3 at a time. Its not that hard. <br />

I've done it with 5 melee + one healer before, and while we didnt get it done in record time, we still did it and everyone had a blast.</div></div><hr />

That is SOOOOOOOOO freakin true! And has been for awhile now. People would justify that behavior in PoP because of the high damage of the mobs. Heh.<br />
<br />
But that behavior's been infecting grouping for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I remember in my 40s, it was different. It was just round up 5 or 6 people, try and get at least one healer and go kill stuff.<br />
<br />
LDoN is so much fun because you CAN do that again. Round up some people. And go to town. But people still waste tons of time trying to be super efficient. Sort of an oxymoron.</div></div><hr />

I don't know much of anything for level 60+ LDoN, but me, at level 55, have got more LDoN groupings on ARo than anything else. Sometimes I even get groups within minutes now.<br />

I swear, some people are so caught up with having the most efficient grouping that they actually take longer to set it up than it would take to just go with whatever you have and give it your best. I can tank everything in LDoN &quot;normal&quot; completly unhasted and the mobs not being slowed. Hell, I can tank 2-3 at a time. Its not that hard. <br />

AMEN Renix!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Even at level 65 that is my experience with LDoN Normal, heck we've gone for 10 - 15 min streches in an adventure while the cleric is LD wacking away at mobs with on a BST giving spot heals here and there.</div></div><hr />

In the about 150 adventures i did (106 on my warrior but most 6 weeks ago or  longer) I havent seen a single chanter use his charm in LDoN.<br />
I have seen Mages charm the stones in NRo adventures but truth being told it was more of a hindrance than a boon with charm breaking at the most inconvenient times.<br />
And the kind of groups i was usually in didnt need the added dps to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Then after a bit I realized I had heard the same Mage /oocing for a group in 3 different zones for the last hour.<br />

Don't kid yourself, we all min/max when given the chance. We look for /lfg guildmates to fill slots and then prefered classes. Some will go overboard insisting on a Cleric even if it takes 10 minutes to find one and others will say &quot;Grab the Druid.&quot; and others even &quot;Two Paladins is enough healing, grab the Pally.&quot;.<br />

If you've the DPS not to need a charmed pet then the Enchanter really wasn't needed in the group to begin with because you can most likely just burn through any bad pulls with DPS (though Takish might be an exception).  I don't see very many Bards either, just saying Bards in general would be better if you need a CC person than Enchanters in LDoN due to their versatility.  Charm is huge DPS and it's pretty safe assuming your group actually knows what's going on.  Of course I've seen Paladins that don't stun the mob that just broke charm and they need me to try to taunt the mob off (can't attack since they'll try to mez the ex-charmed mob first) instead so yes it can be a hindrance if your group doesn't know what they're doing, and I've seen plenty of groups where that is true.  Charm is absolutely vital to win for some hard missions depending on your group setup (namely any non heavy melee DPS groups).<br />
<br />
I'd probably prefer a Bard over an Enchanter on Hard if I can only have one.  I'd rather have both of course but an Enchanter can't charm easily without Malosinia (pet breaks becomes fatal on Hard especially without a competent stunner) whereas a Bard can still do everything (provided they're good, of course).</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, if you have problems gettin LDoN groups something is wrong.  Make your own groups, late at night or not you can find people around.  I made a pickup group today made entirely of unguilded people or in guilds I had never heard of before... the result?  Two victories in a combined 74 minutes.  I mean sure we often try and get really good groups together, but as it was most eloquently said earlier that is a waste of time on normal difficulty LDoN.<br />
<br />
If you are worried about gettin crappy folks in a LDoN group, do what I do:  Grab a couple people you know you can count on, and then fill it in with people you've never heard of.  Some are bad, some are good, but since you have at least a couple good folks you can squeak out the mission.  Next time they are LFG you will have heard of them, and you know whether or not to grab them.  It is truly amazing the number of good people I meet daily that I have never heard of before.  As the list of good folks gets bigger, making groups gets easier, and often times I get several tells from people within minutes of logging on, saying &quot;If you get a group together in the next hour or so, you can count me in&quot;.  Nothing beats gettin a group together in 5 minutes without even having to consult the LFG chart.</div></div><hr />
