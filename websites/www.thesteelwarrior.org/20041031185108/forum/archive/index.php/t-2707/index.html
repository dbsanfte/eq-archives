<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bashemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your armor for your lvl looks good.<br />
<br />
my advice for an upgrade would be an Earring of the Solstice or a Vashir claw earring for your ear slot, and maybe the Draconic Pauldron quest for a little better shoulder peice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valkir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A good mix of things;  that neck piece I have never heard of.  Looks interesting;  I'll have to go research it :)<br />
The face piece could use an upgrade, then just bag the silvery mask for its spell when needed.  Death Mask of the Elysians is one good choice, and not too terribly expensive if you are already kitting-out in Underfoot gear. I still like the cobalt arms, because the lesser shield spell adds to many buffs, and if for some reason I am not in a big group (light soloing, duo-boxed) the buff combined with the cobalt arms makes for better stats than Champions or Underfoot.<br />
If you have access to the pirates of Ykesha, get a charm.  Brotherhood one is straightforward, if not too exciting, and you can still XP here.<br />
Picking up the Shrunken Goblinskull earring would be a good investment in time/money, for its insta-right-click.<br />
<br />
Hope there is a good story to tell on your wearing that Cloak of Flames ;)<br />
<br />
The sooner you can reach 1200AC unbuffed (or self buffed) the sooner you can begin to concentrate on HP/STA gear! :)<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
