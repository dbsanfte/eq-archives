<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiriak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for some suggestions on where to power level my 52 Warrior. He has good equipment and fine weapons. The 65 shammy has very nice gear and 86 AA's... Thanks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">City of mist is probably still good at 52 in the very back near the black reavers.  If that doesnt work try karnor's castle or sebilis.  Kunark zones really have insanely easy mobs compared to the later expansions and you can get pretty damn good xp in some of those zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>meatshieldd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if your warrior has good gear as you say and the shammy can keep up with heals ....i would give GE a shot......first pull kinda sucks  cause you will get adds but if you can clear that first room out without wiping you should be pretty well off........all you gotta do after you clear the first room is wait for repops......pretty easy imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Howling Stones.  Early mobs (basement/north/west) are in the 40's.  Deeper mobs (south/east) are in the 50's.  Very easy for their level, and great zone XP mod.  Just have your shaman make a gate potion for the warrior, or plan to reach the exit portal at the end of south wing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Melanii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also play a warrior and shaman combo. They have always been of a similar level, i.e. I didn't play the shaman to PL the warrior. When they reached level 53 I took them to the basement in Plane of Justice (also known on my server as Mauvin's room or the punisher/enforcer camp). I farmed ethereal parchments for my shaman (had ~30 by the time he reached level 61) and other drops (diamonds, enforcer stones, etc) and made quite a bit of PP. The strategy to use is simple - shaman casts root on one mob, wqarrior gets aggro on the other mob, shaman slows warriors target, shaman slows rooted target. Rinse and repeat as you work your way down the room. My warrior and shaman weren't twinked and they were able to stay at this camp for many hours at a time (without a Virtue/Symbol/Po9 ac/hp buff or KEI).<br />
<br />
As you have a 65 shaman this camp should be very easy. The XP is great because you don't have to hunt for mobs and the respawn time is ~12-14 minutes.<br />
<br />
When I go back to this camp to help friends complete PoJ trials I am amazed at how quickly I can clear this room by myself. I used to clear 8-10 mobs before the first one would respawn. Nowadays I can kill them all including the guardian at the end and still have time to rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With that combo you would do great in KC, just fight your way to LCY and hold there, should be able to lvl pretty fast. When the exp there drops off head to PoN, try to get the Hedge camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go straight to CoM, its the fastest PL anywhere for what you are doing. I PL'd my war from 44 to 61 in no time (also did the same with a monk and rogue). Get the castle key of the named trash green skeleton mob, head to the back &quot;gazebo&quot; area and kill everything. You won't see any light blues until he hits 57 then you can head upstairs for great XP up to 61. I killed everything in the zone except Lhranc with my 61 war and 65 shaman. Kill all the reavers for jade reavers which you can sell to twink the war. You can split the 3 reavers up the elevator (after you get the no rent key from the named up top) by using the lowest level shaman pet. Use the shaman screen to position warrior when hes blind.<br />
<br />
Why CoM?...no runners ever, also you can sow, lev, horse, empty zone, lots of easy mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was gonna say.. I think CoM would be optimal because you don't have to worry about mobs running.  I think that in itself would be enough reason to go here.  Something about the AC loss on my snare whip that always made me hate using it =(</div></div><hr />
