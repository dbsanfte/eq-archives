anyplace offhand we can duo for exp, she can find groups rather easy in the planes, but as a warrior, we all know how wanted are these days, I have enough trouble just finding a spot for the warrior, after hours of waiting, but seems tough for us to find a spot for the both of us, I have tryed building some groups, but only so many slowers to go around <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uthaar60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">id go to velks lab any of the bottom mobs since they single out the most. chardok entrance and exit, once she gets pacify you might want to try CT entrance at 55, plane of justice, the hole but you'd probably have to hit the halfpipe for real exp, permafrost keep(inside) giants, scarlet dessert the revenants, acrylia caverns entrance maybe, tenebrous mountains the vamp camps castle if you get a group, bats in sol b,  karnors castle, City of mist, jungle trash in traks teeth, and i think thats all i can think of off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
hope this helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croque-Mitaines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best XP for your dual = POJ near the exit at one-end of the left or right corridor. For the other spots as far as i know :<br />
-Ice Giants in Everfrost is good for money but slow XP and very very boring.<br />
-Entrance of Chardok used to be very nice before POP release but compared to is now XP junk (especially 'coz they hit hard and root/snare is quite resisted, but with the cleric you can pacify with np) BUT has many nice drops if you are not twinked aka SBS, Tribal war boots, etc.<br />
-Karnor is crap unless you get one or 2 more levels and hunt the skellies in the underbasement.<br />
-Velk is still nice for the gems.<br />
-SolB Ldc's and beetles are better than bats, and you can single pull them with the pacify...<br />
-At late hours you could make it to Sebilis Entrance also ...<br />
-Give a try on Maiden Eye where you can single pick Goranga &gt; you can also try Akheva Ruins Entrance.<br />
-Scarlet Desert could be a pbm to get there thru Fungus Grove if no port or invisi, but the Plateau is a place where you can hunt quite safely.<br />
- You could also try T-Rex Islands in Timorous Deep but the aggro range is quite impressive so get a good timer :) (btw because of your epic this zone shouldn't keep any secrets for your cleric)<br />
-Once the Entrance Spawn is broken, Charasis (aka HS) is quite nice if you find a safe corridor &gt; seems to me the best XP place if you dont have POP but you will need thje key and any error will make any CR difficult.<br />
-Other POP planes could be done but whithout slower, and no KEI on your cleric you are going to get into trouble (POD adds are quite often the rule ie).<br />
Well that's all i can think of now ...  GL !<br />
:D :D :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well unless you &quot;want&quot; to duo I'd just suggest you build your own PoP group.  My guild has two characters like that war/clr combo.  It would work out wonderfully for you trust me I know how tough it is to get a group :p  You already have half of what is needed for a group just look for a shaman/chanter then your gtg with other lfg peeps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kadore Damadred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for all the suggestions, chanter friend been with us again, so has been alot easier building groups, dinged 57 and 55 tonite<br />
<br />
sometimes it nice to just have a place to relax and exp a little all to yourselves, does wonders for my faction <br />
<br />
many thanks <br />
