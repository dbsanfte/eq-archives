<br />
and now i am wondering about Natural Durability, if i was to do sturdiness first, would ND then take those extra 500 hp's into calculation? when doing its %'s, yes i understand that its only about an 85hp upgrade total that path if it did.. but does it?<br />

thanks all<br />

ND before strud ot sturd before, the result is same, so just get the more rewarding 1st ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slovack</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just keep in mind that Sturdieness will cost WAY more AA's to complete than ND. I cant remember exactly off the top of my head how many the line of Sturd costs but i think it was somewhere around 50+  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">60aa to complete sturdiness 1-5<br />
12aa to complete Natural durability 1-3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sturdiness is 4/8/12/16/20 AA per each level, and each level gives you a flat 100hp, unaffected by ND or anything else. It doesn't matter which order you get sturdiness or nd in, but I'd say sturd1 and maybe 2 are what to get first, then nd3, then maybe go back and work on sturdiness, but the reward per aa gets really bad at levels 3-5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest you get Sturd 1, WA 1, and forget GoD AA's for a very, very, very long time afterward. Pick them up again after you have 250 - 300 under your belt.<br />
<br />
Get ND3 next, then AE Taunt, and then move back and get CS3, CA3, and PE. Then move on to Planar Power / Durability, max those out, and get a few offensives. Now, finally, get the GoD stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sturdiness 5 and WA5 were both done a month after GoD came out. I did have 30 saved though. I am really impressed with WA 5 though. One of those better aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sterix_VA</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the question sounded like poster thought ND gives set amount of hps that is defined at the time it is bought, so he should buy it when he has the highest amount of hps.<br />
<br />
But of course this is not the case. ND is dynamic hp increase, the more you upgrade equipment, the more hps ND gives you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fulorian, I think waiting until 250ish AAs to get anything beyond wa1/sturd1 is a serious mistake. I've got 148 aa spent, which include sturd2 and wa4, and I would have gotten them before many of my previous aas. I think the order you get AAs in depends on what content you are expected to tank, and how well you already hold aggro. Someone newly admitted into an ele raiding guild with only 50 AAs would probably get different AAs before a similar warrior raiding velious/luclin content.</div></div><hr />

ahh i did think that ND gave a &quot;set&quot; hp increase ie: 2% at time of purchase.. but its dynamic?.. cool.. then it matters not what order for hp aa's then.. so ND here first as easiest for greatest gain then..<br />

thankyou for the replies all....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frakius</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the reason Anakuns Magelo is off is that he probably has it doing dynamic updates which means that when he swaps out a weapon to use his vanishing device it may not update before he logs etc accounting for missing weapon in sec slot, or when  i checked it the gnomish vanishing Device.</div></div><hr />

LOL sorry to say I update my magelo every day so it changes everytime I play.  LOL this time I just happen to have my invising device in my off hand. I figured that paying for magelo and getting a real reading of my stats as opposed to a fake one was better in the long run. plus most guilds prefer you to have a true magelo.</div></div><hr />

I Did ND3 first and just got PE and was very please with the results.  Thinking of  doing CS and CA next as opposed to straight HP AA but justa thought. I got my path straight out of the library here on TSW. These are just my thoughts as I plan on grinding out all the DEF AA before any other AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While having a 'legit' magelo is all well and good, you can just be honest with it, and they will know if it is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with nd3 and sturd 1 or 2 then complete focus on def AA till finished then finish off sturdy. WA is nice but it's mostly there for the special people. If you pull with incite and begin tanking once the mob is in camp aggro shouldn't be an issue. If you end up in pick up groups where they tash or malo or slow on inc, or the wizard has to cast SoS at 97 percent then they want aggro, let them have it.<br />
<br />
Last night in tipt the enc died right off the pull. Soon as she popped she was laughing because she couldn't believe she'd just tashed on inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its also there for raid tanks.. but.. okay...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And raids are filled with special people. The first 10-15 seconds are the crucial aggro loss moments. After that if you lose aggro (and a/e is down) it's most likely due to an over zealous nuker. And during those first seconds chances are you are gonna have maybe 1 extra proc from WA. I have an anger2 aug on my BoW and between the 2 procs I don't seem to have alot of problems (I do currently have wa2).<br />
<br />
It's a handy skill but I think for a raid tank you're better off with Sturdy, that 500hp may be the difference between you getting a heal or dying.<br />
<br />
Warriors tanked before WA was available and did just fine, WA just makes it a bit easier imo.</div></div><hr />

It didn't seem to have any effect on straight HP buffs, but I was getting more HP with STA buffs than before.</div></div><hr />
