<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this one took the cake. (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=31475.topic&amp;start=21&amp;stop=29)<br />
<br />
If warriors are the first choice as tanks on raids, and I agree that they should be. Then they should be second choice in single groups, as they are now. I call that balance. If they want my agro control in exp groups I want their boss mob tanking ability for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, and since raiding is about 5% of this game for most people, that argument makes perfect sense.   Don't sweat it Aldarion, not all paladins are greedy, power tripping idiots.  Some of them actually do realize that their huge aggro advantage is nowhere near balanced with our minute tanking advantage, and the rest of them aren't worth arguing with.  If they can't understand  that there is a problem it is because they are either incapable or unwilling to see the matter at hand.  If they are incapable of understanding  such a simple line of reasoning they are sad, if they are unwilling to admit what reason tells them they are sadder still.  Either way, arguing with them about it is a waste of breath.  (however, it is acceptable to be angry with them for it, even if it wont benefit you in any tangible way) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The guy who wrote that comment got owned in the next message of that thread. Don't sweat it. <br />
Statement like that are a desperate attempt from knights who know a nerf of their aggro abbility is likly. It is just their defense for playing in god mode.<br />
<br />
If that statement were true, no one would want clerics to heal for exp groups, shaman to slow for exp groups, Enachanters for kei and mez in exp groups...<br />

So he is full of poopiecakaka.</div></div><hr />

It says outhouse Grimlokk, you want exclusively serious debate why not head to the newly designated Class balance forum, the Warrior class forum, the equipment related forum or the quests forum or even the Tavern, which you may note is not heavily spammed with wildly inapproprate threads by us moronic posters. <br />
<br />
If i feel like letting my hair down in one or two threads between serious posts (check around i do make a few :p ) then, until I'm told it seriously affects other peoples enjoyment (apart from yourself and a few other humourless persons apparently) you can go hang.<br />

It does DIRECTLY affect us because Grimmlokk and I have spent A LOT of time on these boards.  Both of us are nearing 1300 posts here you know...most of which were helping other people out.  That's what this board is here for...for warriors to share ideas about EQ, not to fuckin spam juvenile crap.  That's what the screenshots forum on FoHguild.org is for.<br />
<br />
I'd also wager that a lot more people care, and just aren't gonna say it, because the masses of idiots tend to overpower the rational.  I don't like opening up a thread and reading thru 3 pages of fuckin one liner crap just to maybe gleam some important information about the topic.<br />
<br />
You've got yourself a little leeway here, because no mod has stood with either side yet, but I seriously doubt that they're gonna allow the rampant degeneration of these boards.  Until they either tell Grimmlokk and I to shut the fuck up, or tell you to, you're gonna have to deal with us every time you make a retarded spam thread.   A lot of people spend a lot of time here, and this is a highly respected community.  I don't want it to all be shot to shit like some of the other class boards around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted I give you this paragraph except for the fact that the forum I post my juvenile crap in isn't exactly the OVERLORDS SANCTUARY. Ever think it was named after a bathroom for a reason you ninny. Don't read posts that start out with things like &quot;I seriously Hate Paladins. The people.&quot; If you don't want to read 3 pages of inane bullshitting. Just pass on by Sweet Cheeks no one asked for your opinion :)<br />

So suddenly your the voice of the masses?! Gawd help us.<br />

<br />
Stop and think about what your gonna say before you type anymore inane, bitchy B.S. get down off your soap box and look at the forums I post in. I read everything because I want to learn more about my class Jackhole but I post in the Tavern and the Outhouse because sometimes it is fun to take the stick out of your ass and laugh alittle...<br />
<br />
So in conclusion. No one has told me to STFU because I 'am not posting my silly juvenile crap anywhere I shouldn't.........unlike you derailing a political discussion to bitch about me i.e.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Seriously fellahs, a little bit of sillyness isn't gonna ruin your day, generally speaking, none of us that let of a little steam here spam the place as you suggest, i know i for one am very conscious of trying to keep my spamming to appropriate levels, I avoid deliberate derails of threads (unless it's my own) until it is very clear they have already lost the plot or unless such a thread is clearly not about a serious topic to start with. <br />
<br />
Haas as usual you're overstating things, as i think i covered back in my reply in the UN thread. <br />
<br />
Grimmlokk i have very little respect for as the majority of posts i've seen him make have consisted of mean spirited sniping against people whom he disagree's with. He has stated in this thread that he is 'enjoying himself' attempting to bait and/or put down other people (as i can only assume some form of ego boost for himself). Of the two forms of spam i much prefer my own brand to his vulgar crudities. <br />
<br />
If you wanna ignore it that's fine, if i truely and uselessly derail a thread which still serves a serious purpose then by all means tell me to back off, but I don't have to conform to your own rather narrow view of what's appropriate on a messageboard. Grimm posted that rather nasty little thread about a sex offender getting pwned in the tavern, it didn't suit my taste but you don't see me going around calling him a 'fucking reject' or some such for it.<br />

You're flaming for no reason other than to make yourself look high and mighty (as you accused me of, now that was funny!) and because of your negative attitude to having fun.<br />
<br />
A few posts here and there, in the correct forums I might add, for off-topic posts are not going to degenerate the boards as a whole as you suggest.  You don't have to read the threads either for crying out loud, are you a masochist?!  That's the only explanation I can think of.  So what if you're near 1300 posts.  Does that mean you have more right than everybody else to post?  No, it just means you've been here longer.  Things change, get over it and as Raych already said, get off your soap-box, you're embarrassing yourself.</div></div><hr />

 However, if 99% of my posts were inane(I don't think that word means what you think it means Raycheal)babbling I'd fully expect someone to let loose on me occasionally.

<br />
 Once more, from the bottom of my soul, I'm very sorry I shit on your very important thread. I truly hope you can somehow find maybe one other one to fill with such witty banter. Without some horrible monster like me coming in and ruining your fun with 1 whole sentence. Go, spread your wings and be free.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">The tavern has had lots of silly threads in it as long as I can remember.  Some of the most popular posters around here do nothing but post silly threads in the Tavern, lots of people, including pretty much all of the moderators, participate in these threads in the Tavern and they're all in fun.  This forum (the outhouse) hasn't been around long enough to really define itself, but mostly it's been an off-topic, off-color, anything goes kind of forum.  Personally I don't much care what gets posted here as long as it's not Porn, spam, excessively foul, or a lot of personal attacks on other posters, but I don't think it would be considered a forum for serious discussion.  If you want to talk about serious EQ and warrior related stuff, the Arena, the Battlefield, The Bunker, and The War Room are all full of that kind of stuff.  There are a few class-balance related threads here, but this is really for ranting than serious discussion.  Continuously derailing threads asking for help or discussing game mechanics would be inappropriate.  That's not what I see happening.  <br />
<br />
Just as a disclaimer, I didn't discuss this with any other mod, just my personal thoughts, and I didn't read all of this thread either.  Basically though, it's not against the rules to make silly posts, and it's not against the rules to complain about it, but I hope this discussion doesn't go on forever because it's not very interesting or entertaining.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Don't worry Val, i'm sure he thinks the same about you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Saying something doesn't make it true. You have some misguided belief that people like you because you post stupid cutesy bullshit on a messageboard. Meanwhile 90% ignore you because you're annoying and unfunny, and a vocal minority of fellow twits finds your dumbshit antics funny. These are the same people that love Big Brother. You're a fucking emote wannabe valley girl halfwit retard like every other moronic twit &quot;female&quot; who calls everyone &quot;hon&quot; and &quot;doll&quot;.<br />
<br />
 I'm sure I haven't endeared myself to the &quot;community&quot; here. The difference is I don't give a shit. I don't make up some bullshit messageboard persona to try and get people to compliment me and laugh at my unfunny bullshit. I don't emote bounce around and spank people and try my best to act all sugary and recycle old lame jokes and stupid overused catchphrases that weren't funny in the first place. kthx? I'm sure there's someone's base that are belong to you somewhere that you must go yatta, so be off. Or better yet, post another mind numbingly stupid reply that will get the same braindead &quot;you go girl&quot; responses. Rock on sister, tell it to the hand!<br />
<br />
 OK I think I'm really done this time. Please be sure to make more witty observations and scathing retorts. And remember, I swear sometimes, use that because no one but you noticed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">As i do about you Haas.<br />

Difference is I know that at least in this respect I'm the better man because I don't seek to harm others with my postings.<br />

Read closley you Homorepressed little wanna-be flamer. Why don't you grab your tu-tu and your copy of &quot;How To Piss People Off for Dummies&quot; and go write your all important other posts that I must have been interupting for you to act like a complete and utter douchebag for the past 5-6 posts that you've written.<br />
You're a fucking emote wannabe valley girl halfwit retard like every other moronic twit &quot;female&quot; who calls everyone &quot;hon&quot; and &quot;doll&quot;.<br />
Gee Sweet Cheeks did some girl do you wrong, or did some boy just do you right??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I don't make up some bullshit messageboard persona to try and get people to compliment me and laugh at my unfunny bullshit.<br />
<br />
So why then do you go to such great lengths to spew such pretty prose? why not just say 'You aren't funny, please stop?' <br />
<br />
Offer me the courtesy of framing the request politely and I'd have placed far more weight on your opinion. Face it bud, most of your posting here is designed to 'Pwn' your opposition, to give you a nice little ego stroking - or why is the in your face attitude neccessary?<br />
<br />
Because you find it entertaining?<br />
<br />
Why is it at all entertaining? <br />
<br />
The answers an ugly one don't you think?<br />
<br />
Anyway, i hate flames and rants, getting involved in them does nothing for my enjoyment of a messageboard, this is over for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Ninamwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">*cackles at the posts*<br />
<br />
Hey Haass, Grim. my sig applies to you both 100%, btw are you two related?  You both post the same &quot;don't hate me, this is just how I am&quot; spiel and as though you speak for the masses while telling others they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Banuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">If someone over the internet calls you an idiot or twit and it somehow has long term effects on your psyche, then you are an idiot IMO.<br />
<br />
Females will always be better at derailing things then men will.<br />
<br />
And now someone will point at my post count, call me an idiot or twit, and tell me to STFU newb, or they'll simply agree with me.<br />
<br />
if I had it on hand, this is where I'd insert the pic of the retarded kid running with the witty comment about argueing on the internet on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">as though you speak for the masses while telling others they do.<br />
<br />
Actually I'd prefer *you* do hate me. Means I must be doing something right. No one in this thread speaks for the masses in any way(in fact I've sorta made a rather obvious point of stating that repeatedly, kinda hard ro miss...), we're all varying levels of idiots. Anyone who inserts themselves into this utterly mindless debate at this late time is just a bigger idiot.<br />
<br />
 And if everyone had to be gay to hate you Raych, I think there'd be a *LOOOOOOT* of Elton John's running around this board posting about the latest Cher concert. But tell yourself that some more, you are special. You are unique. There is no one else like you anywhere in the world.<br />
<br />
 I'm probably emotionally repressed or something to behave like this. maybe there's something horribly wrong with me? Oh well, at least I'm not annoying, just an asshole.<br />
<br />
PS: You'll notice *I* haven't resorted to RL insults, yet. You horrible horrible monsters are making me feel very bad about myself. I'll be sending you my shrink bills for the emotional carnage you've made of my fragile psyche with your horribly sharp observations. <br />
<br />
'OMG he hates me, GAY!!! And he cusses!!!!'<br />
<br />
 Which really can't hold a candle to the above<br />
<br />
&quot;You are teh stupid hur hur&quot;</div></div><hr />
