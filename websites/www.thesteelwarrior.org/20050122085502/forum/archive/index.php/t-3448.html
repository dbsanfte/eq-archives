<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't go wrong with putting vengance on an item. Heh. More ATK is always good.<br />
<br />
BUT ... the funny thing about LDoN ... it's bringing back the usefulness of regen.<br />
<br />
The style of the adventures (lots of crawling, etc.), along with the damage output of the mobs, really does bring back the effectiveness of things like Fungi Tunics.<br />
<br />
So the regen augment is also a great idea.<br />
<br />
But, Enduring Breath is still a favorite effect of mine. Heh.<br />
<br />
My advice ... if you're planning on spending a LOT of time in LDoN for the time being, put the regen on the pants.<br />
<br />
If you're planning on using these pants in PoP encounters ... put the vengance on the pants.<br />
<br />
If you're tired of swapping out for a fishbone earring or whatever your other EB item was, then go with the enduring breath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
+5 dex sta +20 hp(or +40 hp if sta maxed) any stat your lacking realy. type 2 is the stat type<br />
<br />
dodge +8%(if you dont have a dodge modifier allready)<br />
<br />
realy open greaves for choices. to bad ac wont fit on them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">40+40+30 hp <br />
<br />
Having now a 180hp item = something you will never upgrade.<br />
Even after you have finished Farming PoTime.<br />
Having &quot;Final/End items&quot; is a blessing because you are done with them.<br />
<br />
Looking for a compromise is indeed a wise choice.<br />
But ask any warrior you find whats better :<br />
200hp cloack and a 50hp bracer or a 125hp cloack and a 125hp bracer ?<br />
<br />
Most will say 200hp cloack, because once you have that cloack<br />
you are assured of 1 thing : You will NEVER need to upgrade it.<br />
<br />
Ps: Be very carefull, there are rumors/reports of a nerf INC on LDoN<br />
from test server so my advice may not be valid/wise after the nerf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suggest waiting till after next patch before spending any points.  <br />
<br />
Things have changed a bit on test and from what I read some augments will &quot;pop out&quot; of the item they are in onto your curser.  Great cause you don't waste the augment but if it doesn't happen to fit on anything else you own it is just wasted bank space till you find something to put it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have these pants also and two things are irritating.  <br />
<br />
1- the only type one augments that will fit on them are 1150 points (unless you want to pop a dropped 6 sta or something on them, even though my sta is not maxed yet it will be with a few more upgrades and that would end up a waste) and <br />
<br />
2- all the Miragul armor has no graphic &lt;gasp&gt; troll running around with no pants on...<br />
<br />
Originally I had planned on putting the 510 mm 10AC augment1 on them (54 ac pants would be good for me) but only realized after that it won't fit in the leg slot.  I will most likely put 2 hp augs and a regen on mine and save the vengeance and auras for the other pieces (all from Tak from here on out - just liked the sta on the miragul pants as opposed to the tak ones).<br />

<br />

<br />
Then wait until after the next patch.<br />
<br />
One of the augments changes on test, reportedly, is one of the 40 hit point augments.</div></div><hr />
