<br />
where would you rank it with the other dropable agro weapons...<br />
<br />
I suppose it would be below CHoS/SotBS/RSHS but how much below?<br />
<br />
give us your opinions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Longern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've played with this  a couple of times to debuff mobs, but it's uses are situational at best, IMO. I usually forget I even have the thing.<br />
<br />
I'd be interested to see the numbers, though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im guessing the aggro from the proc is about the same as an AC debuff, ~350. whereas chos and sotb are ~450. and i dont see -5 to the mob's resist helping with spells greatly enough to make any difference. on top of that, it doesnt proc any better than any other normal weapon. so its basically a droga weapon with worse dmg, worse aggro, and worse utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If this thing procs at a lower level than the Droga weps...twinkage loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah, never mind. Rec level of 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i would imagine this around the willsapper if the debuff is as much aggro as AC debuff, but ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used that weapon for 3 or 4 levels and loved it ...<br />
<br />
until I got my hands on real aggro weapons (SotB and CHoS).<br />
<br />
It looks cool and the ratio was better than anything else I had at the time. I think I put warm emerald shard on it and felt UBAH! I even looted it myself!<br />
<br />
But your gut feeling is correct -- it's not as good for aggro as any of the other weapons you listed. Use this until you can get one of the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a weapon to actually use? meh.</div></div><hr />
