Sorry, but you're not going to convince the monkeys at SK.org.<br />
<br />
<br />
I applaud you for trying though!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">YOu have to look at the right threads there...but I do think they have a much worse signal to noise ratio. Makes me appriciate my time at PoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Eh BRUTALL is trying to explain stuff there, but people are just bringing up that he spells Parce wrong. Brael is the only one that really had anything to back stuff up.</div></div><hr />

Parse* ;).<br />

/em realizes he has channelled his outer jackass as well.<br />

Brutall has gone where I fear to tread. Mentally filtering out all of those threads is  ... erm ... aggravating :p.<br />
<br />
I agree on the signal to noise ratio - the voices worth listening to are there, they're just lost in a greater cacophony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I feel for Brutall, those sk's on that board are total tools. Most can't even form a coherent arguement, just saying Brutall is a liar. That thread is one of the funniest I've read in a while, full of knights who know they are overpowered but refuse to admit cause they fear the nerf bat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah lol those idots on sk forums, they can't stop slurping brael's cock for long enough to type out a coherent post or refute anything brutal says.  All they can do it make fun of his spelling</div></div><hr />
