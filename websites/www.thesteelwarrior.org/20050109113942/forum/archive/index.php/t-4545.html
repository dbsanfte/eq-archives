I've spent some time at the wolves/wolfmasters outside thurg, and a tad in icewell.  Was going to schedule a lil WW dragons romp in WW for some other faction.  Any ideas on places to go that i could either solo, or that people would actually not mind going to? I'm a 58 warrior, 1210ish ac 3300ish hp unbuffed, using a 13/20 and 11/17.  Me/pally/cleric took some mobs in icewell pretty well, but it's impossible to get groups, so it's got me a tad discouraged. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
*edit* BTW i have thurg BP for healing purposes when soloing if need be*edit*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that, single group the kobolds in Velks and save the goodies for turning in?<br />
<br />
Other than that, I just think it's dorf slaying time.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go find the mines in GD. Kill dorfs until your eyes bleed. Collect the heads they drop and turn them in to the Kromrif recruiter at the EW zone line. He will not agro even when KOS so you can have someone invis you after you open a trade window to do the turn in until you are not KOS. This gets you all 3 giant factions. Once you are not KOS to Kromzek, turn the heads in to Capt. Bvellos in the bank. He gives better Zek hits and Zek is the faction you need for armor turn ins. It will probably take anywhere from 100-150 heads to get ally depending on how good/bad your faction is now.</div></div><hr />

 Am already KoS to Thurg and Kael and won a Dains head and need KT faction which will be harder to get I think.</div></div><hr />

The fastest way to raise giant faction is to slaughter green cons in Skyshrine. Usually takes me 4 hours two boxing to go from max kos to ally, but that was before revamp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Factioning has been nerfed to hell.  Get exp and aa's your turn ins are not worth the hundreds of hours.</div></div><hr />
