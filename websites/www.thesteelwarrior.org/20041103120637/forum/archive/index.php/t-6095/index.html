<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone confirm they have gotten the 40AC 100HP face from Lcea Katta in recent months?<br />
I have killed her 5x or so and never seen it.  Gonna give up if it just doesn't drop anymore cuz her other stuff mostly rots, which is depressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes she drops it about 1 in 10</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We're 0 in 15 so far :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">0 in about 20 so far.  We gave up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fafnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dropped about 2 months ago for my guild (fortunately, allocated to me).<br />
<br />
We are 1 in about 8 kills and won't be doing her any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe her mask is a legend, I have killed over 20 times in last few years and never had one drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A guy in my guild has one, but he got it before joining us.  Not sure how many times it took him to get it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We did it 15 times and never got it. Stopped doing it finally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KaoraEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I saw one out of about 25 kills, very rare :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">She just dropped it for a friend of mine last week.  This was after I'd told him that it was gone from her loot table and he was wasting his time... yes I feel stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm in the same guild as Fafnir. Mask dropped the first time we killed her, has not dropped since. I'm going to try 4 boxing her... anyone have solid data on how high MR needs to be to resist her charm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Her charm is unresistable.<br />

Since her charm is unresistable, make sure she charms the weakest char you can afford to have charmed.</div></div><hr />

charm is easily dispellable, plan for it.</div></div><hr />
