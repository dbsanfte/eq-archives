<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Welini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everybody,new poster here. I had been playing a cleric but felt <br />
like bashing more than healing so I made a barbarian warrior,now level 13. I LOVE IT!!!!  But I know so little about warriors-she has a great weapon,Rod of Lamentation. Son has many high level chars and passes off weapons and plat. I know, I know, I'm very lucky.<br />
So if I have some plat available,what should I buy to build my skills other than 2HS? The rod is my only weapon other than a bow for pulling.<br />
My armor is rag-tag:crusty b'plate,mithril bracers,not much else.2 velium wedding rings. I would appreciate any and all advice. Thanks</div></div><hr />

On my server this thing sells for 50pp!! LOL <br />
<br />
If you are fighting your warrior like you should... evan with NO haste, this should keep your 2HS maxed well, and honestly (even in a game a massive twinks) this is a damn fine weapon into your 30's and 40's (when you may be able to get better weapons...)<br />
<br />
And don't forget 1hs 1hb and piercing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One thing to remember is that the warrior, though not the Master of Damage, should be the Master of Combat.  What??<br />
Basically, make sure that you train ALL of your combat skills to the max in order to be most effective with your weapon combos as you progress!!  train both 1h and 2h slash, piercing, and both blunts!!  This will be key in your progression!!<br />
<br />
And most of all, Have Fun!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Welini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks everybody. I'll look for the Weighty Polearm on my server.<br />
So I should just keep swithcing weapons and max all skills? Even if one weapon does significantly more dmg? Right now I solo and play with my sister who's a druid.<br />
Fun is not a problem,this is a great class,but what's with the taunt button.Hardly ever works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You got it!  Keep switching until you max your skills.  :)  sometimes it takes longer to establish the kill, but it'll make up for itself in the long run!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unfortunately, the Weighty Polearm has a recommended level of 50 or 51, can't remember off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Welini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That is unfortunate. As a level 13,I have a looooong way to go til I can use it. Thanks for the heads up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another very good 2hs for the low levels would be a Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6026)  I used one of these into the mid 20s.  Very cheap, usually about 15pp, just don't confuse it with a Blackened Iron Bastard Sword.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brigade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Runed Frost blade, awesome cheap 2hs, I got mine for 150 pp, after about 3 days of looking though, so it is all about patience.<br />
<br />
like 49 delay 42 dmg I think, forgive me I havent played eq in about a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sensorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ack... I apologize for the bad info... =( ---<br />
<br />
Actually the first weapon that can to my mind also was a BABS... The key to it I guess is find the fastest one you can for speedy skill ups..<br />
<br />
And on the weapon skills... DEFINATELY max (or try to max) ALL the weapon skills you can... the Warrior is the Meat shield - You want your 1HS, 1HB and Piercing maxed because you will have some pretty nice weapons come available later on and you want to be able to hold agro as well as possible.<br />
<br />
(and even though I have pretty much been exclusivley 1 hand duel wield througghout my warrior life, I used a BABS for 2HS from the first time I ever wielded 2HS until I replaced it in my late 40's or early 50's - been awhile)<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Welini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the help.I'm looking for a BABS now.Are piercing weapons specifically for piercing or usable for other skills? Sorry for being so woefully uninformed. And could someone please explain &quot;proccing&quot;? /em sighs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">this is a great class,but what's with the taunt button.Hardly ever works<br />
<br />
ROFL!<br />
<br />
Theres plenty of us here who have been warriors for a long time and are still trying to work that one out!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bogonia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by Welini <br />
And could someone please explain &quot;proccing&quot;? /em sighs  <br />
<br />
Proc'ing is short hand for processing - this is when a weapon with an effect on it processes an occurrence of that effect firing.<br />
<br />
For instance - velium weapons have an effect of Velium Strike listed on them.  Every time you swing (not every time youhit, but every time you swing), you have a random chance of that weapon processing that effect - or essentially of the weapon casting that spell.<br />
<br />
That casting of the spell is what is referred to as a proc.<br />
<br />
Some of the spells affect the mob you're attacking, some affect you, and some affect both the mob and you.  There's even a few that proc an aoe type spell :) <br />
<br />
Hope that helps :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Welini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks Bogonia, that explains it. And that's a great name for a froggie warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I actually used a Nathsar Greatsword (17/30?) for most of my early years.  It was a cheap two-hander with a good delay.  Just another option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmm I would forget 2hand till your 20 you have a damage cap.  A good 1hand will do the same damage but much faster.  Wait till your damage cap is off then do 2hand.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't know about your server, but on mine, Mith 2handers are dirt cheap now too, and because of the haste you'll get lots of skillups with one.  Tough to beat at low level. (used to be one of the best blades in the game back in the day)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Welini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow, so much helpful advice! Thanks guys.I knew I liked playing a<br />
warrior but bashing AND shopping,how happy can a girl be?</div></div><hr />
