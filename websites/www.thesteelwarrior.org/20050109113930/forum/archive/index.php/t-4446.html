<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyson Dycson</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With recent news about melee changes intended for pure melee, and giving a small portion of the new toys to knights, there have been numerous posts about how Paladins are upset about the disc changes.  The deal is, they feel their discs are rather worthless, and while I am no pally to say they are or not, I would agree with them just by the looks of them.<br />
<br />
But here is the kicker.  Discs were introduced in Kunark for PURE melee only.  Correct me if I am wrong, but it wasn't until Velious that other melee got something.  So right there, it just proves that pure melee should be the ones to benefit from disc changes first.<br />
<br />
So how is it that a Paladin can complain about pure melee balancing when knights are already balanced as is?  Last I knew, knights were not complaining that they were severely underpowered.  In fact, they would taunt us by tanking where we would in exp groups and flaunt their abilities while laughing in our face.  Explain to me why a knight needs to have better discs.  Do they need to boost their powers again while we catch up to them now so they can advance again creating the same gap between us?</div></div><hr />

I feel hybrids have to be included in this change somewhat. One reason being the fun factor of it all. Another being that we are melee also and should partake in a portion of what melee classes get. Lastly we need to be included to insure the gap between melee and hybrids isn't opened so large we are unwanted. <br />
<br />
<br />
HA!  How many Pallies came here and posted the following or somethign similar...<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins are extremely balanced right now and need no changes.  We are where we should have been from the start. <br />

Well, I am going to have more fun than I have with auto-attack on, chatting with my g/f while her DoTs tick away and the mob dies :D.<br />

And yar, I got a chuckle from spell casting fighters who also want to be combat specialists ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put all of the warr discs on diff timers, a minimum of 1 minute between use of each disc. With a 30 minute or so reuse per disc.<br />
<br />
As an SK I would love to get a riposte disc. Don't believe it will likely ever happen /shrug <br />
<br />
Glad they're looking into it, and partially glad it won't be for hybrids. I don't want more of a click fest while meleeing then I already have. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30 minutes per disc would make our defensive, and evasive disciplines much less usefull... at least thats what I think.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea how long your disc reuse timers are set for. I was assuming they were the same PoS ~52 minute ones I have. =)</div></div><hr />

With a new system in place, a paladin has a right to be afraid of being tossed back into the pit again, because noone knows the ramifications of these changes as of yet.<br />

And I'm almost convinced Ezedriel doesn't play a paladin  =p</div></div><hr />

The amount of that scaling is dependant on the level it's obtained, but, the big D has a reuse timer of the manigtude of 10 minutes at level 65. I'm too lazy to go look. <br />
<br />
Are there things I would like to have done to SK discs? Yes, but then again, I'm a crazy ass bitch and want a chance of getting a Cazic Touch, complete with shout. Do ours function respectably? I can't complain about adding another 2.4k to an instant damage spike, can you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That right there is the main point of topic.  Our discs are the only utility we have.  A knight has quite a few spells to use for any given situation.  You mean to tell me you want more disciplines AND your spells?  If that is the case, I want spells to go along with my disciplines.  Knights are balanced enough without disciplines.  The main usage for knights is eye candy, while a warrior has utility, be it only one real utility we can use without fear of a bad pull that requires defensive.<br />
<br />
What I am getting at is, you don't need more disciplines.  You're balanced as is.  I'm all for unhooking timers for all classes, but give you more of something you don't need is pushing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the changes will be interesting.  If they effect paladins or not is fairly irrelevant to me.  I do not require more.  However, I find the most interesting thing about this all to be:  You are getting utility.   That means no more throwing paladin spellbooks in their faces.  It means that the small(ish) gap between warrior and knight hp/ac *will be* justified.  It means that there is no longer any reason to *not* make it so knights can tank end game mobs.  <br />
<br />
Of course, that is speculation based on what little has been reported so far.  But, I do find the idea interesting.  Furthermore, one can only hope that the &quot;mana&quot;ish presentation of alot of this plays out exactly like it does for pure casters:  Fun parchment turn ins, having to choose between good &quot;mana&quot; items and good &quot;stat&quot; items (for lower end players, obviously) and all the nifty stuff that goes with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a Hybrid chooses to Also have /Discs (Via an I Accept agreement @ log in) then they should get that GD Spellbook back when they med @ a trade off fer having discs.<br />
<br />
Pure melee no disadvantage<br />
Pure caster no disadvantage<br />
Hybrid no disc no disadvantage, got disc got disadvantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boracelt</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Play a 57 Warr and a 48 Pally. Lets just take a simple run through on a Day in the Life of these two Chars. In Dreadlands at 48 both my Warr and pally tried to solo a ravishing Drolvarg. My Pally with his heals LoH and stuns easily takes down this Mob while My Warr with his Pure Mellee attack/Bash Stun  Runs for his Life with 10% HP left and the mob at about 30%. Is this Blancing? I Know I won't complain if My Pally Looses his Disc altogether and Warrs Get some added skills/Disc/AC+Mellee to bring the 2 classes In line with each other. Both Classes are designed to Tank But Currently a Pally will Wipe the floor with the same Lvl warr and that Isn't Balance. I don't Think Nerfing Pallys is the Answer but rasing Warrior skills Caps and Def/Dam Capabilities is. Otherwise No one will be able to Tank the Planes High end and everyone will be left at a disadvantage. Just My 2cp and ramblings</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is 1 Paladin tanking Quarm Reprenstive of the class as a whole, but 1 Warrior with Saryn Range, Time BP, DBoTWL and EoE + 2 Anger 3 Augs not Reprenstive of the warrior class?*<br />
<br />

*I dont beleive that the warrior i stated reprenstive of warrior class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyrfalcon</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Madronedorf, because previous to it happening, only defensive warriors were capable of bringing the guy down. Now it has been done with Pallies, Monks and Shadowknights. Who's next? Ranger? Beastlord? All this thanks to knightemization, tanking AAs available to all classes, BoV, and a mana regen rich environment.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;whole class&quot; shot, not all warriors will tank Quarm. I bet not even 3 percent of the class will even get to see him, let alone tank him. No, one paladin tanking Quarm does not a whole class make, but it is indicative of what a class can achieve. Yay knights. Now you can chip the last flake of stone from warriors' tombstone.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps ... I don't know if you've spotted it, but the general skew of these boards is that paladins have had all the balance they need, and more than most other classes, for a while.  Which indicates fairly strongly that there are a significant number among us &quot;who don't understand&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Prithee, conclude the thought.</div></div><hr />
