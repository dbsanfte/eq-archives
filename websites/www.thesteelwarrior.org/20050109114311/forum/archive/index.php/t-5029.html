<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the original game, one of the advantages to picking a warrior was the fact that there was a fairly significant advantage of innate MR over the other classes, as Warriors got an innate bonus in magic resistance each few levels, while (I believe) none of the other classes enjoyed the same bonus.<br />
<br />
With all of the new spells that are cast by mobs having large negative modifiers, as well as resistance increasing items being tens or hundreds of times more available now than when the calculation of MR added to warriors was made to balance in the game as it existed back then, the minor bonus that warriors get has been rendered insignificant. Back then, the innate resistance given to warriors could easily account for half of the warrior's total resistances, while now it can easily account for less than a TENTH of their total resistance.<br />
<br />
I think another thing the designers have to look at is restoring the resistance advantage that warriors had in the origincal game, but which has been slowly rendered obsolete, by the same things which have necessitated the implementation of disc changes, the addition of incite, and the addition of openings.<br />
<br />
I suggest a change along the same lines of HP and AC... just like the addition of a 50 hitpooint or 50 AC item does not add 50HP or 50AC, but rather, somewhat more, so should warriors get rather more out of a MR addition than what is stated in the item's description.<br />
<br />
This addition would just about finish the update to the original warrior to balance with the realities of game play today.</div></div><hr />

Paladins have a PR or DR bonus i think... Barbs get CR i think? Trolls get an FR penality..... <br />
<br />
what would be better idea imo would be allowing the bonus's to overcap resists.....<br />

IE warriors could get like 540 MR paladins 540 DR... etc etc</div></div><hr />

Race resists... I may be wrong, but I think that's just a one time starting setting for a race... that's part of picking that race, just like the other starting stats, so that should stay the same.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's necessary to give it to everyone in the form of AAs.<br />
<br />
32 MR is still a nice chunk of extra MR.  Even with today's gear having huge stats on them, that's worth at least 1 to 2 slot worth of resists (2 slot of generic save all gear or 1 slot of svM + other gear).  There's no reason we should be better at withstanding spells than say a Wizard, but we do, because we have a lot more HP.  Asking for even more spell resistance isn't fair.  Melees types aren't supposed to be good versus spells...</div></div><hr />

I don't see why we're supposed to be the best class versus spell damage, but we are.  That, on top of 32 innate MR which is more than any innate adjustment any other classes get, is not enough?  If anyone is supposed to get innate magic damage reduction it's the casters.  You'd think someone who spend their life practicing how to throw fireballs would at least learn some innate resistance to the elements they control.  Given equivalently high end geared characters, a warrior will always outlast any other class versus any kind of magic damage.  You should appreciate this advantage that we're never meant to have...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, most RPG's follow the philosophy that if you don't deal with magic, you have a higher resistance- whereas spell casters are already opened to magic and therefore have lower resistances- for example Barbarians, (in second edition anyway) were given an innate MR in addition to their saving throw.  If I remember right anyway, been a long long time since I pulled those books out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know much about AD&amp;D stuff but I was under the impression casters can cast spells that vastly reduce or outright negate spells.  You can't do that in EQ.  Spellcasters get a few token anti-spell stuff like spellshield (the spell not the ability), the reflect line, or the enchanter ward line but I have never heard of anyone trying to stay alive but chain casting spellshield on themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anti-Magic? Like, your basic Counterspell?<br />
<br />
Yeah, EQ doesn't have one of them yet. I guess MIRROR is as close as it's going to get.<br />
<br />
But, the thing with warriors is sort of a simple RPG trick that goes back aways ...<br />
<br />
Warriors on the whole tend not to BELIEVE in magic. They are physical beings, who deal with what they can see (and hit). And as such, magic has less of a hold on them and is less effective on them.<br />
<br />
That's the foundation of where the warrior innate MR bonus in EQ comes from. <br />
<br />
Is it effective these days, in the current state of EQ? Well, I dunno. I mean hell, a +32 SVM item would be interesting. So it is as someone above described ... it's worth a slot or two of gear. It's just not 1/3 of your overall resists like it used to be when 100 resists were the huge plateau.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are many classes and races with resist bonuses/penalties<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, so far we've come up with 2 of the classes, and 2 of the races, and only warriors get the sliding scale benefit. Of the only 2 classes that got any kind of benefit that I've seen so far, both are tanks. That still leaves QUITE a few of the other classes and races with no MR benefits or penalties at all. All classes with resist penalities and benefits should be updated to reflect the realities of today, as these &quot;benefits&quot; have faded into irrelevancy.<br />
<br />
Phantron, your claim that warriors take less damage &quot;comparatively&quot; because of their HPS is sophistry. I can just as easily say that warriors take MORE damage comparatively due to being in the position TO TAKE magic damage. The casters are rarely if ever taking proc damage, and aren't the focus of a mob's attention, you know. The only thing they have to worry about is the AE's, which isn't even a consideration on anything but raid mobs.<br />
<br />
Tanks are and should be better at taking spell damage because they have TAKEN far more damage than the weak casters. They are damage taking experts, they've learned how to take hit sof all kinds without getting injured too badly. Just like a warrior has the experience and the reflexes to duck that blade coming at their face, while a caster not having the speed or experience would get hit by it, so does a good warrior see say, a sheet of flame coming  and cover his face at the right time so that between covering his face, and his skin that's been toughened by years of beatings, he takes less damage. Meanwhile the baby faced caster that's right beside him doesn't duck in time, and gets his soft skin burned all to shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron, not in any D&amp;D I ever played, but I haven't played Third Edition yet... there was another game, called Shadowrun where the casters could use their magic skill to augment the magical defense of themselves and their party members.<br />
<br />
By the way- I believe ROG get a +PR adjust, as do SHM (I think)...</div></div><hr />

I think we can all agree these &quot;benefits&quot; are almost completely worthless now compared to then.\, and need updating to the realities of the magic system today.</div></div><hr />

Mad Historian:<br />
1. In the day 1 game there was no warr MR bonus.  It happened about 3-4 months into the game (Summer 1999) along with crit hits, no death crawl etc.<br />
<br />
2. Warrs were never chosen for exp groups based on this (hell at least none I knew).<br />

That being said I think you have some good ideas</div></div><hr />

That would make the resist bonus MEAN something without unbalancing encounters. as a 65 warrior I have an unbuffed MR count of 203 which really means nothing when youre getting hit by proc's and AE's that have a -100 or -200 modifier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course if your resists suck innate advantage or not you'll still get mauled.<br />
<br />
Though it does seem to be too easy to get to 500 resist these days and especially MR.  My MR is aronud 430 unbuffed but it really doesn't make much of a diference from another guy at 300 unbuffed unless all the bards died.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could give me 500 innate MR and it wouldn't impact me much.<br />
<br />
There are 3 ways they could code it to give warriors back this (relatively insgnificant) bonus.  1) Let the warriors exceed the 500 cap either through AA points or by simply raising the cap on all warriors  2) Put warrior save rolls on a different table.  Much like AC means more on some classes than on others, let warriors MR mean more.  3)  Make warriors less susceptible to resist modifiers.  This could be an innate resistance to spells like tash and malo, a lessened effect on warriors for those spells, or ignoring the resist mods on spells cast on them.  Or some combination thereof.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every bit of resist still helps.  It's nice to never have to worry about MR being your lowest resist to deal with chromatic AEs, that leaves only 4 resists to worry about and one more buff slot as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MR is the easiest resist to raise, followed by CR/FR, followed by DR/PR.<br />
<br />
NOONE needs to worry about MR being their lowest resist save people who have made a series of gear selection choices with the intent of passing over the other resists in favor of the hardest to raise ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoTime in particular typically only has 2-3 resistances on items.  While MR is certainly prevalent it is not unthinkable that MR ends up being your lowest resist.</div></div><hr />

In the beginning of my EQ adventure, I had gear without any resitances on it( I was happy to see stamina or hp on it ) - so about till lvl55 for me as I worn out my crusty at that time and dual wilded 2 lammies the MR boni was indeed much better. I was mostly the one who didnt got slowed or didnt got rooted/snared in regular groups. I would like to see a kind of different advantages and disadvantages between the classes, aka give the warriors more resists in magic base, paladin against disease base, dwarfs against beer :p...and so on. So all classes get maybe even one immunity just in 1 special resist or a very very high resist in one folder. I like more various :) it is more &quot;interesting&quot; - ins't it? :D<br />

I believe it was added partly for PvP balance back when RZ was the only PvP server, along the inability to loot Pri, Sec, and IIRC Range items.  Naked casters had 95% of their power, and zero risk.  I  believe the one-time bonuses for other classes were added mostly to appease the masses after the warrior MR boost went in.<br />

Traditionally, warriors in many systems have had a resistance to magical effects that comes from being so bullheadedly ignorant of them that their sheer stubborness about it conveys resistance. Or other similar justification: If you're not magically active, it's harder for you to interact with magic, both benefical and detrimental. Or a hundred other such RP justifications.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why we're supposed to be the best class versus spell damage, but we are.<br />
<br />
Why shouldn't we be kickass against casters? I have a druid alt that rules against melee types. When he gets into a fight with a caster he can get into trouble because he has low HP's and can be nuked to death.<br />
<br />
I think it's fair and balanced to have my warrior be able to stand up to nuking better than my treehugger.</div></div><hr />

What would you rather have when a fireball is coming your way:  a powerful ward against spells, or saying &quot;I don't think that fireball is real&quot;?  <br />
<br />
But then this also assumes that spellcasting is actually rare, which certainly is not in EQ.  I mean, you'd rather a level 65 wizard cast even a Strike of Sol Ro (not that they do, biggest nuke I've seen is Sunstrike) as opposed to meleeing double 700s+.  This shouldn't happen in a fantasy setting game, but it does.  <br />
<br />
Anyway Warriors are pretty much the best against any spell damage out of all classes by virtue of HPs, especially at the high end.  I don't see any reason to be even better.  And hey, +32 MR is like +6 resist versus Prismatic AEs in GoD.  It isn't much but it's better than 0, at least while your bard is asleep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a car with side impact beams. If a guy goes, these side impact beams are now irrelevant (for whatever reason), how far do you think an argument that &quot;well, you've got a big car, which by virtue of its size takes impacts better, so it doesn't matter!&quot; is going to fly?<br />
<br />
No, the fact that the car is bigger is pretty much irrelevant. The fact is, if those side impact beams are rendered to all intents and purposes irrelevant, it needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />
