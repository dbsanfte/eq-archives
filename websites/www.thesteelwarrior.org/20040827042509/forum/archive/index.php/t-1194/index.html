<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Should magelo an wot m'see in Norrat match up?<br />
<br />
M'gots bout 100hp less in Norrath den wot Magelo thin says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you using any stat food Azlana? First time I made a magelo I was missing stats and that is where they were from. Perhaps you forgot to plug in your food items. Just a guess of mine since I haven't peaked at your magelo just yet :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That wouldnt help her if her magleo has more hp then her ingame character:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">same for me. only i only have like 80hp more. So i say norrath makes it the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">are you sure you put in the correct starting stats? <br />
<br />
if everything is correct maybe the best way is to adjust your sta stats and that should bring your magelo profile closer to your norrath profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The HP formula is correct up to level 60 for sure. I don't know how accurate they made it past 60, as some things may have changed. Do any of you other 60+'s have any discrepency's? <br />
<br />
Mine is right on target...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my's hps match dead on with my magelo at 65.  make sure all yer gear matches, take a screenie when yer dead to chk yer starting stats (adjusting for any aa's u may have put into sta) and make sure yer AA's are all updated.  Other than that and ching stat food, I cant think of ant other reason why they wouldnt match.  If they still dont, have a few more beers and chk again tomorrow!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If your AC and ATK are off, check to make sure you put in the correct values for all your offensive and defensive skills (especially defense since your ac is off).<br />
<br />
Heh, when I used to have an iksar regen bp, I used to always forget to switch back to my normal bp, and died with it on more than I'd like to admit =p</div></div><hr />
