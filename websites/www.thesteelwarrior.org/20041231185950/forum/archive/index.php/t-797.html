<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has recently come to my attention that the Wyverns in Cobalt Scar (the drakes too IIRC) will drop the Velious Quest Gems. It has also come to my attention that at Level 38 (Me) and Level 41 (My wife's Druid) these may be marginally doable by us.<br />
<br />
Now, any comments on whether these CAN be done at these levels (or maybe if we wait til I am 40).<br />
<br />
It seems to me that stockpiling (or selling) these Gems, would definately be a good thing for the future, so this area would be lucrative for both XP and money.<br />
<br />
The mobs seem to be in our level, the only drawback I can see is that if I die (which I am sure I will at first) I will have to get a higher level to port me back in each time til my wife gets to 44.<br />
<br />
Barring that negative, any comments on whether this will be worth it?<br />
<br />
I played her Druid a bit while she was out of town last weekend and ported into CS a few times for Ulthork tusk turn-ins and it was pretty much empty everytime.<br />
<br />
Any opinons are appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cobalt Scar tends to be kiter territory.  If you and your wife can find mobs up to hunt, then you should probably do well.  There is one or two named mobs that spawn in the area, one which is pretty common and will clean your clock no problem, him you should just avoid.  The other is a Dragon that only spawns on a seven day cycle iirc.<br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind is that I believe the Wyverns will give you negative Skyshrine faction hits.  Maybe not a big deal, unless you expect to get Skyshrine quested armor some day.  If so, you're just making your faction work harder, but it may be worth it in the short term if the experience is good and you can stockpile the gems.  Only you can really determine that for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did some background on a few of those issues already.<br />
<br />
From what I've READ none of the creatures (EXCEPT those two named) will lower Skyshrine faction (anyone verify)<br />
<br />
The other thing (about kiter territory) Like I said, it always seemed empty the 4 or 5 times I was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned the normal wyverns do NOT have any faction hits so that will not be a problem.  The point about dieing is a valid one unless you clear and camp up near the Skyshrine zone line.  On MithMarr it is often refered to as the tower and has 4 or 5 static wyvern spawns there.<br />
<br />
As for actually killing them at your level 38 warrior/41 druid respectively I have a feeling that the damage output might be too much for the druid to handle.  I haven't hunted them in ages but I remember as a bard at level 60 with skyshrine quest level gear going toe to toe with them was not easy.  Granted I understand that differences between a warrior and a bard but keep in mind that is also a 22 level difference in favor of the bard.<br />
<br />
Best bet would be to gate in and try it, make sure the druid is ready to gate both of you out.  You will know based on how much damage you take in first twenty seconds if you two could effectively hunt them.</div></div><hr />

You can do them all day long as a duo and rake in big cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you can stockpile gems for your own future use or just kill in the areas mentioned for exp but you aren't going to make any money at all trying to sell Velious quest gems.  Even the BP/robe gems only fetch a few hundred pp at most, and that's assuming people actually buy the ones you see for sale ... which I kind of doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flawless Diamond, (BP), sells for a good 1.5-2k on Tholuxe Paells, but than again our economy is whacked...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my time hunting Wyverns I found that they drop flawed / chipped gems which sell for around 40pp to a vendor.  The only slots you will get gems for a warrior from the wyverns are the arms and legs, not sure which you will get for a druid.<br />
<br />
However as mentioned above because the wyverns are such popular territory for kiters the market is pretty well flooded with these gems so don't expect to ever get more than 75-100pp for them.  The real popular quest gems are all crushed (crushed topaz and crushed flame emeralds in particular) which you need to go to Velks / Sirens grotto for.<br />
<br />
Wyverns have around 3khps and hit for up to 100 so you may find its a little steep for your druid to keep you healed without too much down time.  I certainly found that in my high 40's when I duo'd a few with a druid it was hard work and the druid could kill them much more efficiently without my help - however this was towards the end of velious and my gear back then was spectacularly crap compared to the kit you can buy in the bazaar today so that in itself may make this alot easier for you.<br />
<br />
I agree with what the dude above said about Crystal Caverns - nice XP and you can walk out with some pretty decent cash at the end of a session even - gems and also crystalline silk and velium which sell well to tradeskillers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quad kiter heaven.  I stopped playing my wizard at 52.  If you're lucky enough to be on a server without cobalt scare being &quot;the&quot; quad kiting zone for druids and wizard lvl 51 - 55, you're lucky.  I notice a strange pattern on BB.  The zone will be more available during prime time and less available during off hours.  Weird, I know.   It seems like on BB that the quadders quad on off hours and group during weeknight evening primetime hours.<br />
<br />
My attitude toward cobalt scar as a quad kiter was different than my attitude is now as a warrior.  As a quadder, it didn't matter as much if the zone was crowded because the quadder can just run around with one or two drakes in tow until more are found.<br />
<br />
For the rest of us, it's a lot more difficult because we don't wanna circle the entire zone a few times.<br />
<br />
in CS on BB there really isn't any respected camps.  Sometimes people insist on the rest of the zone respecting the 5 spawn at SS entrance; however, many times ppl ks the 5 spawn when someone's demanding respect for the camp.  The only consistent form of camp respect I've seen is when someone's sitting in front of a wyvern which has spawned, ppl usually leave the spawn alone so that the quadder can wait for the rest to spawn in order to pull them all.<br />
<br />
I sometimes do CS with my wife; however, I didn't find it really doable until high 40s low 50s with cleric / warrior duo.  You can get these quest gems in different places if that's you're motiviation.<br />
<br />
/agree on the geo camp, great money for the level range.  If CS isn't crowded on you're server, the geo camp might not be crowded either.  My personal record for the geo camp is 1k in one hour; however, the average is more like 2.2 k in 6 hours I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the responses. My real thought was stockpiling gems for use in our guild (actually our new guild which we joined 2 nights ago, though I haven't fixed my sig yet). I like to be helpful to others, and a few ways I can figure of doing this are with these gems. I will be doing the velious armours if for no other reason then beacause I can't buy better armour. If I am farming gems, I might as well keep the ones that I won't use for the rest of my guild, right?<br />
<br />
Guess it just all floats in what I want to get out of my guild and what I am willing to put in.</div></div><hr />

 People like you make guilds better, eventhough you are trying to get the gems for yourself but you are also thinking of others.  <br />
