Were they all using self buffs or were they all sporting raid buffs. If the former is true than its an even worse example of class imbalance.

<br />
Six Paladins with elemental loot could pull off a mana pool of 24k.  That is A LOT of HP to heal back (at least 50 straight casts of Light of Nife) ignoring any FT or Clarity or Focus which they would probably have.  Unless they take more than 50k in damage or they waste mana no one is going to die.<br />
<br />
The one thing that is fairly apparent in LDoN is that &quot;normal&quot; level is fairly tolerant of odd group configurations.  If you don't look outside of the lines a little you don't see how stuff like a six Paladin does work.</div></div><hr />

gorenaire didnt even take 6 paladins, just 1 (hmm)<br />
6 paladins in a LDoN group at 65 (hmm)<br />
<br />
now that i ask him if he thinks its about time for a narf like he called for necros(killing yellow and red mobs)/wizards(dragon manaburning)/shamans(said that they can solo lodi) he tells me he doesnt want to argue about it, or something similer.<br />
<br />
i wonder what it will take before knights will admit that their class is to strong? i mean if the average paladin had sat down and hadwritten out what they thought would be insain changes to their class a few months back, most of them would seem mundain now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins will never admit, in significant numbers, that their class is too strong.  Just as Enchanters wouldn't do it when charm was so powerful.  Just like Wizards with manaburn.  Just like every single class that has been SoE's darling at one time or another only to have the rug eventually pulled out from under them.<br />
<br />
While I'm not arguing that Paladins are overpowered, I know that even if they were, they wouldn't admit it.  And I firmly believe that in today's game environment Warriors are grossly underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is picking and choosing events like soloing Gorenaire and 6 Paladin LDoN runs is kind of a straw man situation.<br />
<br />
In this case, what is the qualification that Paladins are too strong?  That they are able to make a 6 Paladin group and run a Normal LDoN Adventure?  There is no logical connection between overpowered and performance in LDoN.  Or at least no one has made the case yet beyond &quot;nerf them&quot;.<br />
<br />
So why are Paladins too strong?  Please define this for me instead of some vauge assertions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point is that paladins are overpowered. Glatius might not want to say it but I will. They solo better, group better, and have a very useful raid role (raid roles actually -- what raid wouldn't want a paladin in every group?).<br />
<br />
And how are these examples straw men? They actually happened, and they illustrate exactly how valuable paladin utility power is. The utility power, by the way, that warriors don't have, and that paladins generally refuse to acknowledge. They don't happen every day certainly. What happens every day is that paladins outshine warriors in any situation of gameplay that doesn't involve /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
No way could a druid + 5 warriors do to MM what those paladins did. Not even close. The case of 6 warriors is of course a sad joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're making a mountain out of a molehill. 5 warriors and a druid could do what they did to mistmoore, along with the 4 other themes. In fact, they could likely do it faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have completed the last 3/4 of an adventure with a bard healer only. The healing requirements, pulling requirements, and DPS requirements just arent all that tough for elemental geared, 200+ AA characters.<br />
<br />
Do I think that knight vs warriors are balanced? No, but I dont think this is a very good proof of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think of this as having indicative significance, rather than direct significance. It doesn't prove anything, but it certainly illustrates something: namely, those utility abilities and that spellbook represent a very serious source of power.<br />
<br />
And I really think a lot of people are kidding themselves. The game is seriously out of whack. I just watched a bard SOLO 50-60 mobs in a SINGLE pull. He got 2.5 AA in just over 20 minutes, and never took a single point of damage. I know of necros who got 30+ AA in a single day pre-charm nerf. And now paladins have been kicking warrior butt in exp groups for at least a year.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, SoE doesn't appear to have clue one what is going on with their game. Doors in Freeport, spells, spells and yet more spells -- and nothing addressing pretty serious fundamental balance questions (except those that came very late, like the monk mitigation nerf or the charm nerf), never mind the very serious game design flaws of PoP itself.<br />
<br />
And I think LDoN is going to be bad for warriors, at least for semi-casual warriors. From where I sit, on normal mode, quality rangers and beasts will be tanking soon. Knights are clearly preferable (I think especially shadow knights will shine). But hard mode looks like it will exclude any pre-VT or possibly even pre-elemental tank.</div></div><hr />

What are all our other choices Aeka ?  Playing lame-ass gimp 2nd rate DPS if all the monks/rangers/druids/wizzes/mages/SK's/rogues/necros/etc are all taken, and the only other alternative is a pally ?  Oh, I know, we can bind wound too !</div></div><hr />

I would tend to think 6 65 warriors with nice gear and lots of AAs could definitely do well against a dungeon...just need the right weapons. :D  Don't know if they'd win, but would do nicely.<br />
<br />
Are knights powerful?  Yes.  All the hybrids are powerful now, I'll admit.  Are warriors underpowered?  Hell yes, I cannot see how SOE can possibly see that hybrids have any significant disadvantages other than a mana pool, which by 60s you should know how to ration, while melee are so powerful the other classes needs tons of upgrades in order to be competitive with. (that last part was sarcasm, or the way SOE seems to think about melee)<br />
<br />
And I've sat down and tried to think.<br />
<br />
On the downside, this overpowered-ness of knights is causing one thing...some people making those classes and not having a goddam clue on how to play it, yet they can get to Tier2 easily.  Those same people are now seriously hurting in dungeons because they simply don't know everything about how to play their class which they SHOULD have learned in the past 55 levels.  I actually had to teach a SK to hold agro in PoI...she was using spears and lifetaps (not very good agro), and running oom every couple of fights.  I've had to do so with paladins, as well.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the rest of you up in Tier3+, but it's getting scary down here...all the decent people are 62+ and don't even come to the lower planes or elsewhere anymore except on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
caster classes most might. Maybe wizards would have an issue<br />
hybred class 2 out of 4 could not do it safe<br />
melee classes none<br />
<br />
I say this is more of a melee balance issue. Not a pally issue.<br />
<br />
But my question is.<br />
<br />
Other than being needed to tank 1% of the mobs for 3 min.<br />
What is the advantages of picking a warrior over a hybred class?<br />
<br />
Balance is achived when you pick a class and it is as good of a choice as any other class in every situation. There will always be class envy. But this goes beyond that. <br />
<br />
Answer my question if you can. If you cannot. then theres an issue with class balance with warriors. Might be for other melee as well but I think thats more of a dps issue. <br />
<br />
I would be happy if they just upped our dps so we could be considered a dps class at this point. But again this would require hybreds to not be upgraded at the same time. If you upped warrior dps and upped pallys at the same time that would only cause more of an issue.<br />
<br />
And no.. I dont think we are a dps class when I pull 80 dps normally. maybe less. And a dps class pulls 140 or higher. (too early to go look at what classes really do as far as dps but i know warriors are not close to a real dps class)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Statements like this have a certain rhetorical resonance, but they make no actual connection with reality. Possibly without realizing it, Aeka here suggests that warrior utility is equivalent to paladin utility, which is of course a joke. I chip out maybe 70-75 dps. My ONLY non-tanking utility function is /shield, which increases *mob* dps 25% for 12 seconds. WTF am I supposed to do in a group if I'm not tanking for it? Tell knock-knock jokes? A hell of a lot more paladins get utility spots in groups than warriors get dps slots.</div></div><hr />

6 wizards?<br />
<br />
I don't believe it. A few resisted roots later, and now you have 5 wizards -- and no rez. Anything less than 6 completing the mission isn't a success. And I'd like to see the 6 enchanters or the 6 clerics with the dps to clear out the dungeon in 44 minutes. If they try to charm their way through it to get the dps I hope they have some solid bind wound skills to deal with the inevitable resists. I really think people saying stuff like this are just tossing stuff out, and wildly underestimating the value of the hybrid utility functions. <br />
<br />
Where the enchanters and wizards (and warriors) suffer is in being specialized classes. All the hybrid classes look great. And that's exactly how it's playing out. Name a hybrid class. Their broad base of skills ensures they'll be fine. Name a specialist class. Pretty easy to think of reasons why they'll fail. Today's EQ is mudflated, and mudflation favors generalists. And non-mana using specialists (pure melee) are on the short end of the short stick. <br />
<br />
AA and gear dramatically increase character power. But the point at which people get exp from mobs is fixed. Hybrids, who have a broader power base, get more relative gain from every increment of mudflation than any specialist, who are already closer to the diminishing return point. Cases like soloing Gorenaire and the MM adventure don't mean much in themselves, but they illustrate the bigger problem, which is a structural flaw in the game that is killing specialists, especially those that don't use mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I said anyone who thinks a Paladin is only a tank is sadly mistaken just like Warriors who only want to tank.<br />
<br />
But Warriors are only a tank and nothing more.  I guess we agreed this is how Warriors got screwed in the first place.  Warriors who think they can and should do nothing more than tank are doomed.  All of the mitigation in the game will not make Warriors more attractive unless <br />
<br />
I would love to see a radical shift in Warriors.  There is nothing in the mechanics of the game that says that Warriors can't be a tank and something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
They killed it in 44mins. Pretty slow, honestly.<br />
<br />
Extremely slow when you're trying to use it to prove a class is out of balance.  <br />
<br />
I've done Mistmoore missions in &lt;20 minutes, with only a necromancer as a healer, and I know for a fact a 6 elemental warrior group would get through the same zone as fast or faster than 6 paladins.</div></div><hr />

Your cleric DPS point is taken.  I was also assuming full range of buffs before going into the dungeon, because the Paladin group was 'fully raid buffed'.<br />
<br />
I think 6 enchanters could do it without charming anything.  At this level of AA I would assume they have Animation Empathy.  Animation Empathy gives them control over their animations similar to what other classes get on their pets.  Even though their pets aren't great, they could summon pets for added DPS.  They could slow and stun every mob.  They could AE stun and nuke to kill several at once.  A full group of enchanters would be very formidable.<br />
<br />
Wizards also get roots and a few stuns.  If they keep the pulls reasonable I see no reason why 6 Wizards all with root and stun memmed wouldn't be able to complete a mission.  The trick would be not to let the mobs hit them more than once or twice.  This would allow runes to keep them from taking any real damage, not to mention they would probably have well over 5k HP anyway.   Once a mob is rooted the PCs can move a bit away and nuke the thing to death.  Keep one or even two wizards on 'stun duty' to stop ones that break root and you go a long way toward eliminating the problem.<br />
<br />
Level 65 characters with over 100 AA are quite powerful, and can do some surprising things if you take the time to think it through.<br />

I don't think 6 warriors going to be able to clear through a dungeon of 400 hitters with no healing in 44 minutes.  And SU paladins with SEWSs are definitely going to outdamage any warrior in the game on undead.</div></div><hr />

All of the puslings, spiders, wisps, werewolves and gargoyles are *not* flagged undead.  We actually got the one MM map that I had doubts about us beating.<br />
<br />
As for what other classes can do it, I can think of strategies that would work for most probably (assuming a similar level of AA's and gear):<br />
<br />
Necros - They've already done it in Miraguls, no problem there.<br />
Mages - Again, zero problems. If they did it in Takish they could even mez/charm a lot.<br />
Enchanters - I had an enchanter go all the way through with a single pet last night, they would have zero problems.<br />
Wizards - Root nuke might work, a bad pull could pose problems. Remember that similarly geared wizards are going to have 6k+ hp.<br />
<br />
Druids - Same as wizards but with added fault tolerance (can heal) and moderately less DPS. Again, assume 6k+ hp<br />
Clerics - Could probably use a tactic similar to the one we used, stun everything to mitigate its damage but nuke in addition to melee, shouldn't be a problem<br />
Shaman - lower DPS but could still finish easy<br />
<br />
Shadowknights - They say on their board they could do it easy, I'd guess they probably could<br />
Rangers - Easy <br />
<br />
Rogues - Stack up on regen gear, would be pretty challenging and kinda slow once they got beat up a bit<br />
Monks - Bandage AA's + mend, they would have no trouble at all<br />
Warriors - Regen items + ethereal stun weapons in offhand would probably do the trick willsappers would help decrease mob DPS as well slow but doable<br />
<br />
I might round up 6 warriors and give it a shot just for kicks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AA and gear dramatically increase character power. But the point at which people get exp from mobs is fixed. Hybrids, who have a broader power base, get more relative gain from every increment of mudflation than any specialist, who are already closer to the diminishing return point. Cases like soloing Gorenaire and the MM adventure don't mean much in themselves, but they illustrate the bigger problem, which is a structural flaw in the game that is killing specialists, especially those that don't use mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or to put it more simply, generalists gain more power overall because they have more areas in which to gain power and have more room for improvement to begin with.  As the game inflates everyone upward, a specialist hits the point of diminishing returns sooner and therefore continues to make very small gains compared to the generalist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Riiiiiight.<br />
<br />
See, awhile back SOE decided to do JUST that. They picked a monk and a warrior and created some mathematical models of vex thal encounters based on high end luclin and velious levels of gear and AA.<br />
<br />
Why did they do this?<br />
<br />
Because in a STRAW MAN situation, some monks were being used a RAMPAGE tanks.<br />
<br />
If SOE follows suit, the fact that paladins are gimping their content by doing the 6 paladin swing on an LDoN adventure can mean only one thing ...<br />

The nerf bat is in the on deck circle.<br />

<br />
Did they take it too far? yeah.  They took away mitigation without adding in some avoidance to help cope.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for warriors doing this... I bet they can.   There are slow weapons a plenty for them.  Get buffs and go.  If my math is right you can bind wound around 90hps per bandage.  With 6 warriors binding you can heal right at 550-600 per click.  Add in warrior regen and there should be no problem for them to go thru and do this.  <br />
<br />
In the end you can't neglect the fact that warriors are supreme for raids and paladins are better suited for softer hitting exp mobs.  In this case paladins are in a situation they are better suited for.  <br />
<br />
Put them to a task where they have to fight a mob hitting for high amounts of damage and they won't be able to do it.  Not enough healing power nor enough tanking power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple of warriors get to pop defensive -- woot. Every other warrior is sitting there eating up healer mana from AE and contributing pretty mediocre dps. Meanwhile, 10 paladins can still contribute wonderfully on raids by using, shockingly, the very utility abilities paladins continually assure us don't actually mean anything. A paladin in every raid group -- sounds great, don't have to worry about AE or adds so much now, and if there are undead targets we're kicking ass, plus our LoH cycle is rocking. A warrior in every group -- what the fuck for? Basically, the fact that a few warriors get to be comparative stars is balanced against the fact that paladins stack much better on raids.<br />
<br />
And of course, what about warriors who don't raid? They're just fucked in exp groups for no reason whatsoever? We already know knights both solo AND farm a lot better than warriors.<br />

At the TIME of these models, Vex Thal was the be all end all of Everquest.<br />

Which means it was just a FEW cases, because even across ALL servers there was only a tiny percent of the population even DOING these encounters.<br />
<br />
The best of the best geared monks.<br />

So yeah, it was a few cases of monks being used as rampage tanks. It was a few well geared monks of the time like a Denzalo or an Arlos.<br />
<br />
It certainly wasn't a Wubao being a rampage tank back then.<br />
<br />
Which parallells this nonsense. It's a SELECT group of Paladins tearing up an encounter that really they shouldn't be able to do like that.<br />

It's the same benchmark used to nerf monks.<br />

Warriors have always maintained it was far more than a &quot;few&quot;.  You know and I know that one of the primary reasons that Monks soloed as well as they did comparatively to Warriors was because they took damage much like a Warrior did.  Many Warriors had also seen many cases where Monks were being used as tanks and doing just as well as a comparitively geared Warrior.  I remember very clearly grouping with a guild Monk in Velks back in the day, and realizing that there was no perceptable difference in my ability to tank versus his ability to tank.  Except he had mend, FD, and significantly higher damage output.  Of course, I did have a taunt key, for all that was worth.  And his gear was not particularly high end, far from it in fact.  My gear was actually overall harder to get and better.  Yet there he was, tanking just about as well as me.</div></div><hr />

I remember the days of monks soloing Velks and even tanking over me at the same level of gear.  I wasn't too thrilled with it either.  <br />
<br />
I would argue that POP changed the monk mitigation nerf into something useless.  Your average level 60 monk with 20 AA's and a fungi and a t-staff who could nearly chain-solo spiders in velks is now getting smacked to hell and back on a normal valor pull.  <br />
<br />
Maybe the mitigation nerf was justified, but times change, expansions come out.  SOE should be taking a look at issues that might have changed due to these expansions.  Not just itemization.  Actually sitting down and making some changes.</div></div><hr />

Warriors didn't get screwed because they could only tank. They got screwed because the only thing they could do became something Knights could do better (in addition to all the other things Knights can do that Warriors can not).<br />
<br />
The problem is easily repaired:<br />
<br />
Have vendors sell stackable 10-charge Swollen Fungusbeast Glands for 1g.<br />
<br />
Have the Adventure Merchants sell 600 EB proc weapon augmentations (Warrior only) for 200 points<br />
<br />
Double all weapon proc rates (it will increase the frequency of melee damage procs as well as EB procs)<br />
<br />
Lower the Knight Defensive skill by 20% instead of having it exactly the same as Warriors.<br />
<br />
All fixed.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet you'd find even your huge amount of utility cold comfort if SoE delivered on what it says in the Warrior Class Description:<br />

my problem with paladins in general is they complain or ask for something, and lo and behold its added in spell form, and that had happend to much that they now just about the premer tanking class, also getting to the point of tanking mobs that were once considered warrior only, and finally they can kill dragons and own LDoN mistmore, IMHO it looks like they are running the bases, can you point out the penalty the pay for all this? i mean being a hybrid to start with? i dont really see a negative side to being a paladin at all</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which means, in Velk's Lab, I've NEVER had to rampage tank. Not as a monk. Not as a warrior.<br />
<br />
So which is it? Is it that monks could solo VELKS spiders (which, btw, with a truncheon of doom, even WARRIORS could solo velks spiders) and that's why they got nerfed?<br />
<br />
Or was it that monks in VEX THAL gear could RAMPAGE tank Vex Thal monsters? A very situational encounter with a very small percentage of the monks?<br />
<br />
<br />
According to Sony, and Absor and Scott Hartsman, it's because monks could rampage tank. According to Furor it's because monks rampage tanked and tanked a lot of trash mobs in raid settings.<br />
<br />
So what does Velks soloing, an activity that Rangers, Paladins, Monks, WARRIORS, and yes EVEN ROGUES could do ... have ANYTHING to do with the monk nerf?<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides ... the parallell still exists ... right now I see Paladins XP tanking better than warriors. I see the 6-uber-paladin group doing something that they probably shouldn't in LDoN. And of course there's the paladin that solo'd Gorenaire thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no real disagreement about it.  Warriors constantly out tank SKs and Paladins.  No iffs or butts.  Pound for pound, Warriors just do it measurably better.  Whether or not the gap is wide enough for anyone's comfort is a subject of debate but the fact remains that Warriors do tank better.<br />
<br />
The problem is that game has changed to the point where tanking is such a minimal part of the game.  Need something parked?  Tanking won't help.  Need someone healed?  Tanking won't help.  Need a stun to stop a gater from poofing?  Tanking won't help.  On and on.  So many exp situations require skills beyond tanking.  Where do Warriors fit in?  No where.<br />
<br />
I recently was in an adventure where there were a SK, Warrior and me.  We let the Warrior tank not because they were better but because it sucks being the fifth wheel.<br />
<br />
All of the mitigation in the world won't fix Warriors.  Double and tripple the mitigation given to Warriors.  You will still be the same neglected class just hoping the heals land in time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SK's can and DID the exact same job at the exact same time. Not all guilds used Monks to RT. <br />
<br />
When you figure out why monks made good RT's you'll realize why the nerf was stupid. It had nothing to do with their AC or their mitigation. And everything to do with how Rampage works.</div></div><hr />

I'll tell you right out that by the time the Monk nerf came about I'd seen Monks rampage tank like twice.  But I'd sat down and done some figuring.  Prior to NToV Monks had always had a difficult time coming up with gear with high AC.  Which was one of the only reasons their AC stayed within spitting distance of a Warrior's, due to their inherant 200 AC avoidance AC advantage.  Once NToV gear was factored into the equation, their AC took off like a shot, leaving a Warrior significantly behind.<br />
<br />
Now, you want to tell me that the problem was really only high end Monks who were rampage tanking, fine, tell me that.  SoE wants to tell me the problem was only high end Monks who were rampage tanking, fine they can tell me that.  Furor wants to tell me that the problem was only high end Monks who were rampage tanking, fine Furor can tell me that.  But I don't believe any of you.  Prior to NToV Monks ran neck and neck with Warriors in their ability to tank and did so using gear that was substantially easier to get.  A fungi tunic might have been expensive, but it was far easier to aquire than a Champions BP.  Once Monks got to NToV, they began to blow Warriors away, except for the uberest most heavily geared Warrior.<br />
<br />
And Monks damn well knew it.  They crowed about it.  They reveled in it.  There were even long threads on Monkly Business about how the Monk was the most efficient tank once you factored in their Mend and the additional damage they brought to the table.<br />
<br />
So please, don't try revisionist history here.  The problem was NOT just high end Monks who were rampage tanking.  Now, if you want to argue that PoP made the Monk tanking ability fairly moot and that in the end HP became more important, then we probably wouldn't disagree a great deal.<br />
<br />
All the same, if left as they were, Monks would still be owning mobs from prior expansions while thumbing their noses at Warriors.  And I damn well know you know it, because we've read many of the same threads over on MB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the time of the monk nerf, the monks in my guild had more AC than I did.  So they had better avoidance AND better or equal mitigation to a warrior.  That was wrong.  Argue all you want about whether they went about it right, but high end monks were overpowered, and it had nothing to do with rampage.  Monks could outtank a warrior on anything that didn't require a CH chain or defensive.<br />
<br />
A monk is NOT a tank.  There's no way they should take less damage tanking a mob than a warrior, and I don't give a damn whether they're doing it with avoidance or mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it wasnt that a small percentage of monks were uber enough to rampage tank in Vex Thall, its that the small percentage of monks did it better than the small percentage of similarly equiped warriors, paladins and shadow knights.<br />
<br />
Because VT monks had comparable mitigation and superior avoidance than VT geared plate tanks, its safe to assume that a velious geared monk would have comparable mitigation and superior avoidance to a velious geared plate tank, and the dude with the fungi and the T staff in velks mitigates as well as the poor guy with a couple of lammy's, some cobalt and a barbed ringmail, and still has superior avoidance.<br />
<br />
About a year ago I was in a guild that was doing NToV, sticking its nose into Ssra a little, killing Tunare and Cazic etc.  The guilds top warriors were hitting about 4.5k hps unbuffed and the monks were at about 4k, warriors were at about 1300AC and monks were at 1300AC - go go itemisation. (wtf are my 60AC 100HP legs from velious huh?).  The guild wasnt end game by any stretch but we were using our monks to Rampage tank because compared to our warriors they did it better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jat5</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Monk class was once balanced upon the same mitigation table as warriors using items with significantly lower ac and a smaller hp pool. Meaning they could take a hit just as well as a tank class with crappy gear for a short period of time requiring more heals. <br />
<br />
After a couple expansions worth of really stinkin poorly balanced itemization the monk class got too close to tank class ac / hp and started causing problems, for which they got smacked down. Unfortunately, itemization errors were corrected with a change in the classes core functionality that doesn’t scale fairly across levels, but it helped in the short term.<br />
<br />
Now, with mobs hitting much harder and more reasonable itemization, you are looking at monks having ~ 1700 ac and ~ 6k hp’s compared to warriors with ~2200 ac and 9k hp, with knights weighing in around the ~2100 ac and ~7k hp mark. (eq rankings) It’s not surprising they would be complaining about getting the double whammy now that they’re back to the low ac / small hp pool situation once called balance with higher mitigation.<br />
<br />
But, then again I thought we were talkin about the paladins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not talking revisionist history here.<br />
<br />
The simple fact of the matter is ... monks weren't SUPERIOR rampage tanks. They were just EQUAL rampage tanks to the knights. The only difference was, since monks pulled a lot, they ended up on the rampage LIST a lot.<br />
<br />
I'd love for someone here to post about their experiences with Vex Thal monks PRE-PoP, TANKING in VT and endgame Luclin encounters.<br />
<br />
I'd LOVE to see a parse, for instance, of a level 60 pre-nerf monk tanking Arch Lich or Cursed. And I mean TANKING.<br />
<br />
Another myth being propogated in this thread is AVOIDANCE AC.<br />
<br />
Monks do not have Avoidance AC. Come on, I can't believe I read that shit here. One of the best things about this board is how much great data and parses are on it. And on this very board I've read parses showing how avoidance AC simply does not exist.<br />
<br />
The only difference between a monk with 1200 AC and a warrior with 1200 AC PRE-nerf was that block would fire off more often for a monk than parry fired off for warriors.<br />
<br />
And really not that much MORE often, since neither skill fired off at such an alarming rate to make anyone take notice.<br />
<br />
What's sad is ... monks can and DID lag behind all of the other &quot;tank&quot; classes in Hit Points. Even at that level of the game. No matter how many 100 hp items a monk could equip, a knight or warrior could ALSO equip them. And they had more BASE hps.<br />
<br />
So the knights and warriors always made better tanks. And they even made good choices for RAMPAGE tank.<br />
<br />
A lot of guilds even used the knights to BE rampage tanks back then.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
But ... that's all in the past.<br />
<br />
And what you're missing right now is the PRESENT.<br />
<br />
If 6 paladins can rip through an LDoN adventure ... and if a paladin can solo kunark dragons ... and a paladin makes a superior XP group tank in PoP ... and a Paladin with GUARD procs and the VIE line of spells can approach the mitigation of DEFENSIVE warriors ...<br />
<br />
I mean ... really ... you gotta wonder if it's not time to WAKE UP and realize who the real problem is and always was.<br />
<br />
Not monks. FELLOW melee bretheren who are ALSO being gimped by hybrids (ask a monk how awesome it is to see the HYBRID version of them, beastlords, MITIGATE so much better than them ... or for a monk to notice that a druid with LR 5 is just as good a tank as they are).<br />
<br />
This is more than just monks being good XP group tanks because the mobs don't hit hard, and being used as rampage tanks (a job warriors didn't get ANYWAYS because they were on the MT rotation). This is about hybrids being better than warriors at ACTUAL tanking. The real deal heavy stuff.<br />
<br />
In short, you've all been hoodwinked. All that crap about monks ... and the whole time it was the knights taking your job.<br />
<br />
And LDoN just makes it more and more apparent.<br />
<br />
But HEY ... Alan certainly thinks there'll BE TONS of options for warriors in LDoN. Because it's such a balanced expansion and because the classes aren't all that out of balance.</div></div><hr />

Show me the legs that a warrior could have worn in velious era that had 100 hp. Show me the legs that a warrior could have worn in velious era that had 60 AC. Now try and show me the legs in velious era that had 60 AC AND 100 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wubao, I'm not sure if you were talking to me, but I didn't say monks had higher aviodance AC, I said they had better avoidance.  They do.  The only person I have ever heard about talking about &quot;avoidance&quot; AC was a monk from my guild that liked to tell me he didn't tank better than me even though he had 100 more ac because his ac was 'aviodance' ac.   <br />
<br />
In Velious, in addition to their better avoidance, they also had equal or better AC, so they took less damage tanking ANY mob than a warrior.  Personally I don't give a damn if it was boss mobs, rampage, or blizzard spiders, if a monk is tanking something and taking less damage than an equally equipped warrior, that is wrong and needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
If you disagree with this then we have nothing to talk about.  You can say they were wrong to correct an itemization problem with class nerf, but there was no doubt that there was an imbalance that needed to be corrected, and if you can convince yourself that there wasn't then you must not remember the same game that I played.</div></div><hr />
