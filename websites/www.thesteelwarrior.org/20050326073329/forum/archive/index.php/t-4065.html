<br />
I'm trying to find a benchmark event in order to aim for when my regular raid attendee's are ready to begin attempting raid events. Are Vox and Nagafen the first targets one should go for? or are there other creatures that should be attempted first before risking a dragon fight?<br />
<br />
Also if anyone can provide a site or guide with the Progression of who/where to go once you beat a certain Mob I'd be very appreciative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, even before those two were things like Phinigel Autropos and Master Yael in the Hole.<br />
<br />
Master Yael is gone now. Phinigel is always a fun fight. People definitely need to pay attention too.<br />
<br />
The only thing I would say is that level-restricted raids are really tough things to try and do for your guild.<br />
<br />
They are pick-up mostly because people level at different speeds.<br />
<br />
at the levels you begin to think about Naggy and Vox (i.e. all 52) I would start by trying to break into the Arena in Kael.<br />
<br />
You can get armor as rewards and learn to work with an MA, etc...<br />
<br />
The other real raid type things to try are Fear and Hate. (hate has been gimped, but you can still learn a few things.<br />
<br />
Just be careful that you have a backup plan if you get stuck Dead in Fear.<br />
<br />
Plane of Growth is similar but a little harder to those.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would put all my money on Kael. Learn to have a good MA, some good offtanking for any adds, splitting PoZ's, Learn to slow and debuff without dying.<br />
<br />
Once you know Kael really well, you can Move to Halls of Testing. Same idea as Kael, but you have to learn how to work with Area Effect Spells from Mobs.<br />
<br />
Holding everyone back till you get 18-36 people all level 52 to kill the dragons is not really the best thing for your guilld.<br />
<br />
Let your faster exp'ing people lead the charge into Kael and beyond, you won't regret it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well right now i've got about 2 groups with levels 37-45 and I'm trying to see how soon we can start trying some of the actual Raid events.<br />
<br />
For the moment the most we've attempted are low level dungeon raids (splitpaw) or zone raids (mistmoore) to get our techniques down.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately since i left preluclin and only recently returned, Vox and nagafen are about all the &quot;raid&quot; content i'm really informed on.<br />
<br />
Dont quite have enough people to even try a LDoN raid and i'm hoping to come up with something a little challenging to try our hand at once we can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is sooo much low content in EQ that you dont realize is there because most ppl want to just go there and get some item instead of having fun. If you are looking for fun raiding with friends tehre is tons!<br />
<br />
You can try raiding CoM reavers<br />
Go to Kedge<br />
Raid FGs/Naggy or IGs/Vox<br />
Clear Paw<br />
See how far down you can get to in Sebelis<br />
Raid Charasis/Howling Stones<br />
I dunno about hole since revamp but it would be a good place to explore with 2 groups of sub 50s to see how you do.<br />
See how far your force can get in Velektors<br />
<br />
Doing any of that will not give you and jaw droping loot by today's standards but it can be alot of fun. When I was in family guild I know I had tons of fun doing exactly same stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't want to try an LDoN raid anyway - they're targeted at 6 groups of at VT level folks for the easiest of them, so they're well beyond what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Casai, thats the kind of info i like to hear. Loot is nice but a good time is the main factor i'm looking for. I'll give some of those a shot.  Going to try Crystal Caverns and killing the queen this friday then i'll try one of your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crystal Caverns is a really fun zone, I always loved it myself. One I never did but many many people love for the fun of it is Tower of Frozen Shadow as well. 37-45 I think you guys could have a lot of fun in Nurga also, and get some drops that should actually be useful since the zone revamp. Good luck and have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The revamped Skyshrine is a very good place to learn and push your limits.  The mobs scale up smoothly from very easy level 35ish trash at Wakening Land entry (like shin knights in LGuk) and get slightly tougher every time you move to the next room or corridor, eventually ramping right up to level 62 mobs at the top.  At any given level, Skyshrine mobs are probably the easiest mobs in Velious for that level.  There is very rare loot to be found, but do it for the practice.  Bring a map.<br />
<br />
Phinigel in Kedge is also an outstanding suggestion, but I would not try that until your average level is at least 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">epic encounters are usually pretty easy, and are designed for a few groups of people between 50-60. kael is a good place to start testing a new guild as stated before. you'd probably want to work on the plate cycle in the mansion. later on, you can give vindi a shot, he seems to be the big mile stone for just about every 50+ guild, statue is alot easier than vindi. also during the 50-60 range, you should take a few trips to UP and do the lesser named mobs, and maybe even give Rumblecrush and Doomshade a shot. UP is a really good place for an up and coming guild to learn the basics and get some decent loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would avoid skyshrine though - you will want their faction later for when you head to HoT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As well as Kael, a good place I found to hone the troops was at the ZI in Umbral Plains, get 2 groups of mixed level people there and you can learn about mezzing, assisting, placement etc...tough run through ME tho at lower levels :)<br />
<br />
Quite a few named in UP too, so good drops occur that can be used by guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless I missed it, i can believe no one listed Tower of Frozen shadow!  ToFS was the zone where lots of people used to learn how to raid.  Multiple levels...keys...PHs...a really well designed zone imo.<br />
<br />
After ToFS we did Kael for quest armor, working our way into the arena and bank areas.<br />
<br />
Lots of other good zones listed above...just thought I'd toss in some props for ToFS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToFS is still a kickass zone.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend to anyone of the level and in need of raiding experience and getting your feet wet in the whole group_raid scene...go there ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For level 37-45, you really need to consider how you will get your corpses if you get wiped.  Lower guk dead side should be workable, invis to undead works on most mobs there, you can dungeon crawl to ghoul lord.  Velks is also nice, most spiders don't see invis.  You can also go to sol b, and camp the efreet for GEBs.  I'd be wary of crawling deep into sebilis or similar places, unless you can afford to summon a lot of corpses.  Long CRs really bite, they can turn off a lot of people who are depending on you to lead them and show them a fun time.  You seem to be looking for learning experiences, so be sure to stress this to your members, and plan ahead for the worst case, so you know what to do when a wipe occurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, Fortunately exploring places i shouldnt even be speaking of in secret has made me very experienced at CR's.<br />
<br />
We've also got a good Evac plan set and a druid with a 0 mana evac clickable. Saved our arses many a time.<br />
<br />
Great suggestions in here folks, i thank you all for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to say one thing first: Any list with Gorenaire and Phinigel on the same level isn't helpful to a guild working their way up unless they started a raid guild with pure 60th+ level members.<br />
<br />
I'd like to add in an agreement about ToFS and building to Kael plate cycle. Kael arena is actually somewhat easier than the plate cycle if your cautious and time repops but the drop's are so rare its mostly a time waster until your able to clear most of it between repops.<br />
<br />
One thing is that when your members hit 47th (keep 1-2 levels range in case of death) then consider going to the Plane of Hate. It's very good aa xp for me at 63rd so likely good xp even in a raid at that level and the new Hate has all the old armour and new drops of quest items (rare). It should upgrade a number of people over time and corpse runs and pulling are dramatically easier than before. Stay at the zone in and just keep pulling.<br />
<br />
Hate will also provide a lot of gems for cash and jewelry tradeskill resist items. Consider keeping some minor gems to cover peridot costs and coffins at raids and rotate Blue Diamonds/Diamonds to people needing resist items made. This can get contentious though. <br />
<br />
Btw, the raid list is mine from an old post on the monkly-business forums. Here's the old list thread and people's arguments either way on some mobs:<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=1123.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20<br />
<br />
The latest update is on this thread (reading this reminded me to post a long overdue update):<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=1228.topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tier 0<br />
Phinigel Autropos<br />
Gorenaire<br />
...<br />
<br />
LOL well, from a BARD's perspective, perhaps...any such list is going to be highly dependent on the levels/classes you have available. I thought that would have been self evident, but I guess not...<br />
<br />
Tier 3<br />
Statue of Rallos Zek<br />
...<br />
Doomshade<br />
<br />
err...no.<br />
<br />
Would suggest you take any lists herein, mine included, with a grain of salt, Daggorr - only one way to find out for sure, after all ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No worries, I won't have us go blindly marching off like lemmings on parade.  ;)<br />
<br />
My main goal was to at least get a listing of raid targets to research that way when were ready to begin Raiding specific target Mobs i'll be informed enoguh to choose the right starting point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidor</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I noticed no one seems to mention is Sebilis. Getting keyed at 37-45 isn't hard if careful and a buffed tracker is available. Your raid could easily sit at the zone in and pull to there until higher level when you can fight towards some of the front loot camps.<br />
<br />
From what I remember back then your people are more likely to be upgraded by getting 500pp and shopping in the bazaar than most upgrades you can see drop. So gems and cash from zones like Sebilis and Hate can be nice. Also learning to value resistances after you get hit with an Ice Comet is a learning experience useful later on in raiding.</div></div><hr />
