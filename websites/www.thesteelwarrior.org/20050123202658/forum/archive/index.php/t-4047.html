I've hit 247 sta unbuffed, and don't intend to do PP in quite some time, so with shaman buffs I'm always maxed out.  I'm in a family guild, so keep that in mind please when you make your suggestions.</div></div><hr />

(Greaves and other pieces) There's no shortage of that stuff on MM. The chain pants from CT have 65 hps, but not much AC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheap - steel wrapped leggings - 27AC 45HPs<br />
Cheapish - Kylong Shinguards - 35AC 45HPs<br />
Mid Price - SS MQ, Fine Heraldic etc - 40AC 40HPs <br />
Expensive - Ornate - 46AC 90HPs <br />
<br />
Its always been hard to get decent legs.  Camping (and winning) Ornate plate legs in BoT would be your best shot at good legs and you won't see anything worth upgrading to till Fennin is eating dirt at your feet.  Kylong shinguards are a decent cheap pair of legs to last you till then.<br />
<br />
Side note to this, helped a mate with Yeli faction so he could quest his tormax head the other day and we scored 3 pairs of thurg legs while we were at it (the drop rate seems way better these days then when I actually wanted the stuff) so we went and checked out the stats while we were deciding who's twink was going to get what.<br />
<br />
Warrior Thurgadin legs: 34AC, 9str, 7sta<br />
Cleric Thurgadin Legs: 24AC, 10wis, 80hps, 40mana, click cast group heal<br />
Shadow Knight SK Legs: 24AC, some stats, 60hps<br />
<br />
cleric gets 80hps, SK gets 60hps, we get zip.  Why did it take until PoP for us to notice we were getting the itemisation shaft?</div></div><hr />

Not huge hp upgrade, but could get em for free and earn a few points exp along the way :)<br />

<br />
Honestly though; if you still got the faction go hit HoT and get myrmidon greaves and gloves; maybe even a helm...Esp the gloves; they've got a big chunk of hit points on them.</div></div><hr />

Unless you wanna camp ornate. Another possilbity is greaves from Takish for 1490 points, they're somewhere from 80 to 100 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for your suggestions.  Zacc gets bonus points for noticing my diety was Mithaniel Marr from my sig.  Shik gets to go with me to the mall next time I'm in a power shopping mood. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also if you're having too much sta...ditch the 15sta bracelet and get the +40hp thing from Velks. They're all over the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
