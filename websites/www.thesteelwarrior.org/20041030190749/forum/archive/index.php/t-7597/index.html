<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe cuz it is way more aggro, dps/stats.<br />
It doesnt have more than normal procrate as darkblade do, but i guess the ratio more than make up for that, also 4 % shielding, yummy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still don't get why both this and DBoTW are primary only, not that I'll see either for a long time but it just seems screwed up that we can't use them both at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grocolo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Incase you missed it, that weapon is 1hs.  Also there is no increased proc rate which leads me to believe that it is not the final weapon for warriors in GoD.  Luclin (bf) and PoP's (dbotw) final warrior weapons both had increased proc rates, just a guess though.</div></div><hr />

Cold DMG 1? Why even bother putting that on there? Anyone care to enlighten me?<br />
<br />
Devs need to work out some more ways to advance character gear IMO<br />

PS whats with the primary only WAR weapons?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">weapon is a decent upgrade from dbow as far as dps.  they probably make them primary only because dbow+this would be too much aggro when you add in ancient chaos cry(best incite). maybe in next expansion things will change when more spells are added that should cause more aggro on casters.<br />

and crystal matrix please dont ever make suggestions to devs as you represent the warrior class when you say things like that. i dont like you making me look stupid =p</div></div><hr />

. Are you saying agro increasing spells for casters? Or just spells that cause more agro from their effects?</div></div><hr />

A personal attack was warranted, how? Please leave such comments for the outhouse. I don't care, start a &quot;crystalmatrix is stupid&quot; thread and have at it.</div></div><hr />

 Yeah, too bad the devs made shields so worthless. I would love to use a shield, but right now there just isn't any point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
85 or 90 ac shield with 2%+ shielding is worthless? <br />
<br />
<br />
Please do *US* a favor and not make suggestions aimed at the devs when you haven't the clue what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">90ac 4% shielding shields :D lets just hope it doesnt look like a Greatblade of the storms, like the icon suggests ^.^ but than again the &quot;augmented&quot; war epic also uses that graphic when turned in(though I never bothered turning mine in) and dont look like that ^.^ so we shall see.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm, lets see, I'm of the impression that most of your fellow warriors dual wield to hold agro not for the added DPS. Shields don't do that for ya's, sorry.<br />
<br />
 Also at that level of the game, I'm quite sure you can find other comparable items to make up for your piddily shield. Sure there are times when shiled could be useful, but far and away, DW is preferrable to using a shield at this point.<br />
<br />
Please, do *ME* a favor keep your slanderous comments to yourself in the future.<br />

 Yes, i suppose you have a point there which in that case it looks like they were indeed designed for use with a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There are offhand weapons avaible, so its not nessaricly designed for a shield, its jsut designed for the main hand, maybe designed for the shield in the sense that comparitivly you wont loose as much DPS with it as you would have with DW setup pre DB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My shield comment was a joke, lol. Not worth it for a warrior, as described in tons of places. Yes, situational use, blah blah blah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure they could do it with this, because of the lack of proc mod...but I wouldnt be surprised.<br />
<br />
Dual Wielding is a CHOICE, as is wielding a shield.  Anybody who tells someone they are an idiot for making one choice over another needs to shut up.  (I do not use a shield when I tank normally, btw -- I use my SEWS.  Yes, I am a magelo padder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">crystalmatrix when you make a complaint about devs on stuff you arent qualified to complain about it gives the whole warrior community less credit.  yes you have freedom of speech on a public board which is great but read the last sentence. <br />

<br />
not letting us dual weild our weapons ins mainly to keep our aggro/dps from going over the top. all hybrids really got going for them atm is there superior aggro and utility spells since they beefed  us up.</div></div><hr />

Just reread my posts a second ago, now where was I complaining? This is the last I'm going to respond to you offtopic in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">With a DBoW, lots of people use a shield regularly<br />
<br />
<br />
Not so sure I agree with that statement. My guildmates who weild a Darkblade, myself included, never use a shield with it. Maybe we're just a bunch of weirdos, but I tend to find an augmented EoE more beneficial to use than a shield of any sort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Shield is purely situational you noobs...  As a warrior, I would only use a shield, when I'm tanking RZtW (PoTime version) or any hardhitting, high repositing Boss mob.  The raw 90AC helps tons, the shielding mod, and of course you wont get reposite (or way less) from your offhand shield.  DBoTW (with 35 delay)will be enough agro to hold RZtW's attention on the MT and have WAY lesser reposites also.  When Im in groups doing xp, ldon, clearing mobs, or even tanking Sarynn, TT, and other Time phase 4-5 boss mobs (other than the Zeks or Quarm) then I use my EoE  to dualwield with DBoTW since those mobs don't reposite much and hit like pussies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Let's see: weapons with dmg greater than delay which are primary only, lowering our DPS, hinting to us to use shields. Anyone else notice they're making us knights without spells? Yes, no? Anyone?.... <br />
<br />
<br />
If they do, as long as I get a 10k harmtouch I'll be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">That seems to be a conspiracy theory, to me it seems like they are seperating mainhand weapons, and offhand weapons for endgame warriors, making mainhand weapons that are suffecient to hold aggro on their own, and having the offhand slot be for DPS or additional agro or additional AC/HP/Shielding.<br />
<br />
Making them DWable would mean they couldnt be as good primary hand, which probably isnt a good thing overall /shrug</div></div><hr />
