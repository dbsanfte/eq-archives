<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>harryfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Havn't been able to find this out. If I fail Krekk encounter, &amp; it ends up being that my raid force cannot try again ( I play on Sullon Zek, so there is a good chance of being trained and corpse camped ) will I have to do the epic quest all over again? Since he will have my items that I handed in?  :(</div></div><hr />

I think the event stay live for 30 minutes to 2 hours. so yoiu can CR and kill him.<br />
<br />
He's really easy to get to. My guild did it last night and we just invis'd everyone and ran in there. After clearing the Snakes surrounding him we did the event. The big this you'll need to remember is that you will have to deal with repops if you lose.<br />
<br />
He has a knock back,stun, and summons but isn't that difficult a mob. It's kind of a fun fight. You big timing problem is the repop of snake babes around him (10 ish of em).<br />
<br />
The big thing to do is just after clearing area to camp out and back to make sure there's no stupid aggro from pulling mobs around him. Not that this will make a difference but i couldn't hurt since people are saying its 'bugged'.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think what he is asking is what happens to the TURNED IN ITEMS if he is able to finish the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think what he is trying to ask is...what if he cant try a second time.<br />
<br />
Will he lose everything? How will he get his items back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tellis_Maelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">since you don't get the items back, <br />
<br />
1. If you turn in and lose the fight, then if the GM doesn't re-emburse your items becuase you failed the event, you start over. Or possibly you can go back to Korbuk and say &quot;what visions.&quot; Don't hail him because you start the script from the beginning. <br />
<br />
Note: What I found was that when you completed one part and you had in you hands the piece for that part, you couldn't go back in the script if you had that item. For instance if i had done the DS borer and lost battel but pick up ore, then i couldn't go back and retrigger the fight without destroying the ore.<br />
<br />
2. If you turn in and krekk eats it (buggy version) you petition GM and hope you get one that is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Druss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Came to City tonight to do mine, AGGRO version of Krekk was at zone in.  Apparently another dude failed a couple times to Krekk, then logged for the night, leaving an aggro Krekk near zone in,  killing folks trying to go past him.  Tracked down who through some of the interguild channels after we killed it.<br />
<br />
No, you don't get items back if you fail.<br />
<br />
No, you cannot loot epic if you didn't trigger event.<br />
<br />
<br />
He logged in with 5 minutes left on corpse and got his.  Congrats Dhur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, you cannot loot epic if you didn't trigger event.<br />
<br />
erm, ya you can... We did it on Saryrn and I coulda looted the sword but the war who did to the end was supposed to, thus he did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FORCEFROG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">erm, ya you can... We did it on Saryrn and I coulda looted the sword but the war who did to the end was supposed to, thus he did.<br />
think you get invisable flags for turning in the 3 items for  triggering krekk so wouldnt you receive &quot;You cannot loot this item.&quot; text?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>OrgroInsanity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you try to loot and haven't done all the steps and gotten the invisible flags, it says &quot;You are not allowed to loot this item, Champion's Sword of Eternal Power.&quot; <br />
<br />
Just like if you try to loot a quest item out of order..<br />
<br />
Frogs are wanna be know it alls..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Druss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FroggerX, how do you know you &quot;could have looted it&quot; if you didn't actually click it?<br />
<br />
When the &quot;other&quot; Krekk died, the sword was on the corpse, but ANYONE who tried to loot it got a new message:<br />
<br />
You cannot loot this item, it is attuned to someone else.  <br />
<br />
Followed by the familiar:<br />
<br />
You cannot loot this item, Champion's Sword of Eternal Power.<br />
<br />
Even *IF* you had done all the steps and had all the flags except the final turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Least it can't be ks'd. Guess if fail you can just wait around for him to die, or server down and then petition it :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This actully happened to me, However we managed to re-engage Krekk before despawn and I was able to get my epic. <br />
However I had a GM in the zone and he was willing to reimburse me my (epic? / items? ) if we failed again and Krekk poped.<br />
<br />
So not all CS people are bad. Some are very very good<br />
