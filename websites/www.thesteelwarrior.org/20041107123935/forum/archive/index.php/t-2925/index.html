<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Imagine for a second you were managing a huge online rpg like EQ. <br />
<br />
You want to keep the classes balanced, but you have given up on getting feedback from the &quot;masses&quot; because its often conflicting, and/or overpowering suggestions etc etc.<br />
<br />
So if you are looking down at the game from the executive chair how do you objectively determine if classes are actually balanced, without going into the nitty-gritty details?<br />
<br />
One (primitive) way would be to ask the database guy to give you weekly/monthly reports about class distribution. Aka, how big a percentage of the population plays warrior, how many play paladin, etc etc.<br />
<br />
If the numbers show there is twice as many playing warriors as there are paladins, would you then do anything to make warriors more popular? Probably not.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my suggestion:<br />
<br />
Go delete all your warrior bazaar mules/un-used twinks and remake them as another class, so you do not contribute to these statistics!<br />
<br />
I think alot of people by habbit simply choose a warrior when they want to make a level 1 bazaar mule or whatever. I know I do(back in the old EC days STR mattered, so having mules be warriors made sense).<br />
<br />
A brief survey in the AB bazaar showed 12 level 1 warrior mules in the bazaar, as opposed to 6 level 1 paladin mules.<br />
<br />
Depending on how SOE does their statistics, these mules &quot;could&quot; be contributing to giving a wrong picture about the actual popularity of our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would think that they would group the demographics within a 5 level range similar to how they setup their poles. ie, 35-40. 50-55. etc.<br />
<br />
If I was in the big chair I'd want to get a sample of each class within a level range, say 60-65, during peak hours. I then would want to see something like an exp per hour table, or anything else to show grouping of said classes versus looking for group. With this information it would be possible to weed out the hype and get the truth about player preferences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True, there are plenty of good ways to go about getting good data. And maybe they already do that.. who knows.<br />
<br />
But knowing SOEs trackrecord about knowing about broken things(Alchemy anyone?) allow me to remain sceptical ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fafrd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You shouldn't have given the trick Timmok, now all paladins will go create a warrior mule in order to keep us underpowered :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rather then look at lvl 1 war mules, go look thru the rosters of guilds.  Look at the number of warriors compared to paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can start with my guild...<br />
<br />
8 Warriors, 7 Paladins.   Two of the warriors are more or less part time and one of the Paladins is out for a period of time.   So, 6 active warriors and *gasp* 6 active paladins.    <br />
<br />
Who has more to do on our raids?   If you guessed the paladins, you guessed right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if i wanted to generate demographics from the DB, I would want these stats broken down by groupin levels 1-20, 21-40, 41- 50, 51-60, 61-64, 65 <br />
<br />
Count<br />
Avg time played<br />
Max Time Played<br />
Min Time played<br />
<br />
this tells me relatively clearly the size of the population and the amount invested in the character. I would also break it down by server before aggregating it.<br />
<br />
cutting off non-active characters is also possible single last login is now tracked. so you would get a total report and one with only chars that logged on in the last 30 days.<br />
<br />
now, what class will have the highest count across all servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know what I do on raids?  DPS...  granted that's mostly because I'm gimp compared to our top 5 MT's most of which are on raids... I think I'm somewhere very close to the bottom of the barrel but still.  I spend the vast majority of raids trying not to use healer mana and avoiding ripo's.  Our guild pallies ( I think there are 4 or 5 that come to raids often) get to buff, offtank, heal, stun mash lotsa buttons; swap weapons and yada yada.<br />
<br />
What sounds like more fun?  I enjoyed being an MT way back when we were all close in gear; we'd take turns rotating defensive warriors in to fight etc...  Now... we wait for one of the &quot;big boys&quot; to get defensive back for the boss fights.<br />
<br />
I do get to tank yard trash occasionally (quadding 1k+ YT bu still YT).  Sometimes I wonder if I shoulda just went ahead and leveld my BST or SK or anyone of my many other alts and changed mains.  But damnit!  So many have put so much effort into me and here I am time enabled.  I'm just gonna stick with it!  YAY GNOMERCY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">my guild has 5 active paladins that are 50 plus and 2 active warriors 60 plus one is me and the other guy is hardly on but still enough to be called active</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All my trader bots have been rogues.<br />
<br />
It was an odd habit I picked up back before the bazaar. A newbie wood elf rogue was my Mule, so that I could die and end right back in G'Fay at a moment's notice. Just find a guard and press attack.<br />
<br />
Then I switched to Vah Shir Rogue when G'Fay became less important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm quite sure level 1 characters wouldn't count in the actively-played demographics, anything under 25 probably shouldn't.<br />
<br />
And, SoE listens to $$$, if they see the largest population of melee is Warriors, and Warriors are mad, they will want to help the $$$.. I mean largest population of gamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My bazaar trader is a pallie :). I made him before PoP and Felwithe is the closest starting city to a nexus spire, so he's a high elf paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My bazaar mule is my retired 54 human monk (retired about 2 years ago).</div></div><hr />
