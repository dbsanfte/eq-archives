<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This may have been brought up earlier, but I had a question about snares.  Its my understanding that once a Mob is rooted it will attack players in melee range regardless of aggro from another player out of range.  I have a couple questions.<br />
<br />
1. Will a rooted mob attack the closest player regardless of Aggro?  (I was told by a BS rogue that he was getting aggro because he was closer to rooted Mob then I)<br />
<br />
2. Will Snare affect aggro management other then the intial hate caused by casting it?<br />
<br />
Thoughts rants and raves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The rogue is right. Mobs will attack whoever is the closest when rooted. Snare doesn't have any effect like that just agro from the spell and possiblities and range agro if you need to move the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rooted mob = you best be mashing pixles with it or it will attack someone else who it thinks is closer. f9 to top view helps alot with this.<br />
<br />
i encounter alot of casters who root because they can't control their own agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rooted mobs also decrease a rangers bow damage by 50% I am told.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a quick note:  As stated before snare does not affect aggro the way root does.  This is how aggro kiting works.  Someone snares the mob then casts their most hate per mana spell they have while everyone else tries to kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Technically root doesn't reduce ranger bow damage, they do normal damage vs. rooted mobs. They do double damage versus stationary, non-rooted (i.e. tanked) mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rikam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Had some goofy mages using root pets in solro even though mobs are immune to PC cast root the pets were going to town. I was loosing agro like a mofo to everyone and was annoying do yourself a favor and choose snare weps and kill mages with root pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Snared mobs reduce bow damages too, that's why snare kitting for a ranger isn't that good.<br />
<br />
And on the root problem I'm often playing with magician using their earth pet because it's the stronger (in hp), and last time I asked to change pet the answer was: &quot;I don't want to change pet, I got this one for an hour&quot;<br />
<br />
*sigh* no comment, zoning pet make magicians greedy on malachites...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alright Sirek, I haven't played my ranger in a long time but please verify that.  My understanding of snare and damage reduction is that the reduced damage is only if the mob is pathing and unable to attack (snare-kiting) and not when the target is snared and engaged.  If that's all you meant, then ignore me and all good.<br />
<br />
Root is like the old-school undead-aggro... closest target gets the smackage.</div></div><hr />

It effects all ranged attacks, not just rangers.  This &quot;nerf&quot; sucks for PvP for other non-ranger classes because throwing/archery in PvP for monks/warriors/rogues/etc do less damage, despite the pathetic dps these non-ranger classes do with ranged attacks.  Ranged attacks don't do much in PvP to begin with but to have it do even less makes it difficult to do much damage when other classes run around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Range damage isn't effected by snare or root, if it is, its a bug. Anti-kiting/damage reduction code was removed for the other kiting classes. The reason I know this is because my main was a druid and was effected similarly when the change was made. The damage reduction was eventually removed for druids, and other classes such as necros and wizards.<br />
<br />
If the damage reduction is still in effect for rangers/ranged melee this is a bug and should be on your class issues lists if this is so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not getting a bonus is not the same thing as getting a reduction. There's no reduction for archery versus snared or rooted mobs. Rangers gain a bonus of 2x damage versus stationary, non-rooted mobs. Snare kited mobs aren't stationary, so they lose their bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cuclian said it perfectly, but I'm gonna say it again.<br />
<br />
Rangers do 100% ranged damage on mobs while using a bow, be it snared, rooted, feared, anything. However, if the mob is stationary, and not rooted, rangers do double damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i could swear water was the high hp pet with earth second.<br />
<br />
most mages chose earth because it's the only root they got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i could swear water was the high hp pet with earth second.<br />

<br />
Pre 50 yes...post 50 no.  The water pet post 50 is a rogue with rather lacking hps for tanking.<br />
<br />
A mage that uses anything other than Air/Water in a group (unless you need CC) really isnt playing their class very well.  Earth is only used in exp groups AFTER asking that group first (mage rule of ettiquette 101)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hate earth pet, think i used fire pet 96% of the time for the last 25+ levels</div></div><hr />
