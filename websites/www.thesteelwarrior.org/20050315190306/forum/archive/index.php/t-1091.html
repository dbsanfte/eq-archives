<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">try west ToV, the named there are doable with about 18 and drop some pretty nice stuff, also might want to try Eashan and Ikiatar, they drop really good stuff for the encounters you will be able to face.  Vindi is a must for your tanks, and you could even start workin on sleeper's tomb by taking down Zlandicar and Klandicar, both doable with 3-4 groups.<br />
<br />
Once you get two groups flagged for sleepers you can continue working on keys for rest of guild, as well as taking down the nameds in there for your folks that have already gotten keyed.  Avatar proc weapons are great dps increasers for a melee heavy guild, or even one that isn't melee heavy... especially for your high dps melee classes.<br />
<br />
From there you could probably start doing Rumblecrush/Doomshade in umbral plains, as well as Va'dyn/Insanity crawler and even Itrar Vius eventually in akheva.  Servitor of luclin in grieg's is a fun encounter, and can yield some pretty nice stuff as well.<br />
<br />
From there you will start to attract more people, and will build a bit, head to NToV, and then work from there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do your clerics have epics? If not Chardok Royals would be good for the cleric epic drop and you can get some epic pieces for enchanters and warriors at the same time.  Then you can do spawned mobs like Ixiblat and Ragefire too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats what we do chardok. ALOT. one cleric does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kbam</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the revamped Hate if you can get a lift up there.  Aggro range toned down, decent amount of cash items and armor can be turned in for gem and exp.  Zone in is green/light blue to level 65 but turns darker blue as you work you way in.  Also the new quests for there seem to be pretty decent for the level targeted although the drop rates on the minor signets still suck.  Been looking to get the FT3 item for my twink cleric and still no signet after 12+ hours of hunting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh you (AS IN YOUR GUILD ASSCLOWN ) need resist gear? i smell a poG raid.<br />
unless things really changed there's a LOT of gems droping there. y'all need a guildie jewelcrafter and load him/her up with all the jewels to make your giuldmates resist gear ( that's what we did before we progressed through HoT; made nearly the entire guild's resist gear for basically prices of velium/plat/gold )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">me? no. but the guild does</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to give away my secrets, but here it is.<br />
<br />
Spend some time at the enforcers/punishers camp in PoJ.<br />
<br />
Exp - good.  Cash - around 1K an hour, maybe more.  A few nights there and many people can have decent resist gear.<br />
<br />
There's also some cheap ways to up your resists for HoT.  Runed bone fork is one example.  Crown of the froglok kings also adds some big numbers to key HoT resists.<br />
<br />
Really, though, the best way to get resists in HoT up is to have a bard singing the right songs.  Really good gear can't match the improvement in resists you get from the bard songs.  <br />
<br />
And remember, many of the mobs in HoT aren't AoE.  There are enough that can AoE so that it's plenty annoying, but there are many that don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">edited my post for clarification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Derakor The Vindicator (Vindi) sounds like a good option to get the tanks a nice BP until better comes along.<br />
Other than that find some mobs that have good drops for resists and FARM them like the froglok king for 20 cold and fire which really helps also a bard in every group if possible for resist song...<br />
<br />
PoG sounds good since I hear it has a good frequency of Gems.<br />
<br />
What i would do if i were you is on normal days when you would have raids assign one good group to just FARM crowns in Lower Guk. When king is dead and waiting for respsawn farm other stuff aybe monk epic guy maybe some FBSS to disperse or sell for cash to buy dots and other components. Assign another 2 or so groups to farm PoG for gems. and if any other groups left over if you guys have no Thurgadin armor farm some to MQ and have a tracker in that group incase Vindi pops and that should provide you with a few crowns from Lguk some FBSS if anyone need and some stuff to sell also a few BD's and Diamonds and other gems. AND if not Equipped with Thurgy or just need some pieces for PoG  quests from Arena some Thurgadin armor for MQ and those pieces and also a lookout for Vindicator spawn.. Although i am not that educated on leading a guild and doing all this stuff this would be my ideas.</div></div><hr />
