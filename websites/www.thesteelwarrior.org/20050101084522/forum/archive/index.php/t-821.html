<br />
I have a question of a technical nature. Does anyone have any experience with the nVidia FX chipset and EQ? <br />
<br />
Does it work? (Set myself up for the Direct3D standard type reply there.)<br />
<br />
I've been looking at a video card upgrade, and since I absolutley hate, and I do mean hate, ATI cards, I'm pretty limited to the nVidia route.<br />
<br />
And secondly, anyone have any experience with the Gainward line of cards?<br />
<br />
Thank ye very kindly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KalanaTheMighty</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure why you hate ATI cards considering NVIDIA doesn't have any card to compete with ati on any level. ATI beats NVIDIA with every product they have, FSAA anybody?<br />
<br />
Don't forget also NVIDIA was just caught cheating on the 3dmark03 test with over a 20% boost to their score due to them optimizing their drivers for that test. O' in actuality their card is performing 20% worse than those scores which were barely competing with ATI as was. Now we know that it's worse than we thought. NVIDIA is dead, get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, FX series are fine cards, the only problems I've heard about them is their high heat generation, which can be dealt with np.<br />
<br />
Honestly I'd buy a Ti4200/4600, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KalanaTheMighty</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye i am currently running a gf4 ti 4400, fine card for eq, more than enough power. But i also am planning on upgrading to a 9700 pro from ATI. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Gainward ti4200 ~ Golden Sample, and my previous card was the Gainward Geforce2 Pro Golden Sample.  Both have been great cards for EQ and performed well for anything else I have run on them (UT2K3 most recently), so if you're choosing a manufacturer for your Nvidia card I'd definitely recommend Gainward.  Gainward's own driver they supplied has always worked better than the detonator drivers also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xexys</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without starting an argument over card vs. card, the reason I'm not partial to ATI cards, is the after-purchase driver support.<br />
<br />
I've been down the ATI route, and their driver update schedule is terrible.<br />
<br />
As for the nVidia cheating on that benchmark, I don't know. Maybe they did. They still put out new drivers on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
What good's a card if it doesn't work with anything? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KalanaTheMighty</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is no longer true of ATI's driver support. They keep the drivers up to date quite reguarly now and as a matter of fact are considered industry best and most reliable. Things do change...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xexys</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, they very well might. I just have certain companies I like, as you do.<br />
<br />
ATI just isn't among em. Call me stupid, or ininformed, I just like nVidia. Always have.<br />
<br />
If I hadn't had nightmares with ATI cards in the past, I'm sure I'd be very open to the Radeon series.<br />
<br />
Never had a problem with nVidia. Why fix it, if it isn't broken? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kvak</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kalana, when stating something as a fact be prepared to back it up with links. <br />
<br />
You rarely hear developers comment on driver quality and to be honest, I can only think of one who has, John Carmack, and last I read he still saw nvidia's drivers as the best.<br />
<br />
Go play Splinter Cell on the Radeon, when you get it and report back on the &quot;industry best and most reliable&quot; drivers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FutureMark is revisiting some ATI benchmarks, too. ATI, which has grabbed the lead from NVidia in a ferociously competitive battle, was caught cheating before. <br />
<br />
In 2001 ATI was discovered to sacrificed quality for frame rates in a Quake 3.0 benchmark: when Quake was renamed &quot;Quack&quot;, the drivers produced much better output but frame rate performance fell.Source (http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/30860.html)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meface</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently using an Nvidia card. only 64 mg ATM. The only thing I can say was that I had a bit of a heat problem. Went out and bought a PCI slot fan for 15 bucks at Bestbuy. Easy to install plugs right into the power supply and what ever the fan from the video card blows down the extra fan i bought sucks up and out the back of the pc. I am even runnin full models horses spell effects (unless on raids) and only seem laggy in the Bazaar. But who isn't. <br />
            <br />
   Go with wait you like I personally am a fan of what is usually less expensive or on sale. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garyen</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the geforce fx 5900 ultra outperforms ATI's newest card, the 9800 pro, but like someone already said nvidia has been cheating a bit.<br />
<br />
if i was to buy a card right now I would buy the 9800pro or the 9800 over any nvidia card no question, but i think id rather wait till the 5900 and the 5900 ultra come out so i can make up my mind then. i wouldnt buy the 9700 now because the newer cards will get you a lot more for your buck, even the budget ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KalanaTheMighty</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok well here you go pay $400 for a 9800 pro or $600 for a 5900 ultra, pretty easy to see where bang for the buck goes. Or for the next best cards you could go pay $300 for a 9700 pro or $500 for a 5800 ultra.<br />
<br />
The cards compare almost identically compared to each other as well with a negligable edge given to the nvidia cards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kvak</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy Jebus Kalana, you are linking to a review of the 5800Ultra not the 5900Ultra, this link (http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/20030512/geforce_fx_5900-32.html) would be a little more relevant.<br />
<br />
As for the prices, did you pull them out of your ass or the blue air? Introduction prices (http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1821) (look at the table).<br />
<br />
5900U 256MB $499<br />
R9800PRO 256MB $499<br />
<br />
5900 128MB $399<br />
R9800PRO 128MB $399<br />
<br />
(Prices from above mentioned link, pay attention to memmory sizes)<br />
<br />
The products 5800 and 5800Ultra are DEAD as in dropped and is no longer being manufactured. Replaced by the 5900 series based on an improved chip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KalanaTheMighty</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well most of the reviews i read said the 5900 would be selling for $599 intitially but if it's less all the better, competition is good. Although the 5800 has dropped in price some too compared to initial release which was $500 bucks, the 5800 is at 350 on most sites i checked now.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter if the 5800 is no longer manufactured, there's quite a few of em out there for sale, they aren't going to throw them awa ya know? It's also not a bad card, just too pricey for what you actually get. and i am not sure if you are aware of it or not but on some benchmarks the 9800 pro 128 actually outperforms the 9800 pro 256.<br />
<br />
Prices also will vary alot by manufacturer, i prefer made by ati over powered by ati. Board quality of alot of the 3rd parties aren't always up to snuff for my tastes. And well nvidia doesn't make any of their own cards, all third parties so pick whom you like, of course quality comes at a premium.</div></div><hr />
