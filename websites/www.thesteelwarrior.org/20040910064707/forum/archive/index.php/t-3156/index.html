We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.</div></div><hr />

Future Plans for September, 2003<br />
Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game.  Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are.  Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Items in the Planes of Power<br />
<br />
We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate.  Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed:<br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Plane of Innovation<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />

<br />
Shields and blocking<br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.  We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.  We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It isn't a new message.<br />
<br />
The only melee weapons they improved were in Plane of Time or they changed Fire Damage or other kinds of extra damage to regular damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fritzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/sigh...Aye, I'm not holding my breath either. I just thought I'd throw the note up there seeing as I haven't seen anything from SoE in quite awhile about the issue. <br />
<br />
I am concerned that they are considering using equipment to solve the balancing problem instead of addressing the issues around aggro maintenance.  Given that a lot of equipment these days is geared towards multiple classes, it would seem to be of little benefit to us Warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean this from the Nov 02' Fan Fair?<br />
<br />
We don’t particularly like when abilities are obsoleted by items. Enraging Blow items were a temporary fix for a systems problem that has unfortunately stuck around too long.  <br />

You could look at it this way.  Since Warriors use Bind Wound to heal, a 'Band-aid fix' is the most class-appropriate solution to their problems.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The SOE dev team's next step is to give Knights a bind wounds AA that turns a single bandaid into a complete heal.

<br />
A small percentage of players will ever get to see PoTime.<br />
<br />
LDoN is designed to require a lot of hours to get a significant upgrade and for many players the dungeon drops are not upgrades at all.<br />
<br />
All of this is designed so that it takes many months of effort (and many months of paying) to get anywhere.<br />
<br />
I'm seeing planar guilds give up raiding, lvl 65 players quiting left and right, disgruntled Warriors, bored Clerics, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid a stream of players are headed toward WoW and messages from SoE saying that they're working on some long standing issues (while refusing to even acknowlege those of most concern to many players) is not going to stem the tide.<br />

FAN FAIRE: DEVELOPERS TRANSCRIPT, NOVEMBER 14, 2002<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do warriors stand in the grand scheme of things? <br />
<br />
Most warriors tell us they are pretty happy with their advancement and the inherent advancements they get from 60 to 65 that they don’t have to spend any AA points on to acquire, We’re pretty happy with how warriors are right now. <br />
<br />
A warrior isn’t measured on DPS alone, but they can take so much punishment and have always been designed to get hit points above and beyond any other class. They are really a solid class for both offense and defense where other melee do sway towards more offense, or give up some of both for magical abilities, <br />
<br />
<br />
Will Epics be upgraded at least? They aren’t that useful now.  <br />
<br />
Some will always be useful. Please keep in mind, though, that these are Kunark items. You might want to look at them in that perspective, as we’re now three expansions later. The fact that some of them are still as useful as they are means they were probably overpowered initially. <br />

However, we do have time for all of the other questions; our individual positions on Tolstoy's War and Peace; our understanding of quantum mechanics (with a guest lecturer); watching paint dry (with visual aides); oh, and let's not forget all of the nifty new spells for casters we're going to add in within the next couple of weeks.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree.  NO MORE EQUIPMENT BASED CHANGES TO FIX THE WARRIOR CLASS.  Why the h*ll don't they get it???!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Most warriors tell us they are pretty happy with their advancement <br />
<br />
Who are they talking to?<br />
<br />
the inherent advancements they get from 60 to 65 that they don’t have to spend any AA points on to acquire <br />
<br />
What exactly are these?  Hps and stat cap increases?  Are they saying &quot;most warriors are happy with the hps and stat cap increases from 60-65&quot;?  Well yes I imagine that it so.  But thats like saying &quot;I'm satisfied with the oxygen content in this room because I am still breathing&quot;.<br />
<br />
and , We’re pretty happy with how warriors are right now.  <br />
<br />
Who is the &quot;we&quot;. <br />
<br />
A) the warriors from 60-65 they polled?<br />
b) the developers at Sony themselves?<br />
c) some other &quot;we&quot; that is not defined in this quote?<br />
 <br />
A warrior isn’t measured on DPS alone, but they can take so much punishment and have always been designed to get hit points above and beyond any other class. <br />
<br />
1. Where was it EVER stated that warriors were measured on DPS?<br />
2. The DPS argument usually comes into play in terms of a role when they are not being hit.  THIS IS A MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE CONDITION.  Increased offense from the precise or aggresive disciplines does that address this but there needs to be a further answer.<br />
3. &quot;Above and Beyond&quot; (as stated elsewhere) is a &quot;gap&quot; that is becoming smaller with the increasingly cross class &quot;shared arm,or types&quot;.  To quote this as a hard attribute of warriors is rather misleading.<br />
<br />
 They are really a solid class for both offense and defense where other melee do sway towards more offense, or give up some of both for magical abilities <br />
<br />
Sigh...see mutual exclusive argument above.  See &quot;above and beyond&quot; gap closure argument above.<br />
<br />
Sorry for beating the dead horse...just rather frustrating to see this yet again.</div></div><hr />
