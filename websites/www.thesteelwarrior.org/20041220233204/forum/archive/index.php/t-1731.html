Which according to this thread (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2189.topic) works on every offensive spell:<br />
<br />
&quot;To confirm: Furious Bash &quot;fires&quot; on every offensive spell. Stuns, undead zaps, innate damage procs and good old Bash. FB screams in the hands of a Paladin and is probably sick and wrong for an SK. ^_^ &quot;<br />
<br />
Kinda funny, instead of doing something to lower the agro gap between warriors/hybrids, they are actually increasing it, and by a large amount too.</div></div><hr />

i'm getting so sick of their lack of .. everything.<br />
<br />
Either they admit to being incompetent, or they start firing certain people.<br />
Seriously...... HOW can you be such a bunch of retards?<br />
<br />
I guess The Vision, was a good thing after all...<br />
now it's just The Cash.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of our only bonuses to not having a spellbook, was dual wield...<br />
now theyre forcing us to give that up.<br />
<br />
Next expansion you'll see spells that make knights mitigate 50% more anyhow...<br />
because obviously, daddy's son plays a Knight at home...</div></div><hr />

I don't think its going to have a large impact on class balance because of it's rarity. Where does it drop? It looks like a Time drop to me just because of the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a time drop i think.</div></div><hr />

Players in Time guilds really don't have the same issues as we do in the lower tiers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just checked and it does come from Time. So maybe a dozen folks per server will eventually have one. Not really game breaking if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

They just don't NEED crap like this, in fact it's the very opposite. And as time goes on, mudflation means that more and more will have them.<br />
<br />
That shield should be warrior only. It's overpowering in the hands of a hybrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's true they don't need it.  I wouldn't think they would even want it.  They can already get unlimited aggro.  The effect on this shield does nothing for them.  Who cares?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am rather unconcerned about the shield itself(other than I want one just to play with...not that I will every see it), but I got a nice chuckle from that line,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, whatever is in PoTime atm, hints to what will come the next few expansions.<br />
<br />
SoE likes shields, they want to nullify Warrior Dual Wield and force them to use shields.<br />
<br />
Which is plainly retarded.<br />
<br />
Now paladins get to wear a shield with 1handed weapons that have WAY better ratio then warriors.<br />
Meanwhile, warriors have to carry the usual 1handed weapon with a shield.<br />
<br />
Hello Warrior, your dps has just been fucked with.<br />
Now pick a knight if you want more aggro AND better dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The shield drops from Rallos Zek in Plane of Time. Knights can use both Blade of Carnage and Blade of War. How many knights in your guild are running around using BoC (3+ expansions old)? On your server?<br />
<br />
Any guild capable of looting one of these is probably capable of getting it into the &quot;right&quot; person's hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dubb, if no knights are wielding BoC, it's because it sucks.<br />
<br />
The only good thing on BoC is the hate proc, and knights have 0 need for that.<br />
<br />
Now that shield has lovely stats, and will most probably go to Knights first, seeing as they also get an AMAZING one hander.<br />
<br />
If warriors get it, its for aggro.. and it will mess up their dps.<br />
<br />
Thus, if we warriors get such a shield, it will be a huge nerf to what we had that knights didnt... yet bring us only slightly closert to what knights have and we don't. (After having gone all the way to PoTime)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">djjinn</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious Bash is pretty useless to warriors right now.  It increases hate from bashes and cast spells only.  It won't fire from a proc of a weapon.  No focus effect works with spells from items.  <br />
<br />
The only benefit warriors get from FB is increased aggro from shield bashes, which really isn't that much.  It would probably take FB 30 or 40 to compare to the aggro generation of the offhand weapon of a warrior in the plane of time.  I would assume most of those are using 2h anyway.<br />
<br />
FB currently is only really useful for knights when they tank, and then it just allows them to aggro lock with less casting, or even more assure aggro lock.  Until FB works with procs, it is almost useless for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure a shield like this will make agro control trivial to a knight when XPing in tier 2/3 planes, however to any warrior in a guild capable of obtaining this shield agro control in those XP spots is also pretty much trivial so its not like this unbalances anything.<br />
<br />
Playing a chanter I had the pleasure of grouping with a BoW wielding elemental equiped warrior in plane of valor on one occasion and there were no taunt problems - infact early on the warrior told me not to bother slowing because a 9khp buffed warrior with 1600 AC and 150+ AAs can tank Tier 2 pop mobs unslowed quite easily.<br />
<br />
Giving this shield to either a tier 5 knight or a tier 5 warrior is not going to effect the game balance at tier 2 / 3 at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FB works with bash..<br />
<br />
FB works with spells that are cast...<br />

FB doesnt work with Procs...<br />

WHY the hell do warriors even bother with this?<br />

hmm.. lets just INCREASE the aggro from stuns... boy that helps.</div></div><hr />

It modifies the hate associated with bash only.</div></div><hr />
