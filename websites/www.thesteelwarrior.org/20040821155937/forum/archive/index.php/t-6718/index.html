They really need to think this one over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what friends in beta have told me, MOST of your experience will come from questing anyways. At least this will give a reason to stop people from playing 24/7, and reward players who can only dedicated 2-3 hours a night to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But why penalize those hardcore players just because of the casual players.  It doesn't make sense to me.  I don't know how long it takes you to become fully exhausted from well  rested so I can not comment on that.  But to penalize someone that wants to exp for over a lengthly amount of time is quite ludacris.    <br />
<br />
  Even if the EXP from questing it will limit the amount of quests that one can accomplish at one sitting.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I do not know to me it just an added timesink like the many in EQ has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I gots 100 bucks that says it won't last.  It's the beta T-E-S-T.  Once people start complaining that they don't like it, it'll go away.<br />
<br />
It's a nice idea, but one that doesn't really need to be there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Timesink, mebbe.  What we dunno at this point is how significant the bonus XP for PvE when fully rested is ... if, for example, it's 10% and it takes 16 real-time hours to go from Well Rested to Exhausted, that's effectively irrelevant.  If it's 50% and it takes 4 hours to go from Well Rested to Exhausted, that's insane.  If it's 200% bonus and 12 hours to drop to Exhausted ... well, I dunno.  Requiring a character to rest is a reasonable game mechanic, if well implemented, tho I don't have the access to judge this one.   <br />
<br />
Some nights, I've regretted being able to swing a bugle on a stick for several hours without pause ... I used to chat with my groups during downtime, and now it feels like the frickin' treadmill never stops from the minute I log on till the minute I log off, cuz their aren't med breaks anymore.  But I expect that the system they're testing now is more extreme than what would go live, and I figger that's deliberate for the testing model.  I think they're exploring ways to slow down levelling a little.<br />
<br />
I just found a lot of posts about this (surprise!) on the Blizzard forums, including   this  thread (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=21727&amp;P=1&amp;ReplyCount=46#post21727).  The system doesn't look perfect, but it doesn't look game crippling either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It will last.<br />
<br />
SWG has a similar thing.<br />
<br />
SWG requires you to get rest at a cantina or suffer from lost hp/mana etc.<br />
That is the reason I quit SWG.  I will not suffer harm because I play more than 2 hours at a time.  Any game that wants to harm me, isn't a game I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hope it stays so then I'll have something to point to when people say Blizzard is so smart they know how to balance their games.  And looking at the current feedbacks, it seems like it actually will.<br />
<br />
I know people say Quests are the way to xp but at some point you've to grind.  If not the game will either be consumed too fast (assuming quests are supposed to be NOT grinds, i.e. relatively fast), or the quests themselves become grinds.  <br />
<br />
I don't see how you can justify punishing people for playing more.  From what I've heard, the rate you get tired is dependent on XP gained, not the time played, so that means the more efficient you are the quicker you've to stop playing otherwise you go to 1/2 or even 1/4th xp gained.  How does that even make sense?  If it's time-based, at least you're not being penalized for being efficient (even though it is still stupid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are technical reasons to implement this.  You need a lot more bandwidth and server capacity to support people that play 6+ hours per day.  For business reasons, I can understand Blizzard adding an incentive to get people to log off after a few hours.  If WoW takes off like everyone is expecting and becomes very profitable, they may change this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MachedorCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Played for 4 hours before going from Well Rested (200% xp bonus) to Rested (150%).  If it takes 4 hours for every stage (Well Rested, Rested, Normal, Tired, Exhausted, or something like that) then playing 8 hours a day shouldn't hurt anyone.  <br />
<br />
disclaimer - Did not time the amount I actually played, this is just an estimate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Isn't the change from rest states dependent on how much XP you gained, not time played?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah that is what I heard also but not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Amberlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, it is based on the xp you gain from killing monsters (before the bonus is applied).  XP gained from quests does not factor into the rest state at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you wont lvl up or rely on exping to lvl up. 90% of youre exp comes from questing and its alot faster and more fun than sitting in the same spot for 6 hours like eq pulling and killing the same garbage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Old post I know but just found this forum.<br />
<br />
1st thing. I've seen 3 posts from Karubi here and all three have been full of utter garbage. Do not believe a word out of his mouth and you'll be doing yourself a favor. Closer to 40-60% of your exp will come directly from quest turn-ins. Less if you do harder content/mobs.<br />
<br />
2nd thing<br />
<br />
 In case anyone missed it. The big problems with the rest state were twofold. It took 8 hours to go from ANY state to well rested. This was intentional and a poor design decision. It's being changed to incremental. Whether that means 2 hours flat per state, or 1 minute of rest = 1 minute of rest no matter how long there I don't know. The other problem was the amount of exp to drop a state is static through all levels. 20,000 I believe. Sure it might take you 4 hours to drop to Rested at level 10, but I routinely get down to Normal in 4-5 hours now easily at 30+. Faster if I do an instance or fight lots of + mobs. This is also being changed, the amount of exp to drop a state is going to scale.<br />
<br />
 Really that's the only 2 issues I ever had with the system, and they should both be getting changed. So whoopie.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to see a game from Blizzard that was not fun to play. Ever since Warcraft in early 1990s they've been publishing great games I don't see why WoW would be any different. Its their company moto they do not realease unfinished games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the reseon it can be diferent is that the fundators of blizzard left last year and before (actually they got like 30 or 40 demissions at blizzard in less than 18 month, but only 5 or six as been well known).<br />
Nevertheless, I don't think their stupid anougth to change their way of working (no change they become like SOE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>doranski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well i would agree that blizzard does make fun games, but also is one of the biggest games that people stop playing because it gets hacked.

Then diablo 2 game out and for about 1 year the game was good then hacks came and destroyed the purpose of killing stuff except to get to 99.  Hacked items were far more powerful and cheap to buy on ebay so the game became unfun.  I can only hope that blizzard, who will take forever to put a game out, goes out of its way to prevent the game from being hacked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree  historically that is true, however from what I have seen everything is stored server side other than local graphical/sound settings.  I had to reload the game onto my computer due to a hard drive crash.. and all of the hotkeys, friends list, chat color settings, etc were there already when I logged back in.   I am certain Blizzard is aware that people will attempt to do things to work around and break the technology of the game, they would be stupid not to assume attempts and some successes at hacking the game will occur.</div></div><hr />

Pulled this quote from one of the official community liason types:<br />
<br />
 The Rest State system will be undergoing some changes in the near future. Among other modifications, we will be adjusting the 8-hour timing to be much more flexible. Rest will be accumulated gradually vs. the “8 hours of rest or nothing” approach that is currently in place. To add to this adjustment, people who do not play for long periods of time (weekend warrior types) will accumulate extra rest. This will allow those who only play once or twice a week the added bonus of playing as “well rested” for longer than those who play on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Another anticipated change is to add the ability to rest from anywhere in the world. This should help players who forget or choose not to log off at an inn. Resting at an inn will remain the preferred method, as tiers will accumulate more rapidly if you log off inside an inn.<br />
<br />
Lastly, we are planning on making the Rest State modifier a level-based sliding scale for how much experience you can gain at each tier. That is, at higher level-ranges, the amount of experience that you gain before moving down to the next tier of your Rest State will increase.<br />
<br />
Overall, we are happy with the Rest State feature and appreciate everyone’s continued feedback. We realize that it still needs to be adjusted and will continue to do so until it’s where we want it to be.<br />

I think this is actually an old-ish announcement.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The way it is now, you need 11 hours to get to &quot;rested&quot; state.  Once in rested, the additional time gives you exp bonus.  It takes 5 and a half DAYS (120 some odd hours) to get to full rested.  Once full rested, about an hour of play in the 20 to 40 level range will empty your 6 days of &quot;rest&quot; pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">arf arf<br />
<br />
Ah, that adds specificity to this bit I found on the beta site.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rest State Changes<br />
<br />
The Rest State system has undergone several changes. There are now three tiers of rest states: Rested = 200% experience, Normal = 150% experience and Tired = 100% experience.<br />
<br />
The rest timer is much more flexible than before, allowing players to gradually accumulate incremental rest credit for all time spent logged out. Additionally, people who do not log into World of Warcraft for several days will gain bonus rest credit. This will allow those who only play once or twice a week the added bonus of playing as rested (200% experience) for longer periods of time than those who play on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Players also have the ability to rest anywhere in the world. This should help players who forget or choose not to log off at an inn. Resting at an inn is still the preferred method, as rest credit will accumulate four times faster for players logged off inside of an inn.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the Rest State modifier is now level-based using a sliding scale to determine how much experience you can gain at each tier instead of the previous flat 20,000 experience per level. <br />
<br />
This is something I can live with, but then I generally avoid watching the XP bar anywho.  I imagine a lot of peeps still dislike it, but to me it's an inneresting approach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think they should just remove it.

I'd really like to see some supporting evidence of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd really like to see some supporting evidence of this.<br />
<br />
I don't understand...<br />
<br />
You MUST rest (stay logged out in an inn) for 11 hours 2 minutes to go from any rest state to &quot;rested&quot;.  Once in rested, every chunk of time you stay logged out provides a set amount of exp.  The maximum is gained at 5.5 days at &quot;rested&quot; state in an inn.  When you play, every time you kill a mob, you drain your &quot;rested&quot; exp pool.  This pull is 5 bubbles or 20,000 exp.  At level 14 20,000 exp = 5 bubbles.  At much higher level, 5 bubbles approaches an hour worth of killing.<br />
<br />
What sort of evidence would you like?  Do you play WoW?  Is it that you just don't understand the system (and my detailed description above helps?)<br />
<br />
If you play 3.5 hours on a week end, and gain 200 percent exp you will level at the same rate as someone that plays 1 hour a day, every day.  This is because the person that plays 1 hour a day will have 9 percent of his exp at 200 percent, 9 percent at 150 percent and the rest at 100 percent.  Do you want to disagree with the raw 3.5 to 7 hour factor?  Fine, then maybe it should be more like 4 hours on the weekend vs 1 hour a day.  That better?  If you play once a day, you will gain almost no exp at the 200/150 rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm under the impression that a) the vast majority of exp is gained through questing, and b) exp gained through questing doesn't affect your rest state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
30 percent of your exp will be gained from quest TURN INS.  The quests (especially higher level ones) will demand many many mob kills, so you will gain far more exp from mob kills than from questing beginning around level 20.  Exp gained from quests do not count against your rest state, but the exp gained from killing mobs to get the drops for quests do count.</div></div><hr />

Are you low level?  I noticed I didn't start dropping to normal (150) or tired (100) often until around level 12 or 14.  I played sometimes 6 to 10 hours at a time during that leveling period on my most recent character (started after the latest patch.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
An xp boost for a particular play style is the exact same thing as an xp penalty for NOT playing that way.  IE the rest system is a penalty for players who play one way &amp;/or a boost for players who play another.<br />
<br />
I used to be a very hardcore EQ player, I am now married and play about an average of 1 hour a day and 2-4 on the weekend so I understand both mindsets.  Frankly the rest system SUCKS, I hate seeing my character go down in rest state it makes the game less fun.  That's really the end result, rest system = less fun than no rest system regardless of your play style.</div></div><hr />
