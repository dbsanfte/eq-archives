<br />
From the end of http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=16537<br />
<br />
<br />
Just redid the test 3 times post patch - and now I am not sure what happened pre-patch.<br />
<br />
The buff drops once it has adverted 1600 dmg - ie, once you have taken roughly 14400 dmg (as 14400+1600 = 16000 and 10% of 16000 is 1600).<br />
<br />
That obviously lowers it usefullness tremendeously - though I still see some usefullness in it - but its definitely situational.<br />
<br />
con:<br />
- takes a buff slot<br />
- takes a spell slot<br />
- only 1600 healed for 300 mana (and in abjuration)<br />
<br />
pro<br />
- its a non-aggro &quot;heal&quot;<br />
- it stacks with normal heals<br />
- it &quot;heals&quot; even when you are not in range or otherwise unable to heal<br />
<br />
<br />
I am very sorry I seem to have bugged the first test somehow. Still not sure what happened as I took significantly more damage and still had the buff on. Seeing I now got the same result 3 times in a row it has to have been a fluke - which might even have been fixed somehow by the patch.</div></div><hr />
