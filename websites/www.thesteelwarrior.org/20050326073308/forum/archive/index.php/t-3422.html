Can a  lvl 65 Warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=450024) solo the ME shard??  Which named would you try??<br />
<br />
For those magelo-challenged: no ToD, no Fungi, no Eyepatch/Ornate gloves, unbuffed 6k hp, Schmitar of Lifestealing.<br />
<br />
Thoughts??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thoughts? Get a ToD and Fungi=P I solo'd the spot easily enough but I have better gear, and named never popped. Did the one by Akheva, 2 spawn. Was split already from duo and I stayed when partner left, handled it fine solo. But I have Fungi/Dain Ring/ToD/Eyepatch at the time.<br />
<br />
 If you have a big heavy hitting 2H you can probably handle the spot once split solo, just delay kite. But named summons I believe. So would need to slow and go toe to toe by 95%.</div></div><hr />

You'll need some luck too, keeping a camp cleared all by your lonesome self is very hard. I normally check all camps to see if a named is up, whenever I am in the zone, and sometimes you get lucky, a named is up, and no-one is camping him :)<br />
<br />
The more 'casting' the named is, the less you have to rely on a slow-proccing weapon..., however a ToD is probably neccesary. A snare weapon is a must too, both to single pull the named and to keep 'm from running away.<br />
<br />
When I solo'd the prophet, I had not yet the clicky 30% haste and was using self-buffs only. (19pt DS and ~6200hp)<br />
<br />
Normally I'd say to use yer 2hander, just remember that warrior solo= DPS.</div></div><hr />

Its possible but there is a good chance you can screw up and then watch a friendly someone &quot;help&quot; you after you have died or zoned.</div></div><hr />

Doing it solo might be tough though and probably isnt worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can 2 box a druid or shaman, just play them and kill them alone, then loot up.  I ran through ME to AR with druid, and who should agro me... but Mr. Shard....<br />
<br />
A min later... I looted my very first shard.  Only 9 more to go!<br />
<br />
Sea!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I solo'd the camps with my chanter which I wouldnt have been able to do the way I did it if they had summoned.</div></div><hr />
