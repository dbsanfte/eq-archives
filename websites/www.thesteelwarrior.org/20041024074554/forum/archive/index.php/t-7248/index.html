I did a search and didn't find anything for the Glaive of Marltek (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26033) , so I thought I'd post it here.<br />
<br />
This nifty item is the result of a very simple quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2718) . I did it while my warrior was in his early 30's being PL'ed by my shaman.<br />
<br />
Just as the quest info says, keep killing the mobs that spawn at the tent and eventually you will see the text pop up that one of them has a note stuck in its armor.<br />
<br />
It took me about 12 hours over three days to get the sword, but of course mileage may vary depending on how lucky you are.<br />
<br />
Captain Nealith was apprehensive to me when I first went to FV. I don't know if there is a required faction level for this quest, but indifferent worked for me. Nealith is a dual quest NPC. The main one he talks about is the drolvarg canine quest, during which he mentions his siblings or something like that. Asking him about his brother will yield the text for the glaive quest, but it isn't necessary. Turning in 4 canines will yield a bit of coin, a stack of hearty meal food items, and xp. After turning in about 40 teeth to him I was indifferent and that worked for the glaive quest.<br />
<br />
The stats on this aren't very good of course, but it is an easy snare item to get, and the xp in FV isn't too bad if you're in your 30's. I use this thing all the time since I spend most of my time 2-boxing with my shaman nowadays. It procs fairly often and I can probably count on one hand the number of times I had to use my shaman to root a mob. Swapping out weaps can be bothersome of course, but its better than having a zone full of mobs coming your way after the one you're killing runs off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Another is Tserrina's Whip (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4262). Not attainable at 30 but it's not as resisted. Only downside is it wears off quickly if the mob has decent PR.<br />
<br />
Edit: Procs at 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>walkka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I stick with my goold old Kunzar Ku'Juch, probably not the best weapon around but the Engulfing Darkness is ok to snare the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I stick with my goold old Kunzar Ku'Juch, probably not the best weapon around but the Engulfing Darkness is ok to snare the mobs.Well.. since you already derailed the thread, I'm going to jump in and say you'd do better with a Silken Whip of Ensnaring since its effect lasts 10 min, not to mention swinging a better ratio'd weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I decided to do this quest just to pass some time last night while I was lfg.  Took me about an hour and a half of killing drolvargs at the camp mentioned on Alla's.  It definitely has a better snare than the Kunzar Ku'juch and since it was free and easy I'm not complaining.  Thanks Romtom.</div></div><hr />

Silken Whip of Ensnaring procs &quot;Snare&quot; not &quot;Ensnare&quot; - same effect as the original weapon in this post.  Only lasts 3.9 minutes, unfortunately, though that's still more useful than the Kunzar Ku'jich, which can only last 1 minute, tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got this piece while working on the VP key NPC in FV.  Roughly 4 hours spent total, though, I've heard longer camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>allamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the 1hder spear of constriction that drops in VP,is probally the best one.it procs ensnare, the 14 min one.<br />
easy to farm with one group.well, at least til the VP revamp thats comming out soon.</div></div><hr />
