<br />
As a main tank in groups, I use a Greatstaff of Thunder.  I love this little gem for keeping aggro and I proc like crazy even without shaman buffs.  I am one aa pt from Punishing Blade 3... already I see a difference.<br />
<br />
Ok now on raids, should I.. use?<br />
<br />
My 2H Epic?<br />
A War Marshall's Bladed Staff?<br />
A Windblade?<br />
<br />
I'm really torn with what I should be using for max dps...  please share some ideas I appreciate them...<br />
<br />
Now as far as AA points go, where should I go next to get max aggro/dps with my 2H skill?<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly, <br />

Most people agree that WMBS has a slight DPS advantage. If you want to trust other people, go with that. Your best bet is to parse a couple of hours with each weapon and see for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myself personally I'd go with Windblade of course I've never used the War Marshall's staff and I loved my Windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WMBS is beter dps I think, and also cheaper so it's probably the way to go, Epic can proc and get you aggro sometimes and if you're not MT that's bad and it's also th elower dps of the 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used both WB and WMBS (borrowed WB for a day) and I can tell ya from personal experience, WMBS holds agro better. I haven't parsed the damage, but most say WMBS is better there as well and from observation - not that it counts for much without a parse - I'm inclined to agree.<br />
<br />
No to mention that on Saryrn, WMBS is nearly 1/2 the price of a WB and has more hp.<br />
<br />
I'd say get the staff and leave the blade for those who don't know any better and want to burn pp unnecessarily just to see big hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had all of them (still have WMBS, GSoT, and epic).  I sold the windblade pretty much as soon as I got a WMBS.<br />
<br />
With the WMBS and GSoT, I've had no reason to use the 2h epic.  (I have been swapping around 1h weapons, testing out combos of CHoS, SoBSw, Red, Blue.)</div></div><hr />

It has a slightly better ratio, and as well, I've seem to remember reading here that weapons with a delay of 30 or greater are also given an attack/damage bonus ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you rather Flurry with a 31 damage weapon or a 50 damage weapon?<br />
<br />
How about Punishing blade?<br />
<br />
How about Ferocity?<br />
<br />
How about critical?<br />
<br />
How about riposte?<br />
<br />
I'm sitting with Flurry 2 right now and I've quad 300's a couple of times with my windblade.  Whatever small bonus the War Marshalls staff has with no AA, I can GUARANTEE that it goes away with AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well with the lower dly, you should get more flurry/ferocity/PB checks. dps can vary so much with aa skills, would have to do a long parse to know for sure. ive parsed anywhere from 120-200 dps with someone using a dps checker.<br />
<br />
<br />
only aa that isnt dependent on delay in some fashion is double riposte/flash of steel. i eventually got this aa too but most seem to think its marginal dps increase, would be a real pain to parse and try to figure out as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well actually that depends on whether skills like flurry fire off on a fixed % of times, or has a given likelihood of occuring over a certain period of time (like a proc). If criticals, flurrys, and extra attacks from AAs happed a certain percentage of swings, then the damage from a WMBS should scale up just the same as a WB. If the likelihood of occuring per swing scales down with weapon delay and haste (like with procs) then the WB would give you more bang for your buck. Have any tests been done to determine how these work?<br />
<br />
WB will always maintain an advantage in riposte damage though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to call bullshit on Haass, but Gimmel raises a good question.  We know that proc rate is defined per-minute, not per-swing.  Are flurry and PB coded as procs?  If they are, then they would be independent of weapon delay (unlike double-attack and triple-attack), and they'd be most effective with the slowest weapon you can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe flurry is on a per minute thing but ferocity is definately dependent on weapon delay. PB could be coded as a proc though, hard to say, you dont get a message on successful PB hit like a weapon proc or flurry so i doubt we will ever know. <br />
<br />
i always assumed it was just % chance at an extra swing every combat round though, which is the natural way to think procs would work but its not the case. one person theorized you get a PB check if double attack fails or if triple attack fails after a double attack, wont know unless a dev tells us.<br />
<br />
u dont want the slowest delay weapon either, u want the highest dmg weapon, the per minute proc rate makes delay meaningless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are flurry and PB coded as procs? If they are, then they would be independent of weapon delay (unlike double-attack and triple-attack), and they'd be most effective with the slowest weapon you can find. <br />
<br />
Nah, they'd just be more effective with the higher damage weapon.  Even if it was just ripostes, the minisicule difference between the 2 would make me pick the higher damage weapon.<br />
<br />
Aside from that fact, since 2h is all the craze these days to avoid ripostes, why the hell aren't you all picking a 44 delay weapon over a 28?  You want to avoid ripostes right, and that's why you're using a 2h right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be because people generally use them for DPS rather than tanking setups....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tier 1 and 2 mobs don't hit hard enough for riposte to be a big deal, which is why you see most warriors in those planes dual wielding. By the time you run up against mobs which hit so hard that ripostes are a real factor, you're bound to have a better weapon than a windblade, or you at least ought to.<br />
<br />
On Saryrn at least you don't see very many tanks in elemental/PoT guilds using a WB. It's safe to assume this is the case on other servers as well.<br />
<br />
Which pretty much makes the argument for a WB to avoid ripostes a weak one, if at all meaningful.<br />

<br />
I would imagine Flurry/PB would go off the same percentagea amount in relation to your normal attacks - dps gains from these skills would be linear across the board regardless of weapon delay.<br />
<br />
I'm probably wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which pretty much makes the argument for a WB to avoid ripostes a weak one, if at all meaningful. <br />
<br />
Oh no no no no no no.<br />
<br />
You see, there's a large number of people here who will NEVER see anything past Tier 2 that are on the 2h bandwagon.  They beat you over the head with the 2h argument that &quot;I do it because I can't take the ripostes and everyone notices it.&quot;  Because i take soooooo many ripostes for maximum damage you know.<br />
<br />
So since they're all on that bandwagon, using the windblade over a faster weapon is a perfectly good counter with that argument, and you can't call bullshit on it with a straight face with me.  It undermines the entire reason you're using a 2h in the first place.  If 2 1h weapons have near identical DPS as a 2h weapon, then people would use 2h &quot;To avoid ripostes.&quot;  So now that there's a pair of 2h weapons that have near identical DPS, we go with the one that has the slight DPS edge and ignore the riposte question entirely?  Odd indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what you are getting at, Haas. If you just want more agruements about Droga weapons vs GSoT then this is the wrong place really. I would say if there is a warrior in a group wielding either WB or WMBS then I hope they are using it from behind as a dps use, and not trying to tank with them.<br />
<br />
If dps'ing from behind just use whatever is best dps, cause ripostes should not be a factor. I personally would use the Windblade just cause it is slower and hopefully (slightly) less aggro than WMBS, only because the two put out almost identical dps. I would say a strong droppable 2h ( either of these ) would out dps droppable 1h weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it's a difference of play style then.  See, when I think about going for DPS, I think of XP groups.  In an XP group with the mob slowed, in the places I hunt, I don't care who the fuck tanks it to be honest.  It dies fast, we all get XP.  We cheer. <br />
<br />
I guess I forget at times that XP groups for the average joe in PoP requires them to actually be able to hold aggro.  I only group with my guild and we're all decently equipped and none of us are dumbasses.  I used my windblade in XP groups more than enough times.  I bag the BoC in my Xp groups and bust out a copper hammer.  For me, &quot;doing DPS&quot; and tanking aren't mutually exlcusive.  I can do both, and quite often I do both.  If I don't feel like dual wielding, I don't dual wield.  <br />
<br />
I'm never in the DPS role that some people find themselves in.  Stuff is hitting me, all the time, everywhere I go, because that's how we do things.  I guess some people have been relegated to wannabe rogue because they have to deal with pickup group idiots, but that's never been an issue for me and I forget about it.<br />
<br />
Still tho...lets be honest here for a second about coolness factor.  If i've got a 31/28 weapon that supposedly does slightly more DPS than a 50/44, what am I gonna pick?  You bet your ass I'm gonna pick the 50/44 and the 1768 cripple screenshot i have is why.  If the difference is negligable in the first place, why not pick the weapon that makes you at least look like a beast, even if you're just an average joe :)  Have some pride people, and think of things other than just min/maxing your stats and everything so you're 0.003% more efficient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bought a WMBS and I'm going to keep the windblade and switch out when I deem it necessary.  I know there is still a 2H argument out there but since these came out, I love the fact I can hold aggro in my groups &amp; the aa pts just make it that much better.<br />

<br />
In raid situations, when I don't worry about riposte and my job becomes one of doing some damage, then I bring out the WMBS. I'm seriously thinking of passing the WB to my wife's twink warrior; the WMBS just feels better for the way I play.<br />
<br />
In either case however, neither of the two weapons mentioned in this thread make the cut for aggro. GSoT is the best 2H aggro you'll find for the money (like 1-3K on most servers these days, no?)<br />
<br />
Oh...I should point out that my opinion is purely that of a level 62 warrior with no important AA's to speak of, and no access to the elemental planes. In other words, I am a representative the majority of the player base. :p YMMV, of course. ;)</div></div><hr />
