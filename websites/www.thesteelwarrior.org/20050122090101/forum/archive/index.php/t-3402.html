<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qris</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">K, so my guild killed Sol Ro last night and a Gold Runed Mithril Knife dropped.  They asked all full member if anyone would like to bid on it and no one did (apparently all the rogues are saving for Ifir).  They asked trials (me!) if anyone wanted and no rogues wanted so I said, eh, why not.  Turns out I was the only one that went in on it so it would have rotted anyway.<br />
<br />
Anyway, how's the aggro on this weapon?  It's a 16/19 piercer with a 150 fire DD, also has 1 Fire Damage.  I put it in my secondary and didn't see any less aggro than my GBoS (actually saw more in LDoN).  So I'm going to keep trying it out, but anyone have experience with EB proc/ GRMK?<br />
<br />
And one more question, does 1 Fire DMG mean additional damage vs fire or cold mobs?<br />

against cold/magic/dis/pois mobs, since mobs with high FR would be resistant to it.<br />
<br />
the dps it puts out is one of the greatest contributors to the aggro it generates.<br />
<br />
what's your mainhand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sardonus</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He said the rogues were saving for an Ifir. To me that implies they are on a dkp system. If that's the case, while they COULD get this for offhand, it would hurt their chances when the Ifir drops if they took the dkp hit for this. I can completely understand why most rogues would pass on this till they got Ifir. On the other hand, I'm sorta surprised no rogue realized he probably wasn't gonna get the Ifir anyways and just decide to bite the bullet and get this for the time being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ifir is so stupidly common, they'll all end up with one eventually anyway. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah stupidly common if you get to/can kill FR. We've gotten like 3 real shots at FR in 6 months or some shit that we've been in planes. When you have 5 other groups in Ele planes that all play earlier than you it's not so easy.<br />
<br />
 If this was this guilds first or second Sol Ro kill or something then their rogues are retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
P.S. 1 GRMK out of something like 18 Solusek kills for my guild, as well. /grumble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok aggro from dps, tho it would be alot better for a rog, strange none wanted it. We have 5 nifes after 11 solro kills and 5 ifir of 8 fr kills, so both pretty common anyhow.</div></div><hr />

what's your mainhand?  <br />
<br />
I believe Qris still mainhands BoC (last I knew anyway).<br />
<br />
Grats bro- both on CE trial and dagger win :) <br />
<br />
AFAIK, this was one of their first few SolRo kills (maybe their 3rd or 4th, not sure), so I too am surprised it fell to a trial warrior, but hey- score one for the good guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some people have found the Ifir common and others have found it to be rare. depending on your server and the competition in the ele planes, especially over time, getting FR will be rare. Those rogues should have gone for bird in hand /shrug. <br />
<br />
as for the winner who started the post, grats. its a nice piece and over time as your attk rating goes up the drop off in dps due to skill cap will be less noticeable.</div></div><hr />
