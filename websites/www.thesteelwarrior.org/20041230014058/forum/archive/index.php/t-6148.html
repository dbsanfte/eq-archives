Because they are on the same timer than fellstrike, mightystrike and charge. <br />
So I have two questions :<br />
<br />
- Does the Precise disc, and by extend, Charge disc, prevent mob riposts ? I understand those allow the user to score better melee checks, so basically we have less ripost with Precise or not a single riposte with charge ? (on non-enraged mob of course)<br />
<br />
- Do you use aggressive ? And how does it parse against the other 30 second damage disc ? I dont like it the way it is right now, the damage increase doesnt seems to be great compared to Fellstrike for exemple.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Debbin</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree fellstrike beats the shit out of mightystrike.  mighty strike is pretty much eye candy for those without fellstrike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were some parses done right after the disc changes. Mighty strike is right below fellstrike in DPS, IIRC, and probably above if you're zerked.<br />
<br />
  I don't know if the increased hits disciplines avoid ripostes, but I personally suspect not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use charge when i have to land a slam or bash. like that stupid cleric mob getting ready to get off a third cheal.<br />
<br />
crips stun dunno if lvl capped but never seen the not stunable message. you have to risk berserk to get the most effect though.<br />
<br />
fellstrike i use for the gotta die now mobs. just seam to get better results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use charge on Gating Eom's in VT, or any gating mob. But for Dps i would use fellstrike</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaoraEci</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mightystrike is invaluable in duels, now that it last 30 seconds you can really lay some hurt once you are berserked. Pop this, if they are far away fire some arrows till you stun them, close the distance, stun them again with some more hits and watch as the fight is over rather quickly :D Works great against pesky running casters :P</div></div><hr />

<br />

OMG this is too funny, I didnt know that did until last night. First time ever i used mightystike out of necessity, on a 4th disciple of Rhag. We were doing High Priest, and after the HP was dead things got out of control and we were both at 35% and my healer was dead.  OK i'm was DEAD tired but i'm sure it said like &quot;A fourth Disciple of Rhag staggers&quot; every time i landed a crippling blow. I never seen that before, i think because thats the first time i used it on a mob that can be stunned. When your berserk mightystrike has to be better than fellstrike, i had 260 hits and i never got that out of fellstrike. I downed that sucka losing only another 2-3% of health. Only to shortly after be summoned by a golem and smoked :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;soandso staggers&quot; means its stunned, not sure for how long, but I dueled a wizzy friend just for the kicks and he could not cast anything at all when I was chain stunning him. It also works for stunnable mobs, I know it spams the shit out of everyone, but I group always with the same ppl, they know that when I go berserk and we have a single, Im gonna use Mightystrike to spam em and laugh :D Besides, it keeps the mob permastunned (on LDoN at least). I think it uses less END than Fellstrike too.<br />
<br />
I dont think Charge avoids ripostes, I have missed hits while I was using Charge, and that is only possible due to some save check from the mob, and I bet it was riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use mightystrike if you have  good weapons and feel like spamming people out with criticals OR to kill a caster in a duel (if you have a nice 2hander like PoWater sword or dathor great hammer) - Using this during berserker (30% or lower) results in stuns that seem to hit most enemies/pc's.<br />
<br />
Use charge if the mob your fighting casts annoying spells (gate, complete heal, etc..)<br />
<br />
Use fellstrike to kill the enemy fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">quote:  I think it [mightystrike] uses less END than Fellstrike too.<br />
<br />
actually thats an important distinction because what we care about often is not dps but increased damage per endurance spent.<br />
<br />
i dont know how long mighty strike stuns last but it wouldnt surprise me if the time were zero. nevertheless it would seem like they would interrupt spells pretty reliably. also its my understanding you dont get stuns unless berserk and on the tougher mobs staying berserk means the cleric spaming you with mini heals which wastes manna. fellstrike seems to do more damage when not berserk which means most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cripple is a cupple seconds atleast long enough to stop a mob your running from dead in its tracks long enough for you to get away, or regain a lead if you're running slow do to health while bow kiting for skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, I think i may have used Fellstrike perhaps once, ever. Yeah, i'm sure that sounds pretty stupid to say given the amount of time involved getting this far...<br />
<br />
Anywho, I use mighty strike regularly for stubborn to die named and such. I havent come across anyone complaining about spam, or even where it has been an issue.<br />
<br />
Part of what makes it appealing is that, while yeah it may seem like showing off (the crits), but at least the others in group/raid know I'm wailing on the sucker, by the means i have available... and if it happens to add to the excitement of the encounter for everyone there, woot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charge is also good for mobs that you tend to miss a lot like red cons and other high ac mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A critical hit is about 70% more damage.  A Crippling blow does about 150% more damage.  Fellstrike doubles damage and caps the minimum damage to weapon X 4 + damage bonus.  For example the lowest you'll hit with Vanazir is around 280 regardless of how low your hit was.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike beats Mightystrike unless you're at berserk.  It also beats Precision/Aggrssive since you don't hit 50% more often or do 50% more damage per hit with either disc and the duration is only twice as long.  Fellstrike is especially good against high AC targets since it raises your minimum damage as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about anyone else, but I've learned a little from this thread. I used to use Mighty Strike all the time when the call for max damage was made, but I've noticed that Fellstrike seems to do more consistant damage. I often find myself playing DPS on raids, and the burn at the end atleast makes me feel like I'm doing my part to help kill it.</div></div><hr />
