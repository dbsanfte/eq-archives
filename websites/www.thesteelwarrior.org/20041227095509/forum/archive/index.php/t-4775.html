<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible for a character who is KoS in Katta to use the banker as a DPS/Proc checking source? And if so, need some details (where to position etc)<br />
<br />
Thanks ~</div></div><hr />

I farm in TB alot and do the Rallic Pack quest often simply by using illusion potions. I usually pick them up in bazaar for 100-120pp. Any good race works for me for doing the quest turnins and buying/selling. BUT as illusion spells have durations, potions likely do also so they aren't going to last the duration of a 8 hour parse.<br />
Now, I don't know this for fact but I think if you can get into the bank you aren't going to be agro'd by the guards that path outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being kos to the bankers wouldn't be a problem since they don't fight back anyway, and you can invis there so as long as no regular guards roam close enough to aggro you I think it would be ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a side note, your initial katta faction is almost enitrely deity based: Cazic, Bertoxxulous, and Big Papa Innoruuk worshippers start KOS, no one else does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What level is the banker? Any risk of death at all (like a guard assisting), and can you get skillups from it?</div></div><hr />

Get behind them and you won't even take ripost. I have parsed well over 30 hours there and never had a problem.</div></div><hr />
