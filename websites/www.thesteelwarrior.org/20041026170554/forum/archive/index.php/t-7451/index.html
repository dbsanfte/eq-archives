<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">wow every post with paladins having worse aggro then a warrior, I've pointed out that paladins can wield a BoW and aug with yeshka and they seriously just steamroll over it and ignore it.  It's like to them EB only exist for warriors.  <br />
<br />
I know alot of high enders do the whole dbow and eoe? but I know alot that still wield thier bow as what second best aggro for a lower riposte rate?<br />
<br />
anyhow, just one of three posts about pon now I guess.  <br />
<br />
And landarain great posts over there, and you are right stun resistance is a very good aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two things.<br />
<br />
1) Although great aggro weapons are, well, great aggro, they're generally not great weapons. So you're telling a class that they have to go back to an inferior weapon when they never had to before. That's a system shock.<br />
<br />
2) For most long time Paladins, EB weapons were WAR exclusive, no matter what the weapon said. because they knew that Warriors needed the aggro. As the changes came in, many Warriors still don't realize that EB procs are now a safety margin instead of a 'must have'. Conversely, many Paladins may know empircally that aggro weapons are no longer WAR only, but most still don't see them as 'Paladin' weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Paladins don't need aggro weapons.  They can generate aggro just fine without them.  So can SKs.  The fact that the perceive a Warrior using all the possible tools available as having better aggro generation than them just means that the Warrior is maximizing all of his potential options, something Knights don't have to do and never have had to do.  If they find it to be a problem, they can follow the same route as a Warrior and do all the things possible to maximize aggro generation, but they don't really need to.  Basically it's just something more to bitch about in hopes that they can leverage it into tanking upgrades because they're not claiming they need access to more aggro weapons or that the aggro on their spells needs to be increased are they?  They're claiming that because of this perceived &quot;inequity&quot; this justifies more tanking upgrades, aren't they?</div></div><hr />

the fourth one is a different topic but again dubb (ass) go home = p</div></div><hr />

Well considering the topic description on the Outhouse says, &quot;The place to vent your frustrations and whine about paladins&quot;, I think it's in the right place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you do realize the &quot;whine about paladins&quot; part is sarcastic, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On another thread I recently posted knights are a bunch of whining bitches, everytime some asinine arguement stirs up on PoN, just does nothing more to me but to re-inforce that.<br />
<br />
Didn't Sony just recently nerf GoD zones to make them tons easier for knights to tank there? Seems all that's been forgotten, let's latch onto the next bitch and whine topic!<br />
<br />
They bitch even when there's nothing wrong. Actually it's gotten to the stage where if knights aren't bitching about something on their boards then something isn't right with the universe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They bitch even when there's nothing wrong. Actually it's gotten to the stage where if knights aren't bitching about something on their boards then something isn't right with the universe.<br />
That's pretty much the case on ANY eq message board, this one included.  You realize the irony/stupidity/whatever of bitching about other people bitching, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well considering the topic description on the Outhouse says, &quot;The place to vent your frustrations and whine about paladins&quot;, I think it's in the right place. <br />
<br />
I have zero issues with where the thread is located.  I take issue with the fact that he's started FOUR goddamned paladin whine threads in the last week and no one wants to hear it.<br />
<br />
If you wanna make one thread, that's fine, keep your fucking bullshit there.  You don't need to make a new topic every day to spout the same retarded bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">au contrere Mathas, I wasn't bitching. Yes there's irony, but it's not here :)</div></div><hr />

I guess you've never created threads with different issues and some even on the same (two threads same topic)<br />
<br />
Talk about some anal bitches when in the RANT section someone can't rant because they did it too often!?</div></div><hr />

The folks saying I've gone over this quite a bit are right, but that's what the forum is for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Paladin primary method of aggro generazation basically doesnt scale,  similiar to how the 50 paladin in pop had more aggro then the 65 warrior with a BoW, the 50 paladin has generally the same spell ag gro as the 65.<br />
<br />
Yes we do have weapons with decnet hate procs, and option for those procs, but we've never needed it, so a lot don't have it,<br />
<br />
One of the points that I bring up a lot though is to use those weapons with good aggro, is we sacrafice a lot of our other bonus's or abilities to do it (which is not a bad thing, i'm just saying its happens) IE if we use that VDD or BoW, we loose the &quot;Shield advantage&quot; if we're chain stunning, we cant use our other spells/abilities as much, or as often, (This is not to say we CANT  use them its just to say that its diminished*)<br />
<br />
*For the inevitable person who says just use heals to hold aggro, theres one hole in that theory, is that heals dont always give aggro, i'm not sure why, but theres many times when you heal someone and aggro doesnt transfer, (Its most easilby noticable when botting a cleric faction farming and dont want the cleric to loose faction sometimes you cast a heal and go to campout, but then you notice you never were even added to the mobs hate list, even though you healed the PC the NPC was beating on**<br />
<br />
**This is not to say I dont use heals to help aggro, I do espcially group heals, or later in fights, I'm saying that its not as good or easy as some people says it, thatit has its drawbacks, THIS IS NOT A BAD THING, just be aware that they are there.</div></div><hr />

Mikar's healing aggro parse (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=17872&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=3) at EQCleric - sample size is way, way too small for solid conclusions on how often heals are hateless, but it was an afterthought; he was parsing something else in that thread -<br />
<br />
Total heals: 100 <br />
No hate heals: 50 <br />
<br />
The reason group heals work for aggro and targeted heals don't is that a group heal is up to 6 separate heals; you're basically guaranteed at least a few of them will generate aggro.<br />
<br />
Paladin primary method of aggro generazation basically doesnt scale, similiar to how the 50 paladin in pop had more aggro then the 65 warrior with a BoW, the 50 paladin has generally the same spell ag gro as the 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know from when I'm forced to tank in groups that stun aggro is weak (post-SCS3) and heal aggro is useless. Adding a few things to stuns could easily make them scale better:<br />
<br />
Spell: Concept-Stun-70<br />
1: Stun(4.00 sec/70)<br />
2: Increase Hate by 350<br />
<br />
Mana: 160 Skill: Evocation <br />
Casting Time: 1.2 Recast Time: 18 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.25 Resist: Magic <br />
Resist Adjust -25 Range: 200   <br />
Interruptable: Yes Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental Category: Stun [Targeted]<br />
<br />
Classes: PAL/70<br />
Cast on you: This is not a real spell.<br />
Cast on other: %Version without recourse<br />
<br />
Adding a recourse would balance stun mitigation while giving paladins a little more sustained aggro.<br />
<br />
Spell: Concept-Stun-70b<br />
1: Stun(4.00 sec/70)<br />
<br />
Mana: 160 Skill: Evocation <br />
Casting Time: 1.2 Recast Time: 18 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.25 Resist: Magic <br />
Resist Adjust -25 Range: 200   <br />
Interruptable: Yes Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental Category: Stun [Targeted]<br />
Autocast: Concept-Stun-70b-Recourse<br />
<br />
Classes: PAL/70<br />
Cast on you: This is not a real spell.<br />
Cast on other: %Version with recourse<br />
<br />
Spell: Concept-Stun-70b-Recourse<br />
1: Stun Resist(1000)<br />
2: Increase Modify Hate by 115<br />
<br />
Mana: 0 Casting Time: 0 <br />
Recast Time: 0 Fizzle Time: 0 <br />
Range: 200 Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: Any Interruptable: Yes <br />
Short Buff Box: Yes Target Type: Single<br />
Resist: Unresistable Spell Type: Detrimental<br />
<br />
Duration: 3 ticks<br />
Cast on you: This is not a real spell.<br />
Cast on other: %Recourse for Concept-Stun-70b<br />
<br />
While this would balance stuns a little better and allow them to scale, keep in mind the concept stuns I came up with are nearly double the aggro of regular stuns, and so the mana cost increased sharply. This would encourage paladins to use level-appropriate stuns more, since higher-level stuns seal aggro better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Stuns are cheap enough as it is and still produce a serviceable amount of aggro.  When all is said and done about Warrior's dominance in aggro with DBoW and whatever, at least 25% of the time the person getting the aggro first after a mez break is still a Paladin on a raid.  Now this may not sound like very much but you're looking at a Paladin against multiple warriors with DBoW or similar high end weapons, and they can do it without using any special aggro weapon setup.<br />
<br />
If an EB stun is needed, just change the long stun line to do so.  No need to make a new spell.  I don't remember the last time I saw any Paladin use those long stuns anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Increasing level cap on stuns, adding a hate component, and even a mitigated hate (- agro) compent could be useful for paladins. The stun could really come in usefl when a warrior MTs but a pally can chain stun without pulling agro, or grab major agro when ever he wanted. IMO should always be well equiped in the agro department. I don't know first hand how agro is at the highend with EB + anger 3 + EoA but it does seem that paladins would have a hard time taking agro if needed with a well equiped warrior. Give the paladins finer agro controls. Oh and remove stun immunity from trash mobs, thats just annoying same thing with trash mobs summoning. I can understand boses or mini-bosses, but a_big_rat_01 summoning, immune to stun and mez is just annoying.</div></div><hr />
