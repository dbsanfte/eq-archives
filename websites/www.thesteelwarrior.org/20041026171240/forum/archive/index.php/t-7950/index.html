<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Needless to say I'm getting really pissed dying in lower guk in the last couple weeks.<br />
<br />
I run around swarming undead frogs to set up rampage (working on Crown of Deceit faction of course), and my mood gets evil when i fall ~10 ft down a random ladder/hole and die instantly.<br />
<br />
Is this a 'side effect' of collision fixes or have i somehow just not been experiencing this crap before?<br />
<br />
Other zones where people are goin splat like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, cleric in my guild had the same problems in LGuk going splat on ladders.<br />
<br />
In POK its sometimes the same if you walk through library. The height differences aint that big that it would justify a 20k fall, but we have had several fatal casualties in there (and no i dont speak falling off the elevator - thats real high, I admit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Falling damage is based on hangtime.  If you lag while falling, or get some weird sliding effect against geometry, or just have a computer with a poor framerate, the resulting hangtime can be enough to 20k you.  This is why some people can jump into the Tactics Pit without dying, and some cannot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I died zoning to KT from Natimbi after a 20k fall.  Kinda sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mady</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">An enchanter buddy of mine took a 20k fall last night in Velks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can fall from the top in Velks and take ~500 dmg. Tactics pit nets me ~600. Carrying a light load helps. However, if I lag at all I will 20k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it used to be 10k. but then they realized that sometimes a very well equipped warrior would fall off a ladder and drop about 2 feet and suffer 10k damage and ACTUALLY SURVIVE. so they upped it to 20k.<br />
<br />
this gem of a feature is how we know that some psycho person at sony is sneaking in at night and actually adding bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mady</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This guy got stuck at the first pit fall heading up the ramp and fell...not even mid way. 20K seems kinda harsh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Again, if he lagged on the way down, or ended up standing on someone's head before reaching the ground, etc., then he could definitely 20k.<br />
<br />
You can 20k off a rock if you somehow make the hangtime long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got summoned by a named in BoT the other day and fell for 20k, I was none too pleased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jumped off the ramp behind the bank in Katta the other while doing the Loyalist shield quest a couple of weeks ago for 20K damage. Thats was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not!</div></div><hr />

I've seen them for sale on my server, but 25k is a bit much for my tastes. it the only thing I have left to do on the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>skjalnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My favorite 20k hit happened to me this weekend...  Off the little bridge between the big bank and the nexus stone. <br />
<br />
Luckily it made for easy CR i guess...</div></div><hr />
