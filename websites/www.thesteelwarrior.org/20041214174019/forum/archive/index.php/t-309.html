It never glows during the course of my play, as focus effects do not affect clicks or procs normally.<br />
<br />
As for aggro, I have the best one hander in the game for aggro - the BloodFrenzy.  Wielding this with the best Furious Bash shield so far (Aegis of the Earth) seems to have no affect on my aggro.  In fact, I have better aggro with Bloodfrenzy + Jade Mace than I do with Bloodfrenzy + Aegis of Earth.<br />
<br />
Bashes seem to create no perceivable aggro.  I have yet to see a mob turn on me because of a bash.<br />
<br />
Is this focus working as intended?  If so, what is this focus supposed to do?</div></div><hr />

- Make you spend DKP on useless items<br />
- Make you believe that a shield is usefull<br />
- Make you think that VI programers have a brain<br />
- Make you have a phat magelo<br />
- Make you <br />
- Make you <br />
- Make you <br />
<br />
Focus effect dont work on procs.<br />
(Ask a rangers with ID4 item if he gets bigger procs)<br />
<br />
Where did you ever get the idea that it would work for us ?<br />
<br />
Lets face it for bash agro to be &quot;noticable&quot; it should be at least<br />
100-150 agro points. And we know it aint.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aegis of Earth = &quot;my disc just dropped, i got no BoW&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh agree the stats kick ass, so does the mod.<br />
But no one would ever use this unless disc down when MTing.<br />
<br />
Just like every other fooking shield in the game at this point.<br />
You end up using it 10 15 mins per day in the best case.</div></div><hr />

It seems focus only effect spells that have a real spell level.  Since most of procs don't have a spell level (since no PC gets them), this means focus won't work with them either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way I read it was focus effects work on spells that the person actually has. Shaman with Rune Etched Icewurm Fang would get focus from the Spirit Strike proc as they get it at level 14.<br />
<br />
 And I doubt they read this board at all. Never saw any signs of them really reading the old board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, focus certainly doesn't work on spells that no one has, like Enraging Blow.<br />

Does a furious bash item glow when you bash?</div></div><hr />

My offhand weapon is a SOD so I would think it would be noticeable if I switched in this. If I had to make a statement I'd say the shield holds aggro better than an sod but I regain aggro more when the sod procs.</div></div><hr />

Shrug I have little problem holding agro with bloodfrenzy and Aegis of the Earth. It seems to work well for me and I even get agro back fast on agro blurring mobs.  <br />
What does using Bloodfrenzy and Aegis do for you that makes it worth using then?  You say you &quot;no problem&quot; with aggro, but what advantage do you gain?  With my set of raiders I lose aggro a lot more with Aegis than I do with BoW.  The options here are that I can tell my guild to lower their DPS and more carefully manage aggro so I can use BF + Aegis, or tell them to behave how they have for months and use Blade of war.<br />
<br />
Let's assume that BF+Aegis is 10% less aggro generation than Blade of War.  Why use it in this case?  A few more hit points and AC are worth the loss in aggro generation?<br />
<br />
If Furious Bash worked to increase the aggro of a warrior beyond that of commonly available weapons (Blade of War, SEWS), or if shields gave a warrior a significant defensive advantage, I would understand why warriors used them.<br />
<br />
As it stands I feel that people who use them are just choosing to operate with lower dps on a raid.  I'd like &quot;Furious Bash&quot; to do something, because I would prefer to use BF+Aegis.  So far in my experience, Furious Bash is not worth the aggro tradeoff.  My guess is this effect was supposed to affect procs, but it doesn't.  It would be nice to get an explanation on what it is really supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Oh, the reason you get blurring mobs back faster is due to using a fast swinging weapon which gives you a greater chance to be the first to anger a mob once it blurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hold aggro just fine with BF+BoC while disc is on, then BF+shield of unimaginable horrors while disc is off.  If you use the time while disc is on to build some massive aggro, it doesnt hurt so bad to lose offhand aggro when disc drops.<br />
<br />
I totally 100% agree with the theory that MT aggro equates directly to guild DPS and therefor guild power.  Having to have other classes decrease DPS to &quot;control their aggro&quot; is highly detrimental to a guild.  The more aggro you can generate as a MT the better off you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the use of the term &quot;commonly available&quot; with BoW... Here, let me walk up to Rallos, hand him a couple thousand plat or so for his sword and walk off.<br />
<br />
I'm still hoping that Auliffe will finally drop the FB4 shield because I want to experiment with this.  And no, I won't be using a BF or BoC with it either, at best a CHSD.  However provided I can finally get the shield, I'll happily report back my experiences for those of us who don't have the ability to just go and pick up those BoWs that Rallos carelessly leaves around the house.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BF + Aegis should not beat BoW agro wise (or BF/HG/BoC).<br />
<br />
It should be inferior. Inferior to the point the HP/Ac gain is worth the Agro/DPS loss.<br />
I can not imagine any numbers, but i'd say a 10-15% seems like a good number.<br />
<br />
Why ?<br />
Well you will going into &quot;Turtle Mode&quot;, hence increase your<br />
survivability, there should be some tradeoff for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is that with Furious Bash broken is you do<br />
get that increase survivability, but the agro loss is so huge<br />
its not even worth it.<br />
<br />
When would that shield be handy ?<br />
On all fights that last much much longer than defensive.<br />
Those fights that MT death is often disaster (see xenogy).<br />
<br />
&quot;Turtle Mode&quot; should not be for burn fights, BoW  and BF/HG/BoC<br />
are for burn fights (for me burn fight = under 3 min).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parsing the effect of the shield is very easy<br />
(xp in fire at 1st castle is a good parse spot)<br />
<br />
Parse 1 : <br />
BF + Aegis (not using taunt, but bashing)<br />
BF + Shield warrior (not using taunt, but bashing)<br />
<br />
Parse 2 : <br />
BF + Aegis (not using taunt, but bashing)<br />
BF + Fine Steel (not using taunt)<br />
<br />
Parse 3 :<br />
BF + Aegis (not using taunt, but bashing)<br />
BF + 1HS with decent DPS (not using taunt)<br />
<br />
Parse 3 :<br />
BF + Aegis (not using taunt, but bashing)<br />
BF + BoC/HG  (not using taunt)<br />
<br />
Parse 4 :<br />
BF + Aegis (not using taunt, but bashing)<br />
BoW  (not using taunt)<br />
<br />
Have the 2nd warrior slowly upgrade his offhand. (from fine steel to BoC).<br />
<br />
And try to see how is getting overall the most CH's <br />
(no need for an exact count)<br />
<br />
I know i get 80% of CH's versus a BF/BoC war with no offensive<br />
AA while i have them all. (i use BoW)<br />
<br />
When the BF+Aegis warrior starts to fall way behind on CH's.<br />
You will see the effect of Aegis and thus Furious Bash.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet you'll see War2 take over with the fine steel.<br />
Or with a weapon just an bit better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavanD</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on the situation. On exp mobs and regular mobs we are clearing to get to a big mob than I'll switch to usually my Stone Etched Warsword. But on boss mobs I don't give a damn what my dps is. Im tanking a mob its not my job to kill it faster or do uber dps thats the rest of the guilds. I might put on boc with bloodfrenzy to put guildleader at ease for the first minute to get in 2 or 3 enraging blow procs but than I always go to the shield. I use it on Fennin, Xeg, the warlord, etc. <br />
<br />
Having 2.1k ac is very nice. Also I don't have to tell my guild to cut down dps or behave themselves so that takes that theory out the window. The agro might bounce in the beginning to a rogue or monk for a second but that happens sometimes regardless if you dont get agro proc etc. But after a few seconds I have a solid lock on agro.<br />
<br />
Sure I think maybe furious bash could do more but its not bad. You just have to know when and how to use it properly. Like staggering taunt and bash. Pushing both at the same time will most likely not help you but if you space them you'll probably see your agro control go much higher. Your mileage may vary though shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 More? As far as anyone can tell it does *nothing*. So yeah, more than nothing would be swell.<br />
<br />
 Slap on a normal non-FB shield Davan and see if you still hold agro fine. Be interested to know personally.</div></div><hr />
