<br />
There is an auction on ebay to buy a penny for $10 from me listed here:<br />
<br />
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3954998326<br />
<br />
Board admins if you feel this is out of place please delete...but I'm hoping you let it stay up and I'm hoping that a few of these pennies sell.<br />
<br />
I am Kogur Kindsoul (Aaron Lord, my sister is Keelian Kindsoul (Kionna Peebles), and my brother in law is Milodon Kindsoul (Micheal Peebles) all from the EMarr server...and this is our story.<br />
<br />
My sister lost her job about nine months ago. When this happened she was unable to pay her bills, and barely able to keep up on rent money. So, I moved in with her and helped her start paying her bills. She now has a temporary position.<br />
<br />
We were finally almost caught up on bills when some strange viral infection hit the family hard in December. Micheal and Kionna were both out of work on and off for about 2 weeks of December, and being that niether of their jobs have insurance coverage this was 4 weeks of lost pay(between the two of them) during December. <br />
<br />
While this was all occurring Kionna began to complain about a numbness in her right foot. She ignored it but unfortunately it did not get better, instead it got worse. What eventually happened is she became numb from the waist down not able to feel anything. <br />
<br />
We went to the emergency room, and they said there was nothing they could do...she needed to see a neurological specialist, so they referred her to one. She went the next day to the neurologist and he said he wouldn't even see her without an up front payment of 320 dollars. We did not have that kind of money lying around because of all the bills we already had piling up.<br />
<br />
So, she waited about a week. Finally, it got to the point to where she was scared out of her mind: literally crying all the time about it. We convinced her to go to the emergency room again, and this time they were more sympathetic. The nurses there actually called an on-call neurologist and he agreed to come in on a Saturday night with no money to try and diagnose her. <br />
<br />
That brings us to the point of almost being current. Right now my sister has been in the hospital for six days, she has had two spinal taps done so they can test for spinal menengitis(which they have pretty much ruled out), Multiple Schlorosis, and various other spinal viruses/diseases. They have also drawn blood from her for various tests about 20 times in this time, determined she definately has diabetes, and her white blood cell count is high for an unknown reason. <br />
<br />
All this boils down to about 6 weeks of missed pay between Micheal(Milodon) and Kionna(Keelian) in only a two month span. We were still not completely caught up on the rest of our bills when all of this struck. So, we are at least one month behind on nearly all of our bills and two to three months behind on most of them. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure that it's a moral or ethical thing to do, but I am asking that you buy a penny from me! I capped the pennies available to stop at the approximate amount of the debt these illnesses have created.... HAPPY BIDDING, AND BUY A PENNY!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Move to a socialistic country, and realise why USA is the shittiest, most fucked up country in the world.<br />
<br />
Or stroll thru the streets of New York (Not Manhatten), and unless you're blind, you'll realise what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Remember, socialism does not prevent multi billion business, yet it prevents 99.9% human miserability, and having a social security net is a great thing, and wellworth paying taxes to!<br />
<br />
If this story is real, I'll buy one from you.</div></div><hr />

The one subscription that wasn't paid up front has been cancelled.</div></div><hr />

The message is there if you want to believe it or not, but this board isn't for soliciting charity.  Nice of Chatja to derail it on the first reply :p.</div></div><hr />
