<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting pissed with the star system on the boards, what moron thought it would be a good idea to make the edit key require being everyones best friend.<br />
<br />
I had edit just 3 hours ago, now i dont, why? because i pissed off a cry baby paladin in the warrior armory, so the little bitch used the find all posts ability and 1 starred all my posts, the basic effect is by doing this ( and probibly being so vindictive to log in his other accounts ) he has basically fucked me over for not pandering to his sorry ass :/<br />
<br />
The sony boards are ass.<br />
<br />
Hey frod, hate to bug you but did you apply as class rep yet? you would have my support :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">keep your head in the cesspool long enough; and you end up smelling like......<br />
<br />
i wouldn't let it bother ya though; don't let some pre-pubescent schoolkid's OMGROOFLESPWN get you down. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Christ, I know exactly what you mean. People star for disliking or disagreeing with you regardless of how informative or well written the thread is. They really need a limit on how many 1 stars a person can give another in a given time frame. It's just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They need meta-moderation, a'la slashdot. Anonymously rating the raters stops the bull pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having the edit key require a bunch of post and a particular star rating to get it is retarded in the first place.  Everquestlive has way too many assclowns that post there to have posters rating each other anyway. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like we need a system like this here <br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im pretty sure on the eqlive boards the edit key is on a 15minute timer - meaning you can only edit for 15minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">nope, it is based on ratings and page views, you get the edit key at master level, i was master for about a week until the assclown had a pissy fit.... bastard went back and 1 starred all the old posts so there would be a good chance no one would rate them and override him(I'm sure it is a him, and a virgin to :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">(I'm sure it is a him, and a virgin to :D )<br />
<br />
Goddamn you're juvenille sometimes. And you wonder why people do this kinda shit to you.  Maturity = Acting your age and not your urge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey let me vent damnit!<br />
<br />
partha has 400 posts and is still rated as &quot;newbie&quot; which is a step under the bull i am ranked as now, yet there are people with 40 posts that kiss everyones ass and have an edit key before partha, that shows how ass up this system is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lol all these &quot;rep&quot; stars on boards are such a waste of time and frankly who gives a rats ass. if your  a good and informative poster, then people will respect you for that, regardless of how many bad marks you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, but it is like having a fishing hok in your eyelid when you cant edit &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">with a bit of luck it will make you think a bit harder before posting... Haass is right, we could use that system here ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not really, nothing stops someone from making a few extra accounts and blamming people in a vindictive manner.<br />
<br />
The problem is there isnt a limit of how long a post can be voted on, so someone who sees you say &quot;If you have your spell book, and all the warrior abilitys you would be playing in god mode, this game isnt about god mode&quot; could go back and rate all your old posts, people are not mature enough to keep it to the post and subject at hand.<br />
<br />
hell, the little bitch went back and 1 starred a congrats posted to someone who made 65 3 months ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Posted this on the EQ live boards.<br />
<br />
Actually, I find the one starring hilarious anymore. As probably the newbie with the most posts on the board by a long shot, I've accepted the fact that I'll never see the edit button, so I just type it right the first time. I know who's doing it, and I find it simultaneously sad AND funny that they're so irritated with me that I could probably post Happy Birthday greetings and get a one star. <br />
<br />
 Yes, and they're easy for the casual board lurker to spot, as well. Makes for a fun game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">To bad you cant fire blowdarts at them or something :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To bad you cant fire blowdarts at them or something :P<br />
 Say hello to edit button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">sweet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think I'm now locked from rating you any more, but atleast you have the decency of an edit button now. I'd rather my fellow TSWs be well spoken and grammaticly correct at the least, even while pissing people off. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">heh, thanks man :P<br />
<br />
I bumped up the rating on a few of partha's post that were getting unfairly raped, now i am locked from that to :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i've prolly been one stared to. when i get the time i'll bump you guys up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I kinda feel like 5 starring to bump friends up is as bad as 1 starring to bring enemies down. It's a retarded system that allows that, one way or the other. I'm not going to do either, personally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the system itself is retarded, might as well make the most of it, eh? I star people because it's just idiotic to not have an edit button because some nerd decided to be cute. An edit button is just common decency and should not be an award for patting other people on the back and stating the staus quo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">mmm, meta cliques!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">mmm, meta cliques!<br />
<br />
lmao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">&lt;&lt;Sounds like we need a system like this here &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
except here a lower rating would give us edit priveledges :)<br />
<br />
... which i would no doubt get after my tirade on the hp thread ... yet i wouldnt edit because im too lazy to figure out how. heck im too lazy to figure out how to work the quote thing. and dont tell me how. im too dumb to understand what you are telling me ok?<br />
<br />
and gerrick link us the board so that volunteers from here can 5star all your posts and get your edit back.<br />
<br />
not like you deserve it or anything :)<br />
<br />
but id still 5star you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm getting stalked by some one star troll myself.<br />
<br />
Stupid system, and childish behavior on the troll's part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Im pretty sure on the eqlive boards the edit key is on a 15minute timer - meaning you can only edit for 15minutes.<br />
<br />
This is correct. <br />
<br />
On a side note, having 2 accounts means the worse rating you can have is a 2 star. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">i taged a few 5's on ya deamonwynd as well as parth and gerick and frod.<br />
<br />
amazing what happens on a rainy sat afternoon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">this isn't gonna be where you collaborate against ze germans, is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I 1 starred all germans. Twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'll get those commie bastards if its the last thing I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i only one star people he say the same thing over and over and over, and can't see beyond their own blunt point.<br />
<br />
always seams to be a pally though.</div></div><hr />
