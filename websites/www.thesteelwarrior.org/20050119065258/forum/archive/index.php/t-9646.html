<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigrin Da Troll</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Magnetic gear is made (well, repaired really) with Blacksmithing, and it is further upgradeable to Chaged Magnetic gear with Blacksmithing.  Some things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
1.  Magnetic gear is Attuneable, so if you equip yours then no one else can do the upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
2.  Visible-slot Magnetic armour is equivalent to (warrior) Ornate without the effects.  For bards &amp; clerics this is an upgrade in AC &amp; HP over their Ornate.<br />
<br />
3.  The items needed to upgrade Magentic armour to Charged Magnetic armour are Lightning Cores, which drop off Lightningfist Diodites, Staticfist Diodites, etc. in MPG and are so disgustingly rare that most people report only a single core per 20ish hours of farming diodites.<br />
<br />
4.  Visible Charged Magnetic armour is about halfway between Ornate and elemental in AC, stats &amp; HP.<br />
<br />
5.  Magnetic Charm is made by Blacksmithing and upgrades with the amount of visible magnetic and charged magnetic armour you wear.  With a full suit the charm is equivalent to an elemental-flagged Carved Wooden Figurine.<br />
<br />
6.  At the moment, Charged Magnetic armour is hideously overpriced, and Lightning Cores are scarcer than hen's teeth so unless you can camp MPG diodites for days on end, you can forget about loading up on the new armour for a year or so until the price comes down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So going for OoW tier 1 armor would prob be better then huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oow tier 1 is better than magnetic, yes, better than charged as well.  Armor has better ac/hp as well as having worn effects which the crafted stuff does not.</div></div><hr />
