Simply put REMOVE their channeling skill.<br />
<br />
They could still get the usage of their spells as long as they aren't being beaten on. This would have zero effect on their utility line of spells, including their combat spells(as long as they controll aggro).<br />
This approach would simply remove their ability to channel through direct combat, in essence making them rely on their taunt button much like warriors do.<br />
<br />
Sorry was rushed before...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interupts do happen quite a bit when tanking.  Fizzles happen enough.  Nothing is a sure thing beyond the fact making another attempt is a lot faster than waiting for Taunt to pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, just simply balance the game by having those stun spells cost more mana.  Lots more.  This would still enable them to use them with some effectiveness, but not for an unlimited amount of time.<br />
<br />
The only problem with that is at low levels Paladins would hardly ever be able to use their stuns at all..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you made it so Knights cannot cast indefinitely you would probably have to do it to other classes or limit mana regen massively which would kill enchanters group desireability some.<br />
<br />
To me the answer lies in making the damage taken to a warrior SIGNIFICANTLY less than a knight on a given mob OR dramatically reducing the casting side of a Knight.  If a knight is 75% warrior and 25% cleric, make the knight take 133% (4/3) of the damage that a warrior would given the same AC and skill progression (ie, both capped defensive skills).  Although it would be nice to up the warrior damage mitigation, it would upset raid encounters too much I think.  The more feasible solution is to retune Knight's mitigation like monks were.  More than likely this would kill Knights for exp groups and therefor is not a viable solution.<br />
<br />
A more realistic possibility IMHO, would be to retune spells and enforce level limits (ie no lvl 9 spells being able to be cast on lvl 65 mobs) and give Knights 25% of the mana pool of the parent class of a given level and gear.  To go along with this mana regen should reflect the 25% caster as well, ie KEI granting 14/4 mana per tick as it should affect only the caster portion of the Knight.<br />
<br />
When I started EQ it was true that Knights could out aggro warriors but they had to med sometimes when tanking AND required more healing than warriors.  Today I rarely see one med and CHeal is a CHeal, doesn't matter if it lands for 5k on me and 5.5k on a Knight, the mob is dead and we are both starting full health again for the same cleric mana.<br />
<br />
The above ideas are too game changing to ever be implemented but I think that the caster side of Knights has gotten way too far out of hand.  When you see magelo's of warriors with 8k hps and knights with 7.5k hps AND 5k mana you realize that somehow Knights became 95% warrior AND 75% parent class.  Don't complain about the %'s either, I made up the parent class one but the above would result in a 9.9k Knight vs 10.4K Warrior or 95%.  The point is that % Warrior + % Parent class &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 100%<br />
<br />
To balance the classes you need to bring the Knight (although hybrid really) package down closer to 100% in my opinion.  Changes to the warrior class would be very difficult to make after the defensive discipline was added to the game as it seems most raid encounters for appropriately leveled and gear players are centered around it.<br />
<br />
I will also say that when I started EQ, ROK had just come out.  I was dumbfounded that anyone would play a hybrid class as knights and rangers in particular seemed to be laughed at.  I have no desire to see them return to that state, but I think the original caster penalties for hybrids were on the right track as far as balancing.  They may have been too severe but IMO some are needed with the prevailance of all/all gear with massive hps and mana and wis/int on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A partial solution would be to limit spells that absolutely cannot affect a mob, i.e. low level stuns on PoP mobs, to creating like 1 point of agro or something. That'd do something for the pally problem at least.</div></div><hr />

stop obessing about it already!<br />

also, at least imo, the reason why a group would prefer an SK or Pal over a warrior isnt aggro lock, despite what people think. being able to have casters unload doesnt do jack shit to overall DPS (in xp groups) but pre engagement range aggro, which this change wouldnt even affect..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh really?  you dont think the wizard/mage/druid that's able to get an extra nuke off immdiately after aggro is locked would increase overall dps?   I think you better re-word that statement.  Also, if aggro is locked the cleric only has to worry about healing 1 person, and is nuking and even meleeing as well.</div></div><hr />

Ouch while this might solve the problem I don't think nerfing another class is going to work (setting things up as &quot;zero sum&quot; game where you can only gain if the other guy loses is not customer service friendly class balancing)<br />

<br />
MANA/Mana regenis still the limited factor in XP groups (Not so much as boss's)<br />
<br />
It doesnt matter if the caster nukes once on or at 20% if he can only substain 1 nuke/mob per going oom<br />
<br />
(or 2 nukes at start compared to 2 at end)<br />
<br />
the overall DPS will be the same.<br />
<br />
I'll fully agree that paladins tanking will increase Burst DPS, overall dps? nope because all the wizards/mages  I talk to say they still go oom if they go all out in an XP group</div></div><hr />

<br />
One more nuke per mob will increase overall DPS for the duration of the group.  I'd think that would be pretty easy to see.  And since I know that typically Wizards/Mages aren't running anywhere near OOM when I'm tanking, it's clear to me that they have plenty of mana to spare to squeeze out that one more nuke per mob.  So I find this point to be pretty baseless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">09-27-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">glatius thats not how mana regen works, wizards dont run oom in xp groups because its stupid to be at a constant zero percent, you want mana if the shit hits the fan, they stay at 30% or 50% or 99% (doesnt really matter as long as they arnt oom or Full mana)<br />
<br />
they could squeeze in one more nuke over the point of an hour or two, but not per mob, if they nukedo nce more per mob they would go OOM fast...<br />
<br />
Wizard/Mages balance incoming mana w/ outcoming mana, having a paladin tank means they can be more lazy about when, but it doesnt increase the amount they can do overall.<br />
<br />
Unless they are FM the mana regen they could &quot;Squeeze&quot; in is not going to waste, it adds up, get enuff and have an extra nuke on a mob</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its a marginal DPS increase that doesnt even matter in the grand sceme of things, having  less then one a few more dps doesnt effect shit, half the reason things are the way they are is because people are uneducated and make big conclusions about short amounts of time and think they can logicially expand it and have no problems, whether its seing a 5k splay and thinking paladins are MONSTER dps vs undead (when its really still far behind monk/rog/wiz/mag/any dps clas) or seeing a wizard being able to unload when a paladin is tanking and think they can sust ain that for 2 hours in an xp group..<br />
<br />
Paladins can do some awesome things in short term, but they are usually not sustainable, or reliable, do these things help? no doubt,  do they get paladins groups? more then likely. i do not dispute that, i dispute it when people make ofbase claims to try to further an arguement, hell half the time ia gree with the arguement i just dont agree with the approach, because its usually wrong</div></div><hr />

So all those people who claim to be able to do so much more with a Paladin tanking over a Warrior are wrong in their perceptions and instead you're right?  Interesting.  Well lets go spread the news then.  We need to make sure everyone knows that Madrondorf says that their perceptions of DPS increases with Paladin tanks are misperceptions.  I'm sure that should fix things right up....</div></div><hr />

When you talk about total group DPS, are you talking about total group DPS over say 3 minutes or 3 hours? Yes a group with a Knight's total DPS over 3 minutes will be much, much higher than a group's total DPS with a Warrior, but does your XP group last 3 minutes before they decide it's time to call it quits while you're ahead of the total DPS rating? Over a long period of a time, a caster cease to have the ability to pump out more damage regardless of aggro because mana regen becomes the limiting factor. At this point the DPS you get from a warrior over a Paladin is significant. Of course, I guess all you people's groups are so uber that your casters just chain SoS for 3 hours straight without breaking a sweat. Stop lying to yourself and think your group is all uber. If aggro is even an issue then your group sucks for DPS because a truly heavy DPS loaded group runs out of mobs to kill well before any aggro related problems can surface <br />
<br />
Theres another warrior with a wizard alt who says the same thing but I cant find the quote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we went through Phantron's various arguements.  They didn't hold up well under close examination.   Basically it requires there to always be a mob in camp as soon as you finish the previous one.  But we all know that there is at least some time between pulls except in the most uber and focused of groups.  So casters have time to regen mana between pulls, sometimes a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
And he then goes on to claim that it's irrelevant because there are a limited number of mobs available and therefore regardless of whether you kill them slightly faster or not, you're going to run out of mobs before respawn anyway.  This may be true in some places, such as BoT, but it certainly isn't true in other places.  And it most clearly isn't true in LDoN, since the point is to kill as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
If a caster can husband their mana or regen it in various ways for an hour and a half, in LDoN that's all they need.  Having extra mana left over at the end of the run is meaningless, you don't get extra points for it.  So the fact that Paladins can allow casters to use all their mana as rapidly as it can regen without negative aggro results is clearly an advantage in that environment, even more so than in other environements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont really get this, maybe i'm missing something but it doesnt matter if a pal or war is tanking, the caster will still med, and even with this med time, the caster will *still* be limited by Mana regen, not aggro.</div></div><hr />

Let's cut to the real issue...<br />
<br />
Are you claiming that there is not an &quot;aggro cap&quot; which is lower DPS than the mana regen cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you claiming that there is not an &quot;aggro cap&quot; which is lower DPS than the mana regen cap?<br />
<br />
Frodlin addresses the core matter.  Are you claiming that with KEI and other mana regen techniques that casters are unable to keep casting at a steady rate which is higher than the aggro generated by a tank not using stuns or other spells to generate additional aggro?  Can you back that up with anything other than your say so, because it defies much of what is believed to be known about the current caster abilities?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Basically yes, for a short period of time a caster will undoubtable beable to unload more damage in a short amount of time with a paladin or SK or anyone besides a warrior tanking, but the downtime will be proportional to the amount of mana spent, no matter when the caster is spent. Given a longer period of time, (how many xp groups last  less then 10 15 20 minutes?) But at least when I xp or LDON they  usually are 50+ minutes at least. the disparities (sp) between DPS with pal tanking and war tanking will cease because, they cannnot sustain the burst DPS a paladin allows because they will go oom, in the extroidnairily buffed groups (FT 15 + VoQ + BoTN + Beastlord + Bard pumping mana) +  MMM + Maxed FT AA + Max specialization + Mod rods  + every 5 minutes, (But the Few casters who have this more then likely are gunna be grouped with Warriors with BoW + aggro generilzation, +   additional aggro procs (AHR, CoS, SoPM) this may not be as true, but this is XP groups we are talking about, and when talking about, <br />
<br />
What do I have to back it up?<br />
<br />
I guess its because ist what frodlin says, the &quot;mana regen&quot; cap in the longrun is more of a problem then the &quot;aggro cap,&quot; When i ask wizards or mages in my guild, they say that in the long run mana regen is the problem, not aggro, in short burts, or for &quot;burning&quot; the mob they prefer a paladin/sk but they just cant keep that up and have more downtime when they have to do that, so overall its the same DPS</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would imagine it's quite reassuring to know the Knight has aggro locked down instead of wondering if a modest nuke is going to bring the mob running at you simply because a &quot;Taunt 'n Pray&quot; Warrior is tanking it.<br />
<br />
And if the mob is running at you, would you rather a class that can Root, Stun, LoH, Heal, and Res was trying to keep you alive or one that relied on random weapon procs and an extremely fickle Taunt button (assuning they could stay in melee distance to use either).<br />
<br />
It's not even close. Most Knights don't even try to pretend it is. They change the subject to raid roles and their lower DPS.<br />

<br />
Nope that has tons of use, It makes a paladin superior for warriors for most situations for XP Groups because of flexability...<br />
<br />
I just dont buy the whole paladins tanking increase's group DPS by any signicent amount thing...<br />
<br />
Overall I think Paladins are a superior XP group tank In a majority of circumstances,  I dont beleive its as drastic as some say...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you think you could link some of the threads on the caster boards showing where they discuss how Paladin aggro lock doesn't in any way increase their DPS performance?  I'd be interested in seeing that.  Also, I imagine there should be threads on the Monk board and Rogue board discussing how they don't have to FD or evade more with a Warrior versus a Paladin and therefore take no hits in their DPS either.<br />
<br />
Because I have read threads saying the exact opposite, so I'm wondering where you're getting your ideas if it's not out of your hat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
signicent DPS increase?<br />
<br />
No...<br />
<br />
Just how as its been parsed that Warriors tank up to 10% better then Pal/SK in same gear (beleive it was a parse on FOH board, dont have a copy atm, its not really that big of a difference, I wouldnt be surprised if there is some dps difference (Which may or may not be offset by warriors superiror DPS) but its not really that signicent as a balance point.<br />
<br />
This brings me to one of the biggest problems in balancing wich i have stated before, if things are &quot;perceived&quot; different then they are, do you balance for the perception or reality. (SU3 is a great example for this, people see this big crits and thing paladins make awesome DPS tanks for undead dungeons, (even tho most &quot;undead&quot; dungeons haev signicent non undead monsters) and I have no doubt it gets paladins groups; but in reality, people ahve parsed the DPS increase for SU3 and its really not that signicent, espcailly when countered against flurry/superior weapon skills on warrior... But it definatly gets paladins groups over warriors because people *think* it owns moreso then it does.<br />
<br />
The same thing happens in this sutation, a wizard says hey with this paladin tanking I can really unload, and they dont really notice the increased downtime from unloading. so they perceive their dps to be signicently increase, and choose paladins for tanks for this, but the difference really isnt signicent when the large scale when the increased med time is factored in</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's simple really(to me), if the spell has no chance to land make it carry so little aggro that it isn't worth casting. This would force using the level appropriate spells which cost more mana. Even then it might not be enough, but it's a good starting point.<br />
<br />
Aggro lock is bad for the game all around. It removes the challenge that should be there. If it's a guarentee, then why bother play?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I recall, stuns were mostly intended for spell interruption, not aggro dominance. The aggro used to be considered a by-product, but wasn't a key selling point like it is now. I don't think I should have to rely on the RNG to proc something that gets a mob's attention. There is no skill in that.</div></div><hr />

So you are telling us, the Warriors that it is in our BEST INTEREST to not have stuns nerfed? That is so considerate of you, I am glad to know that Paladins have our best interests at heart...<br />
<br />
:D <br />
<br />
for some reason I dont think that one will fly here..<br />
<br />
Yes some of our 'aggro' weapons would be reduced, IF they kept the weapons the same as they are now. But what is not to say in response to the aggro nerf, they dont change the weapons to have effects Acceptable at the level requirement? ie a weapon with REQUIRED level 62 would have a spell that can affect UP to Level 62 mobs? Oh, wait that would make sense...<br />
<br />
 Not to mention, a large number of issues that were fixed by stuns and the like getting huge aggro would be broken again.  <br />
<br />
As to this one.. hehe, no one said taking aggro from spells that ACTUALLY CAN stun a mob, just the ones that THERE IS NO CHANCE to ever possibly, even in the smallest way try to affect...<br />
This WOULD not remove aggro from the 'chain stun-lock mob' tactics..</div></div><hr />

simply remove the ability of a pally/sk to chain cast stuns ect during melee.<br />
Sure on inc they can cast, when a mob pings to a caster they can cast, but while being hit, god damn it make them rely on their taunt button just like wariors do...<br />
this simple change would balance this out...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably the worst balance idea I've seen.  Worse than letting warriors dual-wield knight one-handers.<br />
<br />
With this change, I would have no reason to memorize Feign Death or lifetaps.  When tanking, I become a warrior with lower skill caps instead of a hybrid.  Warrior aggro remains ridiculously bad, and you've completely gimped the shadowknight class on top of it.  Paladins would actually be the least affected, because their first stun, if successful, would allow them to cast additional spells without being interrupted.<br />
<br />
Warriors need to be fixed.  There are lots of good ideas out there for fixing them.  This is not one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's really rather simple actually.    <br />
<br />
I have a 50's necro, and have an &quot;undead lull&quot; type of spell.   Some undead mobs are too high level to be lulled.    When I attempt to cast on them, I get a message &quot;Your target would have been unaffected&quot;.    It simply put prevents me from wasting the mana by stopping the spell from being cast.   <br />
<br />
On the Sullon Zek server, it is impossible to cast beneficial spells on members of an &quot;opposing alignment team&quot;, you are prevented from doing so and get a message.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at is that it is indeed possible from preventing spells to be cast in the first place.    Spells which would not affect a target can be prevented from being cast, while procs of the same spells are easily unaffected, because they aren't &quot;cast&quot;.     You would have essentially eliminated stupidity like stuns, and fears which do not affect mobs from being chain cast to build up insane amounts of aggro, which is NOT their function, while retaining the aggro generation of weapons which proc similar effects by design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ability to Code based upon level/class/type etc is already in the game... USE IT.<br />
<br />
I however would go a step further, and Change the proc on certain weapons if it is a player cast spell. I really do feel that if a weapon is a REQUIRED LEVEL to use, the proc on that weapon SHOULD work on mobs AT least UP to that level. Ideally at least on mobs up to 5 levels higher would be my setting as a minimum.<br />
<br />
Oh, while we are at it....<br />
<br />
one minor, small pet peeve..<br />
<br />
I really really really would love if they just tagged all melee IMMUNE to the mass rod of mystical convergence spell, and please dont say we would use it as a weapon...</div></div><hr />
