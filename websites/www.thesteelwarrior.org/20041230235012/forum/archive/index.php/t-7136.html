<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im pondering if RF is really worth it (in the end, I will get it, it's always like that :p , but im talking about right now), I got Flurry, and from it's description and my perception, Flurry seems to be able to fire on any combat round, so even when I double attack or single, or tripple, I can Flurry.<br />
But RF says &quot;a chance to Flurry on a tripple attack&quot;. What does this mean? Is this another kind of Flurry that fires only on tripple attacks? or is the same Flurry and its basically restricting the old Flurry to fire only on tripple attacks? Why does it have a restriction when the original one doesnt?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

Raging Flurry (i'm guessing) improves the chance.<br />

This sounds high by the way.  Anyone grinding thru Flurry will tell you that after they trained Flurry 1, they almost got another full AA before they saw one :)<br />

I was in HoH when i dinged flurry1. I seem to remember seeing one flurry per mob (i was useing a 2 hander)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At first, I wanted to agree with Omnus, but after doing the parsing, I see how much impressions and the numbers can disagree.<br />
<br />
All numbers are taken from level 65 warrior, 280dex,  100% haste, dual wield all the time (greatblade of storms mainhanded).<br />
Also, these numbers are based on actual raid/xp situations, not fighting a banker mob for X time and getting numbers, so you will see a semi-wide variance in my numbers vs a more controlled environment.<br />
<br />
Flurry level 1 - SAMPLE 1<br />
15hours 12minutes 56seconds of actual fight time<br />
35,998 mainhand hits<br />
22,798 mainhand misses<br />
387 mainhand flurries<br />
0.67% mainhand chance to flurry<br />
<br />
Flurry level 2 - SAMPLE 1<br />
14hours 52minutes 40seconds of actual fight time<br />
36,481 mainhand hits<br />
23,278 mainhand misses<br />
751 mainhand flurries<br />
1.29% mainhand chance to flurry<br />
<br />
Flurry Level 2 - SAMPLE 2<br />
12hours 9minutes 9seconds of actual fight time<br />
23,035 mainhand hits<br />
14,798 mainhand misses<br />
524 mainhand flurries<br />
1.42% mainhand chance to flurry<br />
<br />
Flurry Level 2 - SAMPLE 3<br />
8hours 7minutes 40seconds of actual fight time<br />
22,175 mainhand hits<br />
14,614 mainhand misses<br />
393 mainhand flurries<br />
1.09% mainhand chance to flurry<br />
<br />
Flurry level 2 - SAMPLE 4<br />
4hours 43minutes 20seconds of actual fight time<br />
10,443 mainhand hits<br />
6,478 mainhand misses<br />
206 mainhand flurries<br />
1.25% mainhand chance to flurry<br />
<br />
NOTE:  the % chance to flurry numbers are calculated as follows<br />
(# flurries * 100) / (hits + misses) - (# flurries * 2) = X%<br />
Technically a flurry adds 2 extra attacks so to be 100% correct you would need to multiple # flurries by 2 and subtract that from the hit + misses total (at least I think that is right).  Also, I don't know if you can flurry on a miss (I assume you can), if you can't then you'd need to remove the +misses item.<br />
<br />
Flurry 1 sample average (only 1 sample so no change):<br />
15hours 12minutes 56seconds of actual fight time<br />
35,998 hits<br />
22,798 misses<br />
387 flurries<br />
0.67% chance to flurry<br />
<br />
Flurry 2 sample average:<br />
(39hours 52minutes 49seconds / 4) = 9hours 58minutes 12seconds<br />
(92,134 hits / 4)                                = 23,033 hits<br />
(59,168 misses / 4)                           = 14,792 misses<br />
(1,874 flurries / 4)                             = 469 flurries<br />
average % to flurry                           = 1.27%<br />
<br />
So, based on the above averages we see that our lvl1 flurry is 0.67% and lvl2 flurry is 1.27%.   This is near a doubling of the % chance to flurry, but not quite (it should be noted that my #1 and #2 samples, which are the longest, are a bit higher than the average, which supports the theory lvl2 doubles the proc rate of lvl1 flurry).  I would imagine having more data on the lvl1 flurry side would've helped a great deal, but unfortunately I grabbed lvl2 flurry fairly quickly afterwards.<br />
<br />
Based on the above, I would expect lvl3 flurry to be in the 2.5% range.  Now that I finished all my defensive AAs, I'll grab lvl3 flurry and add data from there.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this is helpful.  If anything seems wrong/incorrect, let me know and I'll edit the post and adjust accordingly.<br />

&lt;&lt;post edited per sulvar's post to make clear all numbers are via mainhand&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that your parsing is somewhat confused because you can't flurry with the offhand and by the fact that you can only flurry once per attack round.  Here is a parse I had with flurry 6, in PoE the other day.<br />
<br />
Number of hits: 2233<br />
Number of misses: 1805<br />
Totaly number of swings: 4308<br />
Number of times &quot;You unleash a flurry of attacks appears&quot; : 65<br />
<br />
But you can only flurry once per attack round, so I want to figure out how many attack rounds I actually had.  From EQ companion I can see that I get:<br />
<br />
1 swing per round: 37% of the time<br />
2 swings per round: 48% of the time<br />
3 swings per round: 11% of the time<br />
4 swings per round: 3% of the time<br />
5+ swings per round: 1% of the time<br />
<br />
Doing some math on this, I find that I average 1.83 swings per attack round.<br />
<br />
So if I take total swings (4308) / swings per round (1.83) I get 2354 attack rounds.<br />
<br />
Then  flurries (65) / attack rounds (2354) = 2.76% chance to flurry each round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, as Sulvar said, you have to eliminate offhand attacks, and you have to look at chance of flurry per round, not chance of flurry per swing.<br />
<br />
Also, I was under the impression that flurry gave &quot;up to 2 extra attacks&quot;, which could mean 1 or 2 extra swings, although I admit that the AA description says that it is always 2 extra swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still, 2.76% is nowhere near the 20% stated in the description in the library, and you've got Flurry 6 for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that your parsing is somewhat confused because you can't flurry with the offhand and by the fact that you can only flurry once per attack round.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sulvar,<br />
I only parsed mainhand not offhand attacks.  My note of:<br />
&quot;dual wield all the time (greatblade of storms mainhanded).&quot;<br />
Should've made that clear, but I really didn't specify like I should've.  I off-hand a piercer, so it makes parsing very easy that way.  This means my #hits/miss numbers do not change.<br />
<br />
Good point on only being able to flurry once per attack round.  I missed that and didn't even think of it.  I will rework my numbers and repost results.<br />
<br />
Your sample is very very small, can you post on more hits?  you'll notice my smallest post is 5x as big a sample and I find it to be a bit on the small side, a 20k hit sample should be more than sufficient.  It would be great to have data on lvl6 flurry!!<br />
<br />
Also, seeing as your % is in the barely over 2.5% this means my numbers will be going down a bit, so as Haas said it is nowhere near the 5/10/20% folks were lead to believe.  Technically the description says increases it by X% not that it will be X% of swings.  It is kinda like the +dodge% which simply adds a % to your dodge rate which is a % of all defensive results (ie very small).<br />
<br />
to get # attacks per round:<br />
1 swing per round: 37% of the time    = 1 * 0.37 = 0.37<br />
2 swings per round: 48% of the time   = 2 * 0.48 = 0.96<br />
3 swings per round: 11% of the time   = 3 * 0.11 = 0.33<br />
4 swings per round: 3% of the time     = 4 * 0.03 = 0.12<br />
5+ swings per round: 1% of the time   = 5 * 0.01 = 0.05<br />
add them all to get 1.83 attacks per round<br />
NOTE:  I do not know that this is even correct.  Technically, you would have to remove the extra (65 * 2) 130 attacks given by your flurry skill.  Obviously the 1 and 2 swing per round entries are correct, but the 3-5 is where the flurries would need to be removed from.  Offhand, I think this would be very hard to do, without getting a parser that specifically digs in and tracks the flurries and when they occur.  For now, I worked the following solution below:<br />
<br />
to calculate # of rounds: (you never removed the extra attacks from flurry in your original figure, as you cannot flurry off a flurry, I believe)<br />
(4308 swings - (65flurries * 2)) / 1.83 swings a round = 2283 rounds<br />
<br />
to figure out flurry %:<br />
(65 flurries * 100) / 2283 rounds = 2.85%<br />
<br />
Sassinak also brings up a good point, does flurry always add 2 extra attacks?  I must admit I just assumed it did, perhaps it doesn't.  I will take a look at my parses to confirm that it does or does not always give three attacks.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the 20% in the library is obviously wrong, no matter how you do the math on the parses we posted.  I am not sure where that text came from about 5/10/20%.<br />
<br />
to calculate # of rounds: (you never removed the extra attacks from flurry in your original figure, as you cannot flurry off a flurry, I believe<br />
<br />
I dont think that this matters.  The extra attacks from flurry are included in the total number of attacks and in the calculations of attacks per round so they cancel out.  If I try and remove the flurry attacks from both (which is somewhat hard to remove from the attacks per round) then the answer will still be the same.  I will end up with fewer attacks but also a slightly lower number of attacks per round.<br />
<br />
Also I'll agree that my parse wasn't perhaps as long as I would like, but it is long enough to show that flurry isnt 20% or even 10% of attack rounds.  I'll try and parse some other logs to see what results I get from those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is another parse, done in LDoN missions with 2h only, using the same math as my previous parse<br />
<br />
Number of hits: 3175<br />
Number of misses: 2712<br />
Totaly number of swings: 5887<br />
Number of times &quot;You unleash a flurry of attacks appears&quot; : 107<br />
<br />
But you can only flurry once per attack round, so I want to figure out how many attack rounds I actually had. From EQ companion I can see that I get:<br />
<br />
1 swing per round: 33% of the time<br />
2 swings per round: 50% of the time<br />
3 swings per round: 12% of the time<br />
4 swings per round: 4% of the time<br />
5+ swings per round: 1% of the time<br />
<br />
Doing some math on this, I find that I average 1.86 swings per attack round.<br />
<br />
So if I take total swings (5887) / swings per round (1.86) I get 3165 attack rounds.<br />
<br />
Then flurries (107) / attack rounds (3165) = 3.38% chance to flurry each round.<br />
<br />
This differs quite a bit from my previous parse of ~2.76% chance to flurry each round, suggesting that my sample size isn't large enough.  The problem is it is hard to get a large sample size using 2h, because it swings so slow.  This latest parse is 1 hour 47 mins with attack on in about a 3 hour play session.  I'll keep looking through my logs for longer xp sessions, but even if I cant find any the average of many shorter sessions should give us a good idea of the flurry rate.  Right now I would say that the flurry rate is ~3% per round with flurry 6.<br />
<br />
Oh one other thought I had is that you can't flurry on a riposte.  To be truely accurate we should probably deduct all of the ripostes from the total number of attacks.  Also ripostes tend to deflate the number of attacks per round, since they usually show as a 1 round attack.  If we remove riposites the flurry rate would adjust higher, but I am not sure how much.  Just for example in this most recent parse I had 427 ripostes (I dont have double riposte trained).  It would be easy to take those out of the total number of attacks, but I am unsure how to take them out of the attacks per round.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just taking out 427 attacks from the total attacks, and ignoring the lowered attacks per round due to rips I get a flurry rate of 3.65% from this parse.  This flurry rate would adjust higher still if I was able to accurately figure out how to take the rip attacks out of hte attacks per round calculation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is alot of aspects that we don;t know for sure, and the parses are based on alot of guessing.<br />
<br />
Maybe haste doesn't actually affect flurry, same as procs etc.<br />
<br />
There are alot of aspects we could be missing.<br />
<br />
When looking at how flurry is mentioned in aa abilities i wonder if flurry works like this.<br />
<br />
Flurry has a set rate to activate, unaffected by haste, but afected by weapon delay.<br />
<br />
A flurry equals an extra attack round, and then a double attack check is made for the 4th attack. Which could explain why triple attack is mentioned in the raging flurry. Raging flurry could be increased chance to flurry again after one flurry is made. <br />
<br />
All guesses but there is alot about flurry we don't know.<br />
<br />
Plus 3% seems low for flurry3. That means you only get a flurry once every 33.3 rounds of attack</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
No, parses are data.  Your last post was guessing.  Flurry rate of 2-3% seems plenty acceptable considering what I've seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess RF is just an extension of the original Flurry, by enhacing the % of chance of firing. The &quot;off a tripple attack&quot; on the description kinda confused me, but I guess its just the same as Flurry, but enhacing the chances :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However it goes off rarely. Of course there are the : &quot;Attack ON, Oh shit Triple Flurry, Loading Plz Wait&quot; <br />
While on a raid boss, but its rare.<br />
<br />
Never parsed it or anything, but average 1 flurry per LDoN hard mob with max AA<br />
seems pretty much the avg i am used to. Thats with a normal DPS group.</div></div><hr />

The other day I was playing my level 52 SK and I was amazed at how few swings he gets with a two hander compared to my warrior with all those extra swing aa's maxed.  It made me want to cry almost watching 1 swing 1 swing 2 swings 1 swing 2 swings per round.</div></div><hr />

No, it's high.  The parses above are showing ~3% for flurry6.  That's because flurry sucks.  It always has.  For the high point cost, the return is very small.  It's something to maybe get after you get LOTS of other AAs first.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It goes without saying that Flurry is only really a good investment if you're done with defensive aa's...and only really a good investment if you intend on maxing it and the other associated aa's with it.  I have Flurry6 and am finishing up PB, and I can't complain.</div></div><hr />

I got it :) What I meant on the post was that I already had all the defensive ones, TM, PB2 and Ferocity too, and some other laying around there like Planar Power 1 and Ingenuity 1.</div></div><hr />

Definitely all the defensive AA should be done.  I hope it goes without saying that you do some of the better offensive AAs first too.  Get TM, Ferocity, plus ambidexterity and sinister strikes if you like to dual wield and PB if you like to use 2 handers.  Maybe get both.  It's still a better return than Flurry.  If you're not an ogre, throw in stalwart endurance.  Get the weapon affinity AAs too.  Add the first 2 o 3 levels of sturdiness.  Then maybe it's time to blow points on CF/Flurry.</div></div><hr />

I believe it's more of an individual value judgement, as most things are, than a set in stone 'x is better than y'.  Personally, if you're not married to a good taunting 2h, and maybe slide back and forth, the investment into flurry will never become 'useless'.  Investing tons in Sinister Strike and Ambi if you eventually get a BoW will become relatively wasted points...  the two handed option isn't quite as unforgiving, with PB being a relatively small investment at 12 points.  Flurry works in both environments...so if you're on the fence, it may make more sense.  Also, if you're not in your guilds 'tanking warrior' crew, TM isn't as big a buy as if you're MT, as far as cost vs reward.<br />
<br />
Personally, I bought Flurry6 from 1 through 6 in a row...and noticed a steady increase in the amount of flurries for each level.  It's almost like a reward that RF is so much cheaper than Flurry 1-3...at least, that's the mindset I had.<br />
<br />
I still don't believe that flurry 'sucks', however...it was actually my first combat AA I bought after maxing my defensives...and I've never really looked back.<br />
<br />
Just my own opinion, your milage may vary.</div></div><hr />

Flurry description: This ability allows you to perform 2 additional attacks form primary hand<br />
<br />
Raging Flurry description: This ability further increases the chance of performing a flurry attack upon successfully scoring a triple attack.<br />
<br />
I'm going to make an assumption that RF is merely level 4 5 6 of Flurry, just like Combat Stablity and Innate Defense. Because RF requires Flurry, which is only a small indication, but the fact that it says further increases, which would have to mean it has a start point, which is based off of original flurry AAs.<br />
<br />
I don't have any information on this, just another assumption but perhaps any level warrior can score a triple attack, its merely a dice roll, however you have to be certain level before it will actually work.  And thats what flurry runs off of, which means you HAVE to score a triple attack, wether it actually works or not, for flurry to work.<br />
<br />
One way I can think of actually proving the 5 10 20% supposed numbers in the library, is like this<br />
<br />
First get a 65 warrior without any flurry AAs, and using a slow 2hander, parse the number of triple attacks and he makes.<br />
<br />
Then after the flurry AA, parse up how many times he flurried using same situation.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure if you were to compare the number of flurries vs the number of original triple attacks  the 5 10 20% would concurr or atleast come close.. just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that your parsing is somewhat confused because you can't flurry with the offhand and by the fact that you can only flurry once per attack round.  Here is a parse I had with flurry 6, in PoE the other day.<br />
<br />
Number of hits: 2233<br />
Number of misses: 1805<br />
Totaly number of swings: 4308<br />
Number of times &quot;You unleash a flurry of attacks appears&quot; : 65<br />
<br />
But you can only flurry once per attack round, so I want to figure out how many attack rounds I actually had.  From EQ companion I can see that I get:<br />
<br />
1 swing per round: 37% of the time<br />
2 swings per round: 48% of the time<br />
3 swings per round: 11% of the time<br />
4 swings per round: 3% of the time<br />
5+ swings per round: 1% of the time<br />
<br />
Doing some math on this, I find that I average 1.83 swings per attack round.<br />
<br />
So if I take total swings (4308) / swings per round (1.83) I get 2354 attack rounds.<br />
<br />
Then  flurries (65) / attack rounds (2354) = 2.76% chance to flurry each round.<br />
<br />
I used this Sulvar's parsing, and using a calculator, I did this<br />
<br />
I took 2354 x .11, since thats how many triple attacks he got. 259 approx.  Took that and divided 65 into that and came out with  65/259 = 25.1% chance to flurry, add about 3% to that since at the bare minimum he got 2.7% flurry, comes out to roughly 28%.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the math is all wrong but anyway, it might be a closer way to see how flurry actually works.  Would be alot better if you could get a warrior with a slow 2hander without any Ferocity or Flurry, and work from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as berserker goes, the AA has to be broken if you can buy an AA that does not work till a later level.  Flurry has to be tied to triple attack, as stated in raging flurry's description at the bare minimum.  I never said flurry has nothing to do w/ triple attacks.<br />
<br />
It raises questions because the original flurry is described as 2 extra rounds.  Its plain that flurry MEANS 4 swings, because the only time I ever get the message is when I quad swing.  If it worked on a single swing round, I would get a flurry message right after a triple swing. Double attack would raise to 4, which concurs. Triple attack perhaps caps to 4 swings.<br />
<br />
But the question comes up due to the nature of the second flurry AA, Raging Flurry, which is described as further improvement upon triple attack..<br />
<br />
One theory I can think of is that original Flurry works runs off of double and triple, while second only increase chance on a triple.<br />
<br />
Another is perhaps that original flurry runs off of doubles only, while raging flurry runs off of triples.  Which seems logical since you double far more than triple, and second tiers of AAs tend to be lesser or equal.  <br />
<br />
In both  theory it would conurr with that trend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best way would be for a high level warrior to have reliable parses through out the flurry progress</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I believe I already showed substantial proof that atleast doubles and triples ARE required for flurry.  <br />
<br />
How many times have you seen a triple attack followed by flurry message? I never have, its ALWAYS been quad swing, which means according to the Flurry AA message, it has a max of TWO swings.<br />
<br />
Being that I use two hand, unless I somehow miss the triple attack with flurry message, its fairly obvious as to how many swings I get per rounds.  With DW same type weapons it'd be hard to distinguish.  There is no way 1 + 2 can give me 4.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Romul, I went to my own log to see if you were right about &quot;flurry always means 4 attacks&quot;.  Sure enough, the majority of my flurry messages were preceded by 4 attacks.  However, this makes sense since double attack is the most common type of attack in my log; triple attack happens rarely.  The incidence of a triple + flurry would be extremely rare.  Occasionally I see things like the following:<br />
<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] A flame lordling tries to hit YOU, but YOU parry!<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] Sassinak hit a flame lordling for 75 points of non-melee damage.<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] A flame lordling has been struck by lightning.<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] You try to crush a flame lordling, but miss!<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] You try to crush a flame lordling, but miss!<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] You try to crush a flame lordling, but miss!<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] You crush a flame lordling for 153 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] You crush a flame lordling for 264 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Apr 25 19:52:42 2004] You unleash a flurry of attacks.<br />
<br />
In the above case, it's a 2 hander with 31 delay.  Either PB fired or triple attack fired, because I ended up with 5 attacks on a flurry.<br />
<br />
[Sun Apr 25 20:31:59 2004] You crush a defender of fire for 35 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Apr 25 20:31:59 2004] You crush a defender of fire for 75 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Apr 25 20:31:59 2004] You try to crush a defender of fire, but miss!<br />
[Sun Apr 25 20:31:59 2004] You try to crush a defender of fire, but miss!<br />
[Sun Apr 25 20:31:59 2004] You crush a defender of fire for 35 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Apr 25 20:31:59 2004] You unleash a flurry of attacks.<br />
<br />
In this second case, it's a 1-hander with delay 20, which means that combat rounds are still distinct in the log even at max haste.  Here I see 5 non-riposte crush attacks in a single round, which can be attributed to neither PB nor my offhand (which slashes).  They can only be the result of a triple plus a flurry.<br />
<br />
I found 5 such examples in 2.5 hours of log.<br />
<br />
I will absolutely agree that you cannot flurry on a single attack.  The only time I saw a flurry message on a single attack was when it was the killing blow that ended the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I was wrong in the aspect that its only quad swing, which I believe you since I am going off casual observation vice actual log history.  So it can be readily believed that a double attack equates to quad swing and and triple swing equating to 5 swing, whatever the word is.  That still doesn't concur in any fashion with the parse given earlier, which makes me wonder.<br />

I will disagree with any suggestions on how many hits must land. I've had instances where all 4 swings were misses, which seems quite common.  I guess unless we were to actually see the script it'd be near impossible to determine, because there are so many swing checks going off per round, its tough to determine how they interact, or override each other.  <br />
<br />
For instance you can't know if a 5 swing attack actually meant, a succesfully flurry on a double attack plus a successful PB on a double attack, or if that flurry would override PB, which means it had to be a triple attack + flurry, not case 1.  Guess its just a mystery that won't be found answers to</div></div><hr />

At any rate, it does seem that the &quot;10%/20%/50%&quot; numbers are nonsense.<br />
<br />
Well no Triple and PB wouldn't be independant, its one or the other (Innate or AA triple attack).  So max you would still get is 5. (Innate or AA Triple attack + 2 Extra Attack from Flurry).<br />
<br />
I could see a test being done, although its too late for me since I already have Flurry 2.<br />
<br />
1) Parse a warrior w/o any Flurry/PB AA, and note how many double and triples he gets.<br />
<br />
2) Then parse the warrior with Flurry 3, and compare them to how many Doubles and Triples you get in number 1.  Like Innate weapon proc override potential augment proc, making augment's actual PPM lower, Depending how much double and triple is affected, you could make a conclusion as to wether Only doubles, triples, or both are used.<br />
<br />
3) Then parse the warrior with PB3, and note how many Triples are increased by.<br />
<br />
4) Parse the same warrior now, and compare pre-PB and and Post-PB.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Then parse the warrior with Raging Flurry 3, and then compare the doubles and triple in 4.  Again it would explain if only a triple attack is affected.<br />
<br />
<br />
If theres a flaw in this test method, or can think of a better way put it down, maybe some curious warrior will test it out.</div></div><hr />

xxxx is a 59 war with insane aa for his lvl around 157, so i don't know if this was a dubble riposte or a flurry. will give his name if i can get his permission. yea i even melee as a wizzy force of habit. ohh and 6k hp vs. min hit of like 29 is gotta be serious overkill.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems to me you need double or triple to fire off a flurry, but raging flurry requires a triple, so that makes you wonder about flurry itself.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
1 swing per round: 37% of the time<br />
2 swings per round: 48% of the time<br />
3 swings per round: 11% of the time<br />
4 swings per round: 3% of the time<br />
5+ swings per round: 1% of the time<br />
<br />
Doing some math on this, I find that I average 1.83 swings per attack round.<br />
<br />
So if I take total swings (4308) / swings per round (1.83) I get 2354 attack rounds.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Number of hits: 3175<br />
Number of misses: 2712<br />
Totaly number of swings: 5887<br />
Number of times &quot;You unleash a flurry of attacks appears&quot; : 107<br />
<br />
1 swing per round: 33% of the time<br />
2 swings per round: 50% of the time<br />
3 swings per round: 12% of the time<br />
4 swings per round: 4% of the time<br />
5+ swings per round: 1% of the time<br />
 <br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Going off that, and the fact that its somewhat agreed a single cannot flurry.<br />
<br />
One thing for certain is that flurry means atleast 4 swings, wether the original flurry always adds 2, or 1 - 2, can be proven by asking wether you've seen a triple flurry.  Because a double attack + single flurry add = 3, which is agreed to not be correct.  So then you can agree that 2 adds are always added, and the reason that you can get a 4x or 5x swing, can only be explained if a double attack is in place. <br />
<br />
If only triple attack could fire off a Flurry, that would mean that, going off previous observation of always adding two attacks, flurry would always mean 5 swings, which in fact is not true.  So only way that can explain is a double attack with 2 swings added, and a 5x swing is obviously a triple attack with flurry.<br />
<br />
So if you can agree to that..<br />
<br />
About 2/3 of the swings was/is a flurry checked swing.  A double attack or triple attack can flurry, 4x and 5x means attack did flurry, which would mean it would have been a double/triple normally.<br />
Total swings 5887<br />
Number of those swings being subjected to flurry check: 67%<br />
Number of successful flurries: 107.<br />
<br />
5887 x .67 = 3944 swings were subjectable to flurry.<br />
<br />
Out of those 3944, you have to determine how many rounds each type of attack weighs out to be.<br />
<br />
50/67 = number of double attacks.  ~75%<br />
12/67 = ~18%<br />
4/67 =  ~6%<br />
1/67 = ~1%<br />
<br />
Based off those weights - 3944 x .75 = 2958 / 2 = 1479 rounds of doubles<br />
                                          3944 x .18 = 710 / 3 = 237 rounds of triples<br />
                                          3944 x .06 = 237 / 4 = 59<br />
                                          3944 x .01 =  39 / 5 = 8<br />
<br />
Total actual rounds comes out to: 1783 rounds based off flurry subjectable swings.<br />
<br />
So all in all, with Raging Flurry 3(aka flurry 6): My theory suggests a 107/1783 chance to flurry.<br />
<br />
6%<br />
<br />
Edit: Math was all wrong, so I re-did it. Think its correct this time around.</div></div><hr />

Wait a minute, is this something you have determined empirically?<br />
<br />
I had to look hard in my log to find something that looked like triple+PB (4 attacks with no flurry message). I finally found one in 2 megs of logfile :<br />

[Sun Apr 25 19:59:49 2004] You try to crush a jopal hunter, but miss!<br />

<br />
More often, I found PB+flurry happen together:<br />

[Sat Apr 03 18:03:06 2004] You crush a doomfire soldier for 81 points of damage.<br />
<br />
I interpret the last line as being PB firing, since it comes after the flurry message.<br />
<br />
I could not find an incidence of triple+flurry+PB all happening at once.  But this doesn't mean it can't happen.  More likely, it's just such a rare event that my sample size isn't large enough to see one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If flurry could be 1 attack then you would expect to see rounds containing 3 attacks followed by a flurry message.  I never found such an incident in my log.  Flurry appears to always be 2 attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SeeboSteele</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it is worth, I was a 59 warrior that trained flurry as a AA ability while 59.  I then went on to earn 10 additional AA's without seeing a single flurry message. After I dinged 60, I saw a flurry message within 5 minutes. So, it seems you MUST be 60 for the flurry ability to work.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well no Triple and PB wouldn't be independant, its one or the other (Innate or AA triple attack).  So max you would still get is 5. (Innate or AA Triple attack + 2 Extra Attack from Flurry).<br />
<br />
PB is an extra attack, is not a tripple attack, it can be a tripple if you doubled and PB fired, but it can be a double if you singled and PB fired, or it can be a quad if you trippled. The explanation of PB says an extra attack, it doesnt restrict it to a tripple, thats why I would guess PB is independant and you could get a Tripple+Flurry+PB = 6 swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the percent increase is meaningless, the parses indicated the increased dmg are really small on all offensive aas, flurry being so aa expensive makes it the worst one.<br />
<br />
we all did it because we had nothing else to buy and went on to /sigh resistance aa hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flurry might actually be more worthwhile for the point cost if they made it effect the offhand. I wouldn't mind paying 15ish aa next expansion for an Ambidexterity 2, if besides upping DW rate again it let my offhand use my dex bonus and get access to flurry :P<br />
<br />
Sidetracking, forgive me ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So then it probably is a mistake that you can train Flurry at 59 and it really does follow a triple attack. And IF that is the case, you only flurry after a triple, then it would follow flurry could be one or 2 extra rounds if you are getting flurry messages on a 4 swing round.<br />
<br />
<br />
   So if PB is an added chance to Triple, then it should also increase the chances to flurry. And that could probably be determined through even more parses, using warriors with Max flurry but no PB and those with but that all seems like way too much math for this dumb Ogre.<br />
<br />
   Of course it would be even easier if a Dev could actually check and just confirm if flurry is dependent on triple attack.</div></div><hr />
