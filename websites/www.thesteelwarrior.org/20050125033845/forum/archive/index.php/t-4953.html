<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimbex</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a lvl 50 HFL WAR. I have fierce heraldic armor throughout, except for back, which is Greater Cloak of Pernicity, and waist, which is empty. I just sold a Soulscream Belt - offer was too good to pass up - so I dont have a haste item. My problem is choosing new items. I see this Belt of the Great Turtle which looks nice, but is selling for 25k on my server. Atk add of 10 and hp regen of 2 seems awefully low for a warrior that has 4500 hps buffed. Heavy Rubicite Belt is a great white rhino and never seen, and when it is, it sells for a half a mint. Cof would be nice but also is very rare and very expensive. Thinking of just buying Soulscream belt again and calling it done. Any suggestions? Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
For no haste there's Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide or Fierce Heradlic, I never liked the Turtle belt for same reasons you list.<br />
<br />
If you need haste Soulscream, Broken Drivebelt or Belt of Raging Nature dpending on how much you can spend.</div></div><hr />
