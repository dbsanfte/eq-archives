<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lv 54 Ogre, decently equipped, looking for somewhere to hunt with a 62 druid watching my back.  I've been playing in Skyfire (nothing like dropping the Chrom. for Essence of Sunlight) but I'm open to other suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Exp in Skyfire is not very good by around 54.<br />
<br />
PoJ is better.<br />
<br />
Platform in Scarlet Desert is better.<br />
<br />
Giants in BW are better.  <br />
<br />
Heck, even the seafury cyclops in OOT are better, and some of them are light blue at 54.<br />
<br />
To my mind, 54-56 is kind of a dead spot in the exp curve for people who duo.  You're a little too low for most of PoP, you're a little too high to get really good exp in most of the pre-PoP zones, unless you're doing a serious dungeon.  Things just sort of slow down at 54.<br />
<br />
If you find a magic bullet, post it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Old Sebilis =)  If you can find a slower, even better.<br />
<br />
The Hole entrance<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye<br />
<br />
Ahkeva Entrance<br />
<br />
Chardok, slower is helpful<br />
<br />
Theres just some ideas, good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghaok Ogrady</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The hole is actually great exp  for you provided your not grouping with the druid. Head down to the half-pipe and pull away....<br />
Make sure you have a tod for slow and if a pull goes to bad, just group with druid and evac.<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whew, I just leveled from 53 to 57 in 4 days.  4 levels in 4 days.  I stayed in Poi (at the entrance no less!) until 55.  At 55 I hit PoD and took LCY camp until 56, then the RCY camp for 57.<br />
<br />
As for the hole, forget the entrance.  The entrance is full of mostly warriors, not crusaders.  The crusaders are what you want at 54.  I do the hole all the time and would only do the entrance up to 54.  At 54, if you're doing the hole, you best move in imo.<br />
<br />
The half-pip is fine for you and the druid (altho the druid wouldn't get much xp unless the druid is doin altexp).<br />
<br />
if you get a slower, and especially if the slower is a mezzer, you could move in a lil.  Unless you got a full group, though, I wouldn't suggest going as far as the ratmen.</div></div><hr />
