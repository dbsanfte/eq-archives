those are first thing first things I can thing about when you say &quot;raid leading&quot; :D.</div></div><hr />

Raid leading is definately tough, but very rewarding.<br />
<br />
It does get easier with time.  What particular things did you have the most trouble with? The tell barrage? Keeping people focused and moving?<br />

It's definately a very stressful job.  Guild officers work harder sometimes, sometimes it's not as bad as leading a raid.  I feel bad for my guild officers, having to repeatedly deal with a guild leader of another guild who is literally psychotic.  When they have to deal with people like him, I'd rank being an officer as much harder than leading a raid.  Though, leading a raid that turns out to be very successful feels nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always avoided leading raids as far as setting them up and making groups and stuff. Bad enough in a guild but we always had a 5 guild alliance we did most of our raids with so that stuff gets even more complicated. But once everyone was there and grouped I usually end up being MA and telling everyone what to do. When to move, special rules depending on zones, strategizing with rest of pull team and all that stuff. And of course I was usually grouped with the raid leaders so would get to hear about all the folks complaining about this and that.<br />
<br />
Gave me a whole lot of respect for the folks that would lead raids, too bad most of the good ones had all they could take and quit doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- You have 4 groupes of 6 people each.... and another guy just tell you he's on the way :p.<br />
I have no problem with degrouping a druid and setting up a 2 man group.. if he complains &quot;why are you late then?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
- creating group (more easier now xp is shared).<br />
I only hate it when we are exaclty 3 healers short :)<br />
<br />

Never had these problems, our raid discipline is surprisingly high for a starter guild<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- level 65 who dont know mecanics of aggro<br />
We dont have 65s yet ;)<br />
<br />
- people level 65 dead on the way to raid zone, when it's been 2 month you raid the same zone and everything is green... <br />
our raids always start at a PoK book, a gate in or at a green zone for that reason. I dont let anyone move alone through anywhere, we have alot of real newbies in the guild that tend to die..<br />
<br />
- awarding an item All/All with tons of stats everyone want.dkp baby.. Awarding is worse than /randon 1 100 imo.</div></div><hr />

The closest I've come to being a raid leader is bein MT, and then all I had to do was take charge and bark orders for positioning, aggro control and whatnot.  The only way I'd be a raid leader is if I lost a bet. :)   Most folks dont understand just how difficult it is to herd all the cats in the right direction.  I do know, and appreciate the folks that do it.  Personaly I'd rather just be pointed in the direction of whatever's in need of killin' and go at it.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that, I don't ever have any serious issues with my guild; they a good bunch ;) but it is still quite stressful, especially when you're MT as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Used to be a real pain in the butt when tanking new encounters and talking to the pullers at the same time. Then we got some insanely good monks and shadowknights so it was something I could stop worrying about.<br />
<br />
But I HATE when people get lost half a screen away! Worse yet when they feel they just have to get out in front of the tanks even though they wear colored paper for armor. What insane thoughts enter their heads that they need to place their aggro magnet asses in front of the huge charging monster are beyond me. <br />
<br />
Moron raider #1 thinks &quot;Hey, I'm going to get in front of the tanks because I'm not afraid the Anival the Blade!&quot; One minute later.....&quot;Why hasn't anyone rezzed me yet?&quot; Two minutes later...../em Trast filters out annoying tells for rezzes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">saturday and sunday we raided PoG.. but it was like 2 totally different games.<br />
Usually I am raid leader and main assist / main tank. the pulling and other stuff is usually done by other key members of our guild<br />
on saturday however, EVERY DAMN key member we have decided to abandon me and leave me ALONE in PoG. So additionally I was now the ST (yes, I was 2boxing a war and a SK, each supposed to tank one of the POGs on break in, and I also was the puller, with the 2boxed SK. However, there was no need to pull as we wiped big time on break in :)<br />
So I had to set up a CR with exactly ONE non-kos cleric and 1 druid that was able to harmony the whorl at zone in (which suddenly gained the ability to see invis and therefor alerting the PoGs which make break-ins a horror really) <br />
After pretty much two hours I was finally able to do what I was waiting for, tanking 2 mobs that are hard to control agro with 2 different characters at the same time. hooray. After these 2 hours when we finally got all the like 35 corpses  from 20 people rezzed up and are somehow gtg our 2nd puller decides to log in and &quot;hi, how's PoG going? Shall I come?&quot;. Yeah, sure come over so I can drown you in the lake outside.<br />
on Sunday it was sooo smooth, we tried a new break in.<br />
2 tanks, 2 clerics, a slower and a snarer zone in invis after a druid / ranger harmonied the Whore of natural energy at zone in. move to wall, drop invis, kill PoGs. Call in the raid.<br />
Still there are 2 major things that bug me with PoGs. They make CRs in the plane a neverending nightmare. As soon as someone kos drops invis, these guys IMMEDIATELY agro. IF someone not KoS drags a corpse, IMMEDIATELY agro. I can deal with these buggers running for us when we zone in. but not when we zone in naked. The other thing would be the 28 minute respawn. Given that these drop not even a single copper, they are nothing but a burden that needs to be timed and killed repeatedly every half an hour.. oh well.<br />
<br />
I tell ya, CRing outside PoP under conditions like that is a true nightmare :)</div></div><hr />
