<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanctimas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright I have a question about delays of offhand weapons, and how they should be used because of them. Or, should I put the faster in the primary hand or the secondary hand...<br />
<br />
I am currently Using:<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
And<br />
Architect's Sceptre<br />
<br />
The Sceptre is 21 delay and the sword is 19. Should I put the sceptre in my primary, or keep it in the secondary like it is now<br />
<br />
I realize this question is prolly really old and asked like a million times but what should I do...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ratio offhand, faster primary given all else equal. It's always better to have the better aggro weapon primary, so I'd definitely go with the SotB primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and if you can, ditch the scepter and get a Copper Hammer of Striking.  I use that in primary with bloodsworn in secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sanctimas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wish I could get a Copper Hammer, but im really broke all the time... I could sell a bunch of my weapons but I value my things =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would recommend sotb in mainhand and the reinforced sandstone in your backpack for offhand.  This will be a great combo until u can get a chos.  I used the sandstone for awhile and was very happy with its aggro-production pre-50.  Stats are better on it than the 1hb you currently have equipped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In a couple of levels you might also be able to loot a Blade of Insanity in Grieg's End. I think it's roughly equal to the sandstone hilted thing (which, by the way, you also might be able to loot). The BoI procs itching madness. It's got a recommended level on it but I know it procs by level 53 (not sure before that). I think with a group you could loot either of them yourself.<br />
If you still can't afford a CHoS before you reach level 55, get a Greatstaff of Thunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sanctimas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can get a Blade of Insanity as my alt, a 62 druid<br />
<br />
I have been soloing in GE for a while and know the zne very well.<br />
<br />
If not soloable, I can duo it with a BST from my guild, they also, know the zone very well =)<br />
<br />
I have a GSoT in my bank, I forgot to put in alot of stuff from my bank and other bags in my Magelo.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You'll need to move your warrior into GE somehow if your druid is going to do the killing for the BoI, because BoI is no drop, I think.<br />
the sandstone thing is dropable, though, if I'm remembering correctly.<br />
The BoI is not as good as either droga, but it's usable. If you're cash strapped you can make it and another okay 1-hander work until the GSoT is equipable. And at that point, a cash-strapped warrior might well be better off making sure his haste is good and working on AC/hp armor than immediately buying the droga set. Once you have LDoN points for two hate augs, the droga (or better) one-handers look progressively better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why not use the Druid to make cash? There's tons of places the druid can go to farm gems, coin and forage crap. My wife racked in pp like there was no tomorrow with her druid. She considered herself &quot;broke&quot; if she had less than 50k banked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With the new aa that makes it where your offhand can't be riposted it seems like having faster weapons in your offhand has a defensive advantage to me.  <br />
<br />
Although with the two weapons mentioned it probably doesn't matter, but for some of the higher end weapons It might be worth thinking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye, the druid thing threw me a bit. But then I assumed the druid wasn't twinking the warrior.<br />
A bit odd, but hey my warrior doesn't twink my SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sanctimas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dont really use the druid to twink the war, I really only use what I can get as the druid, for the druid, and vice-versa but sometimes I do mix the profits</div></div><hr />
