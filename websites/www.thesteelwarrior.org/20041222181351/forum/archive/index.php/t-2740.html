Raid buffed I hit 8342 hp using my aggro weapons.  I have LR5,  ID4 and yet I die like a pansy to everything, even ntov named and other warriors in the guild who have less hp/aa live with ease.  What am I doing wrong?  Or do I just suck so much ass lol?  Any ideas would be helpful, thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of  us tanked in NToV with 5500-6k hps and no AA.  If you're dying to NToV stuff with 8300 hps and a bunch of AA you need to talk to your clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heck i could give NToV a good piece of my tanking skill but i got some good clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you die though?  With good positioning, no adds etc?  If so as stated above your clerics need some talking to.<br />
<br />
If not then it can be your raid, yourself or some other X factor.  <br />
You also state that other tanks in your guild with lesser stats have not died in the same conditions.  Is that on the same raid? Or are you referring to peers that tank with a different support crew?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zandorf</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh its same raids, and as for postioning and adds and tactical thats not the problem.  We know how to do tactical fights and I know how to manuver mobs really well.  Sorry, but I get kind of mad and frustrated when I die over and over to stuff when warriors on same raid with 1k less hp and no aa live to tell about it lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are you dieing?  Are healers fizzling?  Out of range for a heal?  Eating AE's that stun/interrupt the heals?  Are you dieing at the start of a fight?  Dieing by adds before they get mez'd/offtanked?  Is the heal rotation slower on you since you have more HP's than the others?<br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind, if you are the MT, no other tanks are going to die as much as you.  You will be the one fighting an unslowed mob and you will ALWAYS be fighting the most mobs.  Some heal rotations are adjusted mid fight if they aren't working correctly.  Backup healers don't necessarily spam heal sometimes until the MT goes down and they think, hmmm, maybe I should heal instead of nuke/dot if I want to live.<br />
<br />
Figuring out why you are dieing is key to solving your problem.  But, keep in mind, the MT is always first to die for tanks and have the most chances for a RNG to screw them through heal fizzles, healer LD's, lag, etc. since you are tanking the most.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably haven't... but have you sacrificed too much ac for HP's ?<br />
<br />
I.e with 8300hp you should have like at least a 1400-1500 ac ??<br />
<br />
<br />
Otherwise... if you MT... you die.. the better your healers get.. the less you die :)</div></div><hr />

Grats on your BoC...<br />
<br />
I'll have times where I have similiar instances, Its just called bad luck.  Damage spikes seem to hit me all too often.  But thats why we have a SA and a TA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye the question Is ac... had a tank in my guild that got every hp aa and geared for hp only.<br />
<br />
1100 ac unbuffed. at 1300 ac I took a lot less damage than him.. not as many spikes hits.<br />
<br />
so even though he had 50-60 more hp than me I could tank longer.<br />
<br />
and if its not ac... did sombody switch your taunt and sit button on ya =p<br />
Just kidding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is something to keep in mind ... <br />
<br />
All pre-SoL mobs where all killed with level 60 warriors sporting around 6khp with 0aa.<br />
<br />
All SoL mobs where killed with level 60 warriors with under 8khp and not nearly as many defensive AAs as are possible now.<br />
<br />
If you are dying a lot with 8khp+ and 1400ac with a bunch of AA at level 65, then your healers are blowing it. We routinely do the tower named at night with a group of friends, and we have no problem keeping a single tank up against them. We use anything from a 7khp SK to a 7500hp pally to a 8500hp warrior. We usually use 3 clerics with a druid and a shaman gap healing. There is no reason you shouldn't survive mobs with similar damage output.</div></div><hr />
