<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
  I'm asking for something a bit different, I want an AA check based on my current stats.  I'm torn between what path to take next, mainly between: LR/ID/PE/WA(2).  I raid buff to just under 8K hp (w/ tribute) and about 1560 ac (w/ tribute), unbuffed (w/o tribute) just under 5k hp, just under 1400 ac...as you can see in my Magelo profile.  It seems like my ac is progressing slowly, but is more than adequate for a pre-elemental tank...yet it seems my HP is low.  Although, I know I really love the benefits I've seen from CS3/CA3/PE and the agro improvement from WA1.  Based on this and the below information, what AA should I concentrate on next?<br />
<br />
Group Play:<br />
  I generally am the main tank.  About once a week, my group visits GoD Sewers, rest of group related stuff, my present setup is almost overkill.  Seriously thinking about trying Hard LDoN's once a week too.<br />
<br />
Guild Raid Play:<br />
  My guild is a small family guild, so nothing much more exciting than PoStorm Named Giants (for BoT keys), Shade, Dozekar, etc.<br />
<br />
Open Raid Play:<br />
  This is tricky, I've been anywhere from MA (Grummus, we won), SA HoH Villager Trial (not really much involved here since MA lived), SA on AD (we wiped, I had no AET then) to beyond the fourth tank in line (Bert, although I did tank Bert after the other tanks died, then I died shortly after furious wore out, lol, but we still won).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sturdy 1: 4 aa 100hp it's a good deal<br />
planar durability<br />
planar power 305 sta is still hp 305 dex is 2ppm<br />
<br />
should finish off your hp for a bit till you want to spend 8+points on sturdy.<br />
<br />
wa 2 is worth it<br />
<br />
id/lr come out = depending what mob you fight if you tank stuff that has a combat proc alot most go lr first to avoid procs. otherwise either works.<br />
<br />
either way it's your aa do what is fun for you. if you plan on playing any serious amount of play time the aa will come even if you didn't realy pick something useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gear wise... Get better arms. Also keep eye for better resists (should work for ~100 in each)<br />
<br />
Mokor is pretty much right on with AA's. I would recommend LR before doin ID. Avoidance is generally better than mitigation, but both are necessary.<br />
<br />
Planar Power ranks can be added as you need them... no point in gettin PP5 now and only getting buffed upto rank 3 (for example).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for advice on resists, I usually have easy access to resist buffs, but I know that also causes problems on raid having to decide which buffs to keep and which to click off to make room.  I'll have to start rolling on resist augs.<br />
<br />
As to my original dilemma, I should just ask:<br />
Is my HP really low compared to my AC?  Or is it just me?<br />
<br />
Basically, I was trying to see what my biggest weakness (excluding resists) is, to see where I should put AA into next (following the AA advice thread).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends on where you're headed. If you're trying to go further in GoD progression like Vxed and Tipt, I'd preach LR to you all day. Doing hards once a week you'll find the LR/CS aa's both make a noticable improvement maxed. Personally I find these more useful than hp's since they make spot heals more efficient as well. Get WA2 if you have aggro problems, but otherwise it can wait until you have your defensive skills maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your guild can hit the BoT giants and their ilk, I'd suggest you go pimp of Xanomech.  I am a huge proponet of killing him a lot early.  Once you get  him down, you can farm him until the cows come home.  41% haste and a taunting blow weapon would be helpful.<br />
<br />
As far as AAs, I'd go for the LR/ID and WA first.  WA has been some of the best AA I've spent.  Ferocity is highly useful as well.  for 9 total AAs, ferocity is one of the best bang for the buck offensive AAs.  More swings = more procs = more agro.  Couple that with WA and whoo boy!  A really good set up.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you =)</div></div><hr />

OK, I've been convinced between this thread and a few others I read that I really should go get an Anger II (since I can get it tonight) to replace the cheap DD proc on my main hand and get WA2.<br />
<br />
I think I will most likely just start working on LR next since it can make me miss a 1k+ hit versus adding 75 - 100 hp for the same aa.  Plus, I got a few HP from unauging an old sta aug from an old earring and a few more stats on my PoP charm / LDoN augment...so I'm now 5k hp even and I can forsee that with some equipment upgrades, my HP will go up and it seems it would be best if my HP is almost high enough to be MA on open raids I attend that it would best if I get LR5/ID5 first...and of course, it can only help with Sewers and hard LDoN's as my healer pointed out, she'd rather have me mitigate damage or avoid it that will be 3x or more than the HP I'd gain from AA atm.<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone for your feedback, it was very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ykesha augs are generally preferred over Anger 2 btw. But if it'll be a while before you can get it, by all means grab Anger 2.<br />
<br />
Ykesha has a slight edge on hate generation (stun based), plus the DD portion justify consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">More swings = more procs = more agro.  <br />
<br />
wrong<br />
procs are per minute<br />
<br />
Ferocity still is a nice dps increaser though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taggen_of_Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah, will add to swing agro at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ferocity still is a nice dps increaser though<br />
<br />
Wrong.  Ferocity is crap for DPS increase.  Get it after all possible defensive AA's, because it's not worth the 9 points if you have anything else to be spending points on to make you a better tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I got WA2, Anger 2 and LR1...and finally gave a hard LDoN (BB) a try, we won with about 15 min to spare.  I visited the purple club only once and the only deaths were the druid once and the cleric once (both on pacify resists where I had no warning and no aggro).  Group was 65 war, 65 bard, 65 Mage, 65 Ranger, 65 Druid, 65 Cleric (all pre-elemental, but I had the lowest AA in the group).  I also used various combinations of Furious, AET and defensive several times (i.e., any pull that had adds).<br />
<br />
Anger 2 does seem a big boost over the cheap DD proc and I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner.  I only have 1 Guk win (no losses), so it'll most likely be two Anger 2's for now (until I get some more Guk wins for Ykesha and a better weapon for Anger 3).  I can't afford a BoC atm, but I am hoping for PoI Dragon farmage or Tactics flag (so I can attend some open raids in there for drops) soon.<br />
<br />
I also have to admit at this point, I must've been getting confused at wanting more HP because it's always used in game as the measuring stick to pick an MA or to see if someone is capable of tanking something.  I honestly have to say, I think the avoidance/mitigation did more for me last night than another 1 - 2k hp would have done (since that could be 2 hits).  Avoiding some hits and getting average hits of around 300 - 500 versus almost 1k on unslowed mobs = priceless!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me see through the BS of HP = ALL.  Excluding dot damage, it's only true after the Defensive AA (I think).</div></div><hr />
