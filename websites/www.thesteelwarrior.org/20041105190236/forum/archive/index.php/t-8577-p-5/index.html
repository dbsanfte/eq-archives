<br />
Heck, even the more common, standard solo monk at the time (Fungi/T-Staff running around Velks) wasn't relying on AVOIDANCE so much as they were relying on the irresistable STUN from the T-Staff proc as well as high monk DPS as well as the low damage output of the spiders as well as the low hit points of the spiders as well as the monk's ability to get a single mob from a small group of them.<br />
<br />
I've got some experience soloing with both my warrior and my monk in Velk's lab. The DPS difference at the time, as well as the hit points versus the regen is what made it possible.<br />
<br />
By long fights, I mean fights that are long enough for DPS takein to be near constant, i.e greater than 4 rounds.  So yes, pre-60 monks can still solo in these same zones... better than they could before the mitigation nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why aren't monks asking for an endurance using version of Fading Memories or the like?We did.  We were told unequically that &quot;Any form of instant memwipe would be overpowering in the hands of any class with FD&quot;.<br />
<br />
Most of us think that that is utter and complete bullshit.<br />
<br />
But it would be easier to convince them to return our mitigation than it would be to convince them to give us a usable memwipe for pulling.Not sure here on Imitate Death's reuse timer.36 mins.<br />
<br />
<br />
As Lao explained, Mitigation would marginally help our pulling.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
It would also help us in so many areas as well as pulling.<br />
<br />
It's still not going to allow us to displace Warriors as Group tanks, nor will it allow us to displace Knights.<br />
<br />
Hell, even Warriors couldn't displace Knights due to aggro lock.  How could a Monk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And no, Glatius, we were nerf'd because boosting Warriors immediately prior to the release of PoP would have &quot;trivialized&quot; itNo you weren't nerfed for that reason. You were nerfed because you were the strongest defensive class, even more so then paladin/sk. The devs came up with a solution that didn't give a unwarranted boost to anyone and didn't prevent you from doing your role.One more time, tard.<br />
<br />
We were nerf'd because we took damage in the same manner over time as a Warrior because we could mitigate just as well.  And we took less damage over time because our Dodge is better and Block is twice as effective as Parry.<br />
<br />
We'll never again mitigate as well as a Warrior.  We'll never again reach the same AC levels and we'll never have a DI-1 bonus.<br />
<br />
Therefore the manner in which we take damage will always be spikier.<br />
<br />
Even if we somehow managed to take the same damage over time as a warrior, it will always be spikier.  That fact alone means we'll always be inferior tanks.<br />
<br />
Because you have to heal for the spikes.<br />
<br />
If your tank can be dead by a spike at 50%, you have to heal before 50%.<br />
<br />
If your tank can't be dead by a spike until he gets below 33%, then you have to heal before 33%.<br />
<br />
Using those completely arbitrary numbers, along with a made up 9k Monk and a made up 12k Warrior, that means that the Warrior can take 8k before needing a heal whereas the Monk should get one after taking 4.5k.<br />
<br />
Even if they take the same damage over time.<br />
<br />
It's just more efficient to heal a Warrior because he has fewer and smaller spikes and an assload more HP.<br />
<br />
We weren't nerf'd due to our damage over time alone.<br />
<br />
We were nerf'd due to our damage over time combined with the fact that we took that damage just as smoothly as you all did.<br />
<br />
We will never take it that smoothly again.<br />
<br />
No more Hardcaps.<br />
Can't attain the same AC.<br />
No DI bonus.<br />
Can't attain the same HP.<br />
<br />
Even if we mitigated like Knights.</div></div><hr />

That's not true, btw. Warriors have always been the strongest defensive class, when their disc was running. Even pre-nerf Luclin, a defensive disc'd warrior was the strongest defensive class.<br />
<br />
Monks were NOT tanking Emperor. Monks were NOT tanking Aten.<br />

<br />
I'm referring to avoidance's supremacy when the odds of being one-rounded or two-rounded (or anything long enough to react) are out of the picture, i.e solo velious/old world/kunark/luclin.  DPS arguments actually matter as the fights will give the RNG more then enough attempts to make avoidance factor in (the 4-rounds thingy).  The mob will not likely kill the monk before avoidance does its thing.  I'm not sure if you understand what I'm getting at so I'll try to make in short.  In soloing mobs that cannot possibly kill you in a brief period of time, the only thing that matters much is the DPS intake - damage spikes do not mean anything if the DPS of the mob remains constant (which would mean avoidance spike to counter balance that).  In the case of taking DPS, I assume monks are fine.  The second point I'm trying to make is that less monks solo simply because the rate of experience in groups at say 58 in PoNightmare is going to far best soloing say LDCs for exp.  That is just how the game evolved and melee soloing did not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Problem is Where are you going to put us in DPS?<br />
<br />
Simply restore you to where you used to be. And if rangers have changed,restore ranger where they used to be in DPS.<br />
<br />
The old balance for DPS worked, I don't think there will be a sudden issue when the old balance that worked is restored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warriors get an AA that gives stun resistance from behind. That's a defensive skill, that works from behind. So I'd go back to rewording what it is you're trying to say.<br />
<br />
Stun resistance is not melee damage taken, nor is it a melee skill such as is being discussed in this thread. What are we talking about? Melee damage taken, and abilties that modify said damage taken from the front and from behind.<br />
<br />
Jesus, you're grasping at straws.<br />
<br />
That's not true, btw. Warriors have always been the strongest defensive class, when their disc was running. Even pre-nerf Luclin, a defensive disc'd warrior was the strongest defensive class.<br />
<br />
Yep. Definitely grasping at straws. You'll take anything and twist it to try and support your point of view. No matter how ludicrous it is.<br />
<br />
Last statement from Brenlo regarding the monk mitigation nerf, was that they are going to repeal it. It's only a matter of when...<br />
<br />
It's been stated, yes. But dev or CR statements about what's actually going to happen in the game in the future are notoriously unreliable. SO many times they've said they're gonna do one thing, and it either ends up not happening, or they do something completely different. There are many examples of this, the most recent coming to mind being the CoL change which they'd stated in the past that they have no intentions of changing... but then turned around and changed it.<br />
<br />
With SoE, NOTHING is set in stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jat5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The biggest problem I've seen in this thread is the division of arguements on the avoidance supremecy of Monks. Basically, it is a non factor with current mitigation UNTIL time+ where pure +avoidance gear comes into play. It boggles my mind that SoE could nerf an entire class ( and to use thier own words &quot;Right now it seems to be having too much of an impact on Monks who aren뇺 the top 5%.&quot; ) then introduce gear in endgame zones specifically targeted to INCREASE the gap between that top 5% and the rest of the class. Basically, they are forcing a decision to buy the new expansions and raid ( or get a solid group to help you out with SOME of the available gear ) or deal with taking much more damage without avoidance to counterbalance.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would scrap a lot of the avoidance mods for dps style mods and roll back some more of the mitigation nerf for everyone. Ideally that much avoidance shouldn't have been put in where it was anyway, but I'm sure those mathmatical models SoE uses for balance decisions said it was a good thing...</div></div><hr />

People do know this right?  <br />
<br />
He never EVER once said it was going to be repealed, but the only statments have been that while it had the desired affect at the time, but now there might be some changes that need to be made (para-phrasing of course)<br />
<br />
Well. that's completely full of it. A WARRIOR said this? <br />
<br />
Daemon you do realise they get a riposte or a dodge disc also for same duration? AND they have a 2 tick 90% mitigation  that refreshes every 3-4minish?<br />
<br />
AS to saying<br />
<br />
Since you're never going to hit your disc during a pull until the crap hits the shitter, then the ability to use that disc effectively is HEAVILY dependent on surviving the initial 'contact' rounds. <br />
<br />
Let me ask you this, are you retarded?  Since you consider so much about yourself, I'm going to guess no, so answer this now.  What's the refresh on fiegn death?  What's the likely hood of you seeing what you're pulling?  Now what are the odds that ANYONE could guess if the mob(s) are going to be hitting them in the next 3 seconds-6.<br />
<br />
Great, if you answered sure/yes to all of these you're not retarded and you know how saying your skill is going to take twitch skills and getting hit first is utterly retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I'm fairly familiar with their discs. As to the point of your claim, you claimed that they have a disc which reduces more damage than what a warrior's disc gives.<br />
<br />
You cannot take less damage than a warrior using fortitude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen a quote from someone saying in effect that they were &quot;looking into it&quot;.  No outright promises of it being reversed.  I'd like to see the link because I'd be surprised if Brenlo was that forthcoming.  Particularly if he can't give a time frame when it would be done, since making promises without a date to commit to is kind of a CS no-no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm not grasping at straws Daemon. I'm simply asking Liper to be truthful in the first quote of mine you felt the need to quote. He said that monks were the only class to get a defensive benefit from behind. That's not true. Stun resistance is a defensive benefit. Considering how often in this thread you've treated SPECIFIC SKILLS as being encompassed in the OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF AVOIDANCE, I find it humorous that YOU of all people would try and debate me on this point. <br />
<br />
If Stun Immunity from behind isn't a defensive benefit ... then you have to concede that DODGE, BLOCK and RIPOSTE are their OWN separate skills and NOT part of avoidance.<br />
<br />
Granted, that you even try to argue that dodge, block and riposte are part of avoidance is ludicrous. Since you can clearly see +AVOIDANCE gear that monks do indeed get, do NOT affect those skills at all. But you persist on going down that path and making that argument. And while you do, you then turn around and decide to get NARROW in scope regarding something as beneficial as stun resistance from all angles.<br />
<br />
It makes one think you are grasping at whatever argument you can. Because you simply want to argue with monks over every annoying little detail in an effort to divert this thread from its original topic.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to the second statement of mine that you quoted. That you'd dipsute warrior tanking supremacy is funny and shows how exaggerated and overblown the whole Pre-Nerf days have gotten. Even for those of you who PLAYED warriors back then.<br />
<br />
Answer me this Daemon ... When your guild took on Emperor for the first time ... who tanked it?<br />
<br />
Frodlin makes some points about pre-nerf monks taking his spot in XP groups in Cazic Thule. Question ... at the time that happened ... who tanked Aten? A monk? Who tanked Lord Inquisitor Seru? A monk? Who tanked the Avatar of War? A monk? Who tanked these big bad raid targets? Monks?<br />
<br />
Rampage tanking was Furor's gripe with monks. Rampage tanks aren't the MAIN tanks. Monks weren't being used in tank rotations on the actual raid targets, were they?<br />
<br />
Who was the SUPERIOR tank?<br />
<br />
Go ahead. Say monk. Continue to lie. Just, remember to keep it in context. When you say monks were SUPERIOR tanks to WARRIORS prior to their mitigation nerf, you're leading people to believe monks were doing more than replacing warriors as XP group tanks. You're saying they were SUPERIOR TANKS TO YOU. BETTER TANKS. BETTER MAIN TANKS. You are saying they were better at doing your ENTIRE job. Not just ramp tanking. Not just XP group tanking, because XP groups bottom fed off of easy, light hitting mobs. You're saying monks were simply better TANKS than you.<br />
<br />
Which is hilarious. Any cleric from those days can tell you how hilarious that thinking is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Please Superchum, you're embarassing yourself at this point.  All through PoP when Knights were far and away preferred as the experience group tank, who still tanked the boss mobs most of the time?   That's right, a Warrior.  Didn't seem to mean squat for the experience game though, now did it?<br />
<br />
Just because Monks haven't been &quot;boss mob&quot; tanks doesn't mean they weren't perfectly fine experience group tanks that brought higher DPS, partial self healing, and the ability to pull singles in situations impossible for a Warrior.  After all, as has been shown time and time again, once you have &quot;enough&quot; tanking ability more just isn't that useful.  Then other factors start to come into play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You cannot take less damage than a warrior using fortitude. <br />
Correct, but they get a similiar disc as is, so it's moot, they take the same amount of damage (zero) for 12 seconds just like we do.<br />
<br />
Then they have earthwalk which, they basically don't get stunned and only take 1-2di dmg.<br />
<br />
Where? We do? Holy shit, well never mind. I take back everything i said before... Oh wait, your refering to Stonestance? FYI it is not a 90% mitigation increase dipshit. <br />
<br />
Maybe earthwalk isn't real maybe it's not, I could of sworn you folks had it and used it based on MB talks.<br />
<br />
Earthwalk Discipline  Detail | History | Stacking | Timer | Raw Data  <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Melee Mitigation by 90% <br />
2:  Stun Resist(1000) <br />
  <br />
<br />
so yeah, -10di or -18di....<br />
<br />
Even stonestance is 90% on lucy, so unless I'm missing something you're just flat out fucking wrong, again.<br />
<br />
Based off of what I can read on earthwalk from lucy, you might want to have that disc duration increased then a little, because it's obvious it's meant to help you survive the rough pulls, I'm sorry if you have a hard time using it, maybe up it to three or four ticks  :eek:   it would do more for pulling (guaranteed reduction in dmg and very little chance of stunning period) then any reasonable increase in mitigation OR avoidance will do.<br />
<br />
Answer me this Daemon ... When your guild took on Emperor for the first time ... who tanked it? <br />
<br />
Superchum I love your logic, most the issues with a monk improvment isn't a fear of tanking for raids, we know there's no chance in hell of that, it's for bieng MT of a EXP group, raid mobs have ZERO to do with it.<br />
<br />
Who was the SUPERIOR tank? <br />
<br />
Yeap superior on raid targets, monks don't have the hp pool to deal with one rounding on current content.  Problem is that's not the question or thoughts bieng addressed here it's exp.  If I as a say paladin had 15million AC, I still wouldn't be MT for current content if my hp pool was 8k.<br />
<br />
Cause guess what, I would go down eventually.<br />
are saying they were better at doing your ENTIRE job. <br />
<br />
No one said they tanked raids better, raids would wait on our aggro, raids REQUIRED high levels of HP.  The problem was you were tanking better then warriors were in things where that hp superiority didn't matter.  NO ONE HAS SAID YOU TANKED BETTER RAID.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Magruda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;Maybe earthwalk isn't real maybe it's not, I could of sworn you folks had it and used it based on MB talks&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh.... lvl 65 disc huh? How exactly is that helping me at lvl 61?<br />
<br />
So all you need to exp tank is mitigation and some yak augs for agro right? I think we need to petition to have your tuant, incite, and anger augs removed. Also bump your hp down some too and just give you the block skill. Because appartently if a monk got mitigation back they wuold out tank you and they have none of these things. So why do you need them?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I could be as specific as you have been about what mobs and where have been giving monks problems for pulling, but that'd not answer your question.<br />

<br />
Again, you're proving my point about twisting things around, grabbing at straws as a desperate attempt to find an argument that supports your point.<br />
<br />
Here we are talking about XP groups, and you twist it around to start all of a sudden talking about raids.<br />
<br />
It's almost getting comedic.<br />
<br />
What's even more funny is that you turn around and try to accuse me of grasping at any argument I can. Pot, Kettle, Black.<br />
<br />
The funniest out of all of them is your constant claim that DODGE is not part of avoidance.<br />
<br />
dodge    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (dj)<br />

The very DEFINITION of dodge proves that it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Warrior angst is funny...<br />
<br />
Pre monk nerf, warriors and knights had the same percentage of tanking jobs as post monk nerf. Some monks &quot;could&quot; tank decently as Frodlin pointed out, but somehow healers have and will always prefer &quot;real&quot; tanks. Some monks STILL tank decently, but mainly because of the content being trivial enough that even a druid can tank it (because of the insane healing power these days) or the mobs die so fast that monk discs actually matter. Mitigation appearantly, has little to do with a tanking monk...<br />
<br />
You guys are scared shitless, i find this highly amusing.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for monks bringing more DPS to the table as a tank... People obviously forget how close warriors are to monks in terms of dps, but we both agree monks should get a DPS boost. At least we agree on something  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally i seriously believe monks have too high hopes on what a mitigation repeal might do and warriors are most likely overreacting.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What i believe a mitigation repeal will achieve for monks:<br />
<br />
- Pulling monks in GoD+ zones will take ~200 less damage on pulls...<br />
- Soloing monks will find a handfull of blue mobs they can solo...<br />
- DPS monks will take ~100 less damage on ripostes, aggro flips etc...<br />

Mitigation seems like a wild goose chase imo. i'd rather have 10% more dps and rely more on playing skills to avoid damage. Also, complaining is human nature, there will always be people who like whine with their bread.<br />
<br />
DPS seems to be the only true holy grail for monks, pulling tools is a dead end, because content is the problem. Tanking is a dead end, because we're supposed to be the 6th best tank. I'd settle for 2nd best dps along with mages, with wizards and rogues sharing the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can fully see how mitigation is better when you are tanking stuff and being healed... I can see how shielding becomes excelent once you are tanking stuff that needs more than one healer to keep you up. But for pulling surely avoidance is better? Seems to me it would be better in all &quot;oh crap, something just hit me and I have no healer&quot; situations?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I'd just like to understand how mitigation can be better than avoidance for pulling. <br />
<br />
2 reasons, really.<br />
<br />
The first being monks take far too many maximum hits right now. And want that reduced to a more normal level so that they can survive pulls better than they currently do. Avoidance has nothing to do with that. That's mitigation.<br />
<br />
The second being monks spend time running from mobs with their back being shown to the mob. The back arc isn't that spiffy a defensive area for any toon. Smoother mitigation would help when pulling like that. Especially since monks already have the worthless &quot;dodge from behind&quot; and that's not helping. Even moreso when considering they can't &quot;block&quot; from behind, which is what gives them a so-called advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>greyborne25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">[QUOTE]I'd just like to understand how mitigation can be better than avoidance for pulling. I'm probably missing something. [/quote}<br />
<br />
Pulls for monks takes at most 4 seconds, any more and the group will rep the monk with a bard. So on a tough pull (All pulls in GoD) this monk will take at best damage for 4 seconds.<br />
<br />
There압 a huge probability, avoidance will not fire at all in those four seconds and if the monk runs to camp (Which doesnt reduce running speed) he only has dodge to rely on, greatly reducing his avoidance to almost nil during those 4 seconds.<br />
<br />
Avoidance, strangely enough, is more usefull for tanking, since the chance of it firing increases every second of tanking.<br />
<br />
A mitigation boost however, will most likely reduce damage on a 4 second pull by 200 at most. So if a mob has insane DPS and something goes wrong like a failed FD, the monk is dead regardless. Monks would need a lot better mitigation then warriors have to have the survival rate they want.<br />
<br />
It압 therefor my conclusion, that aspiring more mitigation is useless as we will never get better mitigation then warriors.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In fact, both mitigation and avoidance won앖 help much on pulling, the only things that help on pulling is hitpoints and resists and loads of it. Or a neat gimmick, like frodlins suggestion of killer mitigation/avoidance when attack is off...<br />
<br />
Mitigation for monks is only usefull for soloing or (gasp a monk is saying it) tanking... Then again, avoidance is also only usefull for soloing and tanking. Both simply do not effect taking damage on pulling enough unless the effect is godly...<br />
<br />
It is however, true, that mitigation beats avoidance for pulling, but like i said, the difference or usefullness of it is in fact... useless.... Hence monks wanting more mitigation, but alas, overestimating what it might achieve.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Again, it comes out trumping up when avoidance doesn't fire.<br />
<br />
Again, I say for every time that avoidance doesn't fire, there's going to be a time where avoidance fires twice. Otherwise the percentage of avoidance wouldn't work out to what it does.<br />
<br />
People seem to forget that for some reason. <br />
<br />
For every time where monk gets hit twice with avoidance not firing, there's going to be a time where it fires both times.<br />
<br />
As I've previously stated, this problem can be addressed with other than mitigation. It can be addressed by increaseing dodge from behind, or by increasing run speed. Or, it can be increased by increaseing running backwards speed, so that monks may take full benefit from all their defensive abilities by facing the mob they're pulling.<br />
<br />
Additionally, a mitigation increase can be &quot;paid for&quot; by an avoidance decrease. With all the monks complaining about how useless avoidance is, I'm sure they wouldn't mind the reduction of their avoidance to what everyone else can acheive, for a comparable mitigation increase. Of course, that would completely destroy the whole premise of a monk being the class that dodges and doesn't mitigate well, too.<br />
<br />
A mitigation boost is certainly not the only option. It certainly seems to be the one that monks are fixated on, though.</div></div><hr />

AC won't do anything for us as long as we have the softcap. (i'm not asking to remove it) Why do monks want mitigation back instead of avoidance? Because it was unjustly taken away. And why should we not want AC to mean the same thing as all other classes? (before the softcap, I know one of you is going to twist that sentence) I honestly don't think Mitigation will fix our damage taking problems. But it's a start. It's just one battle in the war.

I would support a raise in the soft cap simply because if a class is allowed to grow to strong SONY fucked up by making a bunch of druid/monk/bst gear instead of taking the time to make monk only gear.<br />
<br />
It makes me want to punch my computer every time I see a ring or something similir drop with 20 ac, 100 hp and mana and it is caster only.... but to get a warrior version I would have to kill a monster twice as hard or more to get the same thing.<br />
<br />
The game is unfairly scued to alot of classes, thats for sure.<br />
<br />
I think the soft cap cuts it be 1/2 or 1/3 its effective value so more like 100 or 150 more AC</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree that balancing only the upper level is fuxxor'd, the hardcap system they had in place combined with gear that allowed Monks to reach that hardcap caused some problems.  Monks simply became too strong defensively compared to Warriors because of those two things and our superior skills.<br />
<br />
Of course, since then, Warriors have recieved several upgrades that when combined with PoP/GoD itemization make the Monk Nerf completely laughable.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think PoP would have fixed the problem in that particular case, but SoE wanted to appease Furor.<br />

You're not a warrior with big heavy plate who can't dodge worth shit but can take a hit really well, you're a monk with light armour who can't MITIGATE worth shit, the mob just can't hit you woth shit compared to a warrior. You just dodge a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is the case then I expect you to head up a campaign to get all plate wearers avoidance skills nerfed down to caps of 100 tops. After all, you are wearing big heavy plate armor, you shouldnt be able to dodge for crap. I mean, you DO realize that your skills have identical caps as a monks right? Barring block which you dont get. So you dodge, riposte just as well as us and you parry quite well also. Seems a bit unbalanced that the ultimate armored tank can also avoid very nearly as well as a nimble, light on his feet monk.<br />

<br />
the game isnt about class balance anymore, its about finding way to gimp each class enough so that 400hp on a single fcking item doesnt make things to &quot;out of balance&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If you think about what I am saying then the monk nerf would not have happend if they balanced from the ground up.<br />
<br />
Comparing monks with less than 1500 AC with 2k+ AC warriors is fairly silly.  I have a bit more than 2400 ac unbuffed.  A similarly geared monk would have almost 2k AC and that's despite their lack of ability to use the 10 ac LDON augs (I have all of those).<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">thats Vabtoo  <br />
<br />
You explain that all by yourself in the quote above. That's Vabtoo. No other explanation is needed.<br />
<br />
 A similarly geared monk would have almost 2k AC  <br />
<br />
There's absolutely no motivational factor for monks to spend anytime getting Armor Class. So they'd fall short of 2k AC, as it's not a part of their gear choices.<br />
<br />
Or as Thep clearly states: <br />
<br />
 What is the point? The nerf has completely eliminated AC as an avenue to progress my character. And I don't see the need for it. At 1300ac I still get hit for max 13% of the time and at 1800ac I get hit for max 12% of the time (compared to 3% for 2200ac warrior or 6% for 1400ac warrior). I should still see gains from getting more ac.<br />
 <br />
<br />
What's that mean? That means a monk wouldn't waste their time with these augments at all:<br />
Opaque Sapphire of Bulwark, Daunting Opaque Orb, Bone Shard of Rigidity.<br />
<br />
They'd get no benefit from equipping those augments.<br />
<br />
(SPECIAL NOTE to Khumak ... the weapon augs are off as well, as the Ykeshas are lore, unlike Anger 3 procs, meaning a monk would not be able to equip both of them at the same time ... unless they've changed that recently? ... So they'd have the top Ykesha proc and probably the one a tier lower. It wouldn't matter much in the long run, but for matters of correctness, you may want to fix that)<br />
<br />
And lastly ...<br />
<br />
 Comparing monks with less than 1500 AC with 2k+ AC warriors is fairly silly. <br />
<br />
Agreed. What's even sillier, however, is this comparison actually stacks up:<br />
<br />
 Speaking of warriors. They mitigate damn well. In fact, that 1380ac warrior takes about as much DPS as does the 2066ac pally. But then the pally and shadow knight could still see significant gains in their ability to take damage, so that probably isn't such a big deal.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thep's right. It's not a big deal. His knights from his test weren't at the same level as his monk or his warrior friend. However, it's just ironic that it's bad form to compare a low AC monk to a high AC warrior, but the flipside ... a low AC warrior, actually does stack up against high AC knights (not even monks, knights).<br />
<br />
Just one of them silly quirks.<br />
<br />
I believe the GZA from the Wu-Tang clan summed the entire subject up in his lyric:<br />
<br />
&quot;Unbalanced like elephants and ants on seesaws&quot;<br />
<br />
Too bad monks are the ants getting squashed on pulls.<br />

Ok, here's what i'm saying, If it is determined that a monks softcap is 1300 and we only get 1 actual ac for 40 displayed ac after 1300, which would make a monk with 1900 ac equivelent to 1315. Would it be so wrong to repeal the nerf? If you say yes i'm sure we will all pool our resources to verify what the actual softcap is and what we get after reaching it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">(SPECIAL NOTE to Khumak ... the weapon augs are off as well, as the Ykeshas are lore, unlike Anger 3 procs, meaning a monk would not be able to equip both of them at the same time ... unless they've changed that recently? ... So they'd have the top Ykesha proc and probably the one a tier lower. It wouldn't matter much in the long run, but for matters of correctness, you may want to fix that)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, didn't notice that.  Thanks for catching it.  I was actually thinking about removing my anger 3 aug and using 2 ykeshas but now I think I'll keep the anger 3 and just use the 1 ykesha offhand.  As you mentioned though, the important thing for aggro is the stun, not the DD attached.  <br />

Speaking of warriors. They mitigate damn well. In fact, that 1380ac warrior takes about as much DPS as does the 2066ac pally. But then the pally and shadow knight could still see significant gains in their ability to take damage, so that probably isn't such a big deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt this could be true unless the parse was done on something with a very low ATK where AC didn't matter much for anyone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Yes, he used valorian guards. However, he only collected 60 minutes or so, I believe. The parses are useless and should be removed or a big fat warning put up on there stating that it is only there for historical/archive purposes.</div></div><hr />

Ah, the wonderful &quot;You didn't stand there for 9 solid months, so the data stream has too large a margin of error!&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
Wonderful.<br />
<br />
On the flip-side, since the parses are useless as you state ...<br />
<br />
Pumilo is wrong. Frodlin is wrong. Monks are right. We DO take damage worse than any other class in the game. Because the ONLY parse that indicates we don't ... is that one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Regardless of the parse size, I think we can all agree that valorian guards do not have high enough ATK to accurately judge the returns on AC at or above 2000 AC (perhaps not even above 1700 AC).<br />
<br />
There are XP mobs with much higher ATK these days than valorian guards, against whom our modern AC totals would be better judged.</div></div><hr />

Superchum, go fuck yourself.<br />

If you had taken the time to actually parse data for yourself, you would know that doing just 60 minute parses result in rather large variances. Go ahead, do it, you'll see it for yourself. From my experience, I've noticed that that margin of error doesn't become small enough until AT LEAST 8 hours of controlled conditions against a single and the same opponent. You have to have a large enough sample, those parses do not. Others and myself have also noted the discrepancies in the data that is provided on those tables. At best, the wrong formulation was used to derive some of the values, other times it just plain looks like the numbers were fudged. The numbers dont add up. The numbers are suspect do to small samaple size. The entire encounter is suspect due to the opponent chosen having such a low atk.<br />

Also, where the fuck did you get that I was arguing for or against monk mitigation. Show me where I said, or alluded to anything for or against monk mitigation/tanking in that statment. Hell, even in the past 10 pages of this thread. That's right, nowhere. STFU</div></div><hr />

I use a 40 post per page setting ... so we may have some marging before the 4000 posts</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">You go fuck yourself first, Vikken, you arrogant, lying, shade the truth to make yourself appear smarter than you actually are piece of shit.

<br />
You didn't read a damn thing THEP SAID ABOUT HIS TESTS.<br />
<br />
And Thep ... parsed more shit in his EQ career than you even begin to let on that you know about. For YEARS he tested shit. For YEARS he provided solid, well established data. He never offered it as FACT. Just DATA. He was good at collecting it.<br />
<br />
You'll find more Thep parses even on this very fucking message board, if you ever bothered to look you insufferable assclown.<br />
<br />
Oh, and in case you're still not getting it ... here's the part I'm referring to that you OVERLOOKED, or, imo, completely misread:<br />
<br />
 Each class would tank the mob for 40-60 minutes  at a time . <br />
<br />
He did the tests 60 minutes at a TIME.<br />
<br />
Let me know when you can actually provide a consistently stronger sample of ALL OF THOSE CLASSES, at ALL OF THOSE GEAR LEVELS. Feel free to post it.<br />

Put up ... Or shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />
