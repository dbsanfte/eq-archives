Just wondering if anyone's used 1 of these for agro?  With snare, you'd think it would be decent.  I'm thinking of getting 1, and throwing a yak proc on it, for situational use.  However, if it's pretty lame agro to start with, then I'll probably just stick with a silken whip of ensnaring and save the yak aug for something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The snare proc is nice agro, though the Droga combo is cheaper and much better ratio with similar agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is damn handy though when fighting something you know will run. Good idea to have one imo same as ToD</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Better than a Silken Whip of Ensnaring, if nothing more than the lower delay and higher ac. Snare is decent aggro, and DWing with your BoC should be good enough especially with both augmented with Ykesha/EB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the replies.  Consensus seems to be that it generates decent aggro, so I think I'll put a cheaper yak aug on it and break it out for LDoN's or whatever when there is no snarer in the group.  The way it is now, if there's no snarer with the group I usually do LDoN's with *usually the case*, we just root the mobs.  However, if I can use this and still hold decent agro, that will be worth having to temporarily bag either my BoC or GBoS for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might try DWing a snare whip off hand with the anklesmasher primary, if you're going to be the primary form of snare. More procs will make it more reliable. That is, only if you can still hold aggro though of course :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few expansions ago, the snare weapons were pretty uber aggro.  Aug'd they'd probably not be a bad choice for when you have no other snare in the group.  Not as good as a newer aggro combo, but probably nothing to scoff at either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anklesmasher would probably be a pretty nice off hand weapon if you could put Anger 3 on it to compensate for the low ratio.  It would probably be a lot better agro than an unaugmented BoC if you did that but thats just a guess.<br />
<br />
I thought it was a shame they didn't add snare and slow as augment proc types.  Would be nice to have a BoW that snares or slows for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best part about snare proc weapons is sometimes they can block sk snares. blocked spells = no agro = pissed off sk's, only reason i still carry snare weapons. rangers are tougher to block though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">blocked spells = no agro <br />
<br />
  Blocked slow is still aggro. Wavecrashers still generate aggro even though the slow won't land with any other slower in the group. I haven't tested it, but everyone that's used a Wavecrasher has said it does. I'd assume snare is the same, though I have to admit I never pull out my snare whip if anyone else is snaring. Nor do I try to slow with my ToD with a slower in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snare is definately the same. Even get nice aggro from mobs that are immune to changes in run speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a Silken Whip offhand with a Frostbringer in primary a while back ( ahh, the memories). Aggro was decent, even when snare wouldn't stick. I still carry the whip, it's very useful duoing with a cleric or shaman, not very reliable in LDON because mobs often start to run before I get a proc.</div></div><hr />
