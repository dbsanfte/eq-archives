<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My idea:<br />
<br />
When a warrior (level 1-65+) is targetted by a mob, the mob is innately slowed for as long as the mob is targetted on the warrior.<br />
<br />
This slow has the same agro effect as any slow and will stack with any other slows on the mob.  The slow is not &quot;mob&quot; based, it is mechanics based.  When a warrior is targetted, attacks land on the warrior 10% slower then they would on any other class, just because the warrior is targetted.  Mobs immune to slow still are slowed by 10% because they have targetted a warrior.<br />
<br />
This is all because a warrior is a fierce fighter and it is harder to land a blow on them.  This makes the mob need to slow down to try land a blow.<br />
<br />
Pros:  <br />
<br />
Warrior receives 10% less damage if mob is slowed 10% (duh) and is therefore more viable as a tank without putting the warrior on a different defensive table.<br />
<br />
More agro received on warrior because the warrior frustrates the poor mob who can't quite deal with the warrior as efficiently as they would deal with other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
75% slow means 25% damage taken, and the delay of the mob increases by a factor of 4.<br />
<br />
85% slow (75% + Warrior slow thing) is 15% damage taken, and the delay of the mob increase by a factor of 6.6<br />
<br />
The difference in damage taken from a 75% slowed mob compared to a 85% slowed mob is that a 85% slowed mob would do 60% the dps that a 75% slowed mob would.<br />
<br />
Decreasing a 2 cleric CH chain to one that requires only one cleric and even gives him time to med is never gonna happen, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought slow works like haste, ie an unslowed mob attacks every second, and a 75% slwoed mob attacks every 1,75 seconds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trondir, that's not how haste works.  <br />
<br />
22 percent haste increases damage output (not delay) by 22 percent, so damage is 1.22 times what it was. Delay is 82 percent of what is was in case you were curious (1/1.22 = new delay, since damage and delay are inversely related), and at capped (100 percent) haste, delay is 50 percent of what is was (if you swing twice as often, you do twice the damage, what a revelation).<br />
<br />
For a 75 percent decrease in damage, 1 - .75 = .25 (assuming slow is really a 75 percent decrease in damage). This is a 4 fold decrease in delay.<br />
<br />
Stacking a 10 percent slow on that means 1 - .85 = .15 - which is 60 percent of the just slowed damage (.15/.25).<br />
<br />
A 10 percent stacking slow, then, is insanely unbalanced.  Well, how about one that doesn't stack?<br />
<br />
Assuming slow doesn't stack, a 10 percent slow is a total waste of time since it's not enough to do away with a slower and too little to not be overwritten by any slow that's actually cast (65 BST has 65% slow, SHM has 75% slow magic based and 40% disease based and ENC has 65% slow).<br />
<br />
Although in this idea's defense it's not nearly as stupid as making AE taunt a level 1 warrior ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could change it to 10 % of the rest instead of 10 % absolut.<br />
<br />
That would mean unslowed mob = 10 % slow.<br />
Shaman slowed mob ( 75 ) = 77.5 % slow. <br />
<br />
So it would always reduce the damage by 10 %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And how much aggro would a 2 percent slow be? I think it would kind of defeat the point of giving warriors slow style aggro to make it a non-existant slow, unless of course, slow carries huge aggro regardless of amount of slow. Which it could.<br />
<br />
That would then be essentially the same as giving warriors a 10 percent mitigation advantage to go with their 20 percent &quot;time between complete heals&quot; advantage, which, if you read the boards here, has resulted in no warrior ever getting a group since it's not enough of an advantage.<br />
<br />
So... you get a limited amount of aggro (presumably - who knows how slow aggro works) and an increase in an advantage which everyone here claims isn't really an advantage.  It's yet another twist on the many schools of thought that say &quot;If we only had the aggro knights did we could get groups again by just being a warrior but people would group with knights for utility, even though they never did before.  Really! We don't want to nerf knights we just want to be more desirable in every way for groups. But people would still group with knights.  Stop shaking your head, they will!  Look at how many groups our AC/HP advantages go us in PoP.  Ok, don't.  Just trust me - we want to be more desirable than you for groups, that's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although, to be fair, paladins are breeding like maggots in rotten meat lately.  Did a / all 65 -pick plate class- and paladins outnumbered warriors who still WAY outnumber SKs.</div></div><hr />
