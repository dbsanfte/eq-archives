  SO! Weeks ago I bought a GSoT when I saw one at the bargain basement price of 3500pp - while the others were going for 5kpp+. 10 days afterwards they were selling regularly for 2kpp, and now they cant be given away at 500pp to 900pp each.<br />
Guess I bought too soon.<br />
<br />
SO!  When I saw 3 Windblades in the bazaar for 25k to 27kpp, I thought &quot;Hrm, just wait a bit longer and I'll be able to buy one and have change left over!&quot;  Now, after LDON, I see only one and its asking price is 54kpp!<br />
Guess I waited too late?<br />
<br />
Did I miss something?  Is it because of the DPS nature of LDON?<br />
<br />
Valkir Sunderblood<br />
&quot;How does that horn stay on the staff even after all those beatings?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maadaasaakaa</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a great DPS weapon, not a great aggro weapon, hence favoured by pallies and SK's more than us warriors.<br />
<br />
But with ldon you can add a proc to it i.e. hate/stun, which now makes it far more attractive again, or so some might think, though this is a very short term view.<br />
<br />
Regarding prices, every server has their own economy, on Mith Marr, decent weapons and gear are abundant and therefore dirt cheap, GSoTS have gone for under 1k for about a month now, as they are a common drop in BoT, the cheapness and availability of them has driven the prices on windblades and other nice 2handers down very hard, also the uncertainty regarding the impact on the economy because of LdoN has ensured people who would traditionally have to upgrade gear by buying it have a new option, which means not parting with hard earned plat for bottom feeding guilds who sell it on Ebay.<br />
<br />
Don’t waste plat unless you have it too waste, get racking those points up and buy your own decent 2hander – with MORE augment slots, then upgrade it.<br />
<br />
just my 2c :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been scouring the LDON lists and have yet to see a &quot;big gun&quot; 2 hander.  <br />
<br />
The best I've seen in this dept I believe was:<br />
<br />
Timeworn Desert Spear<br />
Magic Lore No Drop<br />
2hp, level 65 recomended, 10.00 wt, size: Giant<br />
35 dmg 32 dly<br />
+10 int, + 10 wis, 85 hp, 50 mana, 8svc, 10svm<br />
War,Pal,Shd,Ran//All<br />
Slot1: type 1<br />
Slot2: type 4<br />
Slot3: type 6 <br />
<br />
...granted with a 40hp every slot,  a yak proc slot 4 and a slot 6 dam +3 enhance it could look like 38/32 125 hps w/yak proc but thats hardly earthshattering...of course such a weapon wouldnt suck either.  To be honest I'm not certain it would be better than a GSOT with 2x procs on it in terms of agro (31/30 stun/stun) /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banbha</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The GSoT procs a Planar Stun only. I affectionately call it my Horny Stick... Cause, well, that's what it looks like. A horn tired to a stick. Although people say it describes my current state of mind. I don't know why they get that impression :D <br />

<br />
I believe GSOT has a slot 4 = add a proc; add a mod get 2 stuns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I thought it was a great staff of thunder, but there was also some weapon that drops in BoT it's a 2hb stick is that this same item? Because if it is, i thought it was warrior only? Hence why I was confused when Maada mentioned it was better for pallys and sks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without augs, GSoT only procs a 1 second stun that works on mobs up to 65.  Both windblade and GSoT have a slot 4 for augmenting.<br />
<br />
As for the price changes, the drop rate of the GSoT was greatly increased when the drop rates of ornate were also increased.  So with the market saturated, prices fell fast.  The drop rate of the windblade has been the same (very poor) for a while now, so prices should be fairly stable by now.  Other than the times when there are people trying to sell either fast or high, or people just unknowledgeable about the current rate.<br />
<br />
The GSoT does drop in BoT, it is warrior only.  When he mentioned pallys and sks he was talking about the windblade.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I thought it was a great staff of thunder, but there was also some weapon that drops in BoT it's a 2hb stick is that this same item? Because if it is, i thought it was warrior only? Hence why I was confused when Maada mentioned it was better for pallys and sks.  Hehe, you are very confused :)<br />
<br />
There are 2 2hb weapons that drop in BoT, both with the name &quot;Greastaff of _____&quot;<br />
<br />
The WAR only one is indeed the Greatstaff of Thunder (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24799).<br />
<br />
The other one, with more DPS but less aggro, is Greatstaff of the Four Winds (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24780).<br />
<br />
The weapons Maadaasaakaa mentioned that is better for Knights than Warriors is Windblade (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25979).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Bah, I didn't see Hussar's post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah okay, Maada ment the windblade, it all becomes clear now, thnak you. I thought he meant the Greatstaff of Thunder and I'm like... sitting here thinking &quot;that weapon sucks for dps... and wait, knights can't use it?&quot; Thanks for clearing things up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sloanbone</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Zeb there are usually 5 or so Windblades for sale for 20-25k. War Marshall Blade is down to 10kish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry Baadan, but GSot4W is greater aggro than GSoT =p<br />
Used both for quite a while, and now use my GSot4W constantly, even defensive / evasive tanking.  It's a lot more reliable than procing weapons for aggro, since how often you hit is going to be about the same on most mobs, whereas procs can be streaky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting comparison regarding the GSot4W and GSoT on agro... I'm surprised since a lot of monks use the 4 wind staff and they dont seem to be pulling agro that often with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, monks use it also, pretty much everyone in my guild who can use a 2hander uses it actually.  Even though the monks are using the exact same weapon, have more offensive aas, and are doing more dps than me, I keep aggro pretty well.  Which has made me believe that aggro is modified based on your class.  Bards actually are good proof that SOE can modify aggro based on your class, and then this situation shows, to me, that there is some modifier for most classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maadaasaakaa</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye thanks for clearing that up for me, and yes the the proc is planar stun only, getting it mixed up with my sword of the bloodsworn which has the same stun &amp; 75dd.</div></div><hr />
