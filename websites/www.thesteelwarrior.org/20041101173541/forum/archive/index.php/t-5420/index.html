<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mascher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question as to procs.Would some of u give me an idea as to how u would use the snare/tash procs as both a MA and SA etc.I normally do not do a lot of weapon switches and only have dd/anger type procs on weapons atm.I can see how some of these could be verify useful and i am interested in how some of u use such weapons.thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually anything that requires an MA will include enough people to snare/Tash.<br />
<br />
I *suppose* you could use Jstick until you get a Tash off, but it really isnt that good a use of time. In the time it takes hoping that you will get your Tash, you may have dead casters/much less DPS due to you not just tanking as MA.<br />
<br />
This goes double for snaring, as there are multiple snare classes.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about soloing or duoing with no ench or snarer, that is a different matter.<br />
<br />
However most things difficult enough to actually require Tash usually also require bringing an enchanter to help kill it faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mascher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks,I was wondering.I have the occasional runner in LDoN that brings back a room on us.usually happens when root etc..doesn't stick.Your logic makes sense .thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are super hosed on runners and no snarer at all, you could take a silken whip or otherwise and once you get a headstart on agro AND the mob is slowed tashed etc...You could try and proc a snare.<br />
<br />
It's not worth it though.<br />
<br />
Although I concur, Runners do suck :(<br />
<br />
p.s. in trying to be helpful, your best bet is anklesmasher. It has decent DPS and the snare proc. You will give up the least amount of DPS with that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only thing is, if your ranger/druid/shadowknight/necro's snare is being resisted, chances are your proc will be resisted also =-(</div></div><hr />
