got a pair of boots off frenzy iniate in tactics pit one time. various mini named in tactics drop bps - robe(pig guy), chain bp(overseer), and plate bps off the named troll(sword guy)<br />
<br />
ppl claim all the bot named drop them 1 day spawns. few  lesser named have phs(very rare unless its server up).<br />
<br />
we got plate legs pretty common off one of the solro minis, leather bp i think off xzul.<br />
<br />
dunno, other than legs and BP, its all too rare and needs to be more of an upgrade over deity armory, at least 25hp or so and its not. even though the bp and legs are more common if the mobs are available to you, they just arent much of an upgrade. there needs to be more of middle ground between them and raex.<br />

as far as plate gloves, only saw one post<br />
<br />
&quot;Ornate Plate Gauntlets in BoT come from Eindrede Icestorm (I think thats his name, it is a namer in lower water/ocean that has the exact same name as the tower boss).<br />
<br />
Anyway, zone into BoT. Run up the stairs, go straight from the top of the steps up the ramp and take your first left. There is a xxxx kriger there. That is his PH. Got Ornate Plate Gauntlet Mold x2 out of bout 60 or so kills.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
 We had heard same thing. So awhile back took a few groups and pulled stuff from that house. After 3ish hours when *nothing* dropped we gave up. That house is retarded, the mobs are stupid hard. AE mana drains and atk taps, 900+ hitters left and right, it sucks much ass. Total waste of zone space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we had a 2 group farm team get a rune from the 900 ae mana drain things, but they didnt spend much time there, dunno how rare/common the runes are, like warriors care hehe.<br />
<br />
it was rizlona that drops the legs, got another pair tonight, can almost bank on her dropping plate legs. nice shoulder slot item too, too bad warriors arent included on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the Sol Ro mini's(Riz, Jiva, Arly, Dreso, Xuzl) can drop any chest/leg I believe.<br />
<br />
 The absolute best source of non-chest/leg slot ornate items in game is Jiva &quot;event&quot;. The guys he summons can drop any piece but the 2 big ones. And as long as yer on Jiva he keeps summoning them, if you can just stay there awhile you will get multiple pieces. Just in a straight kill of him we've gotten 3 pieces before.<br />
<br />
 Never actually tried this, but I imagine you could farm the hell out of the event with a little strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jumjumbeans</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone able to confirm that Ornate Gauntlet Molds still drop off that BoT named (water wing, first room on the left)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it does. Just because something can take weeks of camping to get (i'm not joking) doesn't mean it was removed from loot table.<br />
<br />
Go camp elif, a spawn that is always up every 27 mins for plate arms. The only spawn of it's type in BoT and i'm still only 1 mold for like 130+ kills. Silk crap hats are another story tho..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jumjumbeans</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you know that it drops for a fact, do you know FIRST HAND people with the Gauntlets, or you are assuming it does because you farm the arms are they are really rare?<br />
<br />
I have seen the Arms, the BP, the Legs, the Bracer, the Boots, the Helm. <br />
<br />
I have NEVER seen the Gauntlets, I do not know anyone on my server who has seen them, and I asked around. <br />
<br />
I do not see any serious magelo profile with someone owning those gloves worn or in equipment for effect.<br />
<br />
I have not seen a single warrior on this board claim to have them, or accounting for a first hand sighting of the gloves.<br />
<br />
Your experience with the arms has absolutely no relevance with this matter, I am afraid.<br />
<br />
I need facts on this one please =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was merely comparing how some people say 'I haven't seen it drop personally, so it must have been removed and your info false!' after they've camped it for a month and got the big fat nothing. Yes I have been in a BoT group when they dropped.<br />
<br />
As for the arms, think of it as a perspective into the horrendous drop rate, when you look at a spawn that is always up (Elif Whitewind), never skips and giving nothing cept maybee 3 times in 100+ kills. Now put that together with an uncommon spawn (lower Eindride Icestorm), see what rarity you have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jumjumbeans</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I can see your point.</div></div><hr />
