<br />
I've just reached level 46 with my Barbarian Warrior (Tribunal) and I've saved up 6000pp. I'm looking for some advice on what to upgrade next. What I've got has served me fairly well so far, but I reckon its time to spend some plat.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether to upgrade armour or weapons first. I'm using Centi Longsword/Defenders Lightblade combo and swapping in/out a Barnacle Covered Axe and Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood. My 2hs weapon is a Weighty Polearm. My other melee skills are lagging a bit, but I'm working on those.<br />
<br />
Are these weapons sufficient for a few more levels? Should I spend 6k on one decent BP or buy several cheaper armour upgrades?<br />
<br />
Take a look at my magelo in the signature. Any opinions/comments will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

Gonna offer a few cheap suggestions.  Pick and choose, but at least get the rings first.  As for weps, primary the Venom Axe, offhand the Centi LS for now.<br />
<br />
Ears:  Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings x2<br />
Neck:  Amulet of Mummy Wrappings<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes or Silvery Mask<br />
Fingers:  Velium Fire Wedding Rings x2<br />
Shoulders:  Crested Spauldors (you have bagged) or Imbued Granite Spaulders<br />
Back:  Crimson Cloak of the Werewolf or Cloak of Greater Pernicity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzen Whacksem</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a barbarian Tribunal worshipper myself, I am pleased with the Helanic Tundra pieces available to wear.  Nearly ever piece has very good +hp stats.<br />
<br />
6k might be enough to get a bracer or a belt ... check the bazaar for sellers, if you don't have the smithing skill yourself.<br />
<br />
Woops -- forgot to add this bit.<br />
The quests provided by Herald Telcha (small sarnak just inside Chardok) are well worth it.  The regal band of bathezid is the 2nd step and has a right nice bit of raw HP as well as +5 sta.  Additionally, as long as you maintain faction in Chardok, can recharge the damage shield effect by handing it back to the Herald!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korgann</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice guys. I've made a couple of changes. I've bought a pair of Velium Fire Wedding Rings, a Crinsose Cape of the Werewolf and a Massive Flameguard Helm (not much of an upgrade but the price was good).<br />
<br />
I haven't seen the Black Sapphire Electrum Earrirngs in the bazaar for the passed few days, but I see them regularly on NPC merchants. Should have a shiny new pair in the next couple of days. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />
