<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">They were pretty quick to announce the melee plans when we were planning our stand down. They answered questions along the way to the melee enhancement 1. Now we see a patch message that the second (and assuming last) phase of the revamp is in, everyone is asking whats going on, and the dev are nowhere to be seen.  I think they saw we could be strung along for a year and figure they can do it to us again. Stand down v2 inc~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm fairly happy with the tuning that warriors have received.  We have snap aggro, a slight mitigation boast, and more hitpoints (yeah, it will take some exp grinding to get). I feel that warriors are fun to play again and are properly balanced with the other tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well its like being told that the custom car you ordered is here, and then you find out its the wrong color, its still a fuck up on the company's part and most people IRL wouldnt stand for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm happy with the new changes I wouldn't say we have snap agro though.  I don't see any reasons to complain about not getting anything new with Melee Revamp 2.  It would have been nice to be given new discs or skills or something.  Added Endurance was nice now when I solo Healing Will doesnt take over half my Endurance :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm more ticked off that they aren't communicating then anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">im kinda ticked because melee balance part 2 was promissed to us and we see that it has no substance, much like the company's recent record.<br />
<br />
go to outhouse and look what the guides have said, REAL gms havent been on in weeks, patchs every night<br />
<br />
this game is going to hell for some reason<br />

think im gona join ninjaburger in FFXI fulltime instead of part time</div></div><hr />

I still enjoy playing the game with my friends.  I have fun, not matter the state of the game or my class.<br />
<br />
I think SoE should send all main 65 warriors a case of the beer (if they're of drinking age in their country!) of their choice =)  That would be cool<br />

I'll be pissed if paladins get the defensive they're asking for though.<br />
<br />
We've gotten attention from developers lately, and some have even appeared on this board. It's nice if they pop in from time to time, but I think they're doing pretty well lately. I don't think we have any right to be bitchy at this point.</div></div><hr />

Try making a paladin if you want stun or root.  SK or ranger if you want snare.</div></div><hr />

You could make a berserker too, and get a weak version of snare and stun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh, don't forget the relatively easy yet far better than any other melee class Epic that berserkers get too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>orrillias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The problem is i am thinking the balance will only be temperary.<br />
The whole reason the opening system was supposed to be made was to give us more during updates or expansions. (ie quested disci's) when an expansion happen mellee gets:<br />
1. new stuff<br />
2. new aa's<br />
<br />
Hybrids and casters get<br />
1 new stuff<br />
2 new aa's<br />
3 new spells<br />
<br />
It wasnt so bad in the old days when we were the only ones with disci's and that could crit aint that way any more earlier some one posted that they dont have a problem holding agroe unless some pally is activelly trying to take it.  to me thats the whole point we should be able to hold it even if they are</div></div><hr />

Shadows only serve one purpose, to tell the entire board that the poster was too dumb to put his post in the right forum in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was being half sarcastic. Not to mention the subject started as a general topic then posters turned it into class balance, but I guess you're too busy sucking wang to see past the balls.<br />

<br />
At most exp spots a Paladin can take less damage (on average) than a Warrior.  Does the lock on MTing we have make everyone else so happy that we ignore the fact that Paladins still will be picked for exp over a Warrior?  Even a better Warrior?</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I have no trouble being picked up in groups, all the time. I go LFG, and I haven't had to wait more than 10 minutes. I'm currently not guilded, so people don't actually know I'm outfitted with AAs. <br />
<br />
  What are you coming up with that now says that paladins take less damage on average than warriors? We mitigate better (and did BEFORE the DI change) than knights, and now have access to even more hp that's ours alone. You think stuns make up for that? I don't. Prove it to me if you're going to post comments like that, or I'm going to go on believing that those melee fixes balanced the classes as best as they ever have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i just feel cheated in that we dont get anything really great from expantions that is unique to us.<br />
<br />
like for example, does anyone really need the new spells that came out with GoD or LDoN? no, they didnt do much just toys really, but you know i want my toys to ya know what i mean? endurance is cool and all but its like having alot of hard candy and no teeth, its pointless</div></div><hr />

I doub't there is anything I can say to prove it.  Ask a cleric about this.  I play a cleric full time (2 box a cleric and a warrior) and I have much evidence that a good Paladin will take less damage on average (over time.)  I am not saying if you parse the hits, the Paladins (when hit) take less damage or the mobs miss Paladins more.  I am saying that if they cast a stun every 10 seconds or so, they mitigate several seconds of damage (and can keep this going forever.)  This lowers the AVERAGE damage they take.  My main point is that the TIME (in seconds) between CH's is LONGER with Paladins if they cast stuns.  I am sure you can find a BAD Paladin (one that doesn't have high FT or doesn't ask for VoQ) and these bad players will take more damage.  I would suggest not playing with these type of players.</div></div><hr />

Holy Light is the bomb for clerics.  Makes the Ikkinz trials orders of magnitude easier if you have clerics with decent mana pools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  So you're saying that paladins, only if they have max FT and mana regen buffs, actually tank better than warriors? Yes, we're talking exp group here. Here's how you prove it: You take a pally into a group, and you parse how much damage he takes over time. Or have him parse it. Then you have a warrior tank the same area, and parse it. Then you compare DPS against the tank. If the DPS against the pally is less than that vs the warrior, you're right. Otherwise, you're wrong. You can even count up how much he heals himself for throughout the course of the parse, and remove that from the DPS to make things more accurate. <br />
<br />
  If you don't parse this, then you're going by &quot;I feel...&quot; which, btw, nerfs jboots every patch, and makes all sorts of weapons proc more/less.</div></div><hr />

Pallys got the nerf stick. It's called GoD. You aren't seeing a whole lot of pally tanking going on there.</div></div><hr />
