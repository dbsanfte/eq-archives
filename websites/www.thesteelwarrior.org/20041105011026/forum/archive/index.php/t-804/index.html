<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nolefear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I've got my 60 war and 52 shaman and I'm looking for a place to grind out AA's for my warrior (I dont have PoP or LoY). Are there any dungeons that are relatively safe and give a fair amount of exp compared to tier 1 PoP zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did a lot of AA's on my war and levels on my Shaman duo in Fungus Grove back before PoP. At that time it was considered one of the best exp spots in game.<br />
<br />
At Lvl 60 you can single pull the Mushrooms , and once slowed they are pretty weak so Shammy should be able to manage the heals OK. And once he gets more levels it keeps getting easier. You do want to get Disease resist up on the war to 120 or better, to avoid the shrooms slow proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can probably do enforcers/punishers camp in PoJ, exp there is insane.  Just pull the four outside the room, one at a time.  The middle two (punishers) will come together, you'll need slow to stick so you can break the spawn, after that it's cake.  I have a 58 shammy and 60 warrior combo, I can kill all four spawns, have about a two minute wait, and then the respawns start.  Better have KEI though, because the shammy is going to be doing a lot of healing until you get the bigger heal at 58.<br />
<br />
Another option is guards in Katta.  They single pull pretty easily until you go KoS on them.  At 60, some will be blue, some light, but the shammy will load up on exp.<br />
<br />
You probably know this already, but life will get a lot easier for you when the shammy hits 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Without PoP I'd recommend Chardok, once you know the place it shouldnt be too hard to get single pulls deeper down (entrance is light blue at 60 for about half the mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can do maiden eye grongas and whatever blue mobs you can find also how can you forget about sebelis? Its very empty now and xp is pretty good for pre pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've always found the exp in Maiden's Eye to be pretty poor.  Maiden's is more of a loot zone, and since it isn't a dungeon you don't get a dungeon modifier.  <br />
<br />
Chardok, Charasis, and Velk's are all better, as far as old world zones go.  Hell, I even get better exp on the platform in Scarlet Desert than in Maiden's.</div></div><hr />
