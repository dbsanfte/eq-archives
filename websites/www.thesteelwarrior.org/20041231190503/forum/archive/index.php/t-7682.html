<br />
I was wondering if any of you experienced Warriors could set down a raid roster for the raid encounters involved in our epic quest. I was recently made an officer of my guild and would love some advice on who to recrute and such. <br />

Assuming your level is a good indicator of the average level in your guild, I'd try to have two to three tanks (as some epic mobs death touch), three to four healers (with complete heal, of course), two to three enchanters (crowd control is VITAL in Plane of Fear, Plane of Hate and Chardok), and a good deal of dps (rogues, monks, berserkers, and well-geared rangers/shadowknights).<br />
<br />
 If you can field three-group raids which include the above, you should be able to take anything needed for the war epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your talking an all 65 guild then 2 reasonably equipped groups shouldnt have much of a problem.<br />
<br />
if everone is around ur level early 50s then you really looking at maybe 4 groups. also, places like fear can be hard to break and much would depend on experience. ive know raids of ele enabled people wiping in fear when they got careless.<br />
<br />
ps. whatver ur roster, u will always need rangers for the Posky and Fear DTs  :D<br />
<br />
on a more serious note, assuming ur early 50s, then you want some decent healling power, i.e. 3-4 clerics. also, good pullers, especially in places like fear and sky, are worth their weight on gold. bards for resist song help, necros for easy CRs. 2/3 tanks for cycling through mobs as someone said above. rest will be mainly dps.</div></div><hr />

how the hell do you whipe in fear with elemental guild? I broke fear with 3 toons 2 of them beeing two boxed by me and I was not in elemental gear. Did named golems with 2 and half groups 2 years ago...<br />
<br />
At any rate you shouldnt need more then 2-3 groups for any epic mobs as long as everyone 60+</div></div><hr />

Bet you didn't do it since they put in the Beastlord epic imp.  Well I suppose you could, as long as you prepped properly.  We ran into this guy by surprise the other night and it was U-G-L-Y wedon'tgotnoalibi.  I've been in on more than one single group fear break before this fella was put in.  If we got him in camp with one unprepared group, it would have been over.  So, when you go to do the golems, check the a beastlord epic walkthrough first and see what you have to do to sort this guy.  Think it was a mez he was landing on us, so pretty sure you have to duel on a dot before engaging.  <br />
<br />
In general though, I'd put it at 4 groups of level 50's, 3 of level 55's, 2-2/12 of 60's, just over a group of well equipped and AA'ed 65's for most of it.  The first time we did Severilious we had something like 30.  If I were to go after him today, it could probably be done with 3 or 4.  A number of the encounters (or getting to the encounters) have their own twists, so its not always about combat power.  Either do your homework, or try 'em out and learn.</div></div><hr />
