<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The poll's missing something. Improving taunt doesn't fix the warrior issue. if you remember, they already HAVE improved taunt, and it didn't fix the problem. The problem is bein gable to not lose aggro to begin with, just like the hybrids can, albeit to a lesser extent. The only way taunt's going to have any benefit at all is if you lose aggro. Then you mash taunt and hope for i tto work so you can a:get the aggro back, and b:indirectly generate aggro. The warrior issue is that they cannot generate their own aggro, they have to rely on aggro generating weapons, and the use of taunt to ride OTHER people's aggro. While hybrids have innate abilities to generate aggro through their spells, warriors are hamstrung with relying on other people and raid level weapons, as well as luck.<br />
<br />
There needs to be added to the poll, something like this:<br />
<br />
Give warriors an innate aggro generation ability.<br />
<br />
Something like a skill that refreshes every oh, 30 seconds or so, that generates aggro with a skill level of 1-250, as, say, 3aggro per skill point in it. At 50 skill, it does 150 aggro. 150 skill, 450 aggro. At maximum skill, it does 750 aggro. Call it &quot;Taunting Blow&quot;. So this ability scales up in levels. Explained as &quot;Since the warrior is the master of melee combat, they, after time and experience, learn how to hit the mob so as to not necessarily seriously injure the mob, to to hit it in its most painful spots, enraging the monster and causing it to attack the warrior nearly to the exclusion of all others.&quot; Just as the monk is the master of pure melee damage production, the warrior is the master of pure melee pain production.<br />
<br />
This way all warriors have the ability to generate their own aggro, enough to covers slows and debuffs, and they're not hamstrung by having to find weapons that pretty much always require a raid to get.<br />
<br />
I think this would solve the warrior aggro issue, and wouldn't be too tough to implement. I believe it's a better choice than any 3 of the options that are presently in the poll.<br />
<br />
Edit: This skill, if properly implemented, would fix the issue that EB was implemented for back in Velious as a &quot;patch fix&quot; for warrior aggro issues. This skill could well replace EB, as such EB could be changed to another effect, such as a lifetap or big DD or other effect that would be a fair replacement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Taunt/Damage DoT's<br />
+Hate on Hits / Crits / Procs<br />
New Attacks<br />
New AA skills<br />
New Class only Skills<br />
<br />
any of which do what you're suggesting, more or less.<br />
<br />
btw, I know you were just shooting out ideas but +750 free hate every 30 seconds = incredibly imbalancing. I know you weren't being specific but still, that's like an extra Bloodfrenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aye 750 makes any +hate weapon go to crap maybe like hate=skillX2 so then at 200 which would be max 400 hate still kinda overwhelming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those are just misleading, or the othersr, they're not specific enough... they really are way too vague. &quot;New Attacks, AA, Class only skills&quot; doesn't say much about what KIND of skills, or what they're supposed to acheive.<br />
<br />
I say that it needs to BE as specific as I've stated.<br />
<br />
As for it being incredibly unbalancing. No, it wouldn't, as long as it was properly implemented. If you even dropped the refresh down to 10 seconds or so, you can remove EB from the GAME, replace EB with say, a lifetap, or DD, or something. EB was a patch effort anyway that was implemented in Velious to address the warrior issue, with this skill it'd be rendered obsolete and unneeded. All that's gotta be done is to make sure that knights retain the aggro advantage with the addition of this skill.<br />
<br />
All this skill would do is take something that's entirely based on luck, as well as having raids to get, and make it innate, just like hybrids have innage aggro generation.<br />
<br />
It would also address the issue where all warriors are weak and the hybrids shine, the first 10 seconds of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">750 FREE hate every 10 seconds = better than a paladin chain stunning. Tell me that is not imbalancing. <br />
<br />
Also it's a little late to suggest another option for the poll, it's been up for close to two weeks. Yes some options are a little vague atm, there are too many ideas to specifically post each one in a poll. We wouldn't get anywhere that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i'm thinking more along the lines of 200 hate when taunt doesn't work or whatever skill cap is=+hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think so. I proc more than that with both my EB, and a pally can keep aggro off me whenever they choose for as long as they choose. Cease and Desist, gotta hate it.<br />
<br />
However, I will agree that the numbers I threw out there were jsut rough numbers. It would of course have to be balanced to make sure knights retained the aggro advantage, and I believe I mentioned that. However the base concept, I believe, is a very sound one.<br />
<br />
As for the poll being up for close to two weeks, I think tha tamybe the poll should be reposted with the removal of the least popular options, the ones that got very few votes. WE need to narrow down the list if we're to propose anything to sony that the warriotr community backs as a whole. That would be a good time to add my suggestion, and I believe it would be a very good addition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">200 hate, Dobbo, is half of ONE resisted slow (450 hate is the commonly accepted number, or about one stun, last I heard), nowhere near a single stun, or tash, or other debuff.<br />
<br />
If I can proc an EB at 700 hate and not peel it off the caster, than 200's going to be useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i was just saying i'd like to have that then No hate at all from a FAILED taunt but maybe 1.5Xskill or 2 or 4X level i don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry dude, you are seriously bullshitting me. An EB proc every 10 seconds, consistently? No way that's happening, even with dual wield.<br />
<br />
Adding more and more options to the poll = we're never gonna narrow it down and be satisfied as a community. We've got to pick *something* or a few things and stick with them, even if individuals aren't 100% satisfied with the solutions. Everyone won't be completely satisfied no matter what is proposed but if we can agree on a few fixes that will benefit the class and increase our strength in groups without totally overshadowing hybrids, we're on the right track.<br />
<br />
As much as it pains me to say this, the halfling's idea is more accurate and balanced. +300 hate *for free* every 30 seconds would own. Yes it alone is not enough to lock aggro against chain-nuking wizards but it's a sight better than what we have now. Pop that ability at the start of every fight, or better yet, pull with it, and just do what you do now (haste, proximity, reasonably good weapons), and you won't lose aggro as long as your groupmates don't go bonkers. Guaranteed. Maybe add a little extra DPS to the ability like a few others have suggested, whatever. But 750 hate every 10 seconds? That's silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, I'm not bullshitting you. That's about how much I proc with DW EB. Sometimes I get 3 procs in as many seconds, sometimes I get no procs for 30 seconds, but I think once every 10 seconds for DW EB is a decent estimate.<br />
<br />
For perhaps the third time, I'm telling you 750 hate (which is the absolutely maximum it can ever put out, I might add. is not a firm amount that I'm asking for. But 300 hate  every 10 seconds is far too low, considering how much hate the hybrids can generate, and considering how much aggro debuffs are, especially when the debuff has to be recast due to a resist. Remember also, that that 300 hate isn't even going to cover ONE slow or debuff, which would be the very point of the ability. I don't see you complaining that 700 hate is too much when the EB weapon procs.... and DW EB certainly does not proc less than once every 20 seconds, which is what that skill at 300 hate would be if converted to EB weapon procs. Remember this would be a change that would enable EB to be removed from the game entirely, as well, so it has to do just as good as a pair of EB does.<br />
<br />
I say absolute minimum per hit would have to be 450-500 hate at the top end. That still allows hybrids to generate about TWICE that.<br />
<br />
As for the fact that we'll never ALL agree on something, I agree. But we can narrow it down to something that the majority can agree on, can we not. If the Paladin community can hash out one thing to propse to devs, we can too.... althought you seem to be saying that we cannot.<br />
<br />
Remember, I'm not saying add more and more options every time they come up, I'm saying only add THIS one which I believe is the perfect solution, and which I feel would be popular. I don't see lots of other people asking for additions, in fact I don'tr see anyone. In fact if you add mine and get rid of even half of the ones presently on the poll, we're still far ahead of where we were.<br />
<br />
By the way, I asked for this option to be put on the poll to begin with before the poll itself was even posted, but it was not added for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
I tell ya what, tho, I'll parse some DW EB proc rates for ya (at least for BoC/HG) and let ya know the results, this way we both have the facts on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fine, we're gonna have to agree to disagree on EB and your specific idea, I'm not gonna argue it further.<br />
<br />
Here's the deal with the poll though. If your idea is added now, other people will complain why their ideas weren't added. Their complaints may be as valid as yours. It's not fair to add yours at this time while ignoring others. Ultimately it's not my decision, this is just how I see it. If Raaj didn't add your idea specifically, /shrug, it's his call, one I agree with.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we can't agree on an idea, or several. What I am saying is the time for ideas is over. Pick something you like best, something you feel could help fix the class, and let's run with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The present ideas in the thread aren't going to balance warriors. None of them even get close to adressing what is by far the biggest issue facing warriors today, that issue being warrior aggro generation capabilities on demand, or rather, the lack thereof. Improving taunt doesn't even cover it, because taunt's riding other people's generated aggro, it's not generating our own, which every casting class in the game can do, and only pure melee cannot. Most of the ideas in that poll, they're like the addition of /sheild, sure it looks cool or interesting, but it doesn't do much to resolve the real problem. Even the few ideas that are decent don't address warrior balance issues.<br />
<br />
Ahhh, screw it.  This poll idea... Good concept, the execution is... lacking. so far. Half the poll options are so vague as to be entirely useless, very few of the options even are in the ballpark of addressing the warrior issues, and it seems the mods/admin are artificially limiting what can be added by the fact of not allowing any ideas past a certain artificial date, no matter how good or valid they are, while on the other hand allowing any and all ideas, no matter how terrible, before that date. Imagine how the Druid peititon would have worked out had the cheal idea for druids been proposed after the date for ideas for the druids had passed....<br />
<br />
No, this is not something that this warrior will back. Judging by how few responses there are to the poll thus far, it seems that the majority of warriors don't support it anyway.<br />
<br />
No, this isn't going to accomplish anything, as artificially limited as it is. I say this is important enough to TAKE however long it takes to hash out what to propose, and that ideas should not be casually dismissed just because they happened to be past a certain artificial date.<br />
<br />
Ahhh, we'll see. Raaj has made a comment about clarifying the topics with the highest votes, so perhaps something decent might come out of it. I sure hope it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They are vague for a reason, but no matter how many times I say that you just will not listen. How hard is it to comprehend that if we had exact ideas from all over the board, there would be unlimited posts all with zero thought put into them. It's much more effective to concentrate on a few areas than to spread ourselves thin over 2 dozen different options.<br />
<br />
I had a post up for submitting ideas for a month. All ideas that were posted which did not already fall under another category were listed. <br />
<br />
Since it seems to me you believe you have a marvelous idea which will revolutionize the way Warriors work in eq, I invite you to do it yourself - honestly. I made this forum for a reason, and i'm simply going off what people are asking for. Nothing is stopping you, but this is getting to be silly. Not once have I said no ideas will be posted - why do you think I've left this forum open for posting? By all means, post anything you want. But for the poll we have up right now I am not adding anymore options. It is too late for that. However, on any future polls I'll simply add an &quot;other&quot; option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ah, Raaj, you've never spoken to me directly about this poll  at any time before just now, so I don't know what you're talking about when you say that no matter how many times you say they're vague for a reason, I don't listen. for the simple fact, you've never told me this before just now.<br />
<br />
By the way, I *DID* offer this exact idea for you to include in the poll. It was on put on your pre-poll post list as &quot;Warrior +hate ability (skill?), short refresh&quot;, but you didn't put it on the final poll, and I don't know why.<br />
<br />
So, this has been around for the poll since before there even was a poll. You just decided not to put it *on* the poll for some reason. Maybe you felt that just saying &quot;add warrior skills&quot; would be good enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warrior +hate ability (skill?), short refresh<br />
<br />
New Class only Skills<br />
<br />
I felt it fell under right there, along with a half dozen others. A few of the ones on the poll are specific simply because they were a little harder to place or because they were backed by a huge amount of people (Furor's taunt dot for instance).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">that's about what I thought.<br />
<br />
That's too vague to gain any kind of support... yes, I know you say it's vague for a reason.<br />
<br />
however in this case, when a vague statement such as that is propsed that has no clear purpose or direction, not very many people are going to vote for it. &quot;new skills&quot; could just as easily mean something like a new and improved, warrior only, bind wound type ability (which noone would care about in the context of warrior balance) as a +aggro skill (which many people would care about).<br />
<br />
Your two dozen different ideas spreading everyone out point is easily adressed by having several rounds of voting, each time removing the least popular half of the ideas. Only two rounds of that would remove 3 out of 4 ideas.</div></div><hr />
