<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, i'm a 55 warrior on Druzzil Ro and i'm in the guild Explorer's Unity. We are not a very big guild(not alot of raids) but the majority of us including myself are between 50 and 60. we have no one over 60 as of present. I, like most other warriors, are a little short on cash these days so i basically need to earn my armor :eek:  My guild is not a raiding guild as i said but i have a lot of friends there and i'm an officer :D  what i want to know is how i can upgrade my stuff without buying most of it here's my magelo take a look and try not to scream in horror at my equipment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kael Arena or Plate Cycle will solve many of your upgrades. The biggest area for improvement I see for you is HP. If you can get some cash together (I know I know :p) you could probably solve a lot of problems by getting some cultural stuff smithed (I forget what the E.Marr imbued stuff is called).<br />
<br />
Another area you could look into is doing named mobs in the LoY zones, some of whom drop very decent items. Some of these encounters are one groupable, other require a small raid. Look up the nameds on Allak's- you'll see some decent loot tables for the level of the encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestions-<br />
<br />
Face: Crystal spiders eyes, you can camp them in Velk's<br />
Ear: Replace that jasper earring with another orc fang or, ideally, a black electrum sapphire earring (2ac 35hp)<br />
Neck: if you are looking to add more hitpoints, you could try swapping that GMT to a clattering bone necklace (drops in the grey, I believe) or buy a fine heraldic gorget (14ac, 5agi, 25hp/mana, basically the same as the one I wear, but no wis)<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'd keep chugging away in KD and hope for corroded drops.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are ally to dragons, you could do the draconic pauldrons and bracers of benevolence quests.  If not, keep hammering kael until you are.  <br />
<br />
Scrape together around 5k and get an earring of the solstice.  <br />
<br />
Shrouded Medallion is another option for neck.  It drops off of the robes in ME.  While you are there, Vah Shir Claw Earring drops off of the 4-arms.<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes drops in Velks or if you are feeling lucky you can do the Eyepatch of Plunder quest.<br />
<br />
I'd snag 10lb Halas Pies and Grobb Liquisified Meat for stat foods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today we were exploring Veksar with a group of guildies, if you know the place, I'll describe the location... its near the golem area, before you get there, theres a pool, kinda big, with a few mobs inside, EVEN before getting there, you have to swim thru an underwater tunnel, right? Ok, you come out of water, turn right and theres a room with a few rotting peasants and 'an animist' which is the PH of a Lord Somethingie. (This is before getting to golem area). So we killed animist and kept going, druid tracked a named spawn and we came back and found this Lord in the place of the animist, and dropped:<br />
<br />
Kylong Shinguards (Leg slot)   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +35 <br />
Sta: +4 <br />
Wis: +6 <br />
Int: +6 <br />
HP: +45  <br />
All plate classes<br />
<br />
He was DB to 61, we killed him with a CHing druid, necro, another war and a mage, he dropped kinda fast, so I assume he was around lvl55. Awesome legs for a single groupable spawn while you are lurking around and exploring.<br />
Like everyone said, stay in Kael. The Draconic shoulders quest is easy if your CoV faction is good (15ac 12str 12sta 6SvC/F).<br />
I wouldnt get Erolisi armor, like Mithaniel (my god), the imbued version adds stats that are not useful for a warrior, so you might as well just buy the Agnostic version (Fine Heraldic). The neck is a good choice, also you can buy shoulders (20ac 5dex 30hp) if you dont feel like questing (The neck is not really expensive but the shoulders might be).<br />
Theres a cloak that drops in Torgidan's mines, Steel Mesh Cloak, 12ac 10sta 12str and other stats, its off a named mob in a circular cave, cant remember the name but try and look up nameds in Alla and their loots :)<br />
If you and your friends hit UP sometime, maybe as a guild raid, you might get lucky with a Raldukan Helm (26ac 4sta 4str 35hp and resists) or a Bracelet of Fortitude (12ac 15sta 6SvAll).<br />
Hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />

They are also nice for sellables. Here is what I found to be somewhat comprable to the Helm of Raldukan.<br />
<br />
Dented Kunzar War Helm<br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +23 <br />
Sta: +8 <br />
Fire Resist: +8 <br />

HP: +35 <br />
Mana: +25  <br />
Weight: 2.4 <br />

Hierophant Vradik drops it and we took him easily with a single group - 61 Druid, 60 Ranger, 60 Rogue, 59 Cleric, 57 Warrior, and 47 Beastlord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a group to the Hole and get imbued granite spaulders.<br />
<br />
Take a group to PoJ and do enforcers for a while.  No equipment drops to speak of, but at your level it's a super exp camp and you can all make a decent amount of plat there (say around 1K an hour for the whole group).</div></div><hr />
