<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You dont need to be flagged by trials in PoJ to do the quest, right now, Im not flagged in PoJ and I was flagged by quest for Tactics.<br />
<br />
Ive seen the Armsman in one place. You go up the stairs as you zone in, you keep going and get to the pit (but dont drop), turn left and keep going, you will get to a room with 2 entrances and an arena in the middle (kiting room). The Diaku Armsman has spawned for us outside those entraces (not inside the room, the room is safe).<br />
<br />
And the zonein is in the circle of stones to PoV/ HoH, etc. Its the first one starting from the right, with a telescope and a compass (or sorta looks like it) drawing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hinvat, Shadow Master, and Anvil can spawn all over the place.  Seen em on the way to TZ, VZ, and RZ, I beleive they spawn in the paths to those mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can anyone clarify more where Overseer, Supplier, and Armorer spawn? Do the directions to them (lower hallways/rooms attached to arena) apply to the Armsman also?<br />
<br />
How would you group the named as far as difficulty goes?<br />
<br />
I forgot to put the levels of the mobs in parenthesis, I'll do that in a few hours when I have more time (on lunch break atm)<br />
<br />
Thanks Crystara and Edone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im not sure about Armorer, maybe Im making a mistake here but I *think* it can spawn of any mob (not in pit tho). Again, Im not sure about this, if someone knows might want to correct me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As Crystara said, I believe that Hinvat, Vinta and Anival can spawn in any spot that a yellow/red ogre spawns.  I've never seen any of them spawn in the same place twice.<br />
<br />
As for the armorer, I always thought he only spawned in the room behind the door on the right beyond the cafeteria... but then last time we were looking for him, he spawned in the kitchen instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sass, do you mean yellow/red con? to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does this map look right so far?<br />
http://www.dragonmaw.org/modules.php?mop=modload&amp;name=Upload&amp;file=index&amp;op=getit&amp;fid=39<br />
<br />
Is Vallon or Tallon at the top-right corner of the map?<br />
What is down that hall in the right-middle? &quot;RZ triggers&quot;?<br />
Is the brownish spot in the middle the Pit?<br />
What spawns in the darker-gray area at the bottom-left of the map, 2 1/4 squares up from the bottom?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your link sends to a restricted area.<br />
<br />
Hinvat can spawn pretty much anywhere in the path to RZ trigger.  If you go to the top of the pit (and don't jump down), then go west is the RZ corridor.<br />
Vinta can spawn in pretty much any spot on the south corridor near the zone in.<br />
Same for Anival, but north corridor.<br />
Since I can't see your map, I'll refer to the EQAtlas map.<br />
Armorer, Overseer, Glykus, Supplier all spawn in the Basement / Pit map.<br />
Glykus is at the very end of the south path, which is shown as grey instead of the same color as the rest.<br />
Out from the pit you have North Hall and South Hall.  Inbetween those two, on the west side and not the pit side, there is a tiny room, that connects to a larger room to the north.  The small room is where Overseer spawns.<br />
The room north of the pit, where you have to go out through north hall, go north, then turn right is the dining room.  In there both Supplier and Armorer can spawn in one spot just north of the doorway at a table.<br />
Looking at the map, there is a place with lava.  South of that there is a four way intersection.  The room west of that has the other Supplier spawn.  If you go east, then turn north immediately when you can, is where the other Armorer spawn is.<br />
Tagrin spawns in the room north of the lava.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A War Boar and Daiku Armsman are not named mobs. They may drop some decent bazaar loot but they are not &quot;named&quot; in the traditional sense.<br />
<br />
Also, The Daiku Overseer AE Rampages and quads. Can hit for 1100 if not defensive, per hit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh, I had kinda forgot about this..<br />
<br />
I made a map. Waiting for guild webmaster to reply to my post because the way NukePHP does uploading is kinda weird and I can't figure out the URL of the map.<br />
<br />
All I can use now is some PH info (noted on first post) and where Tagrin Maldric spawns.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Not sure if unregistered users can view posts.. but you may be able to see the map here (http://www.dragonmaw.org/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=135) until I figure out the real URL (can do linking within the website with the weird URL but need to change to link from outside).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i dont really know how to explain these locations with out pointing them out on a map, but here we go...<br />
tagrin can be found in teh forge area behind the huge doors, if your looking at the EQ-toolbox maps its the top left corner. Armorer spawns in *suprise* the armery room, it's very hard to mistake this room as it has *double suprise* alot of armor in it, if you were on your way to the forge, it would be the last room on the right before you got there, right behind the doors. the supplier would be the room directly across, with *yet another suprise* the supply boxxes all over the place. tagrin is one of those mobs that's eithe up or not, i dont believe he has a PH. the supplier and armorer usually have their spots taken up by the every day, A-typical orge you usually see standing around. when you open the door to the armery room the mob directly across from you should be the armorer PH. as for the suplier, when you enter his room, his PH is the last mob on the left in the small aclove infront of the giant spiked chest.<br />
and jic some one didnt mention it before me, when you zone in and your standing at the stairs, VZ is the path on the right, TZ is on the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Map added :)<br />
<br />
Please let me know of any errors. Need to know where Tagrin spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tagrin spawns in the room with the lava tunnle<br />
<br />
i dont belive any of the mobs that drop the BP/Tunic pattern have placeholders(ie: over seerer and glykus, as they are on a timer...but not positive.  i know i watched OS and tagrin spawn while no one was killing in their room)<br />
<br />
i've been told hte PHer for enraged boar is a frienzied initiat&lt;sp&gt;.  no confirmation tho<br />
<br />
armor/supplier are random mobs(ie: death kinght, warrior, scout, oracle)  just what ever spawns in their spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Anyone know &quot;a War Boar&quot; or &quot;an Enraged War Boar&quot;s spawn time or PH?<br />
What is Overseer, Tagrin, and Glykus' spawn time?<br />
Does Zerlin randomly spawn in place of war wraiths or on a timer?<br />
Anival, Hinvat, and Vinta are completely random?<br />
What is respawn on Rallos, Tallon, and Vallon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">a war boar is a random trash mob that can drop the highly polished gem and specs<br />
<br />
enraged war boar: frienzied initiate&lt;sp&gt; is PH i've been told(no conformation) and i've been told he only spawns 2x a day<br />
<br />
OS, Tagrin and Glykus are both 1day spawn i belive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Originally posted by GorfinML <br />

 <br />
<br />
War boar does not drop the gems. The gems drop off any random Daiku. The boars drop the gold tipped boar horn which is used in the Cloak of Greater Pernicity (sp?) quest. <br />
<br />
I have experienced that any mob in tactics can drop specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Updated, thanks guys.<br />
Need Vallon/Tallon/Rallos spawn info.<br />
Also could use a little more specifics on OS/Tagrin/Glykus - do they spawn 24 hours after last death or the same time every day?<br />
How often do Armorer/Supplier spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">you may attach pictures up to a certain size on the battlefield. Tallon spawns in South wing at the end, 3days probably, Vallon north. RZ script is 2days and is started by killing Decorin Berik - Decorin Lieutenant - TZ - VZ - Mini RZ on the upper floor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks, Mini RZ=Hinvat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well I guess this is complete now. Library-away!<br />
<br />
When it is moved, please change the title - delete the (need input). I can change it on the title you see once you load the thread but not the one visibile when you're in the Battlefield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zebedi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It has been my experience that the Diaku supplier ONLY spawns in the southernmost of the 3 spawns in his room, and the armorer ONLY in the northernmost spawn of his room.</div></div><hr />
