My friends and I finally got this monkey off our back for the first time yesterday after many failed attempts.<br />
<br />
It was probably unecessarily difficult for us since we play eq very specifically.  No guilds, I two box a warrior and a cleric, another friend two boxes a necro and a chanter, and we have two other friends,  a mage and a shaman.  So right off the bat we arent as good as a real 6 person group due to slower reaction time, all that stuff.  But it' always been fun to see what we can accomplish together, the tipt trial was by far the toughest.  The trash mobs alone laugh at my pansy AC, and jhiru just didnt seem tankable by my warrior, period.   But due to Sony's infinite wisdom, our vastly overpowered charmed pet (after wiping our group a few times) took out Jhiru a few seconds after my warrior died.<br />
<br />
After parsing, it seems I need to talk to shammy boy.  Malos + slow + 2 dots, then start healing?  No wonder I was in freeport :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious worked fine, and I did hit defensive afterwards.  <br />
<br />
Parse shows that after ~12 seconds in defensive I got the 'You think me stupid, ? I won't waste my time trying to batter down your defenses. . .I will feast on your friends instead!' emote.  He still fought my warrior though, most likely because of frenzy health range though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that's why, don't defensive. only furious should be enough, or he will rape your group, then rape you. As long as he is slowed, cleric blasts should keep a sturdy tank up, if not, secondary blasts, as you said, shaman ones, should keep you up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh... cleric heals might keep you up if he's thoroughly dispelled and also slowed by the time Furious wears off, but I wouldn't count on it.  At about 9k hit points and roughly 1700 AC, I went down so fast it was stupid the moment Furious wore off.  I lasted a good 5-6 seconds.  I think our initial annul missed his haste.  He was slowed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizef</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He has 70% haste on that will still be on after slow. You have to pull with dispell. I learned this the hard way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His enchanter buffed haste won't do anything if he's shaman / enc / bard / weapon proc slowed, they do not actively stack. Unslowed tho, yes, he is rather mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm so which is it?  Was stated in another post that PC and NPC spell haste/slow stack differently with PC being slowed haste is overwritten but NPC is haste % + slow %= new %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slowing a hasted mob nets you a slowed hasted mob. You can dispell the haste though. Dispelling many GoD mobs on incomming removes thier haste and makes the encounter much easier. Have the druids atk debuff and it only gets easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as i've farmed him like 15 times at least I never noticed a difference between dispell + slowed, and undispelled + slowed. Have always believed it to follow pc rules, but npc's cheat on many things so I guess this could be another. So much stuff in this game that has no explanation, on both sides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well ok, an idea that came to me although I've never done GoD trials...<br />
<br />
Why not hit defensive, and the moment he lunges for a grpmate, click defensive off and AEtaunt? (AEramp first for chance at an additional insta proc ! &lt;3 )</div></div><hr />

I tried that once with evasive on DD in ikkinz1 and the mob didn't jump back on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That exactly happened to me. Before we engage DD, the chanter told me: &quot;Go Riposte only, dont go defensive, if you have any offensive disc go for it&quot;<br />
Then I tought he told me that because we needed all DPS in that fight, so after Furious I went Stonewall.........I am not kidding here, my Bloodfrenzy did proc at least 2-3 times while I was using furious (note that ripostes dont proc) and right when I hit Stonewall disc the mob summoned the cleric. After that I kind realized that there are some mobs in GoD where its better not to use defensive. Both Tipt named and DD Ikkinz1 can be done with 2 healers (cleric + druid is what we had), so dont even bother using Defensive discs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think you're better off starting fights like Jhiru with riposte and your hate procing 1 handers or riposte and a big heavy hitting 2 hander?  I just hate the time lost swapping the weapons back to 1 handers after riposte wears off, but maybe the extra hard riposte hits would be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinterdir</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use 2H throughout the fight to avoid riposts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weaponshield!Best way to tank Jhiru by far. You get 24 seconds to slow/kill him. If you have a pet, he will die before WS wears off. If you don't have a pet, hit AET+Furious just as WS faded and finish him off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm... when i got tipt flagged we had a pet and Jhiru was not dead when WS wore off.  I AE taunted and went furious.  Furious wore off. Jhiru still not dead.  Pet still on him.  I died 5-6 seconds later and half a second after that, Jhiru dropped.  Without the pet we never would have made it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After going back through my logs, it's just simply a miracle that my group beat Jhiru.  Well not really, gg overpowered charmie.<br />
<br />
Our fight lasted an agonizing 51 seconds.  I dropped over dead at 41 seconds, and Jhiru then went on a 10 second rampage killing the rest of the group,  yay necro lifeburn to finish him.<br />
<br />
Why did it last so long?  After parsing and talking to my friends, it turns out that not one single DD or dot landed.  It appears that the shaman got trigger happy and malos'd while enchanter was recanting, and the mage malosinid his own pet instead of Jhiru, and no one noticed it.  Tash being our only debuff, nothing else stuck.  <br />
<br />
Next time it should go a ton smoother, and I hope to cut that teeeeeeerrible 51 seconds way down.</div></div><hr />

Pet probably wasn't hasted...that adds a ton of DPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it comes down to the non-pet DPS.  My group always used WS followed by furious, and Jhiru would usually die within 10 seconds of furious dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanok</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget mage weapons on the pet as well.  In my experience he dies MUCH faster if the pet has weapons.  Have only beat it 3 times when I was tanking.  First time we had a hasted pet w/o weapons, ranger WS'd, I furioused, and he died a few seconds after furious ended.  Second time was the same setup, except the pet had weapons.  Result was, Jhiru dead about 2s after I hit furious.  Third time instead of a ranger, we had a second enchanter...  Both pets had weapons and haste.  I hit furious on the pull, Jhiru died 2-3s after furious ended.  Max 15s fight.</div></div><hr />
