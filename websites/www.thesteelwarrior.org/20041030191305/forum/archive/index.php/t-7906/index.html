<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>max</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted on my guilds web site about using the GSoT when i turned 55. I asked if when I turned lvl 55 and weilded the GSoT with the yek or anger III aug would this be a weapon that I could use till higher tiers zones. The reply was, by 65 wars with 200plus AA, that if they caught anyone using the GSoT that they would pk thier face off.<br />
<br />
 Is this such a bad weapon? On my server they go for 250pp in the bazaar. Now dont get me wrong, I do have access and the cash to purchase good proccing 1hnd weapons for this alt. Would the velium gemmed warhammer be a better weapon with a aug proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alot of people claim this is a good weapon, I'm not sure why.  Personally, I think it sucks ass, but thats MY opinion.<br />
<br />
Almost ANY weapon is better whan a proc added to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">good weapon, but has much stigma associated with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good weapon indeed for low end PoP tanking. Add an anger2 proc on it and you can use it for quite some time. With augment recycling coming in soon you dont have to worry about wasting Anger2 either when you move on to a better weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bought one  in the bazaar before I could equip it. <br />
<br />
Then I carried it in inventory so that I could do so as soon as I dinged.<br />
<br />
Then I whipped it out to wield as soon as I heard that lovely ding from the computer's speakers ....<br />
<br />
Now it sits in my bag unused because I've got better, but WOW what a charge when you get to pick it up and swing. And seeing that message is awesome! (&quot;AssholeBoy's face contorts with rage.&quot;)<br />
<br />
For me the Greatstaff of Thunder remains a symbol of when you really start to shine as the premiere tank of EQ. That's about the same time you get defensive, and your kick starts to land for a stun. And you can equip a weapon with an awesome ratio that procs hate! I am WARRIOR, see me tank!<br />
<br />
I'll never sell mine or tribute it. <br />
I love the damn thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Good&quot; is all relative to the level of the game you and your friends are playing. The GSoT is a &quot;good&quot; weapon for Tier 1-2 pop tanking. It is better when augmented  with Anger 3. And like all proccing weapons, it becomes even better with WA.<br />
<br />
I recommend putting Anger 3 on your GSoT if you have one. If you find it is not enough aggro, then dual wield 2 proccing weapon and add the Anger 3 to the your mainhand and eventually your offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is one of the best 2 handers there are aggro wise.<br />
The biggest perception with it is 50PP weapon must = suck.<br />
That and a good dual wield setup is superior.<br />
<br />
But if you really want a 2 handed weapon for situational tanking, its kinda hard to beat the GSoT<br />
<br />
EDIT: As for auging it.<br />
You can Anger II the weapon if you want to, but you can get just as much aggro plus DPS at a cheaper LDoN point cost with a Yak aug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i paid 40kpp for mine and thought at that time i got a bargain, so the fact that its 250pp now just makes it an unbelieveable bargain, and no reflection whatsoever on its usefullness. <br />
<br />
When i transferred servers to join a time enabled guild, i used it to MT some of the ele raids and didnt have any serious problems.<br />
<br />
If your stuck for decent options, stick a anger 2/3 on it and ur really set for some time to come. and the beauty of the fact that u can now remove augments means u can just transfer that to your next upgrade and in the meantime, a anger auged GSoT will serve its purpose beautifully. And all for the bargain price of 250pp.<br />
<br />
Anyone who says it serves no purpose for a 65 warrior with 200 aa etc etc has no idea wtf they are talking about.  The only upgrades to the GSoT will either be a decent DW setup like a GBoS/BoC/BF etc,  or the ele/raid enabled 2 handers like a BBB, SEWS etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dual wield in normal ldons, use the GSoT for BoT (and similar areas).<br />
<br />
250pp is a bargain for any weapon used at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The reason you see folks like Wandor and Haass pretty consistently maintaining that DW &gt; 2H has to do with maximum aggro generation. To generate maximum hate you need to generate maximum procs and to generate maximum procs you need the maximum number of proc &quot;slots&quot; and to get the maximum number of proc slots you are looking at two 1-hand weapons.<br />
Probably the reason your guild is leery of the GSoT being used for &quot; a long time&quot; at lvl 65 is that as various classes get AAs &amp; better gear their ability to ramp up damage (and generally, the hate they generate) accelerates. The damage/hate that the *other* people in your group can generate is what makes a GSoT in the hands of a lvl 58 or 59 warrior a much better weapon than the same GSoT in the hands of a 200 AA warrior who is grouped with similarly advanced necros, wizards, rangers etc.<br />
But: the GSoT is a very very nice weapon when you can start using it, and for sometime after that. It has a very nice aggro:cost ratio, and that's not insignificant for most 55+ warriors, who in fact need to upgrade all kinds of gear seemingly all at once. This weapon gives you some breathing room in the 2H category for a while.<br />
You can tank with this thing for a good while if you know how to tank. All of the strikingly poor tanks I've seen were poor because of what was going on between their ears, not because of the weapons they held.<br />
It's hard to see why most warriors wouldn't want to have this weapon when they reach the lvl they can use it. Before the GSoT becomes a liability, you'll have access to better weapons. Before your casters start getting dead on a regular basis, you should be able to sense when the GSoT's aggro protential is losing ground to your groupmates' ability to unload on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>max</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Great information guys . Thank you again. The knowledge and experience of the posters here are of great importance.<br />
<br />
 Again thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/rude SoE for taking a nice tanking 2hander and giving it such a shit graphic and animation that hordes of people just refuse to use it. That rhino dick framed in a X-mas wreath look is just tragic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's a damn fine weapon and it will work wonders ... especially with a good anger augment.  It can easily last you all the way till time with anger3 if nothing better presents itself.  People have done more with less.<br />
<br />
The problem lies in its cheap-ass price ... therefore people associate the weapon with newbs who cant afford better.  The weapon used to go for 40k+ and for damn good reasons.  It's a fine weapon .. and at 50-250pp you wont find a better bargain ever.<br />
<br />
Stick with the GSoT imo and save your money for armor upgrades.  It's on par with the droga combo ... some say its better (me) .. others maintain it isnt quite as good due to 1 less proc per minute (/shrug).  I kept and used mine till i scored my GBoS and BoC.<br />
<br />
Anyone who says it is ass for aggro honestly hasnt used one for any significant amount of time.  Sadly, wielding it has become a negative status symbol ... and for all the wrong reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd like to add some reasoning why I still use the GSoT, as the same reasons may apply to you at some point.<br />
<br />
First, I cant buy pricey stuff (10k+), and my opportunities to get upgradeable weapons are infrequent (due to mostly raid drop chances).<br />
<br />
Also, since I'm usually 3rd at best in the tanking order for my guild, and the 'chore' of doing all defensive aa's first... I spent some aa's in offensive abilities to make me more dps capable on raids.<br />
<br />
Ferocity, Weapon Affinity, Punishing Blade, Tactical Mastery ... these have helped with better procs, not to mention more/better swings in general (which is the basis for aggro generation, to the best of my understanding).<br />
<br />
I've been building my aa's more so defensively over time, but I have personally found it more comfortable to avoid excessive ripostes with the 2H, provide better dps on raids, than dual wielding.<br />
<br />
Even within my own guild I see that I'm one of the few (if not the only warrior) that leans on the 2H for tanking (or offtanking on raids, depending on mob).<br />
<br />
It is all situational and depends on preference. Find out what works best for you.<br />
<br />
Cookie cutter warriors are lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well I found that WMBS (which is a mere 120+ times more expensive) holds agro as well as GSoT, but there is no reason that you should not use this excellent weapon until you get the droga pair (or better) weapons for agro. <br />
<br />
Its not a weapon you will use forever, but while it is good, its very good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use a dual-wield Anger Aug-ed SoD/BoC combo for day to day stuff.  Great aggro.  The GSoT is, not surprisingly, a step down from this for sure.  The guild has been getting into PoP stuff lately and I've been checking out a decent 2hd-er to use where riposte is actually an issue (15% rule).  This appears to be one of the better ones to use, short of getting to RallosZek.  If your guild is raiding SSra, there is a drop off of the High Priest that could be of interest, as well, Anathema from Inny up in Hate.  Other than those two (and I'm not even sure how they compare to the GSoT... they're just candidates if you see what I mean) word round the campfire is that you won't do better for 2h-er aggro until you get a crack at the BoW off of RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That rhino dick framed in a X-mas wreath look is just tragic. <br />
<br />
Heh good description!<br />
<br />
GSoT is a good entry level agro weapon for folks who like 2 handing for varying reasons (or just can't afford a decent 4x EB/stun setup such as Droga etc all).  Its not the best thing in the world but nor does &quot;it suck&quot;.  And for its current price its an absolute bargain.  Remember folks some of the normal folks scrap for pp and/or ldon points for augs.  This is a fine weapon for them to work with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jamylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Funny story about the GSoT the other day. My guild was raiding PoFire doing the birds, Babs, etc. I was rather far down in the tank order so to finally max my 2hb skill, I whipped out my GSoT. Well anyhow, a little while after I put it on, I get some tells from casters asking me what weapon I was using. Apparently in the nukers channel they were discussing my weapon and wanted to know what it was. So I sent them a link, and asked one of them why they were wondering what I was using (expecting the answer of why are you using something that looks like a caster item or something of that sort). He replies and says he just thought it looked badass. <br />
<br />
But then again, I don't see very many people on my server using them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It really is the ugliest weapon in the game, but works great if you can't afford a good DW combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i always kinda liked the way it looked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I pulled mine out and used it a bit last night, out of nostalgia.<br />

Has to be the only reason it doesn't fall apart after one hit on the mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have played sound off for years...it makes a special sound????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yes, Flair --<br />
<br />
You know the sound a toilet plunger makes when you push down?<br />
<br />
That's the sound I hear when swinging the GSoT. It's a little higher pitched, but it's quite distinctive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It is one of the best 2 handers there are aggro wise.<br />

<br />
/Agree  for the money you can't beat it for a 2h blunt.  And adding a proc to a weapon that's procless seems like a waste to me.  The GSoT has a nice stun and ratio and with the addition of another proc will hold aggro fine if you group allows you to.  A bad group will steal aggro no matter what you're swinging.  I would stay away from Anger 2.  I bought it for my sotbs and regret it.  It was 510 pts and only 400 to hate.  I believe the yak aug is also 510 and the stun = 450 to hate plus a 75 DD ( or 125 DD for the 760 one?)  Either way the yak aug will give you more aggro plus dps and a stun ( if not resisted)<br />
<br />
I got one for 100 plat before I was 55 and when I dinged 55 in PoD I started using it.  It didn't hold aggro as well as the droga combo, but it's great for building 2H blunt.  <br />
