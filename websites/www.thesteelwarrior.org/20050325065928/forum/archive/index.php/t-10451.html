This is for every warrior who has time and time again pleaded on the forums with great suggestions about how to fix the class and make a warrior a WARRior again and for those who want to see some results.<br />
<br />
So come on down to the Argent Dawn server at 7pm pacific and create your very own gnome warrior too show your support. Many fun events will be happening so don't miss it. Whether you are a warrior yourself or just want to support your fellow warrior friends, this is for YOU!<br />
<br />
My responce:<br />
<br />
We have already gotten a responce. What is the point of this protest?<br />
<br />
Trust me if it uis justifited I will throw down with the rest of you, but in this case its not. We already have a dev responce--about 72 hours ago, just how fast do you expect their ideas about rebalancing to gel?<br />
<br />
Not to mention with number of responces, just being there in an organized fashion has a very good chance of lagging the server and disrupting others game play. I garentee you that will earn a responce. But not the one you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Having gotten &quot;attention&quot; this is neither the time or the place for this action to happen. And if the devs do cave, I am outta here. WOW will be one unending disaster as it panders to anyone who can get 500 responces on a thread.<br />
<br />
Looking briefly over the thread they have no specific demands. Hopefully the smart warriors will start leaving the Blizzard board and coming here....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think some of them really want to ruin anyones fun. all though i do think they want to bitch and moan. I play a warrior, went to the forums, saw the many of the post and decided I want to see how this works out. I will not go to any of the highly populated servers. It is irresponsible to intentionally or knowingly crash a server. However, it could be a really fun and interesting to have people do something like this if it doesn't end up hurting anyone else. Maybe its just me, but I think a horde of gnomes gathering together training is funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Becuase most other classes can solo two +2s and the like. We level slower and harder. Most other classes take can take even con elites (at least if the class is well played). I think all other classes have a way to escape a bad situation. <br />
<br />
I am not sure I could define it more precisely than that, but I can tell you, for example, that over half the warriors in my guild have switch classes and mains. Our talents are considered underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I'm sure it'll be an interesting sight to see.  I'm also sure its an exercise in futility.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is gonna take all the time they feel they need to address any class balance issues that need addressing, as they ought to be doing.  Congregating every warrior who feels slighted on one server in one spot will do nothing but cause that server horrible lag, annoy the players on that server, and probably get some folks banned for a while.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if Blizzard was stating they are leaving warriors excatly the way they are I would have a lil understanding.  Fact is, they have stated on numerous occasions that the warrior class is being reviewed by the dev team.  People want some kind of admission that the class is broken (even when clearly it is far from broken).<br />
<br />
Warriors are a touch underpowered if anything.  That makes them harder to play than other classes.  But this aint like the pre-Incite PoP days in EQ when warriors really could not accomplish anything.  In WoW they still have lots to do, even if its not the way the player thought they would be playing the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A protest against a protest? :P<br />
<br />
I have been following the blizzard forums to find out whats really wrong with warriors. Only some people have been able to describe the problem. Mainly, our abilities do not scale to level. Not one of them. You have to see how powerful ALL other classes become at very high level. You have to see their talents and how effective their abilities are then compare those to our own before you comment on this. Our abilities and talents just do not scale with level. Then your rage never goes above 100 wether you'r level 1 or 60, you have 100 rage max. While other classes utilize huge mana pools.<br />
<br />
It also includes some of our talents being not worth the talent points. Take Thunderclap for example. How much AE damage does it do and what is its use? It slows AE for 10% which will remain the same, and its damage at high levels is what 35? Whats the point of improving this Thunderclap damage through talents, seriously? Two handed weapon spec (arms) increase damage dealt by 2handers for 1%. More talents like these. Look how feeble is Revenge. Improved heroic strike, save 1 rage point. If you switch stances (which is like breathing in a pvp scenario), you lose all your rage unless you have TM that saves 25 rage. It severely hinders us, and what for? What purpose does it serve? Why nerf a class so much that always had the honor of being the weakest and most neglected in previous MMORPG's. Besides, it was clearly stated by Blizzard that a warrior will be &quot;a damage dealing powerhouse&quot;. They should deliver that. Seriously, whats the use of Mortal Strike now except a very costy debuff that you use against healers. <br />
<br />
These were some of the questions put forward on the blizzard forum. Miss rates at level 55+ or so. Maybe in instances facing much higher level creatures. Not much idea about that.<br />
<br />
The domestic problems these protests are facing are. (A) People haven't experienced the end game and start to differ with high enders foolishly. Ofcourse warriors are great in pvp at level 35, esp if you have heal potions. (B) EQ warriors are too used to playing a pathetic warrior, even this nerfed wow version makes em feel high and mighty so they start thinking there's nothing wrong. Hopefully the devs can see past this.<br />

Ability scaling, and ability damage/powers are really the problem with warriors.  If they uptuned that, and tweaked the miss rate a little we'd probably be golden.  The way we are makes us wimpy in PvE and PvP, but it hardly makes for the broken useless class that WoW board pretends we are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree...95%. I only disagree with the word &quot;pretend.&quot; I think it is more like they &quot;preceive&quot; it to be a broken class. As a warrior at currently lvl 21, i do feel inferior to many other classes. I get a chubby when ever a Paladin decides to join my group. However, I do not think it is broken. The above suggestions seem reasonable. As mentioned earlier, though, Blizzard has a priority with the servers issues. I will not abandoned my warrior, and will level him with the faith that Blizzard will tweek the class appropriatly.<br />
<br />
I'm still going to check out the protest though. Oh my god, 20-30 or more gnomes training would be so funny. I think a well planned protest adds depth to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seb I suggest, strongly, that you stay way from the server. AD is a heavy population server with lag issues around the AH. And its an RP server. Tempers are going to be very short. Additionally there are already 2 other events planned  for the server (run by the server community).<br />
<br />
Tempers are going to be short, the queue to get on long and fun it will not be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SebastianDesoto</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, i do not plan to go to AD. There is an alternative server, bloodscalp. It is a PvP, low pop server. this was brought up by one of the original posters. There is actually a split in the protestors community. One want to gain attention by going to a populated server, the other just want to organize. I for one, respect the server fragility issue and will not participate in any thing that will bring headache to others. I think it should be the other way around. People shlould see an ingame protest and think, &quot;OMG, this game really does have a sense of community. thats cool.&quot; Out of players concerns, i have posted on multiple threads, multiple times on the main forums that people should NOT go to AD, but to Bloodscalp. If you can think of any reason this is a bad idea, other than calling it a stupid idea all together, please advise.<br />
<br />
By the way, my main objective is to see how this thing actually works out. It goes beyond the concerns of the warriors. Its about community. I will take screenshots if anyone is interested to see them. I won't know if it really is any good until it happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boy-</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The current issue with warriors it that it requires more than half a brain cell to keep aggro on multiple mobs.  Since a majority of wow.com posters have a bit less than half a braincell, they perceive the class to be totally broken.  This is fairly unfortunate, since most of the warriors are now spending their time bitching about their perceived brokenness instead of learning their own class.<br />
<br />
Ask warriors with clues at the high end, and they'll mostly agree that warrior is a *tad* underpowered, but can pretty much do their job quite well if you pay attention while playing instead of watching tv.  However when your entire forums consists of retards who can't play their class, that tends to drown out say, any intelligent discussion on how players can play better.<br />
<br />
And for people bringing up that some skills/talents suck.   Dear sirs, every class has that.  Perhaps i could bring up my +5% fear resist talent which i needed to take as a prereq.  Or i could name total lines of worthless spells.  Please, at this point you're just trying to find stuff to bitch about.<br />

That, is the bottomline. Point is, I've already been a meat shield for years in EQ. I don't want that role anymore. I didn't roll a warrior so I could always have the honor of saving some mage from getting assraped everytime I group. I've been doing that and have had enough. It's too much work tbh and the fucktards will bitch everytime you switch stance or if your taunt gets resisted.</div></div><hr />

I would say the main problem with any sort of protest at the moment is two fold. 1) We have already gotten a responce from the devs. They deserve more than 2 weeks to respond. 2) There are no demands. Just what is the point of the demonstration? There is no wildly agreed list of problems and potential solutions. <br />
<br />
While I would agree that Blizzard is not doing a great job of communicating at the moment, they have not been negligent either.</div></div><hr />

His idea of a warrior is limited to aggro and meat shielding. We should be able to stack just like paladins. We have Arms and Fury besides Protection. Those should serve a purpose at lvl 60.

We stack plenty fucking well.<br />
<br />
When you can only see one rend on the mob, then you bitch.  As it stands now, you can go with one prot/defensive warrior have the rest turn on the Bloodrage and go to town.<br />
<br />
All of this is a moot point however with the 5 man group, as there isn't room for &quot;stacking&quot; warriors.</div></div><hr />

It's been a few weeks since that time, which is hardly sufficient time to make any reasonable changes.<br />

Look how long it took SoE to fix warriors when we couldn't hold aggro and pallies and sk's were easily holding aggro and even had nice snap aggro.  Blizzard has given us a great game, the least we can do is give them some time.<br />
<br />
The reality is there are so many morons playing WoW it is ridiculous.  Somehow they have attracted a large fan base of really moronic people.  Sure, there are lots of great people who play their class well, but there are just so many morons.  The Blizzard boards are overflowing with them.  Maybe they will all just get fed up and quit, we can only hope.  They are really making us respectable warriors look bad.</div></div><hr />

You didn't read the books then.  Conan was always getting beat down, usually wearing armor, but came out on top (They also spent a lot of time developing characters to kill them 1 page later).<br />
<br />
Full prot spec as it stands is not needed by any means or method.  The warriors problem is the same as druids rolewise.  Yes, we -can- do good damage, but how often is there someone in group that takes hits better than you?  Almost never.  That dosen't mean you have to do crap damage while being a meathshield though.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, and thus we are the primary tank class of WoW.  Sure others can do it, but not as good as a warrior.  The fact that you dont need a tank to get through the low and mid level game is a different story entierly.  I'm not in the top end instances, but by all accounts, our role as tanks return there where the mobs hit like PoP mobs did =) Full prot spec shouldnt be needed to do the job of course.  It will increase your chances to survive, but you'll tank pretty good w/o the talents by all accounts.<br />

there has to be a trade off somewhere for the ability to absorb the most damage.</div></div><hr />

You are absolutely correct. After going back to work and coming back to the issue fresh, I decided that the protest is pointless because of what Blizzard said and I still enjoy my Warrior a lot, even how he is now.  However, I still want to see how it works out because I am a total newbie to MMORPGs. The idea of this kind of expanded online community is still fresh to me. Many of you have more than a year of experience in this kind of thing. Besides, i still want to see what a mob of gnomes dancing or training looks like. Come on now, that just seems cool. Besides, if going to a low pop server doesn't even get a hiccup, then no harm no foul. The ones intent on crashing a server..well, i hope they get some kind of punishment.<br />

Does that make me a moron? That’s invitation for flame, but it’s ok. I usually don't take it personally.</div></div><hr />

Uldman is fun aint it =)  I dont think of it as a mid-level zone though.  It does pay to have a tank there for sure, even if their DPS isnt very high (just as long as they keep the mobs off the healer).<br />

<br />
The trade off is: We get no heals, magic, crowd control or stealth.  I'm not suggesting we be unstoppable, but our ability damage needs to be taken up a notch or 2 to put us on an even playing field for solo pve and Pvp.  It wouldn't even really affect group combat too much, as our damage contribution in defensive isn't super huge.<br />
<br />
My main point though was you don't need to be defensive spec in order to tank well, and there is a notable difference in damage between the trees.</div></div><hr />

The protests are usually a rare thing. I don't predict good things for wow if they are common--and one starting this soon and in such a manner is bad.<br />
<br />
You are right, many of us have been at this for more than a year--I know I rolled up Kailyn 3/21/99. AND I organized the first 'protest' in EQ. Which was the Weekend Warrior Walkout. The game was new enough that I knew it was silly to ask people not to play, so instead we &quot;protested&quot; by not playing our warriors and playing alts. (As I recall crafted and beserk came not long afterwords...)<br />
<br />
The second warrior protest, was actaully organized here and lasted a week or more. In EQ you don't get disconnected when you are inactive. So we would leave our warriors logged in over night in central areas on our home servers. And if things got laggy because of the warriors we would  change zones. <br />
<br />
And I think the unofficial boards (like this one) are far more interesting. Far fewer whiners (as devs come to them rarely so there is not nearly the point) lighter moderation and, IMHO a better quality of poster.</div></div><hr />

hmmm, i dont see no heals as a trade off.  hell we get first aid<br />
<br />
If i wanted to twidle my fingers, I'd play a shammy or a pally.  I like being pure melee.<br />
<br />
We got plenty o CC skills.  It aint what folks in EQ thought of as CC, but we can keep a crowd locked down quite well.<br />
<br />
Stealth, well, ya got me there.... sneaky rogue!!! ;p<br />
<br />
The more I look at the prot tree the gimpier it looks in comparison but hey that just means more talent points for dmg instead of tanking.  Pretty much all you need to tank (so far) is a good shield.  I'm curious to see if the 10% bonus to your AC ends up being overkill in the end.<br />
<br />
I think our dps is perfect since we can go down the tank path or the dmg dealer path.  You will not be able to take huge damage AND dish it out at the same time, your gear wont let you.  You're gonna have to trade off stats.</div></div><hr />

This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding regarding what Paladins do.  I don't sit across from a warrior so I don't know how many buttons or what all they are doing, but I do sit across from a Paladin and I can tell you that he's actively engaged in the battle with his abilities, heals, aggro talents, other talents...<br />
<br />
Sure, maybe lots of bnetties play Paladins so its easy to dis the class.  But it would be a serious fucking error to underestimate a good Paladin.  Given the difficulty of the some of the instances we do now - and the fact that we go in without traditional crowd control and I, as a druid, am the primary healer - the Paladin is instrumental in healing on those rare occassions I cannot cover it.  And on those even rarer occassions when we've been deep into an instance and I die from aggro ... he's been a 1-hour life-saver.</div></div><hr />

No heals is a large trade off.  Bandaids work, they just don't work when you're getting beat down.  You can use potions, but then so can everyone else.<br />
<br />
Yeah, warrior CC is excellent in parties, but it's nothing that you can do to really help yourself hugely solo.  All off our CC is &quot;Hey, look at me!&quot; skills rather than stopping them in their tracks, turning them into sheep, knocking them out, whatever.<br />
<br />
All and all I don't think prot tree is bad, I just don't think it's as helpful in the other ones in their current state.<br />
<br />
Our Dps is just high enough right now to where even if you're well equipped, you can't solo 2 even level guys without help reliably.  I can do it vs some because I'm arms spec'd, and bust out sweeping strikes, but it's still really rough.  Nearly every other class can take on 2, or even 3 and expect not to lose unless they screw up horribly.  And if they do...? Hey, they've got some expediant means of escape.  Our damage is also low enough to where you can't go PvP with a competent player, vs most classes, and expect to have a reasonable chance of winning.   Those are really the 2 circumstances we need to be &quot;tuned up&quot; to, in order to be on par with everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boy-</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard did not define the warrior class to be just a meat shield. That, is the bottomline. Point is, I've already been a meat shield for years in EQ. I don't want that role anymore. I didn't roll a warrior so I could always have the honor of saving some mage from getting assraped everytime I group. I've been doing that and have had enough. It's too much work tbh and the fucktards will bitch everytime you switch stance or if your taunt gets resisted.<br />
<br />
Is it too far a stretch to assume that a skill that is used *only* in defensive stance should be of a defensive stature?  Overpower is the dps skill, revenge is the aggro skill.  Makes sense to me!<br />
<br />
If you have a beef with the defensive tree because you dont want to tank, then don't use it.  Get a ravager, go zerker stance, and spam hit the whirlwind button.  I won't invite you to any of my groups, but if you have fun playing that way, have at it, no one is saying you can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have Arms and Fury besides Protection. Those should serve a purpose at lvl 60. Almost everyone respecs to Protection at lvl 60. Thats not right.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do you come up with this idea?  It's a fairly wide consensus that deep in the protection tree isn't terribly useful.  *MANY* people are only going 10-20 points in protection, which leaves 30ish to get MS if you want, or whatever floats your boat.<br />
<br />
Paladins are getting a fairly big dps nerf coming up next patch (~20% ish), which should hopefully silence some of the warrior solo dps bitching.  Really, warriors (and even post-nerf paladins) have no solo issues when you compare it to the drinkfest known as mage.</div></div><hr />

I think Greysen hit the core points with regards to the problems Warriors are suffering.  I'd probably also toss in that Warriors don't generate enough AE aggro in situations requiring AE functionality, which means in instances.<br />
<br />
But yes, the fact of the matter is that the Warrior class solos poorly when compared to the majority of other classes in the game, the one exception as already noted may well be Druids.  Can it be done?  Certainly.  But it can also be extremely frustrating, particularly when you watch members of other classes that are a level or two lower than you solo mobs with ease that would be a struggle for you.  And the class requires down time between almost every mob when soloing, not so with most other classes.<br />
<br />
I've dumped my Warrior indefinitely, until they make some changes to the class that make it more pleasant to play solo.  And I'm leveling a Hunter instead.  It's pretty telling to me that it took me 18 days of playing time to get my Warrior to level 54, while it's only taken me 5 days to get the Hunter to level 37.   And my Hunter dies far less frequently.  With my Warrior I could expect at least a death or two each playing session while soloing.  With my Hunter I may die once or twice every few days.  Big difference.<br />
<br />
All that said, I don't believe the protest was a good idea.  Blizzard has acknowledged outstanding problems with the Warrior class and expressed a willingness to work on correcting those problems.  While I find the lack of specifics in their statements to be disappointing, I have more faith in their willingness and ability to fix the problems than I ever had in Sony.  It is my personal opinion that protests are only something to be used as a last resort when all other approaches have failed miserably.  Obviously we've not reached anywhere near that point with Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
