Anyway, The Cyrz is back. I've been off in the desert with the army for a while, those of you who know me, I've heard that most of you have changed guilds, and that in fact I got deguilded for inactivity from my own guild, which kinda ticks me off, but Que Sera Sera. <br />
<br />
Back to the point... those regulars I've played with (And I'm talking to YOU, Trast, Dovan, Cmgal, Teranick, ect!) I'm back from playing in the sandbox, and I'm on EQ as soon as I can find some install disks. Want to know where all my homies are guilded, and if the rumour I've heard that I've been deguilded is true, who has openings for a Warrior. And if any of you are in the Washington, DC area and have install disks I can borrow, let me know! I can't find anything but expansions for sale around here!<br />
<br />
Just cause I didn't mention ya doesn't mean don't say Hi.... I might not think you read this forum, like Azziz or Fenier, or I might not remember how to spell your name, like Lexor, or I might hate your guts, like Xaziol.</div></div><hr />

Weren't you in OC? <br />
<br />
Might wanna find some new people to run with if they can't cut your toon some slack for military service.  Them's sounds like fucking idiots to me.</div></div><hr />

Well.... I don't have any direct information yet, so maybe something else happened. Someone might have gotten overeager in a guildremove splurge or something. But, yeah, it kinda stunned me too. :-)<br />
<br />
Freaking Trast and Dovan... I expected one of you two to show up by now.</div></div><hr />
