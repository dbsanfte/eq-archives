Due to the info from an insider at TSW, lets call him Clatius to keep his anomninity, I have learned the truth! You dont wear all that gear for its armor, or stats. You wear the plate because its the only material that can keep your huge PAUNCHES in check! Admit it! You are so ashamed of how out of shape you are in comparison to us super sexy monks (who proudly show off their 6 pack abs) that you wrap yourself in about 30 pounds of steel (the other 100 pounds that you claim is from the steel is actually your beer bellies) just to hold your massive spare tires in check! Chain would leave unsightly marks, leather would tear and coth would explode, so all that is left is the mystical, magically strengthened steel!</div></div><hr />

 Listen you blithering idiot, nobody was talking to you, I was playing around, and obviously the repeated falls on the head you recieved as your mother kept trying to kill you has left you without the mental capacity to understand this fact. Here, maybe this will get rid of you. I heard there was a scratch and sniff panel on the bottom of your local pool. Why dont you go and check that out?</div></div><hr />
