<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far for me, it looks as if a Disc running that drains your Endurance still keeps running even when your Endurance runs out.  Meaning, as long as you kick a disc, it will keep going and you won't oom so to speak and leave your disc crapping out midway through.  This makes a ton of sense because discs never ran out midway through before.  <br />
<br />
So this is a nice balance, if your disc burns your endurance, you can't Incite to add more aggro to give nukers and dps more room to put in more damage.  You also can't burn your endurance on a disc then kick another disc, so if you plan on kicking Furious then Stonewall, best not blow a ton of Incites beforehand.  It takes a slight amount of planning and thinking, but does not hamstring us.  Nor does it take away what we had before.  It simply gives us more power and more choices on how best to use that power without giving us god mode.  <br />
<br />
Personally, Sony realizes that they realistically cannot have their cake and eat it too from a business side.  There is a relatively finite (read, only a certain amount) amount of money to be made on MMORPGs.  They said, hell, EQ makes a ton of money, lets try another one and see how it goes (would't you?).  Well, it has proved to be the same way some fast food franchises are.  Boston Market exploded about ten years ago and expanded like a motherfucker, only to find out, there is only so much money to be made in a city on Boston Market.  Having two Boston Markets in a town or city, when there was only enough of a market to support one, was a bad thing and a waste.  Sony seems to see now that their other MMORPG pursuits were not going to be the success that EQ is.  As such, they realize they may not be able to GROW their MMORPG audience by a huge amount (ie by adding another game ppl will subscribe to) so they are choosing to put their resources into EQ to KEEP who they have, and to maybe increase subscribership to EQ by a small amount.  <br />
<br />
I am a programmer by trade, I used to be a game programmer myself.  Simply put, the changes that have been made to the melee system reek of massive amounts of programming time.  Had they contracted ME to make these changes, the first thing I would have told them was that this was going to require a re-write of the core of EQ, or at least parts of the core.  <br />
<br />
Like anything in life, when you make changes to the surface, it can usually be done easy (like washing your car, its a 5 min job and makes it look a lot better).  But when you make a change in the way the core of something works, it takes orders of magnitude more time, and may not reap the same benefit PER UNIT TIME SPENT DOING IT.  You can take your car and redo the heads of your cylinder, redesign and install a more efficient manifold, machine a new cam follower assembly so its easier to tune to different timings and fuel mixtures.  Your car will get a , I don't know, maybe like a 20% or maybe 200% boost in horsepower and torque or whatever.  But it will cost fucktons more time in labor (which is VERY expensive) and materials.  <br />
<br />
Now take that cost of labor and materials and see how much of an improvement you get, and THEN see how much of a price people are willing to PAY for that.  Compare that to how much of an improvement a simple cosmetic change like washing it and vacuuming it out costs and how much easier it makes it to sell.  <br />
<br />
You do the cosmetic and cheap stuff when you just want to milk things and sell it fast and make the fast money.  But it does not lead to happy customers and repeat business.  Sony did not want repeat business, they wanted you to move to more expensive services and newer services.  They wanted you to buy new and more expensive stuff, or maybe not even more expensive, but something you have not bought yet.  <br />
<br />
Now it looks like they have redone their business strategy and decided to put resources into their cash cow, EQ.  Yeah, they still are coming out with new stuff they want you to buy, but it all comes down to return on investment.  They can put gimp programmers on the new stuff and bring their big boys back to EQ to keep their core cash flow moving.  I know LOTS of my friends had multiple accounts (read: power gamers, read: lots of money fo rSony) have up and left the game because of the oh so shitty issues that never got addressed.  Sony is not making the huge windfall from their new stuff they predicted they would, now they have lost oh so many accounts on EQ.  <br />
<br />
LDoN addressed oh so many issues ppl bitched about.  Named ganking, not enough nameds.  The 4-24 hour camps (working ppl wanted something they could do casually, like in an hour, cause that's all the time they had in their day to play).  Any programmer, especially game programmer, knows that LDoN must have been a large expentiture in Programmers.  It was new stuff, that takes lots of time, which costs lots of money (cost in making software is largely in paying those 80k a year programmers, so literally, time = money).  <br />
<br />
People REALLY bitched about Warrior aggro and such, we made suggestions, organized, and suggested many fixes on message boards.  Devs, Absor, and who know who from Sony have posted messages to us on these boards.  The final solution to Warrior aggro is something (iirc) that some dude on Paladins of Norrath suggested (ironic gettin lovin from a Paladin's idea).  Sony previously NEVER would have done either LDoN OR the new melee changes.  They are both VERY unique (read: costly to write code for).  <br />
<br />
Sony has felt the pain of losing hard core gamers (read their business plan, I seen it posted somewhere, said something about the key to a MMORPG is power gamers creating a community or something).  <br />
<br />
I don't want to go all kiss up to Furor and be a fanboi and shit, but he learned how to play Sony's game.  Money.  Hit then in their wallet.  BUT HIT IT BIG!!!  I remember reading all his bitch about EQ posts and blah blah I'll quit and all of my guild will quit blah blah blah.  I laughed all arrogantly thinking, that's not how to do it, they don't care about losing 1 or 30 accounts.  Then I saw how he brought WoW onto his web page.  Now instead of losing 30 accounts, Sony can potentially lose 30,000.  (or however many).  WoW presents a monetary threat to EQ, hence to Sony's executive's bonus paychecks.  Bingo!!!  That's the sore spot to lean on.  Once I saw that go up on the FoH site, I knew it was only a matter of time until melee got fixed.  And it seems to have been fixed.  <br />
<br />
THAT is the beauty of Capitalism.  If you are a business and gouge customers, its only a matter of time until a competitor comes in and charges less, or gives a better product, and fucks over said gouger.  <br />
<br />
Thank you Furor for playing Hardball the real way.  Thank you for your contribution to me actually being able to have fun in EQ again.  <br />
<br />
Next thank you... to all of you smart fookers who learned this lesson as well.  By organizing and posting well thought out solutions, and then by having a mass show of support through the Warrior Stand down, you ALSO learned to hit Sony where it counts.  Basically, those executives were wondering how much of a danger WoW presented, and when ppl start banding together against THEIR product, they started getting scared and spent the money to fix EQ.  The Warrior stand down demonstrated to Sony that us leaving for WoW is a significant threat.  <br />
<br />
Whining and bitching doesn't make executives do shit, and its executives who control the money and resources, so its THEM you need to convince, NOT programmers.  Programmers all knew what was wrong.  For fuck's sake how many programmers you think play eq?  They know it was fucked up.  But they can't just fix it without permission from the bean counter at the top.  That's life.  When you all made the Bean counter realize he realistically might have less beans to count, he spent some of his money to raise his chances of keeping the majority of his money.  That's the way life works.  <br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone who participated, came up with, supported, and sent tells to us during the Warrior stand down.  It might be argued that Sony doesn't care, but hell, we got our changes and thats what I care about.  Thank you.  <br />
<br />
Oh Sony developers, tell your bosses to fuck off please for making us wait this long, then tell them they will be getting their big bonus checks next Quarter because they made the right decision albeit late.  They deserve both.  Thank you to the developers who fought to do this right btw, I KNOW some programmers had to convince their bean counter to do it the right way.  Thank you to HIM.  <br />
<br />
Fuck off Sony, checks in the mail.</div></div><hr />

The disc's we have now, At least as I understand only use END when we start them, they don't drain END over time.  Its a one time cost paid at the beginning.</div></div><hr />

Off topic- NO you are mistaken.. as they stand right now all disc's (with the Incite line as an exception) have no upfront endurance cost and DO drain endurance over time as long as they are active. If you look at the ability screen you will see the &quot;Start&quot; cost and the &quot;Upkeep&quot; cost listed. To the best of my knowledge for the disc's available to my characters none of them have starting costs and all have upkeep.</div></div><hr />
