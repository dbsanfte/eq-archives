<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, my warrior is 54 and i just bought him a copper hammer of striking.<br />
<br />
I have a Silken Whip of Ensnaring and a Frostbringer as my old 1-handers, now use CHoS and Frostbringer as my 1-handers.<br />
<br />
I have a Stonebladed axe of Dismay that i was using for DPS, which is basically always because i use my 65 cleric to PL myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
What would be better DPS, the 2hander or my 1handers?<br />
<br />
I also have 110k to spend, so i was thinking of getting a Fleshgrinder for DPS, but my dex is only 109, so i have a low proc rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
So... Stonebladed Axe of Dismay or any mix of CHoS/FB/FG/Disemboweler/anyother 1hander<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT- Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=749314)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">War Marshall's Bladed Staff would be more DPS than the Stonebladed Axe of Dismay.<br />
<br />
Split Blade of Destruction (goes for a little over 100k on my server) with CHoS would be badass dps and aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you are looking to spend your plat on DPS weapons then a good 2 hander is definitely the way to go.<br />
<br />
Windblade and War Marshall's Bladed Staff are the best of the tradeable DPS weapons out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Would you guys suggest a CoF or a CCoM to go with the Warmarshal's Bladed staff?<br />
<br />
Windblade goes for 30k, and the WMBS goes for 18-20k, so i will be able to afford a better haste item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just looked at your Magelo.. and well, your gear is hurting WAY more than your weapons are.<br />
<br />
You have 110k to spend. Sell your Snare Whip, CHoS, Frosty, and SBoAD. Buy a WMBS or a GSoT. GSoTs go for 30k on my server (prices on WMBS and Windblade are same on my server also) and CHoS are going for 60k atm. Selling those weps would get you about 70k. Spend 30 of that on a GSoT leaving you with 150k to get new armor with.<br />
<br />
From there:<br />
Neck: Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
Head: Champion's Helm or Helm of Raldukan<br />
Finger: 2x Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
Wrist: 2x Brellium Platemail Bracers<br />
Arms: Champion's Vambraces<br />
Shoulder: Draconic Pauldrons<br />
Chest: Champion's Breastplate<br />
Back: Cloak of Flames or Cloak of Greater Pernicity<br />
Waist: Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide or Soulscream Belt<br />
Legs: Brellium Platemail Greaves<br />
Feet: Brellium Platemail Boots<br />
<br />
Melee: GSoT or WMBS<br />
<br />
On my server that would be about 125-135k and you would be set for a really long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Baadan, i don't plan on grouping him anytime soon, sicne my cleric can keep him healed np, and i hate to spend money =P<br />
<br />
My friend will let me have his Clattering Bone Necklace, i plan to camp dark kylong helm. Fingers i can admit need an upgrade.<br />
<br />
I don't want to buy Brellium because it is super overpriced on my server, from what i see anyways. Chest i might be able to find a MQ for it<br />
<br />
<br />
But like i said, i hate to spend money, and i try to fidn an excuse not to spend it =P</div></div><hr />
