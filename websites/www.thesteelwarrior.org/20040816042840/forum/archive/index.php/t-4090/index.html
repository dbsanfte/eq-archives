<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DumbSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read all the arguments about the class balance issue that exists between knights and warriors, and understand each side's point of view.  A lot of people on this board have called for a nerf to the knight classes, but I have not really seen someone detail what exactly a knight should be able to do, at least in the eyes of the warrior class.<br />
<br />
I do not see how a knight can remain as a tank if their tanking abilities are significantly decreased, as the PoP and hard LDoN mobs hit too hard.   I think the core problem is that in order to have more then one class be a viable tank, they need to have fairly similar abilities.  So, if you nerf Pal/Sk then you really only have one choice for a tank. Here are my questions:<br />
<br />
1) Since I think you can either tank or you cannot tank (i.e. it would be super hard to nerf Sk/Pal to be acceptable but not great tanks), what then is the role of the Pal/Sk if they cannot tank? Does the SK become a DPS class? Does the Pal become a buff/heal class? <br />
<br />
2) What is the role of SK/Pal in an exp group? Should they still be the best choice? Should it be a wash between knight and warrior?<br />
<br />
3) We know the warrior *should* be the absolute best tank on boss mobs.  As every class should be the best at something, what would the SK and Pal be best at? Is the exp group their *best* role? <br />
<br />
Opinions please?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DumbSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can do better then that. I read this board for a good 2 hours yesterday, and your post proves exactly why I asked my question. I have not honestly seen where the warrior class thinks knights should be. I have seen a ton of parses, data, arguments, etc. but nothing that says exactly where the knight classes should be. Maybe I am just stupid. Saying &quot;don't waste my time&quot; doesn't help anyone though.</div></div><hr />

1/ Able to tank well enough so that they are not passed over as an option for tank in groups whilst.... <br />

<br />
This is one of my main points...how does an SK/Pal tank an elemental mob or Hard LDoN mob who hit in the 900+'s without being a very powerful tank?<br />
<br />
3/ When a warrior is added to the group the knight has a secondary role that is still meaningful and worthy of the group slot. <br />
<br />
If we assume that you fight one mob at a time, then either the warrior or the knight becomes DPS.  If something changes as to where the warrior becomes the obvious choice for a tank (i.e. no Pal/Sk would ever tank if a warrior was in the group), then does SK/Pal DPS need to be increased to be in line with other DPS classes?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DumbSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No reason to be upset. I think warriors need to be fixed. All I am asking is how to fix warriors without killing knights. I think it is a perfectly valid question. <br />
<br />
And until someone can make an intelligent post explaining how a knight is supposed to tank exp mobs who hit for 900+ efficiently and effectively without having an enormous HP total then this class balance issue will not end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">like Val said , and about 1,000,000 other people have said time and again DumbSK, utilities, spells, abilities. What does a warrior bring to an XP group that has an SK or Pally Tanking and not losing any aggro at all what so ever?<br />
1.) NOTHING<br />
<br />
I watched my wife play in BoT today (shes a CLR) the group had an SK tanking, the ENCH never got hit noone but the SK got hit, add a warrior to that group and the ENCH would be getting hit 9 times out of 10 pulls, SK's / Pal's bring spells and other things to an XP group, and right now also bring Aggro lock THATS AGRO LOCK ! , meaning noone but them gets hit, that my DumbSK means more than anything else in the game right now, add to that Pal bring 300+ Hp buffs that stack with CLR buffs , fast cast group heals, Symbols that stack with Druid buffs if theres a Druid healer in group instead of a CLR, warriors bring one thing ! /sheild because they are going to use it all day, AGGRO lock is BROKE. thats not the way EQ is ment to be. <br />
You want a reason why AGGRO LOCK should be nerfed ? <br />
Thats like asking for a reason why bank robbies are illegal. Pal have more options than Sk's I agree, but you still get aggro buffs, and many group freindly spells, warriors bring pain and misery to a group trying to XP, I wish I could let all you dam Knights play my War for a day and see whats it like, maybe then you guys would all STFU and see what its like to know how shitty it feels to not be able to do your job since Knights and AGGRO LOCK has raised the bar above what the &quot;TANK of EQ&quot; is capable of doing EVER ! feeling like shit because your the tank thats supposed to keep the group alive but cant do jack or shit about the mob beating the ENCH/WIZ &lt;insert non plate class here&gt; into a bloody spot on the ground, Thats our job but we cant do it since people are too lazy to control aggro or theres no such way to hold aggro on the mob without stun/darkness yada.. <br />
It sucks hearing &quot;Taunt, get this dam thing off me&quot; Every godam pull, it makes a person feel useless, even tho they have no control over it 95% of the time. <br />
The warriors that you hear bitching are the ones that care about thier appearance to others and want to do thier &quot;job&quot; the way it was ment to be done, but can't and are frustrated to HELL that they cant while a &quot;Hybrid&quot; can and does with little to no work at all. <br />
So no you dont understand our point of view.. <br />

Un mem EVERY dam spell in your spell slots, now tank / pull,  dont cast one dam spell for the whole day. no matter what happens to your group dont cast anything and dont use an SK  weapon that procs SK only spells , use A Copper Hammer of Striking or simliar, then get back to me. <br />

Warriors, Paladins, and Shadow Knights should be equally desired as experiance group tanks. This means they must have adequate survivability and up to standard aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
This does not mean that one or another will not be prefered under special circumstances.<br />
<br />
Let's imagine Easy LDoN Assassinate boss mobs hit for 1000's. A Warrior might (depending on equipment) be reasonally prefered to MT in a group that chooses to do this adventure type.<br />
<br />
Let's say that a Easy LDoN Slaughter in DGuk has 60% undead. A Knight might be prefered in this group.<br />
<br />
Anticipating your gambit - But SK's don't have a lot of HP's and mitigation - where's our &quot;special&quot; niche? Unfortunately, SK's are neglected. Undead zones are good. And I'm sure with a little thought your Spears could be quite powerful in a rich mana quick kill group. I'd start with a Beast Lord, Bard, Shadow Knight, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric in a Easy undead Slaughter and tweak the group when I knew more.<br />
<br />
So, No you aren't &quot;entitled&quot; to tank gods just because players have labeled you a Tank. SoE does not have a Tank class designation, Think of it this way, Rangers are very much like Knights and generally tank nothing.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DumbSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tuff crowd here. I agree with you. I know the problems with warriors. I just said I think they should be fixed. The problem does, however go beyond aggro lock. I do not think SK/Pal will ever lose that because it would totally fuck up the game. Imagine a Pally chain stuning a mob without gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
You guys have all called for a nerf to knights yet I think warriors could be fixed without touching knights. If knights are to remain a viable tank, they really cannot be nerfed because mobs are too powerful.<br />
<br />
Is the simple answer to give warriors aggro lock and a true HP and AC advantage and to leave knights as they are?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>DumbSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am not complaining about SK's niche right now.  Our dps, undead or otherwise, is fine.  Our ability to tank is fine. I brought up the dps issue in the earlier post saying IF and only IF a warrior was the ONLY viable tank, knight dps should be looked at. That's not the issue here. <br />
<br />
These boards have called for a major nerf to knights because warriors believe they are too powerful.  Your responses so far in this thread <br />
<br />
Warriors, Paladins, and Shadow Knights should be equally desired as experiance group tanks. This means they must have adequate survivability and up to standard aggro abilities. <br />
<br />
All this means is you want aggro lock. With all the aggro weapons available this *should* be easier to attain then before. I still think they should give you innate hate bonus or something along the line. No need to nerf knights if this is all you warriors want.<br />
<br />
So, No you aren't &quot;entitled&quot; to tank gods just because players have labeled you a Tank. SoE does not have a Tank class designation <br />
<br />
Fine. But by your own words who entitled you to? The best class to tank whatever mob should tank it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if knights are not nerfed, then yes you would need to give Warriors instant, ranged, mana free aggro lock as well as atleast 20% more innate HP and mitigation.<br />
<br />
Considering knights can tank every single mob in the game up to and including Quarm, i'll let you try to convince me that this would somehow break the game more than it already is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sure DumbSK give us aggro lock 10% more HP and AC, lets add mobs walk up to the raid and drop dead without one swing and we all get more ub3r l33t for all, xp groups we sit at a spot and hail mobs so they walk (not chase) with your puller back to camp, die and we all get free XP. EQ would be perfect then.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem is the game, EQ is broke, they have made more classes than they needed in the first place juggling what 15 classes now and trying to balance them all in relation to each other is the main issue, SoE has broke EQ and it can never be fixed, I saw someone say before. <br />
 I Play Golf and I play EQ the difference with Golf is if I'm having a bad day its my fault with EQ theres nothing I can do about EQ <br />
I'd like to add, and if you use golf in relation to EQ, thats like playing on a par 63 course with no maintainence to the greens or fairways, no upkeep of the course in anyway trees lying all over boulders in the fairway, You want to quit the course but you have no other courses in the world except some 9 hole course to go to, thats why EQ Sucks. they Own MMORG's right now, no other game compares really and they know that UO, Shadowbane, blah all the others are just poor imitations. <br />
SoE I hope your ready for Blizzard to kick your asses, cuz people are sick of your poor excuses and lame replies and fixes.<br />
<br />
P.S. I love the new targeting circles it lets me see the ENCH get splatered into the red ring around his feet. and no more Sense heading issues you guys are right on track, prepping new people cuz you know the EQ Veterans are ready to get off the bus. Too bad you forgot to add the new unresistable 10k wizard nuke and 8500hp Druid heal spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">DumbSK said:<br />
Fine. But by your own words who entitled you to? <br />
<br />
SoE did, in the Warrior Class Description.<br />
When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>DumbSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The biggest problem is the game, EQ is broke <br />
<br />
Ok. Can it be fixed? If it honestly can, then great, how? <br />
<br />
If it cannot, then why the hell do we spend so much time arguing about all this crap since it doesn't matter? In that case just have fun when you play and don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
And what if, by some strange turn of events, WoW sucks and you have to play EQ for 3 more years?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Could you throw the next one about 2 inches higher? That one was barely in my power zone.<br />
<br />
The trick is to make mobs that require the special abilities of all 3 Tanks. This even goes for boss mobs IMO.<br />
<br />
Imagine that Warriors had no Defensive, 14k HP's, 25% more mitigation, snap aggro on demand, and ranged aggro. Against a hard hitting mob we are king. With that kind of HP's and mitigation there could easily be mobs that were tankable by Warriors and not Knights.<br />
<br />
Imagine a boss with a huge damage shield that could not be removed. Sounds to me like this is a job for Knights. Make one that is immune to stuns and it's SK all the way.<br />
<br />
I personally don't think Warriors are entitled to MT every boss mob in the game, but neither do they deserve seeing everything they can tank be tankable by a Paladin.<br />
<br />

Other than BSS and Voice i dont see wtf you are good at.<br />
<br />
Does that answers your question? Go back to SK.org and dont try to be a smart ass pretending you wanna fix the warriors... stfu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>gazarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In the best world of EQ tank balance<br />
<br />
Raid Roles:<br />
-Warrior (high mitigation, close range aggro and better aggro over long fight) tank boss mob and names.<br />
-SK (low mitigation, range aggro, dps) tank trash mob.<br />
-Paladin (low mitigation, range aggro dmg-less, healing) off tank adds during clearing.<br />
<br />
<br />
To vary roles slightly some encounter should be like :<br />
-Have a few more encounter designed so that the MT get slowed which make warrior have near zero aggro, and provided those boss mob have lower dps, knights are prefered tanks.<br />
<br />
-Have some encounter designed so that trash mob have DD mana drain, which make warrior prefered trash tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
What needs to change : <br />
-knights aggro lock spell need to have high refresh timer, so that although they can get aggro lock at first, if the fight is long they would lose aggro overtime unable to generate enough of it, which would help warrior remaining prefered boss mob tanks.<br />
<br />
-having aggro spell from knights higher refresh timer would resolve the problem of nuker chain casting without getting aggro, they need to die like they use to.<br />
<br />
-warrior should have better mitigation to compensate the more random aggro they generate or lower knights mitigation and all other class accordingly. (no itemization here, need to be class innate)<br />
<br />
-Warrior aggro need to be innate, not itemized with enraging blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I didn't bother to read all the other posts, but here's something for you (DumbSK) to chew on:<br />
<br />
Base Classes are meant to be &quot;BEST&quot; at something.<br />
<br />
Hybrid Classes are meant to be Jack of 2 trades, master of none.<br />
<br />
Cleric - Best at Healing<br />
Necro - Best at Undead (subjective these days too)<br />
Magician - Best at Pets<br />
Wizard - Best at Damage-spells<br />
Enchanter - Best at Crowd-control/Mana regen<br />
Warrior - Best at Tanking<br />
Shaman - Best at detrimental effects<br />
<br />
SK - Hybrid of Warrior/Necro<br />
Paladin - Hybrid of Warrior/Cleric<br />
<br />
Why are you asking what SK/Pally are &quot;BEST&quot; at? You are not meant to be a &quot;BEST at something&quot; Class, cos u are a HYBRID CLASS.<br />
<br />
Jeez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The problem is that there are Hybrids at all.<br />
<br />
To make a balanced game with the EQ character creation system, you just cant have hybrids and be honest. Look at hybrids in past games, esp RPG's.<br />
<br />
Paladins/Anti-Paladins(SK's) - these were a SUB CLASS of warriors, they required extremely strict and hard prerequisites to create, high usless stat(cha), overall much higher base stats, strict class alignments, strict adherence to limitations. In the EQ game design NONE of these apply. Paladins were much more powerfull on an even footing than warriors, what gave warriors advantages were their melee skills, Paladins could not specialize, etc.. and a warrior was not limited in magic. If you could play a paladin and be able to weapon specialize and use unlimited magic, no one would play a warrior, because there would be no point. <br />
<br />
There are no limitations built into the EQ system for paladins, they get the best of both. ergo there is no reason to play a warrior. <br />
<br />
In the beginning, they USED to actually look at balance thru itemization, there were trade off in paladin gear vs warrior gear.. now paladin gear gets 95% of warrior stats + all the caster stats and bonuses. <br />
<br />
Look at Kunark, Velious, Ornate, and Elemental armor... and you can see the progression, from one that is horribly out of balance tilted to warriors to what is now horribly out of balance tilted towards knights.<br />
<br />
There are NO limits on knights, that is the problem. No limit on magic items, no allignment requirement, no hard requirements to become, no religious duties, no vastly reduced casting power than pure casters, etc etc etc...<br />
<br />
Unless they do massive reitemization, OR, add considerable class modifiers to all gear that is multiclass usable... it wont change.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is some way to enforce some restrictions on knights in a role-playing sense. How about my favorite Paladin restriction... Only 10 of their magic items work at a time? Give them a check box, that they cn turn on / off different items...<br />
<br />
NOW that would balance them... LOL.. I can hear the flames already...<br />
<br />
But seriously, hybrid tanks are way out of balance. <br />
<br />
The only true balanced hybrid i see is the ranger. They have a clearlly defined job that they are better than anyone else at (tracking), and they have a clear role in any raid or exp group (dps), they also have some utility in any setting (snares, roots, atk buffs, etc) I would like to see knights moved more towards that ideal...<br />
<br />
Paldins - tanking healers... Lower their weapon skills,and Hps so that they are halfway between a war and a cleric, Raise AC to a warrior level. Give them a better spread of efficient group heals, group cures, group resist buff spells. Give them a DIVINE-RES, if any class should have this it is paladins. FIX stuns, there are too many available at high level that have virtually no mana cost at all for them now. Hard cap the casting level on stuns, increase the reset time, a lot of tweaks can be done to these to fix them, just DO SOMETHING, I disaggree with removing all stun aggro, but aggro on spells the mob is immune to is pretty silly. <br />
<br />
ShadowKnights - Damage tanks... Raise weapon skills to warrior levels, lower hp/ac to halfway between cleric/warrior. Give them many more DD, DoT, spells that are more efficient and attack/aggro buff spells. Give them better pets.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, and this one will get the biggest outcry from knights.. And honestly I am not sure why it hasnt been suggested before... Fix Knight  Mana Regen, give them the mana regen of BARDS... THIS WOULD PROBABLY COMPLETELY FIXX AGGRO-LOCK...<br />
<br />
Beastlords- sadly are probably the most overpowered of the hybrid classes, but you dont see much of them for a few reasons. Pet classes not usually preferred on raids that much, so a large part of their power is reduced. They solo more than other hybrids easilly, and dont take the tank spot in groups. they do however usually are included in 'tank-less' groups, as this is where they shine the best. They 'can' tank in such as BoT and PoV or HoH, but that is not their 'best' role in the group, unlike knights who excell at that role. That is why they are not threats to tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You know I have a great choice for SOE. Since they dont care to make any real changes then they can easily implement this one. We as warriors have a 10% xp bonus. (or used to)<br />
<br />
Since all our utilty is being taken away by &quot;powering up&quot; all the spells etc for hybrids and casters. Give pure melee (rogues, warriors) a 50% xp bonus or greater.<br />
<br />
This will make it much much easier for us to level and we will be so busy goggling the xp bar we wont have as much time to whine.<br />
<br />
Vack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">As has been mentioned in the post you started on the idea…  most Bard songs do not use mana.  Only a few of their songs require it. <br />
<br />
Imposing the Bard mana restrictions on hybrid casting would cripple hybrids.  Forget balance, it would kill hybrid casting effectiveness.<br />
<br />
What has happened here is that classes with a a mana bar have progressed while classes without a mana bar have been left fallow for a few expansions now.  It's hard to say that 80% of the classes in the game are overpowered!  The other 20% (pure melee) simply have not been allowed to keep up.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, 12 classes have improved while pure melee haven't.  Knights are overpowered comparted to Warriors.  I know!  Let's nerf Knights.<br />
<br />
A previous poster mentions how Rangers are a well balanced hybrid.  Rangers are every bit as powerful as Knights, they just don't choose to tank very often because their DPS is of more value to a group than their tanking.  Warriors perceive Knights to be particularly overpowered because we compete for the same job.  This does not make us any more overpowered than the other classes with a mana bar.<br />
<br />
With that mentioned, I agree with Battleblade's view of experience group balance.  In general, it should be a flip of a coin as to which tank class to take in most situations.  There should be some cases where one or the other is preferred, but those should be the exception rather than the rule.  Right now I think almost everyone agrees that a Paladin or SK is a better choice than a Warrior for an experience group.  This needs to change.<br />
<br />
On raids, I think that a Warrior should be the obvious choice for almost all boss mob tanking against current content.  Knights make good off tanks, but should not really infringe on the Warrior's raid tanking role.<br />

I feel Warriors need to beefed up a bit instead of begging for a swing of the Nerf bat one someone else though.<br />
<br />
I agree with you guys and think that Knights tanking ability is a bit close to a warriors but keep in mind there is still a pretty good gap. You read the stories about Uber Mob X was tanked by SK Y.  But these are isolated incidents and are the product of the exception to the rule and not the rule.  This does not happen in daily EQ life.  Uber Shamans can solo High end mobs, but warriors cannot, so should they be nerfed too?<br />
<br />
I know that just about any raid I go on (that has a decent target) requires there to be at least a few good warriors at the raid or it does not happen.  Whats the last raid you were at that did not go off because there was not an SK or a Pally there? <br />
<br />
 The only time myself or another SK gets on the &quot;Main Tank&quot; list is if there is a serious shortage of warriors.  And when that does happen you can bet we are all saying our prayers because chances are we are going down.<br />
<br />
Aggro wise, and please correct me if I am wrong.  SK's /Pallys have always had an aggro edge over warriors and it was because of our spells.  I think in time it has gotten to be a wider gap.  But an intended one.<br />
<br />
In the &quot;Good ol days&quot; EQ was about trade offs.  If you got a weapon what had an awesome dmg/del ratio (back then like 12/25) it had no stats.  If you got a weapon with stats it's ratio sucked.<br />
<br />
Warriors vs knights is all about trade offs.  Can we hold aggro better?  Sure.  Can we take the whoopin we will get because of it like a warrior?  No.<br />
<br />
Holding better aggro on a raid outside of spite tanking is about worthless because of the fact you need a warrior to tank it.<br />
<br />
Even in EXP groups when I am tanking I am damn glad if a warrior comes in because I do not have to take the whoopin and the group healer will have a much easier time.<br />
<br />
Bottom line , IMHO, is that Aggro is the trade off.  We can hold it better but cannot tank it nearly as well when we do.  I do feel warriors need a boost but not even a big one and for sure not a Knight nerf.<br />

There's no easy answer.  If there was, it would have been fixed by now most likely.  I hope SOE  can get it right.  I wouldn't want to try it personally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>carlelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">DQ you are saying that the group healer will have a easier time. I tend to disagree with you. When a Knight is tanking the only person the healer has to worry about is the Knight because of AGRO LOCK, the healer doesnt have to worry about the slower or the over nuking wizzie. so in turn you needing an extra heal every other fight is no big deal. Another thing about a knight tanking is once again the whole AGRO LOCK ability lets everyone one else go balls to the wall in the DPS department cuz they dont have to worry about grabbing agro so easily. Witch once again makes the healers job easier. You see where I am going with this... A knight makes XPing a walk in the park for all other classes, its a chore having a warrior as the tank. <br />
<br />
Us warrior had the raids to look forward to. We could have our 3 minutes of glory that we where allowed (/disc defensive) now we dont even have that as our moment of glory with knights tanking end game mobs just as easily as us. <br />

<br />
Eh, there's been a ton of suggestions. Not all of them have been to nerf.<br />
<br />
But month after month after month, the inertia builds.<br />
<br />
I actually wrote a huge post, highlighting many of the positive suggestions offered here and at MB on ways to boost melees, help them if you will, without breaking other classes.<br />
<br />
Then deleted it.<br />
<br />
It just wasn't worth getting into again.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so negative.<br />
<br />
It's just beyond frustrating anymore.<br />
<br />
The game's still fun. I like the game.<br />
<br />
But to see an entire class just phased right out of existence, is extremely disheartening.<br />
<br />
Especially when it's one of the two classes I play. And when the OTHER class I play is about to join them plunging into the abyss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>DarkQuark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You all have really good points.  <br />
<br />
I must say after I read more posts on this baord within the last half of the day I really started to sympothize with you guys.  You see as you may or may not know Knights have been the bitch clean up spite tanks of EQ since its inception. It was not until Luclin or so that we really started to gain some ground. All the problems and gripes you talk about now are things we delt with from the get go until the last year or so.  The reason I say that is so you realize Knights who have been around long enough remember how it used to be and understand what you're saying.<br />
<br />
I think the problem here lies with AA's and and gear marked ALL ALL.    Why the hell does a caster need 200HP on a bracer?  Or even more to the point.  Maybe the uberist of Plate gear should be WAR only as right now its all tank classes.<br />
<br />
Again I really think Knights should not be nerfed.  I think Warriors can with slight changes (that would have big effects) be put on top of the melee heap once again.  Just as a few years ago they raised the Knight Offensive and Defensive skills, they could raise Warrior skills and multipliers and I think put you guys back into the tank spotlight.<br />
<br />
I do however think that Knights having the edge in aggro is a good thing.  To me its a natural side effct of spell casting and if Warriors are the top melee once again its a trade off.  Knights could hold more aggro but the warriors can tank better.<br />
<br />
Also, I look at it this way and I mentioned this in my previous post.  I think ya'lls biggest problem is in exp groups.  As far as raids go I think there is no doubt Warriors are intergral parts in raids (SK's are not).  So what if some freaky SK tanked an uber mob.  In daily EQ life Warriors are REQUIRED to do it.<br />

Knights were just FINE in original EQ, and much better than warriors. Warriors got improved so much in Kunark in part because they were so pointless before then. By late Velious knights were fine again, and Luclin was straight out a pure melee nerf. <br />
<br />
So you have 1 bad expansion. We've had: original, luclin, pop, ldon, and maybe loy, if I knew anything about it other than that it has a zillion aggressive greens and is a bitch to get to. <br />

WRONG WRONG WRONG and WRONG again.<br />
<br />
Knights SUCKED from the beginning and up Until Luclin hard time getting groups or even being useful on raids.  I know this because I was one of the peeps sitting LFG forever 4 years ago (well not LFG since they did not have it then but begging for a group none the less).<br />
<br />
In fact the last huge round of class balencing (this was some time ago) was a partial attempt to make knights more useful on raids because we were almost worthless.  That was the point that our melee and defensive skills were raised close to warriors.<br />
<br />
You guys have your problems, just like most other classes in EQ you are NOT the only ones but I give it to you that right now you may have it the worst.  With POP things have gotten much worse with the off the hook melee gear that is not warrior only and all the AA's etc.  <br />
<br />
But to go around saying that Knights only had it bad in Kunark is as idiotic and uninformed as saying Warriors are totally balanced.<br />
<br />
Some of you guys act like no one needs a warrior.  I beg to differ with you totally.  I undertand the problems you are having with exp groups and I KNOW first hand how much that sucks, but Warriors are still an intergral part of almost any high end raid.  SK's never have been and up to this point are still not.  The fact that 1 off the hook freaky SK tanked 1 mob does not mean that Warriors are all of a sudden are worthless.<br />
<br />
I think you guys for sure have something to complain about and your Melee skills need improvment for sure.  No one with half a brain disagrees with that one bit.<br />
<br />
I hope SOE listens to you guys and gives you the much needed boost you require.<br />

That's probably why people are acting like one NEEDS a warrior. Because, oddly enough, it seems NO ONE DOES.<br />
<br />
Beg to differ all you want, but the proof is there. Knights are tanking the toughest mobs in the game. There's no NEED for the warrior class anymore.<br />
<br />

<br />
This isn't about XP grouping anymore.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't NEEDED for boss mobs anymore.<br />
<br />
And still can't do much in XP groups.<br />
<br />
From top to bottom, the class has been marginalized into uselessness.<br />
<br />
Or rather, a class that no one NEEDS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Look at it like this Dark, if you don't tank, and you don't get work as offtank, you still have other options that make you useful in a group (less so than paladins - if pushed to comment I'd say SK's could be given more - so long as aggro didn't provide as much superiority as it currently does). A non-tank warrior is inferior DPS and inferior offtanking and a whole lot of nothing much else. Half the time even when we are tanking and a knights in group we're made to feel that we're simply being allowed to rather than being a proper choice. How do you think that feels psychologically?<br />
<br />
I've never considered the raid need argument to be acceptable simply because you only require one tank per mob, every other warrior is again inferior offtank, inferior DPS. Because a small fraction of the total population gets to tank a boss mob every night everythings ok? nah. especially when that only applies on up to date content and everybody is NOT raiding in Time.<br />
<br />
NOW, we find that as itemisation continues even our much vaunted /disc defensive is more of a convenience option than a neccessity and that apparently - lord knows how - a knight tank in time gear was taking LESS DPS than a warrior INCLUDING the period of time the warrior was under /disc!!! How fucked up is that? How should we feel having slogged through 65 levels without the convenience of a spellbook (which, whilst not enough, WAS useful in kunark) when our sacrifice of utility gives us so marginal a  benefit?<br />
<br />
The answer is of course - pretty pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Scentilk/Saerdi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What i think needs to happen to help knights/warriors the most would be to have the higher lvl armor be class specific.  i had hoped the elemental armor would be the best armor for each class in the game since it seemed to be balanced nicely for the classes, but damned PoTime screwed that up.  As it is tho, until the high end of the game, i think classes are fairly balanced in their jobs. items are what screwed this up and they can fix it by changing the dropped armor in PoT.<br />
As for warriors agro, i think they should have the taunt a line a skills, similar to monks kicks/punches.  some could stun a bit, do a bit of damage, or be pure agro; depending on the situation.  also, stun should NOT give agro on mobs that are immune to it (altho i dunno how easy this would be to do, since i dont know much about coding or whatever).</div></div><hr />

Alot of you keep pointing to this and saying Warriors arent needed anymore because of it.  Bullshit.  He is in a PoTime guild and has alot of nice gear (no idea as we cant see the link to it), Which not all Knights are.  If your using this as even a partial reason to nerf Knights then you are an idiot.  My guild isnt near PoTime yet (still working RZtW), and the only time we use Knights as MT's is for those few mobs that you want agro w/o dmg IE Zek brother, and trash mobs.<br />
<br />
Do warriors need tweaking?  Of course.<br />
Should it be at the expense of another class?  Fuck no!</div></div><hr />
