<br />
my question is i can nicely get him to over 75 dex and agility with a spider fur belt. my question is does getting either one specifically over 100 matter or is just 75 the real hurdle?<br />
<br />
*when i dressed him up i went AC over almost everything why my dex/agility suck so bad*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as your dex/agi are 75 or over you won't incur any penalties for your stats, to get a bonus you need to get to 100.  The next milestone after that is 120 iirc, after that I can't remember where the next increase in bonuses is.   Check shaman's crucible, they did extensive research on stats some time back.<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undafut</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, agility (http://www.users.qwest.net/~taleisin/pages/AC%20from%20AGI.htm) is a fairly smooth progression past 75.<br />
<br />
Dex &gt; 75 and &gt; 100 seem to be the 2 main levels where things just work a bit better.  There's a clear bonus to learning offensive skills when Dex &gt; 150 and Agi &gt; 150.<br />
<br />
Unda was PL'd by a shaman through levels 32, 33, 34, and 35 at the Kodiak caves in Great Divide.<br />
<br />
For levels 32 and 33 (most bears yellow and red) I was unbuffed Dex/Agi because I wanted to see if skills would lag -- with dex/agi a hair over 100, skills were not maxed before the next level.<br />
<br />
At 34 and 35 (with most bears turning even and blue) with Dex/Agi over 150, skills were maxed before leveling.<br />
<br />
Well, except 2hb... I'm a slacker.</div></div><hr />
