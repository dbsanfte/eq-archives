Yes, I need to not be a hypocrite and donate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was contacted by him this week. They wanted to purchase the entire site and pay some moderators to stay on, etc etc.<br />
<br />
I told them we weren't interested. We manage to keep our hosting fee's coming via the donations we recieve, so theres no real need to sell the site and ruin the community. The other sites he's aquired really killed those boards off. I wouldn't want to see that happen here.</div></div><hr />

You can skip the Taco Bell tonite to have a good board to argue with dickheads like me :)</div></div><hr />

EQ Wise I mean.   Is the only thing he's looking for is to be able to advertise on all of them?  Complete Board/Site domination?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just donated. Hopefully we can use that amount later to buy cigarettes for his cellmates - he can be Ned Beatty for the prison play. :D</div></div><hr />
