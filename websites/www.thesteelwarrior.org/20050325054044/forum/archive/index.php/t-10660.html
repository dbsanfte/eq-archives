Thanks for that crucial piece of information.<br />
<br />
Now, WHY? (which is what was originally asked)<br />
<br />
1) We're seen to be evil. 3 of the races are obviously badguys if you are coming from anything but the warcraft world. (I can't figure out why the Tauren and the Allinace haven't kissed and made up te don't feel like the rest of the Horde races.)<br />
<br />
2) We hit most of the branches while falling out of the ugly tree. We have no cute race. We have no good looking race.<br />
<br />
3) The manual is faction neutral--not trying to make either side seem cooler (or even accent that the Horde is just as much the good guys as the Alliance). <br />
<br />
4) There are no in game systems to promote the less populous faction.<br />
<br />
PS Moved the responce from the Pic thread as it was a wee bit OT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a friend of mine was discussing this today.we decided on three reasons - you mentioned one.<br />
<br />
leveling up as Alliance is a little easier and much more varied. a lot of Hordies who played Beta got tired of the Barrens.<br />
<br />
paladins are perceived by so many ex-War3 kiddies as a power class.  it's arguably easier to play a paladin well than to play a shaman well. of course, playing any class exceptionally is the key.<br />
<br />
there is no sexy race for the Horde. if the Undead were vampires, we'd see a lot more of them.<br />
<br />
I agree that the Tauren and even the Undead are ill-suited for the Horde. that's my biggest problem with WoW PvP - it seems so petty, due to stodgy asshats who can't resolve small differences and issues. on the Uther boards, Azariah posted something I agree with - it would be awesome to see a really horrible evil that unites the two factions, if only temporarily and in neutrality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) We're seen to be evil. 3 of the races are obviously badguys if you are coming from anything but the warcraft world. (I can't figure out why the Tauren and the Allinace haven't kissed and made up te don't feel like the rest of the Horde races.) <br />
<br />
The problem is tho that the Alliance are actually the evil people in the WC universe.<br />
<br />
The orcs didn't want to come to Azeroth, they were dragged here by a demon's bidding.  After they released the curse, all the orcs wanted to do was find a spot to hang out, and the humans (being the typical humans they are), refuse to let anyone different than them coexist on the same planet.  Go thru the WC3 campaign...by TFT, the orcs are completely out of it.  They don't wanna fight, they just want to be left alone, and humans keep instigating shit.<br />
<br />
It's kinda the same for the Forsaken too.  They used to be human, but now they're free willed undead.  They'd go back to their lives if they could, but humans would naturally slaughter them.  So they lose out too.<br />
<br />
2) We hit most of the branches while falling out of the ugly tree. We have no cute race. We have no good looking race. <br />
<br />
My ass.  Orcs and Tauren look badass as all hell.  UD are a close 2nd.  Plus they run far more manly than that human male run.  /shiver.<br />
<br />
The only thing it proves is that there's way too many manginas these days.  Especially since my wife plays a tauren and an orc and has absolutely no desire to go alliance whatsoever.  If my wife can do it, all the adolescent boys can do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its in the game, just not used well. Heck I do missions for humans (as an undead) working for the argent dawn often now. They see the Scourge as the big threat its is. And while the NPCs can band together to fight it, we PCs are too stupid to do so.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry, I was impricise. Good looking as in pretty/appealing to the eye. We have no real eyecandy. (An upright posture would help the Forsaken alot, imho.)<br />
<br />
And from what I can tell we Horde have better jokes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Human males have the best jokes. It is known.<br />
<br />
also, yes, the stuff involving the Argent Dawn and the Fallen Hero of the Horde are nice, but they're rare and ephemeral. some way to effectively communicate temporarily with what you have in game would rule a lot.<br />
<br />
additionally, there are far too many manginas, but there are also generally far too many night elves. I'm tellin you, man - vampires if you want equal numbers.</div></div><hr />

Alliance has one mail class. Horde has two, shaman and hunter.<br />

I personally like the way the horde looks, but since there's no half-elves in WoW, I had to settle on human =(<br />

Horde sure is fun to kill though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Weeel, the alchemists are constantly working on trying to create a plague with which to wipe out humanity, so they are not exactly 'live and let live' types. I think it's glaringly clear from all the undead sponsored quests that they are evil. <br />
<br />
Just think of the quests you get from the Undead - get plague components, try out new poison on dogs, wipe out the humans, kill someone's wife in revenge, kill a family for taking over an undead's home...</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking the OP is saying that the Horde only have one class who can wear mail right away..that's the warrior, the alliance have two, warrior and paladin...at the end though, alliance have 3 mail classes (Warr, Pal, Hunter) and the Horde have 3 aswell (Warr, Hunter, Shaman)...<br />

If they want eye candy for the horde, there was talk of the blood elves being added...don't know what effect that would have though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its unfortunate that folks want to look at one side or the other as good or bad.  (well its kind of fun when you pvp P)  Blizzard has gone out of its way in the games, and books, to portray both sides as having good and evil aspects, with many shades of gray in-between.  That's what makes the Warcraft world so interesting.  The only real &quot;bad guys&quot;, are the Burning Legion.  I play alliance because that's where all my friends went.  Honestly if they went Horde I would have went there in a hearbeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went alliance because the tram is cooler and they had gnomes. I made a gnome rogue with engineering so I could be James Bond Jr. and get all the middle school hussies.<br />
<br />
Also, I hated the way horde characters looked in armor. My undead warrior during beta looked like some wild deathrocker with crappy torn armor. Humans actually look bad ass in platemail (assuming it isn't mismatched bullshit).<br />
<br />
If I could have played a goblin on Horde, then I'd be all over it.</div></div><hr />

Blood Elves wouldn't fit into the horde really. Goblins, eh, maybe for a long shot, but the blood elves sorta hate everyone, since they're techinally following Illidan, who serves the Burning Legion =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, i'm playing alliance because my friends are alliance. But hey, i like forests, so night elves aren't that bad i guess. Can't say they look that good though. I like dorfs too, because of all the snow n junk...and their look and accent kick ass. <br />
<br />
But having read the lore and played WC2 and 3...damn, the tauren and orcs aren't evil, they're nice! And undead..well, who can blame them after what happened. Not sure about trolls, but it doesn't seem like they have bad intentions either.<br />
<br />
Now humans...damn them. Kill orcs, kill undead, we're the best...omg just die! Especially paladins, i can't stand them. They're stuck up and ignorant, almost like americans irl. Grrr...<br />
<br />
And yes, there are decent humans, evil orcs, and decent americans. But the majority of them aren't :P<br />
<br />
Oh, and...i'd play a horde any day. They're not evil, undead /dance kicks ass, tauren are cute and have 5% hp bonus...In fact i'll probably be making horde characters on another server at some point.</div></div><hr />

Way off topic and probably shouldn't be in this forum to begin with.  I'd apperciate it if you'd keep your negative views of americans out of here, even if you're american.  Because my experience has been that for the most part most americans are pretty decent individuals.  And I really don't think anyone wants to see you and I debate the topic.

It's almost appropriate because the conversation has steered towards preconceptions based on very little fact.<br />

Exactly. Rogues have absolutely no escape option besides vanish or sprint in group PvP, and with Vanish being a broke piece of shit now, rogues are going to have a helluva time playing the corpse runner on the battlefields.</div></div><hr />
