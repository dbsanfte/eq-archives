I just wanted some info before i ran into battle blindly. I cant find any decent information about these guys anywhere...<br />
<br />
Can you please help me out with some info like the Average HP they had and how hard they hit with and without Defensive Disc?<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing heh, can you tell me what kind of group setup did you guys use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janus_Eci</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I recall,<br />
<br />
Max hit was somewhere between 800 and 1000 not defensive<br />
Max hit was somewhere between 500 and 600 defensive<br />
They were not slowable<br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly how many hp they have but I think it took three to five minutes to beat one down with around 18 people 58 to 65, more heavily weighted towards level 61ish.  Charming those frogs for pets helps a lot with DPS, but we didn't have that option that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlea</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They all proc an AE wind attack which hits for successively times for low damage. I think around 100 to 150dd per hit. This attack has a rather low radius, casters can easily move out of AE range and still be in casting range to heal etc. The attack can be resisted, I'm not really sure anymore but I think it's magic based.<br />
<br />
Originally only the sea giant minis in PoS were using this AE attack but when we last did the PoS minis about a month ago suddenly all of them, forest and desert minis too, were able to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend 2 groups if not 3. They can be a pain and I've wiped with 2 groups of 65...rotten luck played a big part, but why take the chance.<br />
<br />
The hits mentioned above are pretty much right. They're not really that tough but the bigger the tank the better. Whats yer lvl/ac/hp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed one the other night, everyone was level 65 &amp; we had 2 warriors, 2 clerics, wizard, mage, chanter, shaman &amp; an uncooperative charmed tree :p<br />
<br />
The wizard died like halfway through the fight (noobah :p) &amp; the mage was oom with no clarity when the fight started &amp; itwas pretty close, mana was almost an issue for the clerics + both were in 4800 range in terms of mana pools + ft15.  I wanna say the fight took 5-6 minutes.<br />
<br />
I'd say 15-18 people all lvl 65 would have a much easier time, as you'd probably have enough dps to kill it before defensive wore out.<br />
<br />
They rampage btw, so make sure you got a rampage tank + healer &amp; get rampage set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DennyDarksavior</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow thanks you guys :D <br />
<br />
I finally got back from work and reading all this makes it easier for me to take them on.<br />
<br />
My guilds mid sized. the average of the guild would most likely be at 60. Me being one of the highest in there. Recently our MT stop playing his main and played his alts thus allowing me to rise up! muahahhaha. Anyways I'm planning to take these Giants on consisting of 3 groups...<br />
<br />
How many clerics would you guys recommend me having in my Cheal Rotation?<br />
<br />
This is our first time trying something like this. We've taken the Umbral Plain bosses down with ease. So its kinda a good step for us :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazthet</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just got 2 down two days ago, two of the desert ones.<br />
<br />
I tanked them as a 60 warrior with 6k3 hps buffed and a bit over 1300AC. We had only 2 65 clerics and one 60 shaman as healers, and mana was still ok at the end of both fights (Well at least one fo the fight :p).<br />
From my log, max hit under defensive was around 700, max hit without was 986. They rampage, sometimes flurry, and enrage at the end of the fight. And they also procs these lovely litlle storms that spam hits for 200 max for a short period, then poof.<br />
Best strat is to keep the giant away from casters, at max range from healers. 2 reasons for that, the first being to avoid aggro of the spawned storms on the casters, and the second being as I learned painfully on the second named to keep the healers away from the rampage area, or they will be pushed out of heal range ...<br />
We had almost 3 groups to kill them, with 2 wizards 1 mage 1 monk and 1 rogue.</div></div><hr />

Group DS on everyone.<br />
<br />
No more will I be telling you on this :p</div></div><hr />

Each of the different giant mini types (ocean, forest, desert) have their own fun little proc that you need to be aware of.  IMO the Ocean Giants are the biggest pains because of that fookin fd proc ability that they have, plus they seem to hit harder.  Desert Minis proc a 1k or 1500dd, but nothing too much to worry about other then that.  The Forest Minis proc is ridiculously useless against a warrior, but make sure he stays off your casters as they proc a mana tap.  If all you want is to farm them for your medals I'd say stick with Forest and Desert minis when you can, they're the easiest.<br />
