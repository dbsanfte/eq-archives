Ok Sam,  that is the warrior you want to strive for,  I'm not 100% sure all the prices of everything on your server,  but expect to be laying down.... at least 3,000,000 plat for that,  a few things you can do yourself such as the mask,  the necklace,  the arms,  the BP, and probably the bracers.   Btw for the arms,  the only reason I reccomend them is becuase the regen on them is very nice,  there are more better arms out there that you could prolly attain,  but yeah that magelo up there is what you want,  it has DPS, AGGRO, and HP.<br />
<br />
And in the case of the necklace I think you would find that fight extremely fun,   Va'Dyn,  oh yeah he's got what?  400k hp?  Good way to &quot;Test your burst dps&quot;  effects out on a mob with tons of HP who hit's like a moss snake.<br />
<br />
On the subject of the farwater,  the rings,  and the bow,  I'm not entirely sure on the state of guilds in elementals on SZ,  but if there are 2 or 3 that will cost you a lil more than you might like to pay,  but the end results will be very very nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
IF you have any comments or question just post them under here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I gots the food, cloak and ears already.<br />
<br />
The BP is selling for 69K right now and i have 30K in the bank so thats not impossible. That face item is like 18K.... Helmut is 100k, the rings have never been for sale on SZ. The top craftsperson has failed 5 in a row on them...  I am thinking of spending my money on another FT2 bracer for my cleric, can't have to much regen there.<br />
<br />
Hands are about 75K<br />
Boots 55K<br />
Bow is 55K (humm was 100K just a week ago)<br />
<br />
<br />
Naturally those are all good items you have picked, its a matter of time... I generate a crazy amount of cash.<br />
<br />
Once I can kill mobs like Dakui Supplier or Armorur I'll be able to get ornate, even if I get a ornate I can't use I can sell it and buy something i can use... <br />
<br />
Right now its get to level 65 and start pharming......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I could post a magelo of mid lvl upgrades for you,  I figgured I'd just put all the upgrades that you should really strive for into one magelo so you can compare to current kit,  I'd say as quick as you can get rid of your current helmet and the chardokb bracer,  both are a drag on hp's ect</div></div><hr />
