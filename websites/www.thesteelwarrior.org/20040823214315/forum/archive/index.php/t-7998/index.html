<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nelkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is there going to be any new LDON armor coming anytime in the near future?<br />
<br />
if so how many points will it cost? if u have any idea?<br />
<br />
thanks to all who reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends who you beleive. Both Gemdiver (from Graffe's) and Raaj came back talking about a new level of LDoN armor. SOme dev in the EQLive monk section said he knew nothing about a new LDoN armor set. Since not having a new set screws the non-raiders (despite SOEs turning over a new leaf) I am inclined to beleive the dev.<br />
<br />
I already know one person with type 8 augs and no place to slot them. That will become a lot more common after OOW comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">supposedly a higher cost is in the works. backburner or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They did have the 'of rage' line in game for aabout a week or so... the chain stuff all had different stats and i think 5 extra HP 5 less mana... was same as the normal tier 4 armor cost wise, but it was available throughout all the camps (not camp specific)...  However these were removed from the game and it was stated that they were released earlier than they should have been, so hopefully they'll be bringing them back at some point in the future.  Not great, but they looked to be more melee oriented than the standard stuff, but if you've already got the Royal Attendant stuff you probably wouldn't want to spend all those points for 5 extra hp :(  Of course the stats could change...</div></div><hr />

thank you for info.<br />
<br />
i hope new stuff comes out.<br />
<br />
You have to consider that one of the devs may have a reason to not expulge info about new ep quality armor whereas gemdiver or raaj really would have no reason to lie.<br />
<br />
lets hope its true i sure would like a new set i already have 8k ldon points saved.<br />
<br />
anyone else hear anything? or have an opinion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spoke to both Brenlo and other developers about this.  There will be no new LDON gear until after Omens of War.  The ease with which most people are finishing normal adventures doesn't make the risk worth the reward even if it does take a long time.  While I would like to see either a point-based system for LDON hard adventures, or the sewer / mountain trials in GoD, it doesn't appear we will see any point system in either old-world, GoD, or Omens of War.<br />
<br />
It's a mistake if you ask me.  Point based systems are a great improvement to loot in Everquest and it is a shame SOE doesn't capitalize on it more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats a shame really, too bad the mantra isn't frustration vs reward which, as has been mentioned here before, would be more inline with current everquest reward system. Thanks for the info, Loral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">THere have been plenty of ideas dealing with the silly (currently) risk v reward in LDoN.<br />
<br />
1) First there needs to be a medium setting.So that if my 1376 AC self does not a perfect group we are not forced into a normal where the &quot;rewards&quot; typically go for tribute. And people are scared of hards. Its difficult to find agroup willing to do them. (I am still considered low HP for them apprently :-/.)<br />
<br />
2) If you want EP stuff not to be grindable out of normal missions (which I like as an idea) then make it so that you have to do medium or hard to earn points for it. But there needs to be EP class gear avalible to non-raiders. <br />
<br />
3) The picture could change with 70th an OOW, but I have the feeling that it will be a sparce upgrade path between Ornate and whatever we can get next as non-raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, I feel the same way.  I like occasional LDoN's, but not enough to spend my time grinding out enough points to buy the existing armor, let alone anything else they might add in the future.  (btw, I have about 140 wins atm, so I have spent a lot of time there)<br />
<br />
Yes, the reward is ok, but it's incredibly boring for me to continually do the same thing over and over and over (yes, the scenery is a little different, but it's the same thing - collect or assasinate x number of mobs.)  <br />
<br />
I also think SoE is missing the boat a bit on the risk vs. reward issue because for most people it's more like 2 hours to get 50 points as opposed to 30 minutes to get 100.  I'm including startup and selling time in the 2 hours.  Yes, if you have a set group of uber equiped people you can churn through hard adventures in 30 minutes or so, but that's not the case for the vast majority of the player base.</div></div><hr />
