(well crap the site is running to slow for me to get the direct link, but you just click on the link at the top then pick the OoW partial map set and move the files you download into the maps folder in your EQ directory and make sure to replace the existing files. )<br />
Also, if you do it while ingame, if you are in zone_A and add a map for zone_A then zone and come back to zone_A the map won't be there.. you have to be in a different zone than the map you are trying to upload or else it will keep &quot;updating&quot; your map to the empty file that it starts out with when you zone in.<br />
<br />
But beware, about a million other people are trying to get the maps now too so the site is running very slowly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendler</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Baadan, you mention that we need to replace existing files in map directory.  Why is that since all we are doing is adding some to it?  Can you explain to this noob please?=)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinmari</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to replace them because there are some files in there with the same name but with zero byte size (empty)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep - EQ creates empty .txt files for the zones so it has someplace to put the mapping info already in existence when if you decide to make your own. You can still add to the maps you add with this download (to mark spawns and such if you wish).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to zones, any particular reason most people, on my server at least, have been going to Wall of Slaughter rather than the Ruined City of Dranik to hunt?  My very limited information suggests they're similar level wise.  <br />
<br />
This seems like a small expansion, especially for one that introduced L70 and thus the need for many new grind areas.  Only 9 non instanced zones and then a few instanced?  Whatever happened to Kunark, Luclin, and PoP sized expansions?  :p  I count 19 full sized zones in PoP plus all the smaller part B zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night on drinal there were about 30 people in the ruined city. We set up camp in the north-west corner up in some building full of 67-68 mobs and I found I was getting the hell beat out of me. Most of the people in the zone were from uber guilds. I haven't been to WoS yet so I don't know if it's easier or harder, but I'd say the mobs we were killing were as hard as or maybe a bit harder than tipt, complete with fast running and chaos claws.</div></div><hr />
