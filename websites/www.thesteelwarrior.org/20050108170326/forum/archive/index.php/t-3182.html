My guild isnt active enough for me to go after any of the good stuff and pp is a problem but not a huge problem. I can probably get my hands on 20k-40k to spend right away or perhaps up to 100k if I work some weeks.<br />

I am guessing some of you will say get another Bloodmetal earring instaed of the Rage one, but my STA is high enough anyway to be maxed with shammy buffs and I really really really like the dex and agi bonus from the earring of rage.<br />

Your choice of pieces. Quest for the SS gaunts, those are nice upgrade. Get another bloodmetal earring. Might want to try for ornate helm/boots. and maybe greaves if you want. Would be a nice upgrade and hold you off for awhile. Drop that rage earring. Dex and agi is nice to have, but buffs fix them. Besides stat improvements from rage arent significant enough to loose a possible +20 more base hp's you would gain from the bloodmetal. Go with bloodmetal. Those improvements should hold you for a bit.</div></div><hr />

I am thinking of getting ornate aromur but it will take me a few weeks to get enough pp for the cheaper ones (bracer, gauntlets) so what should I go for first.<br />
<br />
Other upgrades I am looking at are boots of the storm and healm of zek but not sure if they are worth it.  Any help would be apreciated.<br />
