Have tried the site on my puter and as well my friends and same deal.  I Click a link I get a white page with random letter/garbage.  I then  hit Back then Forward and the proper gear shows .... Most times.  <br />
<br />
I have tried to correct the problem and have emailed Megelo and gave up on hearing any responce long ago.<br />
<br />
My own Megelo has been un updated in 5 lvls due to the fact that i cant get there main site to load even with my back/ forward  trick.  Just page after page of garbage.  1 in 10 I can see the Frames load but no link nada.  <br />
<br />
These are my questions:  <br />
<br />
My the only one having or had these problems?<br />
What can I do to fix the problem or at worse work around it?<br />

Just keep hitting refresh until it loads, can take over 10 tries.  Though lately I've had no problems anymore.  I now use magelo update to sync, so I'm not sure if I would still have a problem if I tried to load the site anymore.</div></div><hr />

Have all sorts of similar issues when browsing through a proxy from work, for which there are fixes via IE settings, but I'm too lazy to look them up and usually just bypass the proxy.</div></div><hr />

Internet Explorer 6 <br />
<br />
There are few things you need to check with IE 6... in no particular order: <br />
<br />
- Make sure you keep up with the latest IE 6 with critical updates from Microsoft (Tools -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Scan for updates). Make it a habit to check this at least once a week for maximum compatibility. <br />
<br />
- Make sure Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Use HTTP1.1 through proxy connections is checked ON (ie. checkmarked). Use HTTP should also be ON. <br />
<br />
- You should have your Security and Privacy levels set to medium. If it's higher or custom, make sure you know exactly what are the consequences (trying to set back to medium is a good idea to be sure it doesn't come from here). Medium high should be acceptable. Magelo does use a cookie to automatically log you in whenever you visit. <br />
<br />
- If you are using something like Norton Internet Security or Zone Alarm (its privacy settings), make sure you configure it properly to work with Magelo (see Zone Alarm or Norton HOWTOs in the library). <br />
<br />
- Clear your browser cache when you suspect IE is messing up (eg. displaying an old page or an empty dropdown list). Here's how: Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Delete Files. <br />
<br />
- To keep IE's cache manager from outsmarting itself, set Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Every visit to the page. This will go a long way towards allowing you to see the web content you've selected all the time, and not something else. <br />
<br />
- Finally, make sure you don't disable Javascript in the Advanced section of Tools -&gt; Internet Options. (hmm, where is it?) <br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

Thats the magic ticket. I had the same problem a few months ago and the allowing of proxy connections fixed it.</div></div><hr />
