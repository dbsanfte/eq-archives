<br />
1. can spawn him any day as long as the rings have been done in under 24 hours.<br />
<br />
2. same as above but hes only spawnable every 3 days.<br />
<br />
3. can spawn him any time as long as all the rings are down.<br />
<br />
we actually spawned him last week but didnt realize it since some ppl had done the rings the night before and we didnt know about it. started in halfway on vine ring when someone says hes up and its already too late.<br />
<br />
i hear its 50 min to kill him as well, scoped it out might take a try or two to beat that time limit. question though, can he despawn while you are fighting him like bert?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well all i know is u can pop the &quot;Fake Arbitor&quot; and get the flag.<br />
Kinda like the Fake Exiled/Glyphed in SSRA.<br />
<br />
As for the Cycle ... Dunno for US servers.  But for Euro server it verified to be :<br />
<br />
The Arbitor (Fake of Real) can be poped if all rings are killed within 48h.<br />
<br />
We killed (we cant do a 1 day clear, too many ninja campers):<br />
Day 1 : Ring 1 Ring 2 Ring 4<br />
Day 2 : Croc Ring 3 + Fake Arbitor (got flags, no loot)<br />
<br />
Maybe its 72max or 48 max, but we do it in under 30H<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the 50 mins, that is correct, he depoped on use after a wipe to a bugged Ring 4.<br />
<br />
Once you enter the lair of the croc, and reach the Xroad.<br />
He's on the far right tunnel (at least thats the way we go)<br />
<br />
Fun Fight for people with low resists.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wish they'd fix this remarkably shitty EarthB key acquisition process and give us something that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have to do 4 rings (can be duplicates) to spawn Arbiter.  Unless you're doing 4 rings within a timespan of 2 weeks the time you did the rings does not really matter.<br />
<br />
It helps if you've guilds on your server doing the rings for loot and not Arbiter to save you the boredom of doing 4 rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you saying every 4th time rings are completed (even say mud ring 4 times in a row) the arbitor pops regardless of time between ring clearings?<br />
<br />
I assume arbitor will only pop once every 3 days regardless ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes gallerus.<br />
<br />
4 rings completed (any 4) spawns the arbitor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The PH for Arbiter (A Lesser Arbiter of Earth) will pop if the real one isn't up.  He has no loot but still hands out flags like the real one.  Identical abilities as far as I can tell.  In fact you can do something like kill Peregrin's PH 4 times and get the PH Arbiter and still get your flags that way (assuming flags are what you're after).<br />
<br />
I have seen Arbiter pop from doing 4 rings that are spaced out well over 4 days.  If there's supposed to be a timeframe to do all 4 rings it must be so long to be irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On our server (kane bayle),<br />
we had a guild kill 3 rings the day before (Vine, Mud, Rock),<br />
so we decided to do Vine ring again, since Dust was bugged.<br />
<br />
This means within 2 days, rock, mud, vinex2 was done.<br />
The arbitor didn't pop.<br />
<br />
sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a bug to me Bunnie. 4 rings, any 4 as people have said spawn Arb or Lesser Arb. Arb only spawns once every 3 days fake arb can be popped every day I think. I don't think you can do multiple lesser arbs in 1 day but not sure. 45-50 minutes I think is time on Arb staying up once popped.<br />
<br />
We get along well with other elemental guilds on our server. Everyone takes their turn and always gets loot rings and loot arb.</div></div><hr />
