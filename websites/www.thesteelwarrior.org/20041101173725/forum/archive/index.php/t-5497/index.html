<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">after a streak of lucky wins in tactics, i've found myself with some extra cash to spend.  i've saved up about 55k so far and have a 15k item which i'm not using to sell.  anyways prices on mithaniel marr are following<br />
<br />
primordial driftwood- 55k<br />
obsidianwood- 70-80k<br />
stonewood- 90-105k<br />
featherwood (rarely ever for sale)- 80-100k<br />
<br />
anyways, i'm leaning towards primordial driftwood, because it seems i get the most bang for my buck, but after looking at other magelos, my MR seems to be abismally low, in which case the featherwood would be extremely nice.  all in all i'm unsure as to which bow would be best for me.  they all have nice stats (not to mention the 100 raw hps), so i'm at a loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">make some friends in an ep guild, they can farm stuff to make poe bows while xping - most people got a ton of that crap rotting in the bank cause they are too lazy to do anything with it (I know I do :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got Featherwood because of the MR but they all have one good resist. Most people like stonewood for the AoB but really any of them put 100hp in your range slot and that's what's important I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would not break the bank for an Earth or Air bow. Go with the cheapest you can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went with Stonewood, which I got for 85k (I'm on Mith Marr too)<br />
<br />
the 15sta, 10str and AoB effect are extremely nice to have. Also, the Featherwood's proc is MINUS 200 hate. That sure would suck when you're trying to get aggro from the puller by popping some arrows into it on inc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">go with neither! scalecracker!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a Featherwood for a very long time... loved it, then got the opportunity to upgrade to a stonewood for 10k and went for it.  Pretty much same stats, but gained that extra 10 atk and 2 per tick regen.<br />
<br />
All of em are very nice, I like Featherwood and Stonewood most, but with max sta it don't really make that much of a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless of what Lucy says or what you may have been told, the Featherwood will still pull mobs off of your puller with a proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bows proc so rarely it isn't worth thinking about.  I have Stonewood but I have an EP flagged friend who helped with that.  All things being equal, take the AoB and stamina off Stonewood.  More importantly, get what you can afford, they are all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used to use the Stonewood and liked it very much, but I find the 35 MR from the Featherwood much handier for MT&quot;ing.  I no longer need ferocity to cap my MR, freeing up a buff slot on some fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had a featherwood before Stonewood also and have to say I did like the 35 MR much more than the 35 disease. <br />
<br />
I was sitting at 200 MR unbuffed before and would not need to get a MR buff in most situations. It was nice not being slown on adv's and what not. Other than that I like the AoB on the stonewood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;most people got a ton of that crap rotting in the bank cause they are too lazy to do anything with it (I know I do )&quot;<br />
<br />
AHHHHH!<br />
<br />
Fiend Gut perhaps?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i'm not an officer - they loot the tradeskills drops on our raids.  They are no doubt rotting in THEIR banks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">100hp range is teh win. Not having to swap in a bow for tagging is teh win. Everything else is just gravy. If you have equal to or better than the best possible tradeable item in every slot, go with the Stonewood for the AoB. Otherwise, get the cheapest one and save your plats for another upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Get Sekrits and pull with incite $$<br />
But for the bows, whatever is cheaper, grab it</div></div><hr />
