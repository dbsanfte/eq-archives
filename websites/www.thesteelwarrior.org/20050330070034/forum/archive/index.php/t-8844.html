<br />
Currently I have been doing PoI - I have a 51 magician that I DS the war with, and then leave the war ungrouped and heal with the 65 cleric.  Cleric tosses a mark on mob beating on warrior, every now and then tosses a vie on war, so basically has a 59 pt damage shield.  <br />
<br />
Anywhere where mobs don't run is great.  Velks is starting to peter out, been getting better experience at PoI entrance so far, but looking for more options.  Someone had mentioned in another thread that PoN is good, to spawn the werewolves and fight them since they don't run for hedge event. <br />
<br />
Any other good spots?  Looking for mobs that hit anywhere from 150's to 300's, preferably outdoor zone so cleric can sit on horse, somewhere preferably where they don't run.  I know PoI begin to go light blue around 62 - 63, so looking somewhere post PoI.  I tried ME for a bit doing gorangas, would just pull 3 - 4 or even 5 or 6, let them beat on the war so damage shield would whittle away at their hp, and then just occasionally toss a CH on war, however they are going to go light blue also, and exp doesn't seem quite as good as PoI.</div></div><hr />

Nothing on the first floor runs and its almost all single pulls. Had cleric pacify some of the double pulls. I was grouped w/him so the xp wasn't best, but it's not too bad either. Move up to the 2nd floor if you want higher level mobs, but beware the that casters (naked snakes) WILL run or gate if you pull them far from spawn. Chance at emp key parts and horses there too.</div></div><hr />

I have EVB items, so should be easy to get there.  Do the snakes see through invis or anything?  Anything else to watch out for?</div></div><hr />
