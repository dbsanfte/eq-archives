Metal and Soapstone you have to go deep for of course - both drop from Hraquis.<br />
<br />
One semi decent group can easily farm the gills - the metal/soapstones you are going to need a good one to get. Its also some of the best xp I've found, we used to bang out AAs in around 25-30 mins. I'd suggest a cleric/bard/shaman/warrior/2 others is a great deep group - my usual group was cleric/bard/shaman/paladin/me and whoever else we had available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, Farwater has a VERY high trivial and has a pretty high fail rate. This means that you will have to farm a ton of temper ingredients.<br />
<br />
Second, there is always at least 1 ingredient that is rare and considerably harder to get than the other items. In this case, soapstones and e'cian ice are the hard parts to get, they only drop deep in PoW from the Hraquis.<br />
<br />
The problem with PoP smithing is that you need a temper for every sub combine as well as the final combine. In the case of a 1 sheet item (bracer) you will need a total of 4 povarian mist tempers - 1 to make the e'cian ice scales, 1 to make the chain joining, 1 to make the sheet of e'cian ice, and 1 for the final combine. For pieces that require more than 1 sheet, you will have to add another temper to make each sheet - a BP will take 6 tempers to make.<br />
<br />
You will also need to farm a truckload of e'cian ice as well. For a 1 sheet combine, you will need a total of 4 chunks of e'cian ice - 1 for the chain joining, 2 for the sheet, and 1 for the emblem of water. A BP (3 sheet combine) will take 8 chunks of e'cian ice assuming no fails.<br />
<br />
For the effort it takes to make a single piece of Farwater plate, you could easily have farmed ornate pieces in BoT or the Tower of Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />
