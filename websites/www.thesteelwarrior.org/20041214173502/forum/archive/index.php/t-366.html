In all honesty i am very confused about some things about warriors.  One thing that i have always wondered about is this disc. thing people talk about. I have always played casters and this is why i am a bit confused. Any info will be much appreciated :) .<br />

<br />
A discipline (called disc by 99.99% of EQ population) will enable<br />
the warrior to adopt a specific fight style.<br />
<br />
That fighting style will vary depenting on the situation.<br />
<br />
- You can hit more often<br />
- You can hit harder<br />
- You can get missed more often<br />
- You can get hit for less<br />
- You can block all melee hits in front of you<br />
<br />
<br />
**Small example**<br />
<br />
When fighting &quot;The Hulk&quot; you want to avoid his hits<br />
(1 hit and your dead, so you better not get hit)<br />
<br />
When fighting &quot;Bruce Lee&quot; you want to be able to endure his hits<br />
(caus he's gonna hit you a billion times anyway, useless trying to avoid)<br />
<br />
The EQ world ressembles closely to that example.<br />
Depending on what you fight, how you fight it, you may need to use a &quot;special&quot; style. <br />
<br />
That &quot;special style&quot; is a fighting discipline, also known as disc.</div></div><hr />

Each ability allows us as warriors to perform better at one aspect of our class. The most common discipline, defensive, allows us to mitigate damage against us for about 3 minutes, however we cannot activate it for another 10 minutes and 30 seconds after the discipline has been activated, a real time downtime of about 7:30 minutes.<br />
<br />
The disciplines we gain follow this pattern. (copy and pasted from casterrealm)<br />
<br />
LEVEL 30: THE DISCIPLINE OF RESISTANT <br />
LEVEL 40: THE DISCIPLINE OF FEARLESS <br />
LEVEL 52: THE DISCIPLINE OF EVASIVE <br />
LEVEL 53: THE DISCIPLINE OF CHARGE <br />
LEVEL 54: THE DISCIPLINE OF MIGHTY STRIKE <br />
LEVEL 55: THE DISCIPLINE OF DEFENSIVE <br />
LEVEL 56: THE DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS <br />
LEVEL 57: THE DISCIPLINE OF PRECISION <br />
LEVEL 58: THE DISCIPLINE OF FELL STRIKE <br />
LEVEL 59: THE DISCIPLINE OF FORTITUDE <br />
LEVEL 60: THE DISCIPLINE OF AGGRESSIVE</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Disc is best for increasing your DPS over time?  I mean, if I am trying to increase my DPS over an LDON adventure, say for a slaughter mission, which offensive disc should I be using?<br />
<br />
Also, which disc is best for a simple one time burst of the most possible damage?<br />
<br />
I tried to use this thread to answer these questions, but both links seem to be deleted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only the truely uber people can tank stuff with that.<br />
<br />
Burst DPS = Mighty strike, each hit is basically x 4 dmg, it only lasts a few seconds though.<br />
<br />
If you really gotta have that 1 CH land and it doesnt look like its going to then /disk furious and riposte all hits for almost the entire cast time of CH.<br />
<br />
If the mob has a really high damage bonus and low damage interval then the best bang for your buck tanking is /disk evasive<br />
<br />
If the mob has a really low damage bonus but high damage interval then the best bang for your buck tanking is /disk defensive<br />
<br />
Others I dont see getting a lot of use.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fellstrike is the discipline that makes your weapon damage 4x its base damage, not Mighty Strike :) And since its reuse time is less than 30min, you can use it when you tank without the neg effects of Aggressive, tho it only lasts like 8-10 secs vs 3min of Aggressive. Both have the same reuse time or very close. So I would use Aggressive when not tanking and Fellstrike when tanking :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally always use my Charge discipline when not tanking (makes you never miss a swing). On a 2hs w/ haste its real nice, you pump out the damage like whoa. &amp; it comes back in about 15 mins @ lvl 65, so its pretty good.</div></div><hr />

And for burst dps, there's nothing that beats it that I've seen.  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a list somewhere of the damage bonus vs. damage interval of the various high-end mobs in each expansion?  My guild is just starting to tackle Vindi (no, we're not uber), and with Defensive on he took me down in 8 seconds (unhealed).  Now, that's not a bad no-heals survival time against Vindi, but I'm wondering if Evasive would've let me live another couple of seconds...<br />

Obtained: level 58<br />
Effect: Your base weapons damage is multiplied by 4. Lasts for 12 seconds, base reuse of 30 minutes (28 minutes @ level 60).<br />

From the Library, just to clarify, cause its not &quot;close to an hour&quot; , Mighty Strike, on the other hand:<br />

<br />
Mighty Strike <br />
Obtained: level 54<br />
Effect: All of your successful hits are critical hits. If you're beserked, your hits become crippling blows. Lasts for 10 seconds, has a base reuse of 60 minutes (54 minutes @ level 60).<br />

Is &quot;close to an hour&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

I know the reuse is 1hour. But it has saved my group a few times because every hit with mighty strike is a crit. Now comes the fun part..... Being on PK server having some one PKing you then you go beserk and then pop mighty strike. Thanks  for the pp. have a nice day. OMG some one give me a bandaide !!<br />
I use defensive most of the time tho. I like that its only like 8 minutes till i can reuse it. i use that more often than any other deisc. Like when we are doing LDON and i am mass pulling and chanter is mezzing. I pop this becuase i know the cleric i am with wont use a heal over time because &quot;I dont have a good one yet. hehe&quot; For the love of god. Any heal over time is better than. oops you died sorry Conanix. or Well that sucked we just wiped because the cleric died. *shakes his head*</div></div><hr />
