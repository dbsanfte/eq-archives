anyone else find this laughable? they have a minion they can send to death(get out of death free), gate(get away while group bites it), invis(safe travel)<br />
<br />
some of the best solo farmers, can do great amount of things thru their pet and themselves.... but they bitch about becoming less effective in GoD, when there are people who can get brought down to 15% by green mobs 2 zones away from natimbi, this is like complaining you 6 thousand $ watch doesnt jump up and give you a high five when your team makes the point, and going as far as to hire someone to debate it with soe? maybe the suttalties are lost on me, but this seems ludicris<br />
<br />
complaining about wizzys short term damage? that is what there class is, fast acting microwaves!<br />
<br />
asking for geomancer abilitys? only if we cut your mana bar into tiny little bits, in lore geomancers get tired VERY easy, your a mage, you redirect these forces, you dont become one with them, spoiled is spoiled rotten here</div></div><hr />

<br />
A geomancer can control the powers of earth depending on their current environment. For example, if you were in a desert, you might conjure up a sandstorm or quicksand. <br />

At least that's what it was in FFV...</div></div><hr />

anyhow a geomancer is someone that becomes part  of a elemental force, eather mental(anger=fire, calm=water, very hard to control it this way), or physical, as in temporarly merging with the element, someone who becomes part of the elements in order to better direct them</div></div><hr />

if they go in water, they want fire resists, bard speed in water, if they are in fire they want to have their mana bar get larger and regen faster, if they are in air (pretty much everywhere) they want a bard speed spell to move like the wind, its all bullshit, but most of the devs play wizzys and mages.... id bet we will see zones with fire pits every 5 feet soon, and such powers inacted</div></div><hr />

There's certainly classes that do a lot of things better than mages, and no mage has said that we should nuke as good as a wizard...although I'm sure you could find a few rogue mages who think that...just like I can find a few warriors who hate how knights can take their place in PoP groups...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't we just have this discussion a couple weeks ago in the thread comparing a time equipped warrior to a mage pet?  As some one who plays a mage some(very little lately, too time limited for alts), there are some things to understand about mages.<br />
<br />
1:  We have about the worst mana regen of any pure caster.  Our self buff for mana regen does not even stack with Pot9.  Our new GoD Siphon spell that damages our pet and gives mana regen can crit nuke our pet, doing double damage!<br />
<br />
2:  We are a DPS class, but our DPS is behind other DPS classes, and we lack almost all utility.  Our mana regen form is active, meaning people actually have to remember to click the rod we give them every 5 minutes to get the benefit of(click it every 5 minutes, not give them one every 5 minutes...only every 15 minutes).  Our pet's are disliked by some melee, due to air pet's push.  We are not a terrific group friendly class like wizzies, rangers or rogues.<br />
<br />
3:  Our solo ability has decreased dramatically.  While we used to solo awesomely well, now we can solo in only limited circumstances.  The zones mages can effectivly solo in now at 65 for any kind of decent exp can be counted on the fingers of 1 hand...BoT(charm soloing, many mages choose not to do this, as mages are not well designed to survive charm breaks), Droga, Veksar, Nadox...and not much more.<br />
<br />
4:  Our raid desirability is limited.  Pet's do not survive well against large raid mobs.  People worry about out of control pets.  With rods haveing a 5 minute recast, it only takes one person to keep a raid in rods.  Our DPS is not great, but we are the only DPS class that cannot drop agro in any way(the dreaded MT down, followed by mages getting summoned in), further limiting the amount of DPS we can do.<br />
<br />
None of these things alone would be that bad, but in combination, it makes for some real issues for the mage class.  Rytan has admitted that mages are a troubles clas, and is supposed to work on some of these issues, but as usual, with no hard date, and no promises, and almost any upgrade for mages tied to new AA's.<br />
<br />
A well played mage can do amazing things, but this is true of any class.  On average, mages have small issues that could be tweeked without overpowering the class, that would help us compete more for a DPS slot in a group(soloing upgrades realistically are not going to happen).<br />
<br />
they have a minion they can send to death(get out of death free) <br />
<br />
It is more of a speedbump actually.  Think how fast you die against a PoP mob, then realize you have more hp's, more mitigation, and discs you can use.  With our pet, starting with tier 2, if you are going to use it to buy time to gate, you have to hope it enrages(and that is iffy).  If it does not, you will probably not get gate off.<br />
<br />
some of the best solo farmers <br />
<br />
Against greens and very low blues, yes.  Against anything else, druids, enchanters, necro's, rangers, wizzies, bards, shaman, BL's all solo better than mages.  Something to be proud of...'We can solo greens better than anyone else!'<br />
<br />
and going as far as to hire someone to debate it with soe? maybe the suttalties are lost on me, but this seems ludicris <br />
<br />
As I read it, the author was looking more for a spokesman for the class, kinda like Frodlin and Furor are for warriors, but more formally.  I think he was looking at something like what shaman and ranges did recently, with a class upgrade suggestion post.  Also note that not everyone there agreed with him...it is not mages as a whole, but some mages.<br />
<br />
complaining about wizzys short term damage? that is what there class is, fast acting microwaves! <br />
<br />
Most mages believe that mage nukes are about where they should be.  The complaint more accuratly put would be that in this age of huge mana regen(horse, plus C5, plus SD, plus 9, plus bard song, plus...), wizzies far outdamage mages is most situations.  Since mages bring almost nothing else to a group, how do we compete then with wizzies for group spots.  LDoN did help some with this, as no horses, moving alot, and fast pulling limited how much DPS a wizzy could do, but a mage does still have their pet's going strong the whole time for free(and much &lt;3 for my air pet in LDoN, and interupting CHing mobs), but pet push became a bigger issue(rangers hate mobs that get pushed into walls for example).<br />
<br />
Again, I don't think mages need a huge upgrade, but a few minor tweeks would do wonders to make them more group friendly, and better able to compete for that DPS slot.</div></div><hr />

Marth  <br />
<br />
thats just it, invis is 14p a shot, and its verable at least you get a decent one, gate costs 1k from a vendor and 500p player made, did you pay 500p for your gate scroll? there is no contest here, they are being greedy shits, i could understand if they went with sain ideas, or reasonable suggestions but geomancy? we are hitting the outer limits with what they want.<br />
<br />
about that minion? it costs you a few pp, about as much as 3 trash loots from LDoN, boohoo, you can have 2 if i remember right thanks to suspend... that pet tanks a quarter as well? what are you smoking here, they dont cost you exp when they die, they dont cost you much more than pocket change, they enrage when low on HP, they cast spells as they fight, you have 4 choices depending on what you want to do.<br />
<br />
hmm, to get 4 differnt effect weapons takes alot of time and effort or plat for anyone else, what is so special that you should be given things on a silver plate, by even complaining about pet tankablity shows your true colors, you are a caster, for DPS, this includes YOUR pet and YOUR pets tankability in how your class is balanced, no one should be able to do high burst damage (nukes) sustanded dmg (pet) and have tanking thru their pet, at most a class should be able to do 2 things fairly well or do 3 things really badly, but all togeather its helpful<br />
<br />
make a choice, damage, tanking, or what ever.<br />
<br />
bard speed in any place there is air, not spoiled indeed<br />
<br />
1 ungrouped warrior cant take half the shit you and your pet take, your pet is part of the balance eqation, for you to compair a pet to a warrior is fucked up, if anything it should be pet+mage when you make the compar and contrast and whine lists</div></div><hr />

<br />
Magicians have fallen far behind their INT caster counterparts, as to their WIS caster counterparts. Its kind of agrovating being a lesser part of a team. And right now, Enchanters, Wizards, and Necromancers are outdamaging Magicians. Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, Beastlords, Druids, Shamans, Shadow Knights, and Rangers are out soloing them. And I believe Beast Lord pets have been found to be stronger than Magician pets. And then they don't bring much to a raid or group to be wanted.<br />

 Warriors are ment to fight wars. Not ment to solo. Thats how its been forever. And you know that,  <br />
<br />
Warriors could very well be meant to solo, and if they are going to design one class to solo, the lazy devs could have done them all. Bet you bottom dollar a Barb will be able to solo in WoW! Only this stupid game decided they couldn't. My Barb soloes stuff very well in Diablo 2, I have an almost MAX charm from Diablo Clone. Learned my lesson when I asked for help the first two times and it was a race to see who could loot the body first. My Sorc and Necro can not do it, my Barb twinked them, what a difference. Remember any class can be designed anyway the devs want.<br />
<br />
&gt;The whole Mage bitch is a joke, hence why this is in the Outhouse. I tank 1/4 as well as Furor, I want to buy 5000pp worth of stuff to fix that too! Oh, 5k is a bit much huh, you want to buy a pet to do it.&lt;<br />
&gt;I stand by the statement 5 year old loot farmers.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Diablo 2 you can solo Uber Diablo because of how he is designed (mega regen when not in melee range, only vulnerable to magic/physical if no lower resist skills are used).  Anyway soloability isn't a huge issue anymore since the grouping bonus takes care of incentive to solo (though kiting is sometimes better than grouping depending on what groups you can get).<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the question on hand... Geomancers are probably people who are one with earth (Geo = Earth).  Actually the Elves in Takish-Hiz and the Trusiks are all Geomancers.  So their power would be most likely stuff like earthquake, sandstorms, etc.  Seeing that Earth is supposed to be one of the 4 domains a magician has access to I don't see how why Geomancers is all that more powerful than a mage.  Of course, all the Geomancers types (Trusik casters are particularly nasty, and the golems are supposed to be their pets) in the game are much more powerful than any PC mage ever will be but that's because they're NPCs.  I mean Aneuk are clerics and they melee for 1400+ once you get to Kod'taz+, and they can snare and mez too.  Or how about Mastruqs which are Warrior/Shaman combos.  Note that if Warriors get even Protection of Discord II (90% mitigation) when we berserk, we can easily solo a ton of stuff because 90% mitigation = effectively 10 times the regen, not to mention berserk at 30% = 3 times the lifebar with 90% mitigation.  So yeah there's really no particular reason why Warriors can't solo.  It's merely a game design and now the game design says no one can solo.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, GoD mobs will wipe the floor with any player 1vs1 (especially since most summon).  I don't see why Mages expect to be solo them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bazzal</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As some one that plays a War and a Mage I can give you an examples of what’s been discussed here.<br />
<br />
Zanp level 65 VT and per EP geared and 170AA<br />
Bazzal level 61 war Bazaar bought gear costing less that 50kpp and 4 AAs<br />
<br />
I when to PoJ and killed the mobs near the zone out.<br />
<br />
Bazzal could kill then solo (but buffed) with ease never loosing more that 20% of his hp<br />
<br />
Zanp focused Air pet (buffed with mages BO5 and a 45 point DS) can also kill the trash mobs at the zone in but with one or two heals from the mage. (Please note these are only just light blue mobs)<br />
<br />
And this is the sad part Zanp tanking PoJ trash mobs with the pet hitting from behind (Zanp has just over 5khp buffed about the same as my buffed focused pet) Zanp took less damage per hit and only dropped 20% of his hp.<br />
<br />
So my pet tanks worse than I do and has less hp that I do and I am wearing a dress?<br />
<br />
Add on top of that crap mana regain no real utility and no defensive spells other than gate and worse DPS of any of the pure casters you can see the problem mage face. <br />
<br />
Most mages will tell you we don’t want to see mages mage into the gods of EQ but for crying out loud Druids can have a better pet than any mage with a DC animal and let’s not even go near the pets a chanter can have. And to that the utility of other int casters snare, slow, charm (that works some where other that one zone BoT), feign death, mana buffs, evacs, fear, mezz, and I sure I have missed a bunch then mage also have to deal with been the only int caster without a way to reduce agro (ok dieing dose clear agro but craps out your dps) we also have no rune or other type of defence.<br />
<br />
But then we do have the pet to make up for all this <br />
A pet that tanks worse than I do and last without enraging about 8 seconds against XP mobs in the places I hunt.<br />
That is not welcome in a lot of raids due to many issues to list<br />
That can’t hit raid targets even if it did last long enough to do so against AoE mobs<br />
That with 60 pet buffing AA points spent will add 7% to it dps razing it to a nice average of 66dps against blue mobs.<br />
<br />
So yes mages need looking at that why I am so glad I have my war to play for fun as mages just are not fun any more.<br />
<br />
One quick note/edit i dont see any one objecting to the fact chanters wiz druids necros beastloards and a lot of others can solo well in PoP 2second tear and higher and i betting well in GoD yet mages shouldnt be able to ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try 3, if you know where to look.<br />
<br />
Mages are a lot better at sustained damage than most people give them credit for, including themselves. I think it's because of the mod rod vending machine days that mages are so rare, but they do fine damage.<br />
<br />
We have about the worst mana regen of any pure caster. <br />
<br />
Self buff (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3031&amp;source=Live) is 8 mana per tick, plus the fact that mages can use rods as well: 450 damage every 5 minutes (50 ticks) is 9 damage per tick, sitting regen is 10 (15 with their buff). The damage being inconsequential, mages can use their own rods as free mana regen.<br />
<br />
Water Elemental Form (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2800&amp;source=Live) is another kind of free mana regen. 4 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
Mystical Transvergence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2716) is 1080 mana (360 mana x3), over 15 minutes. Subtracting the 350 mana it costs to summon a rod (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3188&amp;source=Live) (400 mana base, minus 2.5% for 50 specialize conjuration, minus another flat 10% for having SCM3) leaves 730 mana over 150 ticks: 4.8 (technically I'll assume 4, since EQ truncates just about every number) mana per tick, that stacks with every single form of mana regen, and doesn't require a buff slot.<br />
<br />
That puts Mage self buffed, 0 FT/MC mana regen at 43 mana per tick: 27 medding, 8 from Xegony, 4 from Water Elemental, and 4 from rods. Rods are active mana regen, so yes you have to remember to click them as often as possible... but if any caster forgets about the rod in their inventory, they didn't need the mana that badly anyway.<br />
<br />
Elemental legs summon rods for free, increasing the mana regen from rods to 7.2, and the mage's mana regen from 43 per tick to 46.<br />
<br />

The disparity between mages and wizards is large, but compared to other casters, mages are fine.<br />
<br />
Other ways to improve:<br />
<br />
Giving mages a Vie-type pet-only buff that is even shorter term but mitigates a greater percentage - something like Slot 1: Mitigate Melee Damage (100/20/1000) - mitigating 20% of melee damage, but wears off every 8000 damage. Duration 36 minutes, so it can be up in advance if the pet suddenly needs to offtank. Increases pet tankability without boosting their hp even more or giving mages slow.<br />
<br />
Cut the mana cost of rods to 200 (which becomes 175 after 50 spec and SCM3). This gives mages an extra 2 mana per tick from rods if they summon their own, up to 45 per tick self buffed and 111 on raids.<br />
<br />
I rambled, so I could be wrong on a few things.</div></div><hr />

But this isn't Diablo or WoW. In EverQuest some classes were ment for grouping. And some were more leaned toward soloing. Some in both.<br />
<br />
Warriors are pretty much ment for grouping. They're ment to go head to head with the biggest, baddest, mobs, Gods, and anything around.<br />
<br />
Magicians lean toward solo play. Wich is something they're incapable of past 54 or so.<br />
<br />
They can solo past that level. But get no were near as good experiance as a Druid, Bard, Necromancer, Wizard, Enchanter, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
This is we're they want their fix. They don't want to be Gods. They want to be equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the way this game has been designed you cannot let a mage pet be able to tank pop mobs and up solo without slow, it would really mess things up. Hell I don't do too well myself tanking tier 2 and up unslowed and I dinged 65 a few weeks after POP was released. Slow has really fubared that department is all I can say. <br />
<br />
Having said that you are right its not fair, because you have a class like a beastlord who always has a  65% slow around at max level AND a big ass pet heal that helps their pets completely own mage pets solo. They are also a better group class because they have a slowing role (which is far more in demand on my server than pure dps like a mage which seem to be a dime a dozen), can take a hit, can do decent dps and can buff me almost as well as a shaman. <br />
<br />
Honestly I don't have a solution for that problem at the moment, but I do agree mages need something. And I am totally going to roll up a mage if they get geomancer abilities.</div></div><hr />

What mages are really lacking is a solid alternate group role, and now they're lacking much in the way of soloability.</div></div><hr />

They have also tried to count in pet procs as well as possible, too.  Though since you can't actually see how much the proc lands for, it has to be dealt with as variance.  Not including all this damage would be meaningless.  Nevertheless, mages still come up short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eagleclaw</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Magi could use some upgrades.  The way I see it, there is some wiggle room to upgrade their pets w/out encroaching on warrior territory.<br />
<br />
Magi should also go outside the box.  For instance, why do they always need 1 stone which is readily available to summon the same pet?  I'd like to see pet summoners be able to summon pets of variying strengths and abiliities based on the type of stone they use when summoned.  This could open up a whole new range of abiliities for magi.. Here's a quick brainstormed list<br />
<br />
* Stones used to summon pets could be combine using a tradeskill<br />
* This new tradeskill would be available to all classes, but magi might get some kinda advantage here.<br />
* You could combine everything from stones, to augments, to runes, etc to get different effects.  The higher level the effect, the more rare the component and the more difficult to combine.<br />
<br />
So for instance, in this case a time level magi may be able to loot drops in Time which could make a pet that's strength is relative to that of an elemental equiped warrior.  However, these drops would be sufficiently rare enough that it would be a special case use item, not a soloing item.<br />
<br />
Other items that drop may up a pets defense, mitigation, nuking ability.  Maybe a stone could be made with JC that could positively impact a pets &quot;push&quot;.  <br />
<br />
You could add utility by the type of stone you carry.  So for instance, maybe some of the components magi could combine into their summoning stone would have group buff properties... so when the pet came into existence it would radiate an AE haste, or atk buff, or HP regen, mana regen, etc.  Lots of possibilities.<br />
<br />
If a system like this were put in place, I could see where magi could start carrying around bags of components, then create their summoning stone on the spot, based on the zone or group makeup.  I think this would add a whole new dimension to the class that would make it both useful and entertaining without being overpowered.<br />

So, question for the warriors: Assume you're putting a group together for something  fairly hard (GoD level), you've already got your favorite cleric and an enchanter, and say a backup healer of some sort.<br />

Just buy an incardine BP and you have unlimited invis for the rest of your game life - yeah, costs more immediately, but think of every free invis after that...500pp for a gate potion?  Obviously, you don't keep up with the times - talk to some shaman and see about the fun new gate potions you can buy much cheaper...<br />
<br />
1 ungrouped warrior cant take half the shit you and your pet take, your pet is part of the balance eqation, for you to compair a pet to a warrior is fucked up, if anything it should be pet+mage when you make the compar and contrast and whine lists Lol...wanna bet?  Neither a warrior or a mage can do much in PoP.  Mages can chaincast pets at a mob (I.e. not nuking), in the first tier....some of the super equipped may do it in tier 2.  For the most part, though, we can't out-nuke against a mob beating on our pets 4x300 (or more), we can't keep up healing our pets due to refresh times...so, granted, our pets may be speed bumps that let us get a gate off, you just run away with your 3x as many hp, better ac, mitigation, evasion, etc...and in a pinch, go evasive or defensive and even buy more time...<br />
<br />
bard speed in any place there is air, not spoiled indeed I want some of what you're smoking...that's all...<br />
<br />
As for mage nuke damage, don't think you'll see any real serious mages complain about nuke damage.  I just parsed my logfile which is roughly 3 months worth of log, and just my nuke damage is 209dps over that time.  Add in the variable rate of pet dps - anywhere from 40-70 depending on the mob(s) over that time (average is 55-60 dps), mage dps is fine.  You'll get no argument out of me there.  However, at the upper end game, our dps is our downfall.  With no way to reduce our aggro, most times, if a mage is doing his job right, if the main tank dies against the &quot;boss mob&quot;, mages will get summoned rather quickly and munched.<br />
<br />
Beastlord pets have been parsed recently to be 69dps without mage toys on them (proccing weapons, haste mask, hp belt), and just beastlord buffs on it.  Add in the slow portion from a beastlord, the fact they are better pet healers, and it's easy to see how beastlords can solo in places mages can't - that's a pretty big beef we have too.<br />
<br />
In the end, who cares if someone wanted to appoint &quot;spokespeople&quot; for the mage community.  I don't see you hemming and hawing when Furor speaks up and complains (sometimes, rightfully so) - how is it any different?  I say remove all casting availability from all melee classes - get rid of invis potions, gate potions, etc, etc, from use for melee folks - where's my store bought evasion/mitigation/defensive/evasive/big ac potions?<br />

So again in a group, we have ONE slot for the tank, and two open (potentially) for Mages. I probably wouldn't take two Mages,but I would if I knew them both. My servers Mages a NO, ZERO, NADA problems getting groups. It is TANKS that struggle! I am INTENTIONALLY not level 65, to allow me to group with lower levels, as my Guilds of late have REFUSED to raid higher end content. So much for upgrading my equipment. <br />
<br />
&lt;Pointing out your pet does poor DPS,compared to a DC or Charmed pet, is a sure way to incurr the wrath of Warriors. The DC and Charmed pets HAVE been used to replace us in groups. I know, I have a druid, and when I have a pet charmed, my boxed Warrior is moved to a safe spot in the zone, so he DOESN'T GET HIT!&lt; DC and charm should be MORE heavily nerfed!</div></div><hr />

You haven't narrowed it down much! Add am3 rangers to that list (and if we're talking GoD-hard, they'd better) and that's half the classes in the game (ignoring Bers). More if charm's available.

This thread is kinda ridiculous as you have, at least in the original design, the class most designed to solo being critiqued by the class least able.  <br />

<br />
- powerful nukes : 2nd best non-lure nukes in game for magic and fire. they now have a lot a variety of nukes to use, efficients or powerful.<br />
<br />
- Pets and pet trick : Multi-pet, canni-unsuspend combo, a LDoN spell to save their pet from AEs, pet weapons and items, rogues pets, stunning pets...  <br />
<br />
- utility : even if its &quot;not that great&quot;, they still have the best DS, rods, focus, weapon for OTHER pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know several mages. the goods ones are wonderful, they are using their pets like they are playing 2 characters at the time, they can can burn a mob or sustain correct damage better than a wizard, and they have trick to use all their spells in a clever way. Best exemple is CoH. you can use it just to simply bring faster the late people, or you can use it the other way : with eye of zoom (to target a player to coh), to pull, to move a blinded guy... <br />
<br />
<br />
Beside, mages gain wonderful AAs with GoD. pet affinity ? mage is the only class with BST where the cost of 20 is fair, and it boost a lot pet DPS. Pet critical / Flurry / mitigation ? even more critical for nukes ?<br />
Stop kidding. Mage can use some tweaking, but they are a very powerful class if you play them well and dont expect to quad mobs in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Actually Gerick, you have to consider that Magicians are casters. They use magic.. You should be thanking SOE you can buy gate, invis, etc.<br />
<br />
Magicians have fallen far behind their INT caster counterparts, as to their WIS caster counterparts. Its kind of agrovating being a lesser part of a team. And right now, Enchanters, Wizards, and Necromancers are outdamaging Magicians. Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, Beastlords, Druids, Shamans, Shadow Knights, and Rangers are out soloing them. And I believe Beast Lord pets have been found to be stronger than Magician pets. And then they don't bring much to a raid or group to be wanted.<br />
<br />
Warriors are ment to fight wars. Not ment to solo. Thats how its been forever. And you know that,  <br />
<br />
ill agree they could use a hand, but the simple fact the guy that made the post hasnt been torn a new one shows how outlandish this is, bard speed? enviormental powers? using the earth to help you channle? come on, admit it, thats an odd request.<br />
<br />
all im saying is, i can understand augmenting their exisiting skills, hell, make them pay 60 AAs for something they should have in the first place(you warriors know what i mean) <br />
<br />
but dont go giving them FD, bard speed, and everything else, im sick of seeing something that is unique to 1 or 2 classes getting gimped out to all of them, pets can do most of the things a warrior can, even more in some cases (enrage) pets can even critcal now, i am just really sick of classes melding togeather and destroying the lines of that classes purpose, if mages got FD, then it would basically push the monks even further out of groups, if they got bard speed, they could kite all day ETC</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mages need pets that will destroy a Time equiped warrior (lets use Furor as an example) solo! The Mage should nuke better than a Wizard and be able to solo almost all mobs in the game. Thats what Mages want, thats what they USED to have (original game), and they demand it again!<br />
The majority of mages are not asking for such overpowered pets. We just want a pet that can survive, and do our bidding. Magicians are master summoners, our pets should be our weapons, currently, if we use our pets as our weapons in the high end raid game, we do less DPS than even non DPS classes, tell me, how is that balanced?<br />
<br />
they have a minion they can send to death(get out of death free)<br />
In any tier 2+ plane and pretty much anywhere in GoD, our pet's aren't even that, the other day in the sewers I saw my pet get one rounded, how is that even close to a get out of death ability?<br />
<br />
invis is 14p a shot<br />
3 plat in the Abysmal Sea.<br />
<br />
gate costs 1k and 500p player made<br />
You can make a thurg gate potion for nearly free, and the vials aren't lore, so as soon as you use it, you can remake it. This is nearly free. Looks like you are on par with the powerful desired raid ability's of gate and invis /cough.<br />
<br />
My Barb soloes stuff very well in Diablo 2<br />
Heh, last I checked Diablo 2 wasn't an MMORPG made by sony. Horrid anaolgy.<br />
<br />
So for instance, in this case a time level magi may be able to loot drops in Time which could make a pet that's strength is relative to that of an elemental equiped warrior. However, these drops would be sufficiently rare enough that it would be a special case use item, not a soloing item.<br />
That would be useless if it was rare. What if your pet dies in a raid and you are out of &quot;stones&quot;, looks like you are useless, mage.<br />
<br />
canni-unsuspend combo<br />
This was nerfed.<br />
<br />
they still have the best DS<br />
Meaningless in the high end game with the 15 buff limit.<br />
<br />
a LDoN spell to save their pet from AEs<br />
Unless the mob AE rampages often.<br />
<br />
Multi-pet<br />
These pets dont stay out very long and are very low in level, so they have a hard time hitting mobs, the damage they do isnt very great at all with the 20 minute re use timer.<br />
<br />
Pet critical / Flurry / mitigation ? even more critical for nukes ?<br />
You obviously haven't parsed these, they are less than 5% upgrades.<br />
<br />
Pets - Earth and Air can help with CC/mitigation on exp trash adds.<br />
Unless you exp in tier 3+ where pets can be easily one rounded by an unslowed mob.<br />
<br />
Magicians are master summoners. Currently, our pets are nothing more than a pathetic naked melee that only does about 50 to 60 DPS against raid mobs, and die very quickly. This need's to change, as master summoners, our pets need to be real weapons, I could care less about nukes.<br />
<br />
Please, learn what you are talking about before you post that mages are fine, because they certainly are not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D Way to work on that reading comprehension there bud. The idea was to improve current Elemental Form AA's  to actually be usefull. This doesn't mean when the Mage is standing in lava they suddenly gain mana regen, it means when the form is used the Mage turns into a Fire elemental (what they do now with the AA, imagine that:cool: ) and gain those benefits. <br />
<br />
The same with the Air and Water. They hit the Air form AA and bam, a short duration speed boost/invis, not a permanent ability when in 'the air' :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Sheesh, before you fly off your handle, get to actually reading something and comprehending it, or maybe just try to get some grip on Caster classes, something in which you seriously are lacking.<br />
<br />
Oh, and since you are so keen on it, name the Devs that play Mages and Wizards, and then the Devs that play other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think mages are going the right way about looking for some &lt;3 from SoE.  <br />
<br />
If they are jumping on the OMG Warriors got an upgrade we want one too I hope they realise it took the warrior community around 15 months to get the upgrades we were asking for, it was about a year before SoE even acknowledged we had a problem, so I hope Mages are ready for the long road of being told to &quot;STFU Whiners roll another toon if you don't like it&quot; that we had to deal with.<br />
<br />
I don't play a mage so I have no first hand knowledge of mage issues, though I do remember at the release of PoP mages were the gods of DPS.  Whenever anyone put a PoJ trial group together (when they were still hard) the first thing people asked when you invited them to the group wasn't &quot;have you got a cleric?&quot; or &quot;have you got a chanter?&quot;, it was &quot;have you got a mage?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know the OMG mages rool!!1! thing extended atleast a little beyond the trials because mages were always a popular DPS choice for PoV groups as I was levelling from 60-65.  <br />
<br />
I think they are also a popular choice for easy LDoN runs where lack of a concussion spell isnt really an issue for thier nukes and their pet adds constant DPS, mage DS is also a bonus.  Definitely more attractive to an LDoN group than a wizard.<br />
<br />
The solo thing is pretty debatable, my personal opinion is that EQ is an MMORPG and one of the M's stands for Multiplayer - If you want to solo go play Baldur's Gate, if you want to play EQ then deal with playing with other people.  As a warrior obviously I don't solo a hell of alot (though I now enjoy having Seb to myself and soloing disco's or chef room), though I also play a chanter which is a strong solo class but I still play the chanter almost exclusively in groups.  Plenty of people will disagree with me on the soloing thing though and I don't think its worth debating.<br />
<br />
Personally I reckon the geomancer / elemental forms thing is a really cool idea.  I think they are smoking crack if they expect to get SoS + bard speed from these forms as that is infringing on a couple of other classes core abilities.  Air form giving innate invis sounds fair to me, tempted to say some sort of &quot;escape&quot; effect aswell though Im sure rogues and FD classes would have a cow over mages getting that which would be fair enough too.  Water form increasing regen is all good too, maybe make water form a BoV style rune aswell.  Earth form rooting you and making you un-pushable is a very cool idea too, I'd probably make the form a 1500 or so point rune aswell which is good in that it gives the mage a rune, but not so good in that it will &quot;wear off&quot; after a bit of beating.  Increased mana regen in fire elemental form sounds cool too, if I was a dev designing this shit I'd make it like liche - turns life into mana, not sure if I'd make it big mana regen but not stack with the clarity line (35ish/tick so still behind necros) or small extra regen 5-10/tick that stacks with C.<br />
<br />
I posted my views on pet tankability in the war room so not gonna make this post any longer other than to say that the idea of a BoV type rune for pets is the best idea I've heard on the subject, I dont have a problem with something like that in conjunction with a better pet heal to help out mage pets in offtanking type roles (the mob would still need to be slowed for the pet to tank semi effectively, but the mage has some tools to keep the pet up until slow lands).<br />
<br />
I don't think its fair to jump on the mage community and call them a bunch of whiners and stuff, especially after it happened to us and we all know how it feels to be trying to get SoE to talk to us about class balance and have other classes come along and tell us to STFU etc.</div></div><hr />

Pet flurry and critical are ~5% (tops) upgrade. Face it bud: Warriors tank 25437608976 times better than Mage Pets. Mage pets **********ARE NOT*********** a get out of free card - they're a roadbump. Mages got completely assraped with the Canni-nerf (note: the Mages weren't even warned. They only found out when on the Test server, canni was fubar'd. Only after they found out, Brenlo posted on their boards. Courteous, right?)<br />

Oh, and I love how you are laughing at Mages begging for upgrades when not so long ago you were groveling to SoE for the exact same thing. Congrats on being pretty much required for every group in the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe that means you're likely to give an objective opinion?  :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was interested in the perception of mages by non-dps people. When it comes to getting groups, the perception might be more important than the reality anway. <br />
<br />
 If mages are coming up horridly short when addinf nuke + pet damage, yeah, they need a tweak. <br />
<br />
Well, I don't have any parses I'd consider highly reliable.... but my impression from them is that with a ~60 dps pet, mages aren't &quot;horridly&quot; short. I do think we're still behind rogues and wizards, but not by a ton. I'm not sure about necros/monks/rangers at all. But I'm not entirely confident in my data, so take it fwiw. If someone does have reliable parses showing I'm wrong or right here, please link. <br />
<br />
Personally I got kinda bitter seeing my best-available, focused, buffed pet get one rounded by some trashy GoD mobs. It lasts just as long as my level 4 pet would have. <br />
<br />
The visual on it in-game is of the funny/sad variety: last melee on mob dies, mob turns on pet, swings once, pet dead!  An orc pawn would survive just as long! Remember, this one-rounded pet is the reason we don't have root/snare/mes/fd/evac/rune/agro control etc.  <br />

Mages need pets that will destroy a Time equiped warrior (lets use Furor as an example) solo! The Mage should nuke better than a Wizard and be able to solo almost all mobs in the game. Thats what Mages want<br />

This is just dumb. Please go quote where mages said that. Otherwise... please stop spreading rumors. <br />

They will remind us they were PROMISED to be able to solo. The game is NOT allowed to change, they were PROMISED that ability no matter how ridiculous they must be made. <br />

about that minion? it costs you a few pp<br />
It costs us a few silvber is more like it. <br />
And what do  you know, BL pet is totatlly free!! /gasp <br />
now let me see you do a &quot;nerf nerf!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
by &quot;gerick&quot;<br />
you are a caster, for DPS, this includes YOUR pet and YOUR pets tankability in how your class is balanced, no one should be able to do high burst damage (nukes) sustanded dmg (pet) and have tanking thru their pet, at most a class should be able to do 2 things fairly well or do 3 things really badly, but all togeather its helpful<br />
<br />
<br />
For the last time, no mage is asking to do burst as a wizard. (well 99.9% of us don't).<br />
And do you even konw that fire pet is what do you call &quot;uselsss&quot; 98% of the time. <br />
earth? I am sure you know how root can screw up agro in a group since you are a warrior. <br />
<br />
So that's 2 pets out of 4 that is useful. <br />
<br />
by &quot;gerick&quot;1 ungrouped warrior cant take half the shit you and your pet take, your pet is part of the balance eqation, for you to compair a pet to a warrior is fucked up, if anything it should be pet+mage when you make the compar and contrast and whine lists<br />
<br />
What exactly are those? <br />
And I am just going to tell you this so you can go complain some more.  <br />
<br />
A wizard can kill 4 mobs at onces that each can kill Furor in a few seconds!!!!!!<br />
(so can a druid)<br />
<br />
 by &quot;Ciae Redemption&quot;<br />
Self buff is 8 mana per tick, plus the fact that mages can use rods as well: 450 damage every 5 minutes (50 ticks) is 9 damage per tick, sitting regen is 10 (15 with their buff). The damage being inconsequential, mages can use their own rods as free mana regen.<br />
<br />
You also have forgot that <br />
Put in mana cost in your calculation please. <br />
<br />
Water Elemental Form is another kind of free mana regen. 4 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't be use on horse, so anywhere outside that you can use a horse it's useless. <br />
<br />
For enchanters.... forgetting gather mana? <br />
But i agreed that mage mana  regen isn't much to complain on. <br />
<br />
For druids they can also cast spirit, they'd be rooted.. but hey. <br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1564&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
And clerics yaulp 6, basically 12/tick for 4 ticks and cost 25 mana so a net 23 mana gain ober 4 ticks around 6/tick if actively used. <br />
<br />
 by &quot;kavak&quot;<br />
Well the way this game has been designed you cannot let a mage pet be able to tank pop mobs and up solo without slow, it would really mess things up. Hell I don't do too well myself tanking tier 2 and up unslowed and I dinged 65 a few weeks after POP was released. <br />
<br />
Mage is perfectly ok with a tanking pet that does like 20-30 DPS for those mobs. <br />
remember the simple formula <br />
mob power = dps * HP <br />
Same goes for pet... if we have to scrifice dps for HP for it to tank, no problem at all, just give us that option though. <br />
<br />
But i fail to see what the big deal is given that most decent warriors will have anger augments and some sort of agro procing weapons.  Pet's agro holding (there for tanking in groups) ability is not going to touch a war. Even if it tanks semi decently.<br />
<br />
And mages have alot of suggestions of how to do that without directly boost pet HP to say 20k. <br />
<br />
One of the ideas was a DS that will slow the mob. (so a slow that only works if a mob is hitting the pet). <br />
Pet procing a short duration(like 2 ticks at most) slow around not higher than 40% slow.<br />
Another &quot;nerfed&quot; solution was have the pet proc a rune spell. <br />
And alot more mages has suggested. <br />

- powerful nukes : 2nd best non-lure nukes in game for magic and fire. they now have a lot a variety of nukes to use, efficients or powerful.<br />
<br />
Incorrect, druid has the 2nd best nuke. <br />
We are talking about DD because mage bolts doesn't hit at all in raids.  <br />
What variety? we have magic and fire. We don't have anything other than fire and magic. <br />

- Pets and pet trick : Multi-pet, canni-unsuspend combo, a LDoN spell to save their pet from AEs, pet weapons and items, rogues pets, stunning pets...<br />
<br />
If you meant multiple pet as in the AA swarm pets yes, but necro/shaman also have those. If you meant having more than 1 pet at once it was a bug and corrected very shortly after. It was in game for like 3 days. <br />
<br />
And pet canied was nerf, welcome to last year. <br />
<br />
I must admit, LDoN ( protection of calliav) is handy against ae, not like the 30~40 DPS pet's doing against those mobs is great to begin with but it helps. And Protection of CAlliav cost 500 mana to cast once. <br />
<br />
 by &quot;Kaldanm&quot;<br />
- utility : even if its &quot;not that great&quot;, they still have the best DS, rods, focus, weapon for OTHER pets.<br />
<br />
DS---druids are more mana efficiency(they last longer) and is like 2 pts ( 4? ) behind in damage. <br />
Rods--discuseed above. <br />
Foci---most decent geared play doesn't use them. <br />
weapons for other pets--i personally don't even give weapons to my own pets ( it give them may be 7 dps)<br />
<br />
 by &quot;Kaldanm&quot;<br />
I know several mages. the goods ones are wonderful, they are using their pets like they are playing 2 characters at the time, they can can burn a mob or sustain correct damage better than a wizard, and they have trick to use all their spells in a clever way. <br />
<br />
... .... ... the mages you know doesn't play at all in PoP nor GoD do they? ... .... .. and there are no &quot;tricks&quot; as you put it. It's rather obvious what you can do with the spell line up of mages. <br />
<br />
 by &quot;Kaldanm&quot;<br />
Beside, mages gain wonderful AAs with GoD. pet affinity ? mage is the only class with BST where the cost of 20 is fair, and it boost a lot pet DPS. <br />
<br />
Do you even know what pet affinity is? <br />
It allows group buff to hit pet. And no, it doesn't dramatically increase pet DPS. just like a tanks DPS doesn't being 2x when they are buffed with all those buffs. (note since mage pet haste is &gt; chanter haste, the only benifit for this AA is more hp/atk/dex/str for DPS) and a 10% increase in pet dps with those is like a 6 dps increase. <br />
<br />
6 DPS is alot of boost? <br />
<br />
 by &quot;Kaldanm&quot;<br />
Pet critical / Flurry / mitigation ? even more critical for nukes ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Study have shown that flurry + critcal give you at most a ~7dps increase for pets (that is the maxxed of both of thsose AA together). <br />
<br />
And so, not like everyone else is not getting a crit nuke upgrade. It doesn't help mage comparitively. <br />
<br />
 by &quot;wulfran&quot;<br />
Pets - Earth and Air can help with CC/mitigation on exp trash adds.<br />
Summoned toys - for pets and casters alike. Not everyone wants/uses but they are useful in varying situations.<br />
Damage shields - not as flashy as other buffs but extremely useful<br />
CoTH - more a raid nicety than a group one but...<br />
<br />
I look at these and over at wizzies and I do scratch my head a bit. Aside from more Damage/mana nukes and ports, what do wizzies have on these guys?<br />
<br />
1st--earth pet. If we are to use an earth pet in group, meaning the agro will be a little screw by the root it cast on mob. Because we cannot swtich pets in an instant. And most of the times, air/water is used. And most groups at 65--mobs eat earth pet for appitizer anyways. <br />
<br />
2---summon toys--for casters-- they don't need a mage in group to get them. <br />
pet toys--- ditto. <br />
<br />
3--DS--I'll say yeahs they are nice to have in groups, with slow, it's value diminishes 75% though. And if without slow, group's healer will probably need time to med after a few pulls and that too will cut down on DS's efficiencey. <br />
<br />
4--CoTh--disable in 50%+ of zones. really it is. <br />
<br />
Wizards---Translocate---evac---snare and root. <br />
Snare for runners is a very useful utility. <br />
and root, unlike a mage's earth pet that they can cast it any time it's much more useful for CC than a pet. ( also note, for any summonign mobs, earth pet willbe a very bad idea for the root it cast and it's attack will make the mob start to summon). <br />
<br />
by &quot;gerick&quot;<br />
but dont go giving them FD, bard speed, and everything else, im sick of seeing something that is unique to 1 or 2 classes getting gimped out to all of them, pets can do most of the things a warrior can, even more in some cases (enrage) pets can even critcal now, i am just really sick of classes melding togeather and destroying the lines of that classes purpose, if mages got FD, then it would basically push the monks even further out of groups, if they got bard speed, they could kite all day ETC<br />

So unless most mages are implying that they just want a pet to tank better in a group with a proper slower and a proper healer on hand I just cannot see any migitation outside of godmode significantly helping mages. <br />

There are far bigger issues at hand than pet migitation in regards to pet tankability.  the game has just made it that way.  <br />

Let's put it this way. <br />
<br />
If in GoD now no one will take a warrior because there, pally/sk/monk tanks supreme over war (for whatever reason).<br />
<br />
And I am to tell you,&quot;/shrug you are the MT for all the other expansion, what's the problem?&quot;<br />

I wonder how would you react. <br />
<br />
And no, you are correct in saying that classes are nto balance just by GoD trials. Did i mention mage suffers from lack of raid roles for a LONT while now, people just didn't complain as loud before. <br />
(for a quick summary--<br />
--CoH disabled in most raid zones<br />
-- 5 other calsses doing the same if not better DPS (that offers better utilities)<br />
-- Rods needs to actively monitor to be anything remotely useful<br />
-- DS not needed most of the time because of buff slot limitation)<br />

<br />
Or give us some of those &quot;slow&quot; like ability. <br />
(like proc runes, slow ds.. whatnot.)<br />
And even say SoE choose to upgrade pet suvivability thorugh direct HP, pet is not going to replace warriors because they don't tank as-well nor taunt as well. But they probably would be able to tank a little like they use to. <br />
<br />
I mean, there is seriously something wrong  when the owner of a pet tanks better than the pet. especially someone who's wearing a dress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can toss out focus and weapons for other pets since you can buy that stuff in the baz or bum it from a player.  So you're left with best DS and rods.  Druids have an DS on par with mages and the group version is 0 mana with one of their right clickies.  Often times they cover the DS anyway if their in the group.  <br />
<br />
So then you have rods, which are nice but you have to remind yourself to click every 5 minutes(who's gonna set a timer) in order to get full use out of them.  And since 90% of people only use them in emergencies they fall back into the useless category.  On par for the mage class.</div></div><hr />

I think the WORST decision made was class &quot;A&quot; will be made able to solo while &quot;B&quot; will not! It could have EASILY been tanks soloing and casters unable to, just use a different group of devs. <br />
To tank PoP and GoD mobs your pet will have to EASILY solo a Time equiped Warrior! There is no way around the fact that we can't effectively tank GoD or tier 2+ PoP mobs without:<br />
1. A slower (Shaman/Beast/Chanter)<br />
2. A Cleric (in most cases)<br />
So you and your pet must equal:<br />
1. Warrior (very well equiped)<br />
2. A Shaman or Beastlord<br />
3. A cleric/Druid post 58th level<br />
If you can't see how utterly ridiculous this is, you are as dumb as we are making the whole thing out to be.<br />
I am against:<br />
1. Soloing PoP or GoD mobs<br />
2. Quad kiting<br />
3. DC and charming mobs<br />
I don't really care if you don't like it. Oh, btw, the Devs have used this critieria for the high end game. IT IS A GROUPING GAME, someone proved your mana regen isn't as bad as you make it (your pathetic excuse is just that to not use your mod rods properly). SO PROVE WITH PARSES, DD AND PET INCLUDED YOU ARE UNDERPOWERED SO I CAN QUIT GROUPING WITH MAGES!

Until you prove it to me, one of my FAVORITE classes to group with will remain Mages.[/quote] My nuke parse from the past 3 months is 209 dps...20-25% of the time, I had a bard in group, also I'm one of the top equipped mages serverwide.  Add in my pet's 40-70 dps, and I'm doing 250+dps.  Mages don't have a problem with the damage we do.<br />
<br />
The problem we have is that on raids, our damage output with no way to lower hate (other than to not nuke), we die a lot.  And our pets can't tank ANYTHING anymore.  Those are the 2 biggest beefs.  For pure dps, I'd rather have wizzies on a raid.  Or druids (whose nukes are exactly as good as ours) for their more versatile setup.  You only need 1 mage on a raid for mod rods - no more...replace ALL the rest with wizzies.  There's a problem we don't like either.<br />

We are master summoners, our pets should be by FAR superior to any other pet in the game, aside from charmed pets.  Pets are our weapons. Don't believe me? Here is a quote from Brenlo<br />
<br />
Magicians are all about summoning and their greatest weapon should be their pet. As such the team will be focusing on your pets as a solution to some of your concerns. <br />
<br />
And last I checked, we don't have 3k nukes, only 2k max, and that never lands in a raid situation so 1700ish max with focus is more accurate, unless you get a crit.</div></div><hr />

1) What nuke is 3k? and<br />

Why are their a bunch of Mages whining they can't solo on the Warrior board? <br />
<br />
Whining? <br />
Don't be absurd.  Most of us are here to dispell some of the non-sense or misinformation you seemed to hold. <br />
<br />
We are not here to tell you mage problem, in fact, Gerick is the one who started this thread, we are &quot;replying&quot; to it. <br />
<br />
Again, plese be more precise with your accucastion so you don't look too baseless. <br />
<br />
And of course I personally like to dispell a few myths. <br />
Wasn't it you that keep saying war's don't have invis? <br />
I guess you never heard of cobalt legs? Or that incardine(sp?) bp. <br />
<br />
To tank PoP and GoD mobs your pet will have to EASILY solo a Time equiped Warrior! There is no way around the fact that we can't effectively tank GoD or tier 2+ PoP mobs without:<br />
<br />
You are dumb. <br />
Tanking != doing damage. <br />
<br />
For example a pet with 50k hp but doing say 5 dps will not be able to &quot;solo&quot; anything more than an orc pawn.  yet I am sure a 50k hp can tank pretty much anything for a while. <br />
<br />
Then again, judging by the lack of knowledge of being with warriors, I will guess youa re low level and even with the 5 dps it may actually &quot;solo&quot; you. <br />
<br />
1. A slower (Shaman/Beast/Chanter)<br />
2. A Cleric (in most cases)<br />
<br />
So you and your pet must equal:<br />
1. Warrior (very well equiped)<br />
2. A Shaman or Beastlord<br />
3. A cleric/Druid post 58th level<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, you are just dumb. <br />
No mage is asking for a pet that tanks as good as a war with a shaman. <br />
Just that it can tank a while.  <br />
<br />
Why is it overpower if a pet can tank say 1/2~ 1/3 effectively as a war with a shaman? <br />
<br />
I am against:<br />
1. Soloing PoP or GoD mobs<br />
2. Quad kiting<br />
3. DC and charming mobs<br />
I don't really care if you don't like it. <br />
<br />
I see more education to you is needed. <br />
<br />
1) mage can't do that, well nothing after Tier 2 for PoP anyways and even then it's a stretch.<br />
<br />
2) Mage can't quad kite<br />
<br />
3) Mage have no DC. <br />
<br />
So frankly we'll be neutral to your not liking it comment. <br />
I guess you must have thought a mage quad kites, DC and solo alot in GoD/PoP. <br />
If you actually get up some levels you'll konw that's not true. <br />
<br />

<br />
So the Devs talk to random noobish nowadays? <br />
Because you seemed to know a lot about the end game. <br />
<br />
And FYI end game is not &quot;grouping&quot; it's raiding. Continue to make more entertaining post please. <br />
<br />
SO PROVE WITH PARSES, DD AND PET INCLUDED YOU ARE UNDERPOWERED SO I CAN QUIT GROUPING WITH MAGES! <br />
<br />
You just pretend to be a jackass or is that in your nature? <br />
The problem with that logic--<br />
1) if we do come up with parse like that you can go on liek the moron that you are to say &quot;no one should take mages in--LOOK LOOK this DPS SUX!!! THEY PROVE IT HERE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
2) if we don't then we are like lying and you can go, &quot;LOOK LOOK THEY ARE LYING!!&quot;<br />
<br />
So stoping being the Richard Simons fan that you are.<br />
<br />
Until you prove it to me, one of my FAVORITE classes to group with will remain Mages.<br />

Good for you.<br />
<br />
That rod mod nerf sucked too, so Uber guild &quot;A&quot; was exploiting it, how about the rest of us?<br />

... ..... Everyone and their father's cousin's lover's guild was using mod-rods for mana before it was nerf. <br />

Because mages were always able to solo for reasonable exp. <br />
And the flexilibility of not having to LFG whenever they want xp is one of the main reasons people made a mage. <br />

You also have forgot that <br />
Put in mana cost in your calculation please. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gonna quote myself, since I already did factor mana cost of rods into the equation -<br />
<br />
Mystical Transvergence is 1080 mana (360 mana x3), over 15 minutes. Subtracting the 350 mana it costs to summon a rod (400 mana base, minus 2.5% for 50 specialize conjuration, minus another flat 10% for having SCM3) leaves 730 mana over 150 ticks: 4.8 (technically I'll assume 4, since EQ truncates just about every number) mana per tick, that stacks with every single form of mana regen, and doesn't require a buff slot.<br />
<br />
Elemental legs summon rods for free, increasing the mana regen from rods to 7.2, and the mage's mana regen from 43 per tick to 46.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't be use on horse, so anywhere outside that you can use a horse it's useless. <br />
<br />
For enchanters.... forgetting gather mana? <br />
But i agreed that mage mana  regen isn't much to complain on. <br />
<br />
<br />
Or you could click off your horse. Requires a little more skill to survive sitting on raids, but if you need mana badly enough it's doable. I can certainly do it as a cleric, and healing aggro isn't very avoidable.<br />
<br />
Gather Mana was left out for the same reason I left out shaman: It's too variable.<br />
<br />
An enchanter with a 4k mana pool and no Hastened Gathering gets 4000 mana over 1440 ticks: 2.78 per tick. An enchanter with 8k mana and Hastened Gathering 3 gets 8000 mana over 1000 ticks: 8 per tick. It can add a fair amount of mana regen, if the chanter milks every bit of mana possible out of it, instead of what the skill was actually intended as; a panic button. Arguing that GM needs to be included is like arguing that a paladin should use LoH every time it pops: &quot;It's called saving the Quon's mana.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
For druids they can also cast spirit, they'd be rooted.. but hey. http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.ht...564&amp;source=Live <br />
<br />
Oak doesn't stack with nine (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=1564&amp;source=Live).<br />
<br />
And clerics yaulp 6, basically 12/tick for 4 ticks and cost 25 mana so a net 23 mana gain ober 4 ticks around 6/tick if actively used. <br />
<br />
First of all, Yaulp 6 costs 8 mana to cast, not 25 (10 base, minus 12.5% from SCM3 / abjuration spec, then truncated). It can't be used on a horse and it literally doesn't stack with meditate; sit down, and the buff fades. It doesn't stack with Beastlord or Ranger Slot-4 HP buffs, or high-level enchanter haste, and it's only 10 mana per tick (net). It gives clerics a bit of an edge should they decide to waste time meleeing (time clerics with combat effects do 40dps on a good day, using the new blackstar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20627)), or in an indoor zone where there's too much healing aggro to sit down. When meditate/horse are viable Yaulp 6 is largely useless, so I left it out.<br />
<br />
I still say the idea of pet-only BoV is the solution; there's even a precedent for it. When druids were given % heals, devs promised to increase clerics' defensive tools and group desirability to balance that. Since they couldn't give clerics slow, they gave us Divine Arb, Bulwark of Vie, and focii-based heals (Supernal/Holy Light are powerful heals, but only good if the cleric has the focii/AA to back it up). Beastlords have slow, so mages should get a melee mitigation buff as a balance to increase pet tankability.<br />
<br />
My original concept (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4194) behind Incite wasn't very well received on this board, and my pet-BoV concept has been ignored by the mages in this thread, so I guess sometimes the best balance fix isn't the most publicized one. Incite certainly breathed new life into the warrior class, even if the idea behind it wasn't popular. I know some of the more popular ideas on balancing clerics offensively, if implemented, would be retarded.</div></div><hr />

um dont feel like your the only one with a dick in the door, shamans had the idea for racial pets that have to do with home land hence the crock, tiger, bear.<br />
<br />
i do feel your pain on this because we wanted to break legs, and diembowl our enemys, so they make zerkers do this with axes, but i dont think that critcal melee hits should have been gimped to fugging pets, call it something else at least so my class ego doesnt take ANOTHER painful hit.<br />
<br />
also your pet is summoned from the elemental planes, meaning your enslaving a poor fire elemental who could have been playing a nice game of cards with fenin, BLs pets are ehanced monsters, sorta like tiger+spirit(like avatar+player)= warder<br />
<br />
only differance is they are a little less assnine in how they get their pet (poor jobobner was sleeping you ass!)<br />
<br />
also i think compairing cleric mana regen to caster mana regen isnt all that smart, priests have a differnt mana usage ramp all togeather, its like trying to say the euro and the doller are worth the same amount</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is true and I agree. <br />
A rod is somewhat the same nature though, instead of using it as a contant mana regen I found cleircs only use it when necessary or I only use it when i am really lacking mana. <br />
<br />
But that's more on personal choice and for the most part I agree with your calculations. (except the mana cost of the buffes themselves not just rods like you point out again)<br />
<br />
Oak doesn't stack with nine.<br />
<br />
I see, my bad. <br />
<br />
My original concept behind Incite wasn't very well received on this board, and my pet-BoV concept has been ignored by the mages in this thread, so I guess sometimes the best balance fix isn't the most publicized one. <br />
<br />
Reasons for it to be ignored may be<br />
1) it's NOT the best solution<br />
2) what 1 person view as best is not by another person's view point. <br />
3) IMO, if it's a BoV kind of spell then the result will be like increase migitation of pets. ( except the fixed amount vs the increase %, with the difference between them)<br />
4) your &quot;solution&quot; doesn't help mages in raid. We still doing the same dps/utilities and frankly not more wanted/needed for raids. <br />
<br />
And soloing is only part of the reason mages are upset. Another being mage isn't wanted. <br />
<br />
I'll breifly go over some reasons why that is. and a very breif comparison to the other class. <br />
<br />
mage offers to raid:<br />
1) DPS ( pet + nuke)<br />
2) rods<br />
3) CoH<br />
4) summons<br />
5) malosinia<br />
<br />
1) DPS is a dime a dozen while mage's dps is decent on raid, there are other dps class offeres utility &gt; mage that would be taken into over a mage. (examples will follow)<br />
<br />
2) rods--one of the utility mages has that is somewhat wanted in raid, but that only takes 1 mage to do, especially one with elem pants. And for most guilds, they work perfectly fine without rods. <br />
<br />
3) CoH--disabled in most zones that raid goes on. <br />
<br />
4) summons--seriously I can't remember the last time i was ask for focus gears ... the last time i summon something is for arrows during Fennin. (rangers function equally good to summon arrows..)<br />
<br />
5) malosinia--not a bad thing to cast, but without malos, it takes alot of casts for it to stick and if you have malos, the extra 15 less resist is good or nice to have like rods, but wouldn't be missed and shamans can do it just as good (except for those of us that got saryrn mask, then it's arguable who shold cast malosinia.<br />
<br />
Now since mage's main job is DPS, i'll breifly go over the other DPS classes and what they offered besides DPS.<br />
<br />
Rog--CR... SoS pretty much a NEEDED utility if just for dragging corpse. Also can be use to scout or help to pull. <br />
      --escape can help to pull ... same with nimble but those aren't too big a deal. <br />
<br />
Ranger--snare/root sometimes it's very useful utility but nto a big deal since other calsses have it too.<br />
           --atk buffs--pretty wanted for raids... all melee wants them. And since they can only MGB once every hour(? never pay much attention to AA i never have/bought) so i would say 2 rangers is good to have for raids.<br />
          --weapon-shield--even with long recast, it's a very powerful utility can have &quot;make-or-break&quot; effect on raids.<br />
<br />
monks--pulling-- what else... and I am sure there is no doubt on how needed ti can be. <br />
<br />
wizard--they can root and snare, but their DPS &gt; all already so not a problem. <br />
<br />
BL--are they even a dps class really? let's say they do around monk damage with pet ( never parsed a BL before so just a guess)<br />
--SD--a welcome addition with a passive 9/tick hp/mana<br />
--paragon-- can potentially save/breaks a raid (MGB'd of course)<br />
--ferocity--gives more raw attack than FA<br />
<br />
Necros--manafeed--it's the best mana transfer means there is since rods nerf. And 2-3 necro feeding clerics can be very useful. <br />
<br />
So assuming the above doing ~same dps ( read within +/- 30 of seach other) it'll be the utilities that determine how &quot;wanted&quot; a class is in raid and right now, mage aren't doing too good. <br />
<br />
To increase mage raid desirability we thought 2 things can achieve that:<br />
1) increase DPS so incentive also increase<br />
2) increase utility (pages upon pages of suggestions can be found at mage tower)<br />
<br />
So either way will be a good way to fix mage in the high-end. <br />
And even though, your &quot;BoV solution&quot; may be a godo one, it realyl doens't help the high-end mages at all.<br />

 by gerick<br />
um dont feel like your the only one with a dick in the door, shamans had the idea for racial pets that have to do with home land hence the crock, tiger, bear.<br />
<br />
Having the same &quot;appearance&quot; doesn't mean they are the same. <br />
but i agree, prehaps i should rephrase a little. <br />
&quot;SoE ripped off mage suggestions and make it inot a new class along with some abilities rip off from shamen&quot;<br />
<br />
[i]by gerick<br />
i do feel your pain on this because we wanted to break legs, and diembowl our enemys, so they make zerkers do this with axes, but i dont think that critcal melee hits should have been gimped to fugging pets, call it something else at least so my class ego doesnt take ANOTHER painful hit.<br />
<br />
Not our idea to call it what it is. I am neutral to the notion if you wanteed ti to cal something else. <br />
I wanted to say that druid getting a better nuke is more a slap in the face to mages IMO.<br />
<br />
also your pet is summoned from the elemental planes, meaning your enslaving a poor fire elemental who could have been playing a nice game of cards with fenin, BLs pets are ehanced monsters, sorta like tiger+spirit(like avatar+player)= warder<br />
<br />
noway.... elem plane mobs hits 4x+ as hard as my pet =P<br />
not to mention the hp it has over him. <br />

you mean im summoning a flame lordling? why doesnt he have 20k hp and hit for 600. or maybe i missed the section of the zone where all the gimpy elementals hang out just waiting to be woken up by the bad mages. please give me directions there so i can go wake the rest of them up. its a mages job to torture poor defenseless elementals after all. <br />
<br />
you are aware they removed the summoned tag from all the elemental mobs in the elemental planes, aren't you? so our wonderfull mez/charm/dds dont do squat against jobobers pissed off older brother. the 4 zones a mage should really shine and nope we are still the same old mages we were. yay we get a lvl 65 spell that works in 1 damned zone. lets see your loot from a tier3+ boss only work in tactics and get you killed more often than it actually damages a mob. <br />

you say we can buy spells. well you can buy armor and weapons whats the difference?  arent those the tools of your job? <br />
<br />
[quote]no, BLs are ment to be the best with pets, NOT mages, mages are masters of summoning, your DD Vs. summons is PART of what that class discription means[quote]<br />
<br />
yeah dd vs summons. thats a balanced thing. lets see where its usefull. <br />
old world. solb by effreti(15 possible mobs), sola (5 total mobs) narjena. lavastorm. steamfont. and 1 mob occasionally in east commons. <br />
kunark nope no summoned mobs here there were some in burning woods but verant nerfed em. <br />
velious again no summoned mobs here. <br />
luclin twilight sea a whole island full of them. must be a good 100 or so of the little bastards. too bad thier all lvl 20. <br />
pop. poj (trial of flame trial of execution). bot. solro (20ish total mobs) (still flagged as summoned but immune to charm/mez from mages). <br />
ldon takish/mm <br />
god (unknown but i havent seen any so far). <br />
<br />
sure seems like an incredibly powerfull set of tools we have for all the summoned mobs that DONT EXIST IN THE GAME.<br />
<br />
yes im a mage. yes this will probably be my only post on this board. but seriously if your gunna post about another class get a fucking clue as to the problems and benefits of that class.</div></div><hr />

Hmm we all live in this VR togeather, i think we should all know of eachothers valid complaints and whines, reason i put it here was because the boards have been slow, and we all love contraversy :) (and admit it, i make haass, and hussar look good) also if these rantings go on without the other side of it we may someday find ourselfs not needed because a cleric can heal a pet or a warrior ya know? there has to be a level of speration here<br />
<br />
by elemental planes i didnt mean literally, i ment in the game lore, or to a lesser extent stuff like the plane of air.<br />
<br />
i dont not see why mages want super steriod pets in the tear 2+/ elemental/GoD areas, the risk of death is what keeps &quot;n00bs&quot; like myself out of there untill we are knowledgable not to get our group fugged, if it comes down to your HP and your pets Hp, then your tank is a fucking dumbass</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Magicians are master summoners, able to call elemental pets to do their bidding and to conjure useful items from thin air. Magicians are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.&quot;<br />
<br />
this says that they are good at summoning, they conjure items and pets, and the use magic to do it, not endurance or clicky items<br />
<br />
&quot;Elemental pets are at the heart of a magician's offensive strategy, and typically accompany a magician in all his adventures. This pet provides protection for its master, along with powerful attacks and special abilities. Magicians have a large selection of fire and magic-based damage spells, allowing them to mount a damaging magical assault in support of their elemental pet&quot;<br />
<br />
says they do damage, doesnt say a large amount of it, the pet protects its master, but it doesnt say anything about how well, or any comparative nouns, the do have special abilitys, they do have a large selection of spells, doesnt say they do the most damage with them, and it says they SUPPORT their pet, as in you two ARE connected<br />
<br />
&quot;Magicians have a wide range of summoning spells, allowing them to conjure such diverse items as food, weapons, armor, and magical jewelry. In battle, the magician can encase his entire group in a shield of fire, damaging any opponent that strikes them. Magicians also have spells that lower a monster's resistance to magic, allowing spells to damage them more easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
all true, many dumbasses cant get thru a PoJ trial round because they forget to ask for a DS, DSs(underrated as they are) are a large part of unslowed mob raids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magicians are a very focused class, sacrificing some diversity for power in their area of expertise. Magicians are able to adventure solo, but also provide value in a group situation. The magician is a good choice for players who enjoy managing a powerful pet and using a tightly focused spell selection.&quot;<br />
<br />
powerful pet, and it is. you asked for all these wonderful toys but plain as day &quot;Magicians are a very focused class, sacrificing some diversity for power&quot;<br />
<br />
and it says you can solo, and you still can, the day there isnt a blue for you to kill is when you can bitch me out k?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Beastlords are the masters of raw nature, who focus this energy into themselves and their warder pets. Beastlords are primarily a melee class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons, or use their bare hands to attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
pets are nature, they are masters of raw nature, so they are good at controling their pets, and this raw power if focused into their pets, the do their damage thru their melee ability(now remember the pet does melee, and pets count as part of their caster)<br />
<br />
&quot;Beastlords prepare for battle by calling on their animal warder and increasing the creature's natural abilities with spells&quot;<br />
<br />
shows that this class is about backing their pet with ehancements, increasing its tank ability, and power, not just aiding the pet by blasting the monster<br />
<br />
&quot;Beastlords can adventure solo well in many places. They depend upon coordination with their warders and well planned spells to finish every fight, but they can also aid a group through their spells and melee abilities. The beastlord is a great class for players who like the option of solo melee fights, but want to be able to help in a group.:<br />
<br />
this says they can solo, just like mages, so again fucktard, stop thinking your pet is ment to be the best, prove it has any better standing then a bl OR a necro<br />
<br />
<br />
enlighten me, where does it say you have the best pet again?<br />
<br />

<br />
If you are saying the have the best pets because pets are &quot;nature&quot;. <br />
Then mage should have the same best pet because we are master of summoning and pets are &quot;summonings&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
now, now, since you are being specific(? technical?) with the mage calss decription, apply the same to BL, it didn't say what natural abilities it's boosting.  (it can very well meant it's jsut boosting it's ability to move I.E. SoW... it can shrink it's pet .. whatnot)<br />
<br />
enlighten me, where does it say you have the best pet again?<br />
<br />
Absor said so. (or someone from SoE did if i remembered right, but not 100% sure so lemme see if i can dig up his post on saying that )<br />
Something along the line, ... yeah and mage has the best pet in game already...&quot; <br />
But as i sid, not 100% sure, so let me get back to you on that one.<br />
<br />
hell i bet you make a pussy statment like that because you half expect someone to jump in and do the work for you, come on big shit, hop to your response<br />

yeah lol ..... <br />

EDIT: heck can't seemed to find it. So can't use that i guess. <br />

 You are dumb. Then again, judging by the lack of knowledge of being with warriors, I will guess youa re low level and even with the 5 dps it may actually &quot;solo&quot; you. Again, you are just dumb. You just pretend to be a jackass or is that in your nature? <br />

Now, WAAAAAAA, I can get AA's every 20 minutes! So *****, we have shown you do in excesse of 200 DPS with your pet and spells, we have shown your mana regen is not horribly out of whack. All you show is how well you can whine. YOU ARE THE IDIOT, and now you have made an enemy. I am heading over to the mage board to disrupt them, insult them, and cause problems. You have shown what an utter piece of shit you are, go back to the Mage board and whine to each other about not being able to solo anymore. !<br />

Pet Survivalability: it is not a tank period. If you want a tank then say bye bye to your nukes, so make a war.<br />
<br />
Nukes. WTF you complaining about your fast cast high dmg nukes? if you want better nukes forget your pet, make a wizard.<br />
<br />
Soloability. Shut up until war and rogue can solo as well as you do.<br />
<br />
Personal Survivalability, War dont have, root, snare, runes or FD. anywhere where you can be killed if you lose invi a war can be killed also, just lasting a few extra seconds. and we CANT gate. If you want to survive forget your nukes and your pet and make a SK.<br />

Raid usefulness. oh only CoH and rods? and what does a wiz only nuke, and a tank who isnt the MA? bah every class is specialized in raids.<br />

Bah I just see a lot of blah blah blah you probably are not a perfect class and you obviously are not Gods. Stop complaining. Bah you already one of the best classes in game.<br />

Due to conjure / evo spec, druid nukes only beat mage nukes due to a bug with Secondary Forte. Second specialization is going up to 200 instead of the 100 listed in the AA info, which means druids can now have 200 spec in Alter *and* Evocation.<br />
<br />
Mage:<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaos Vortex (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4976&amp;source=Live)<br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1860<br />
Mana: 474<br />
Skill: Conjuration<br />
<br />
Rock of Taelosia (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4887&amp;source=Live)<br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1705<br />
Mana: 434<br />
Skill: Conjuration<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaos Frost (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4974&amp;source=Live)<br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1860<br />
Mana: 468<br />
Skill: Evocation<br />
<br />
Sylvan Fire (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4884&amp;source=Live)<br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1705<br />
Mana: 430<br />
Skill: Evocation<br />
<br />
Since a mage's 2 nuke lines, pet heals, and many other spells are all conj, I'm going to assume that mages specialize conjuration. Druids, however, especially raiding druids, specialize alteration, since saving mana on heals is more important than nukes.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaos Vortex: 474 mana<br />
After SCM3 and 200 specialize conjure, 474 becomes 379.2. This doesn't take into account focus effects, since those are random and not everyone has them. Rock of Taelosia's 434 becomes 347.2.<br />
<br />
Druid nukes have a slightly lower base cost, but the difference is seemingly supposed to be made up by specialization. With the Secondary Forte bug, it no longer does. If it worked right, and capped the second spec at 100, Ancient Chaos Frost would go from 468 mana to 397.8, and Sylvan Fire would go from 430 to 365.5.<br />
<br />
Assuming that bug will be fixed, mage nukes will beat druid nukes by all of 18 mana. Eighteen. Bullshit considering druids nearly match mages in damage shields and resist debuffs, and have a variety of other tools to use.<br />
<br />
Very legitimate gripe, Samxp.<br />
<br />
And Gerick, ffs.<br />

Say that to the wizards who say they deserve a pet because they have no way to save themselves(Yes, they are out there). Say that to the enchanter who can charm a pet safely and wreck a entire zone. Sorry, I think we DESERVE a upgrade to our pets at bare minimum. The GoD AA's have no scaled to what they should have, we are in need of a upgrade.. flame me as you will, send me a tell in game for that, for I doubt I will be viewing this post anymore</div></div><hr />

I assure you I am not jealous, the problem is 20,000 people log onto my server everynight, and a lot of other Servers. There is not enough mobs to support that number of players GROUPING, so lets add more soloability to more classes to make the problem worse?! So you get crap exp soloing low blues, GROUP then! At least 50% of the Mages are bitching they want the pet buffed to SOLO. Warriors rather you didn't have the ability to solo, so some GROUPS have things to do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirulus Delon</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone else find this laughable? they have a minion they can send to death(get out of death free), gate(get away while group bites it), invis(safe travel) Okay I am still reading this but I had to comment. Are you simply that thick that you have no clue what the class is about? Get out of death free ya say? Okay let me point something out to ya friend. I am not in a guild nor am I EP + yet (though I am fuggin close). <br />
<br />
I do progress at a bit of an accelerated level from other casualish non guilded mages because I am daring and determined when I am bored. That said, I took a stroll to Ferubi on day 4 of GoD. I was in zone and studying mob behavior/patterns (that's the stuff I do. I have a rogue and this info is VERY vital to him). So pulled a few times using normal level pet and a very very very low level pet (that works well if pet casts before engaging). In pops a tank botting a druid and a cleric and he enlists my help with a spawn split. I told him okay! and had my wife invis up and be ready to put foot to ground zoning out. I mean I saw my hugely overpowered level 61 Air Pet! get reamed a new one 4 times over...<br />
<br />
So warrior goes to pull but the roamer is back so we get him first (the dog man, the see invis dog) . Slaughter ensues. I watched the tank get 2 rounded (cleric could not get a heal off; reported a quad of 984) and cleric in one round. I manage to get the attention of the beast with my pet while druid gets out of dodge. I popped my level 64 heal, pet LoH and 60 heal but could NOT keep the pet up past 40%hp for more than .5 seconds, I kid you not. I barely had time to type in ooc for all to see &quot;ZONE NOW!!!!&quot;. This dog ran frickin a bit above sow speed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I zone and have about 43% hp....Let's say I was further in and this crap happened. I would have DIED. Not been wounded but dead. And Ferubi is set up where it is rogue unfriendly and my rogue has SoS. I tested this with him and the only thing that saved him was my paranoia. I always keep insta gate potions ready for insta clicky get outta jail. So back on track, play a mage and learn it before you spout stuff you see being outside the class. I have played a SK to 24, pally to 32 and will not comment on the class at all because I know little to nothing about it ( well I DO know I hate that fuggin spell wake of Karana/Tranquility because of the knockback making me miss backstabs lol).<br />
<br />
Then we have the invisibility. Gosh I really do like this. Lasts exactly 10mins unless otherwise broken by outside forces or fat fingers breaking it. Let's say we get a mob that does not fall for the whole &quot;Lookit me I am invis thing&quot; and wants a bite of our silky arses. We have at most a chance to bust out a 4.5 second pet or a 4 second gate. Four seconds is an eternity.<br />
<br />
I once was in AR doing my frame and got jumped by the 4 arms. The only reason I got gate off at 20% hp is because they were surrounding me and countering the push. The mage on a CR or what not has no time to get pet out nor to get gate off (naked I am about 1046 hp give or take). Even via spell channeling AA and persistent casting (only have level 1 of the former and none of the latter) I highly doubt you can get a gate off.<br />
<br />
TBH, on a warrior I would think if you get in trouble you hit /defensive and backpedal your way to zone out if possible. In no way am I that you can do that, more like I am asking if you can. On my rogue I /disc nimble and do that. I pray to god though that I never get donkey punched. And btw, I can buy an invis potion for less than 14p, insta click too. If you say that buying x item with x effect is too expensive and should not have to be that way, then you really really do not have any desire to be good at anything in this game. Hell I have shelled out more than 400k in gear over my course of time playing, some which I gave away when I got upgrades (okay most of it) for free! I still am getting upgrades via bazaar (although now I have to sell junk to make up the difference). How many times have you paid for a virtue? Focus? Ranger buffs? Pally buffs? Po9 when no Virtue was avail? I thought so. So umm you have no real grounds there.<br />
<br />
Now as an aside, I love the way warriors are panning out. Hell except for the lazy ones (I swear to god that is what they are. Level 65 and no ability to hold agro over me?? On my rogue that is) I would say you all are doing frickin nice. I grouped with a lot lately and wow. Mostly I play with a SK/Shammy duo because they are husband and wife, (a compliment to my wife and I Necro/Rogue) but for once, I have no fears of grouping with a warrior tank of any level.<br />
<br />
Lastly I just wanna say I do not make a habit of trolling. I have posted here in another section garnering help with my wife on her warrior. I did get this cross linked though and decided to help clear a few things. Reading the boards on the tower yes our thoughts are jumbled. But if you read the common thought it is most of all pet survivability. Give me a pet that can last long enough to keep up with heals, I will sacrifice my rogue! Okay I am lying about that but seriously, read closer before picking one topic...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirulus Delon</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no, BLs are ment to be the best with pets, NOT mages, mages are masters of summoning, <br />
<br />
Magicians are a very focused class, sacrificing some diversity for power in their area of expertise. Magicians are able to adventure solo, but also provide value in a group situation. The magician is a good choice for players who enjoy managing a powerful pet <br />
<br />
Beastlords are the masters of raw nature, who focus this energy into themselves and their warder pets. Beastlords are primarily a melee class, <br />
<br />
I may be blind but where does it say that either class is supposed to have the best pet? Granted, most mages believe that since it was always the way since the dawn of EQ (BL are just a red headed step child class that was made to sell Luclin) that is the way it should be through out. I agree. I mean tbh I think warriors were meant to be the best tanks were they not? For a while they got the shaft when hybrids were not happy but now they are getting back on track. I guess one could say that warriors are not supposed to be the best tanks right? That would indeed be false because the sheer hp/mitigation/ac/discs disparities between the plates is noticeable. Also, most cases you MUST have a warrior tank (well until you can tweak it for a hybrid). Only place I have heard of high end where you had someone else tank was Inny in time...<br />
<br />
Also, look at parses. An unbuffed mage pet beats an unbuffed warder hands down. Buff on buff it is close however bare naked we have the best pet (to an extent). If BL were meant to have the best pets, they would have the crappy heals and no slow. I mean with their awesome pets, who needs slow right?? Also, the master would have no Defensive disc as he could rely on his pet totally to keep him alive. Then he could support via nukes and and...<br />
<br />
Did you even think about the time where a level 50 mage pet could beat the snot out of a level 50 warrior? Then the pets got scaled down (I do agree with this to some great extent) at which time we got stronger nukes. Sony policy on mages; Give them bigger nukes because their pets can't do jack. Maybe, just maybe they can burn the mob down in time before the pet dies (but with recast times on the heals and nukes, not likely).<br />
<br />
In closing, Mages should have a great pet that can offtank an unslowed mob in a pinch with the master's support. This support should be via heals which would be on par and equal to the amount of damage that pet may have to take from an unslowed mob. These heals should also make a mage limited in ability to nuke to balance it (really TBH I would rather heal the pet for most of the fight than try to nuke. I have insta clickies I can bust out for that). As it stands, slowed, I can off tank (via pet) everything up to krigers and possibly those as well if I do not nuke at all. In GoD, my pet requires (yes requires) a cleric's heals to stay alive each mob. I have tested this on entrance mobs in Qinimi which hit for BoT amounts per round (rampage for 430+ a pop on me).<br />
<br />
And to address Doomflayer (sp?) I am not about the 133t solo xp. I am about the ability to have pet off tank in a pinch to keep a group from wiping. That is one utility I seek (well more but that is a major start). I love to group and that is what I desire. Now being desired is a different thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SSSlippy</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh this is the sadest thing to read.  First of all u are reading the post 100% wrong.  Some of the stuff is crap yes but hes talking about elemental forms.  Not being in that enviornment.  I dont have time to read 7 pages of flames either.  Currently fire form gives you a DS +int and +casting level.  If you dont know how casting level works it gives +20 to our 252 which is hard capped at 255.  My pet has 5k hp on average and the ac of a ranger.  It dies so quickly to anything that hits for 500+.  The current GoD groups require a Warrior, Cleric, Enc/Shaman, druid, and 2 dps classes.  At this point I sit LFG for 4hrs plus a night and im in an elemental guild.  My guild continues to do sewers alot and some other trials.  Its quite boring to sit there doing nothing cause I can not solo.  Reason mages ask for some for some soloing back.  Also if you read any information on EQ they state mages can solo.  Gate and invis are not a suppose special spell.  Also if a mob jumps you it means you wont have a pet up if it did.  Anywhere that I would choose to exp would kill my pet in a round and Ill die just as quick.  Pets are not a wall that you can throw at a mob and gate.  It use to be this way when pets didnt die in a round from mobs but now they do.  Problem is gear and mobs keep scaling up and up.  Ill compare for you.  Warriors get more ac and more hp items when mobs hit harder.  Pets dont scale.  My 61 air pet has a hard time tanking teir2 mobs slowed that hit for 500.  You think a 1200 hitter is gonna be any better?  At this point pet focus items are a great addition however they only add non combat regen and +2 max hit and +300 hp.  Great item couldnt play without it.  However as I said I am elemental and would love the time focus but its 3 pet class usable.  My guild has lost 4-5 mages at this point that dont play enough to be conidered to be active cause its boring.  Im constantly seeing new mages in the guild.  <br />
<br />
Just from the last page of stuff<br />
<br />
Nukes. WTF you complaining about your fast cast high dmg nukes? if you want better nukes forget your pet, make a wizard. <br />
<br />
Our nukes are the slowest casting nukes of all offensive classes.  The least mana effecient and on par with druids for damage.  <br />
<br />
Warriors do 150 dps with a BoW mages do about 150 on average.  On longer fights warriors will do more damage.  Also our pet is level 60 MAX.  Warrior is max 65.  As we all know level is everything.  Pets already have a 50% miss ratio.  On average vs red mobs my pet hits for 22.  Go fluffy go!<br />
<br />
Mages are THE pet class.  Mages dont have root rune etc.  Only spell we have is gate which means we are gone from the fight if we use it.  <br />
<br />
On raids it takes ONE mage to keep a raid rodded.  Every 15 mins ae 300 radius rod.  Woohoo.  Only takes one mage to COTH a raid.  2 is perfered for speed but not needed.  <br />
<br />
Also on alot of fights we will cycle warriors as they die.  You will never see a raid called cause we dont have enough mages but you will if you dont have enough warriors.<br />
<br />
I wont even get into some mobs I have fought that people go there immune to fire and magic.  Im like cool ill sit here and die.  Usually ill run in and melee with my uber 17/19 weapon!<br />
<br />
Pet flurry is a peice of crap.  Warriors have this.  Melee crit.  Warriors have this also.  Crit spells warriors have this for there procs.  Warriors have reposte disc which is the same thing as enrage.  <br />
<br />
During the time of POJ trials when our 2k nuke was buyable was awesome and wizards didnt have there 2.5k nukes.  <br />
<br />
Our DS does not scale with mob damage either.  When mobs use to hit for 250 ooo uber a 32 point ds was.  Now mobs hit for 1200 and I have a 45 point ds.  Anyone see a scaling issue?<br />
<br />
Im doing GoD and time keys this is what I am worried about.  <br />
<br />
The first 2 people to die in my guild are me and one other mage when the MA dies.  Whenever I see NEW TANK that means im dead.  <br />
<br />
irmingnomers you say we have 3k nukes.  WRONG.  Our best nuke is 2k and its a bolt meaning that the fat ass ogre blocks it every time.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords can melee and rather well.  Since they use the same ratio weapons as monks they get crazy ratios.  But then again arnt all melee these days.  Beastlords can solo better then mages.<br />
<br />
Mages are the masters of summoning.  We summon or pets from there planes.  <br />
<br />
I think thats it for now.</div></div><hr />

You say the warrior got two rounded, and the heal could never land. You want your pet to stand up to that? Face it GoD was made for PoT players, I zoned in, I took on a blue mob, it proceeded to pound me, I left. I have written the entire expansion as a BIG waste of money.  I admit I did not make myself clear as I was carrying on a thought I was chewing on. Now I did not say I wanted my pet to be able to stand up to that without support. I did say better heals (forgot to mention FASTER heals) is a start. The warrior who died, died because he had set his cleric up for CH cycles. With quick heals that would not have been too bad of an issue.<br />
<br />
In general the zones they claim to be open to all gear levels 50+ are not. While Qinimi is the only zone I have grouped in and been successful, it was a stress. I fought in Natimbi day one and it was a bit rough on some light blues and even more so on dark blues I duoed near Qinimi. I also did the Plant trial and it was intense. I did not get to finish the trial though because the tank (pally) had to log due to RL issues and we were too far in to get another tank. Oh btw, heh I died 2 times back to back due to repops (necro went LD and since he was puller we had to wait). First death was 1020, 1020, 980, 865. Second was 1123, 1123, 1123, 998. I won't say all of GoD is made for EP/Time players, I will say most of the content is made for one that does not get the majority of their upgrades via /bazaar.<br />

FUCK YOU BAG OF SHIT!~ YOU ARE THE FUCKING DUMB ASS COMING ON THE WARRIOR BOARD AND BITCHING! WE, AS A WHOLE HATE SOLOING FUCKTARDS! You solo because you are a STUPID ASSHOLE, without a single friend in game. You started playing Mage right when KEI could be cast on any idiot and quickly leveled. Now, WAAAAAAA, I can get AA's every 20 minutes! So PUSSY, we have shown you do in excesse of 200 DPS with your pet and spells, we have shown your mana regen is not horribly out of whack. All you show is how well you can whine. YOU ARE THE IDIOT, and now you have made an enemy. I am heading over to the mage board to disrupt them, insult them, and cause problems. You have shown what an utter piece of shit you are, go back to the Mage board and whine to each other about not being able to solo anymore. !<br />

p.s. 'sides, this is on the rants forum of these boards, posted here by one of your own.  Feel free to go do the same on the mage boards (assuming there's a rant board there).

Can't handle being cussed at like the 5 year olds that currently inhabit the Mage board? Quit EQ! They picked FUROR'S magelo to compare the pet to, that is so amusing to many here, and what is impressive is the astounding utter STUPIDITY of the Mage idiots that can't see why that is so utterly without merit.<br />
I think I should post the BEST Knight magelo, get all my flags, then complain that he does more DPS than I do and demand all of EQ stop so it will be fixed. Better yet, they go back and redo every class so they can solo nearly equally! Hell we can't even get them to fix known bugs that have been in the game for a long, long time, like some plat hacks.<br />
Or in simpler terms, maybe you can understand this. If a Warrior, gets a guild together, gets all the best loot, your pet is NOT EVEN FUCKING comparable to him fucktwit. Furor is also the poster child for addictive/compulsive behavior in a computer game. So comparing ANYTHING about your char to his maybe is not a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have no idea what point your making here. <br />
1st a coupla peices of ornate and 1 or 2 decent drops does not equate to being in an uber guild. unless maybe you ebayed one of thier alt's but then it'd probly be better equipped. but you seem to have a pretty good assortment of the bazaar buyable gear. gratz you <br />
2nd sure a pali with no aa and crap gear will have less hp than you. but our elemental pali's are running around with 8-9k raid buffed. your friend (the pali as if theres only 1) must be a new recruit/app to the guild. part of the process of flagging is gearing up. or mabye he didnt ebay 500k to buy most of his gear.<br />
<br />
so your craptastic lvl 65 warriors have less than 5k hp. and your disgustingly uber warriors have 11k+ hp. well guess what your craptastic mage pet has 4k hp and your disgustingly uber mage pet has 5200 hp. your running around with a 12/17 weapon that you think kicks ass thier running around with 38/35 weapons. mage pets hit for a max 9 damage more with the time focus, roughly a 3-4 dps increase. <br />
<br />
this is called scaling with progression. something pets simply do not do. hell even the developers think this is the case<br />
I think most of you can agree that a pet that can stand toe to toe with a Plane of Fire mob that walks over a warrior isn't appropriate for game balance. In my opinion the problem is that pets aren't scaling correctly next to different levels of equipment available in game. The basic % increases for different tiers of equipment need to be roughly the same for a PC as it is for pets.  see full quote here (http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?p=133782&amp;highlight=#133782) <br />
<br />
so im sorry your lvl 62 bazaar ass cant tank anything. that is not my fucking problem. what is my problem is that regardless of where i go and what i kill. my pet is basically identical. 1/3 of my damange does not scale in any way. my only means of defense beside running away gets less and less effective regardless of how much time or plat or gear i try and throw at the problem. <br />
<br />
now is it sinking into your thick skull what mages are bitching about or should i get the crayons out and draw you a fucking picture. <br />
<br />
and you say well i'll never see that stuff my current guild suxxors <br />
well guess what you wont be standing next to a pet thats owning shit either, the only time i see anyone from the time guilds in bot is when they are plin an alt. noone is asking for bazaar mages to have time level warrior mitigation. but i'll be damned if a time based mage pet shouldn't tank as well if not better than some jerkoff who got pld to 62 and has alot of bazaar gear.</div></div><hr />

YOU ARE THE FUCKING DUMB ASS COMING ON THE WARRIOR BOARD AND BITCHING! <br />
<br />
You are just getting dumber by the seconds don't you? <br />
I didn't come here to bitch, Gerick started thsi thread, I am just here to dispell a few mis-infromation about mages. <br />
And own a few noobs along the way, sux you are one of them. I feel sorry for you. <br />
<br />
WE, AS A WHOLE HATE SOLOING FUCKTARDS! <br />
<br />
/shrug, not like mages can solo nowadays anyhow. <br />
<br />
You solo because you are a STUPID ASSHOLE, without a single friend in game.<br />
<br />
That coming from you, no wonder you never leveled up, no one want to group with a grumpy noob? <br />
<br />
You started playing Mage right when KEI could be cast on any idiot and quickly leveled.<br />
<br />
hahahaha, When I started, C2 wasn't invented yet, let alone KEI. <br />
Please don't assume everyone is as much a noob as you are. <br />
<br />
Now, WAAAAAAA, I can get AA's every 20 minutes! So PUSSY, we have shown you do in excesse of 200 DPS with your pet and spells, we have shown your mana regen is not horribly out of whack<br />
<br />
We? exactly which bunch of &quot;you&quot; are you referring to? <br />
And which bunch of mages are you referring to? <br />
<br />
The average-joe-didn't-see-VT-mage?<br />
The VT-able-in-ele-plane-but-not-POtime-mage?<br />
Or the uberest-of-the-uberest-into-GoD-ikkz-mages?<br />
I know it's difficult, would you be more specific? <br />
It's hard to understand you in troll mode. <br />
<br />
All you show is how well you can whine. YOU ARE THE IDIOT, and now you have made an enemy.<br />
<br />
BRING IT!!!!<br />
<br />
A point to note, &quot;YOU ARE THE IDIOT&quot;? so it's a singular &quot;you&quot;. <br />
And &quot;an enemy&quot;. A singular enemy. <br />
So &quot;i&quot; have made and enemy---you(Doomflayer)? <br />
<br />
For some reason I don't feel threaten. Should I tremble?   hahahahahahaha<br />
<br />
I am heading over to the mage board to disrupt them, insult them, and cause problems.<br />
<br />
It's ok, if you wanted to be owned some more. <br />
Besides, there are a few mage boards, which one are you referring to? Or you are going to ALL mage board to troll now? <br />
Anyways, have fun. <br />
<br />
GO FUCK YOURSELF ASSHOLE!<br />
<br />
Do you think it's cool or it makes it more commanding to put everything in capital something? <br />
Let me try to see if it works. <br />
<br />
GO BACK AND WATCH YOUR RICHARD SIMONS VIDEOS COLLECTION!<br />
<br />
Druid: Winter's Frost-1550 damage<br />
Mage: Sun Vortex-1550 Damage<br />
<br />
Looks like the same damage to me asshole!<br />
<br />
haha, ready to be own agian so quick? <br />
Not a problem good thing I am not repulse by the idea of pwning a noob. <br />
<br />
Watch carefully http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3452&amp;source=Live<br />
Winter's Frost druid 65 spell<br />
Decrease Hitpoints by 1550 <br />
Mana: 390 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sun vortex---lvl 65 mage spell http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3325&amp;source=Live<br />
 Decrease Hitpoints by 1550 <br />
Mana: 395 <br />
<br />
<br />
read the mana cost. <br />
WIth doing the same damage, mage's spell cost 5 more mana. That in case you have trouble understanding, meaning druid nuke costing less mana. <br />
Same damage with less mana, I would say it's a better nuke. <br />
<br />
The whole point of the Mage bitch is you are upset you can't &quot;leet solo&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hahahaha, that shows how much you know. <br />
<br />
Well, by my magelo you can see I was in an Uber guild. Some went to Maelin Starpyre and we just lost to much DPS <br />
<br />
Na, You can't be uber when tehre are mages have more HP than you are. <br />
<br />
He started it, I flamed back, and you can take a big flying leap also asshole. Can't handle being cussed at like the 5 year olds that currently inhabit the Mage board? Quit EQ! They picked FUROR'S magelo to compare the pet to, that is so amusing to many here, and what is impressive is the astounding utter STUPIDITY of the Mage idiots that can't see why that is so utterly without merit.<br />
<br />
Oh.. But i have proof that you started it!<br />
<br />
The 5th post down at first page <br />
Mages need pets that will destroy a Time equiped warrior (lets use Furor as an example) solo! <br />
<br />
You are the one who used Furor, I simply use your sample warrior.  And of course owning your argument along the way. <br />
So no, we didn't compare to Furor, you did. <br />
<br />
If a Warrior, gets a guild together, gets all the best loot, your pet is NOT EVEN FUCKING comparable to him fucktwit.<br />
<br />
Again, mages didn't bring up Furor, you did.  But it's funny to see you get upset over that. hahahaha<br />
I think i'll stop replying to you, it's making me feel more sorry for you with each post I read that is by you. <br />
<br />
<br />
To Ciae Redemption<br />
Since a mage's 2 nuke lines, pet heals, and many other spells are all conj, I'm going to assume that mages specialize conjuration. Druids, however, especially raiding druids, specialize alteration, since saving mana on heals is more important than nukes.<br />
<br />
There is a little different with &quot;druids have a better nuke&quot; and &quot;druids nukes betetr than mages&quot;. <br />
<br />
You are arguing the latter and I am talking about the first. <br />
<br />
I agree that we do nuke better than druids because of spec, just with long calculations with pets we pulled out with around ~58 DPS more than druids with pets. And that difference isn't big enough for all the extra heal/utility/buffs that druids have. <br />
<br />
<br />
TO Kavak<br />
&quot;well you are stupid because you are a dumb warrior&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you are talking about doomflayer, or rather how people treated him. It's only because he is an idiot. Just a coincidence he's a warrior.</div></div><hr />

The whole point of the Mage bitch is you are upset you can't &quot;leet solo&quot;. Those are the people that piss me off! <br />
<br />
This is a 100 % complete misrepresentation of mage complaints.  Yes, it is frustrating playing a class that you started due to the fact it was a strong solo class, and have it become a mostly group dependent class(I started my mage for something to play when I did not have time to play my warrior.  It was nice not having to wait to find a group to be able toi start killing stuff).  Most mages tho accept that is the way things are now, and SoE is working to reduce soloing(tho they have a long way to go).  Our complaints are morethat as a DPS class, we feel we should bring a little more to the table to be able to compete with other DPS classes.  Other DPS classes either out DPS us, or have more utility, or both.  We are not generally looking for huge upgrades, but small tweaks.  <br />
<br />
If you are going to complain about what mages are asking for, then please be accurate.  Even most mages shoot down some of the high powered suggestions that the fringe element lunatics suggest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's why: &quot;Yes, it is frustrating playing a class that you started due to the fact it was a strong solo class, and have it become a mostly group dependent class&quot;<br />
<br />
That describes what I personally went through with my monk. I solo'd a lot. And overnight watched my toon go from being able to solo very well to being able to solo very poorly. It took me quite awhile to get back to being able to solo below averagely. And then soloing was removed altogether as an option as I advanced past 61. I know that doesn't strike a chord with warriors. And I can understand and respect that. It does strike a chord with me. And as such, I commiserate with mages.<br />
<br />
So I'll say it again ... if mages come up with some sort of list (within reason ... no manaburn 2.0's or anything) or do some sort of demonstration ... I'm right there with ya. You have my support.<br />
<br />
I know how ya feel.</div></div><hr />

If they would return monks to the old days, I would strip my warrior and certainly make a monk. I have never agree with the stupidity of not allowing classes to solo. The problem is to create a non-kiting soloing class requires they create grossly overpowered abilities.</div></div><hr />

If you have reason to want CoH, or mana is tight and so rods are handy, mages do have some utility, if not, then wizzies would be the first class I would point to as having both.  I don't think you would argue that in most situations, wizzies outdamage mages, plus can do better CC help with root...in many situations, that alone is better utility than a mage has.  Add in evac and TL's, and I would say they do offer slightly more utility.  Not 100 % sure how ranger DPS stacks up against mages, but it has to be close, and rangers offer harmony and snare and buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a couple notes.  First is that ranger melee DPS is not terrible(with self buffs they have unreal high attack ratings, plus imbue procs).  Second is that mages are hit by this same bug, especially spec evoc mages.  Our highest damage nuke is Firebolt of Tallon, a 2k damage bolt spell for 500 mana.  Bolt spells have the same limitations that bows do...if any part of mob is in zone geometry, it does no damage.  Both for rangers sake, and mages, and any other class that it affects, I agree that it should be fixed.  This does not take away from my comments that rangers do probably(I have no numbers to prove this, if anyone does I would love to see them) at least about same DPS as a mage, and has much more utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(might be likend to why we have the new combat window)<br />

The &quot;Programmers&quot; have known about this for a long time. I am not sure why it hasn't been fixed. When GoD was released with Berserkers, you would have expected they at least try to repair the problem (being that berserkers depend on thrown weapons so much for DPS).</div></div><hr />

<br />
2nd, mages can solo in GoD, PoP maybe not quite as effective as a wizzie or druid but it can be done and without the use of mage zerging, IE chain casting pets... although the mage may need to resummon pet 2 or 3 times during the fight but not in the same way as before. i dont mean hunting in tier1 zones either, matter of fact id say most anything a wizzie can do soloing outside quad kiting and most likely a druid too. mage just gotta have some skills is all.<br />
<br />
3rd, i see mages only real problem is that we have no way of getting rid of agro similar to a wizzie.  now my idea for a fix to this is simple, unnerf CoTH.. or make it so a mage can cast it on himself for the same effect. i mean if ya think about it, CoTH has a large mana tax on it for spell cost, a rather long cast time and uses a pearl as a regent. not only that but VI doesnt need to add a whole new line of spells, just tweak an existing spell a little.<br />
<br />
 i would bet if this was done the majority of mages would stop their rants, and well the people that say we should beable to outnuke wizzies and have our pets tank like a time gear warrior... well get used to not being able to please everyone in life</div></div><hr />

Any posts saying Mgae could solo was PRE 65th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Besides which, I may have decided to be level 62 to be with friends, but my Diablo 2 chars would absolutely destroy any you have! I don't care for the devs decisions in this game, and once WoW comes out, you can count on a WHOLE bunch leaving! When the 5 people still playing EQ1, have the final server shut down,. WoW and EQ2 will have taken over. This game has solely become beta for EQ2, get used to it.

Can't believe im posting in this thread again...Gerick, you obviously dont understand mages, please stop making yourself look like an idiot. We need much more than a 5 DPS increase in our pets, as master summoners, our pets should be our weapons, not our nukes.<br />
<br />
No animal from the forest should do more damage than an elemental summoned from the planes, the realms of the gods.  <br />
<br />
i was perposly minimizing your problems, if you cant understand that, sarcasm must also be out of your reach<br />
<br />
im suprised that i could incite such anger from you with 1 little sentance i put no effort in heh, and dont forget, those &quot;nature&quot; pets are imbued with spirits, akin to those gods you like(who we can kill once every 4 days)</div></div><hr />
