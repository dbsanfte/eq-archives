<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gishomil</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only asking this question to make sure I'm not misinterpreting some of the ways mobs interact in EQ.<br />
<br />
When I am in a MT situation, and are required to get aggro, I notice that being as close as humanly possible to the hit box of the mob, and taunting, achieves the desired effect of aggro far more than being on the side of the mob, and taunting.<br />
<br />
Yep, in a lot of raids it's always been clear that the MT should be in the only person in front of the mob, and that we should position so that everyone else can either surround to hold the mob in position, or get on it's backside.<br />
<br />
I also remember back in the days of Karnor's Castle that if you had a mezzed mob, and wanted to secure aggro before breaking mez, parking your butt right underneath the mob and taunting a few times was a sure fire thing (though you'd sometimes have to taunt 3-4 times depending on how long the mob has been mezzed.)<br />
<br />
As I play a dwarf warrior, I'm curious if large races experience the same situations, that aggro is much easier to grab and hold if you're right in the mobs face (literally, even sometimes positioned so I've been able to see &quot;inside&quot; the mobs 3d model.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merc</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's called proximity aggro, and it can make a warrior that weilds CHoS/SotBS almost as good as a warrior with one EB weapon IF that warrior stays right in the mobs face at all times.<br />
<br />
I rarely ever tank in first person mode these days.  I tank in 3rd person so I can A) get right up in the mobs face without worrying about losing sight of him, and B) so I can know the positioning of the people around me and see where the mob goes even if someone behind me pulls the aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merc</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also some mobs are more effected by proximity aggro than others.  I've seen a tank proc shadow vortex tagging AoW and then seen him run off and swat down an AFK shaman just for beinf closer by.<br />
<br />
Someone said this in another post but it seems like raid level mobs have some extra coding in place that makes them react more strongly to proximity aggro than typical xp type mobs.</div></div><hr />
