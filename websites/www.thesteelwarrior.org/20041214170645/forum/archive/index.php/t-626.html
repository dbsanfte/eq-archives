<br />
This would allow warriors to tank the hole mob instead of 3 mins . It would allow non MT warriors to crank out some good dps. And it would allow the warrior to use some of his other disciplines without haveing to panic that defensive/evasive wont be available.<br />
<br />
Each of these disciplines has a negative side effect , so really i dont see a need to have a timer on them . I mean realistically these 3 should be available any time , if your getting beat on hard u should be able to decide your gonna lay off the offensive and concentrate on defence , and any time u decide to change out you should be able to, then maybe switch to aggressive when the mob is fleeing or attacking someone else.<br />

Compared your sustained dps to that of a caster lately?  It's pretty sadly out of whack.  I am max worn attack, Blade of War, and I still only push out 170-180 dps if the mob is perfectly positioned and I am not tanking.  Our wizards easily do 300 regardless of situation.  Overpowered?  Hardly.<br />
With perma defensive most elemental encounters would become very trivial, as it is now our MT's only die if they get an unlucky round with defensive down, and if DI doesn't doesn't go off. <br />
Give one example of an elemental encounter that would be rendered trivial by implementation of perma defensive/evasive.  Name one.  Do you perform tank switches on -any- of the mobs?  We don't.  We single tank Xegony, Fennin, Mystical Arbitor, Warlord in poeb.  Fennin takes about 6 minutes, Xegony takes about 45 minutes, Warlord takes about 12-15 minutes, and MA takes about 4 minutes.  In all situations here, the tank is tanking these things non defensive for some or most of an encounter.<br />
<br />
Are you suggesting that there is additional &quot;skill&quot; required when defensive wears off?  What &quot;skill&quot; is required and who is it required from?<br />

Examples.  Wild-eyed proclamations don't get it done.</div></div><hr />

this has been suggested several times, in one form or another, on the old board by myself and others, but unless someone gets off their arse and posts on the dev corner it's not likely SoE's gonna take notice.<br />

I am not even going to argue about wizards substaining 300 DPS easily, but do you want to be able to tank as well as we do and putting out the same DPS as wizards or come close to it?  Hardly balance if that was the case.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ...<br />
<br />
Oh wait, that wasn't sarcasm ?!?!<br />
<br />
but do you want to be able to tank as well as we do and putting out the same DPS as wizards or come close to it?<br />
<br />
How is the warrior going to be able to get even close to caster DPS?  Offensive disciplines.<br />
<br />
What disciplines does the Tank use?  Defensive  disciplines.<br />
<br />
It should go without saying that a Warrior using Defensive disciplines will still not put out anywhere near the DPS of a caster.  Or hell, anybody else for that matter.<br />
<br />
Removing (or greatly reducing) the Defensive/Evasive/Aggresive timers will immediatly do a couple of things:<br />
<br />
- allow the Warrior MT to be more effective in the single role the Warrior is designed for.<br />
- allow non-MT Warriors to be more desireable in a group/raid because of their increased DPS.<br />
<br />
This change won't affect the current aggro-holding woes the Warriors suffer with however, so I still see Knights getting chosen over Warriors for exp groups.</div></div><hr />

Warriors..... ..... ..... ..... I get to pess taunt/kick most of the night<br />

Ok I love being a Warrior, pure melee, up front fighting but where are the fun discs? Oh yes 12secs every hour and pray you dont need defensive/evasive<br />
<br />
More utility pls, more eye candy pls, more things to do...hell they even let clerics melee cos they were bored. I want to cripple a mob, I want to blind a mob, I want to hack its arm off and beat it to death with the bloody end.<br />
<br />
I dont want to press taunt/kick.</div></div><hr />

casters are fine compared to us they over do it they die balanced and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nothing is wrong with our dps... and hes accually right. it is a little high atm. dont compare it to casters unless you are a moron. compare it to rogues and monks. we should always be noticably below them. being able to toggle disc's is a horrable idea. it would make the game entirely too easy. the only thing i would say still needs working on is taunt, but that has even been working better as of late. the warrior class just needs better tanking capablity over sk's.. thats all. our discs are the only thing that keep up over an sk in tanking. something just needs to be fixed there ie: more innate hp or more innate taunt.<br />
We are noticeably below monks and rogues.  Exactly how is our dps &quot;too high&quot; when you give no examples to compare?  I know what my monks and rogues dish out, and it's decently above my damage.  How anyone would see warrior damage as too high atm is beyond me.<br />
<br />
When you talk about the game being too easy, what the hell are you talking about?  By too easy you mean you don't need zerg clerics for an encounter?  You mean instead of having 6 clerics in a cheal chain you could slow it down and have 4 clerics in a cheal chain?  Oh my lord, SO MUCH EASIER.<br />
<br />
Let me give you nubis a clue:  Keeping a warrior alive is the easiest thing to do in Everquest.  It requires ZERO skill as the game is now.  Dealing with everything else is the issue.  When was the last time someone lost Rallos Zek because you couldn't keep the MT alive?  Those who lose to Rallos Zek do so because they can't manage the adds.  When was the last time you lost to Xegony because it took skill to keep the MT alive?  Never.  You lose to Xegony because you failed to deal with the adds.<br />
<br />
This whole bullshit about how a perma defensive warrior would trivialize anything is stupid.  No one giving an example of how it would &quot;unbalance&quot; the game, no one giving an example as to how it would make a single encounter noticeably easier.<br />
<br />
The reason there are no examples is because there are none, and it would have no impact on the difficulty of encounters as they are today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no way a warrior should be anywhere near a wizard in DPS.  Are you guys nuts?<br />
<br />
Wizards may be overbalanced in comparison to melee damage dealing classes, but comparing a warrior to a wizard in DPS is silly.</div></div><hr />

It would remove the necessity for clerics to be in the CH chain, but since the only dmg a cleric can do is with their hammer, they'd start leaving in droves or complain even more that they're now useless.<br />
<br />
Okay, that's a little bit of exaggeration, it wouldn't make it unbalanced in that way, although the clerics still will want some boosts if they're not needed for the CH chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh...  Fennin Ro is putting out 1000 dps average with the ability to do 8000 damage in a single round while evasive.  You aren't gonna be putting a CH chain out of business any time soon.<br />
<br />
Brutul, I in no way am suggesting that a warrior should be doing wizard damage.  I was giving an example that we are doing 50-60% of wizard damage at the moment.  If we're currently overpowered, what should the ratio be?  We should do 50% of wizard damage?  40%?<br />
<br />
As an aside, Fennin did 9900 damage to me in a little less than 2 seconds the other day.  I had 1905 AC.  Gratz wipe due to total luck of the RNG.  Clearly we would have prevailed if we only had more skill!</div></div><hr />

We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I tend to agree that defensive is mostly a buffer for those cleric that fucked up these days (except on very few extremly violent monsters), I fail to see why having it on all the time would help anything.  We do still use defensive to tank most of the stuff, and 1 thing I like is the fact that when ae taunt/def is down, someone else then the 10k hp tank is going to deal with the mob, and from time to time that mean me.  People want efficient healing, and having defensive always available at a toggle would make certain that no other class(paladin, sk) ever see tanking of an uber mob unless all the warriors are dead.<br />
 <br />
So arguments against toggle defensive for me are : <br />
-Current defensive allow for more tank transitions on tough mobs or on successive mob farm which imo is good for tanks in the guild.<br />
-It allow sk and paladin to be tank at a lesser efficienty but still at a manageable efficienty since a non defensive warrior is very similar to a paladin/sk.  Having defensive available all the time would ensure that paladins/sk are always inferior tank by a very large margin, which is bad for class balance.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, having offensive available at a toggle would imo be clearly overpowered in the current game.  Offensive is by far the best dps disc in the game by a very large margin.  The penalty for using offensive are that you do not have another disc available and that as a warrior with no mean of aggro evasion, if you aggro or if the previous tank die, you risk of dying very fast since most mob can kill you in 1 or 2 round under that disc.  These 2 penalties would be inexistant under a toggled /disc.<br />
<br />
Actually, thinking about it more, in the current state of the game having all these disc available at a toggle would be quite retarded.  You would see a constant spam of warrior changing state.  For example, every fight warriorswould enter defensive, then switch to offensive as aggro is established.  MT lose aggro?  5 spam of tank going defensive, followed by 4 tank going offensive 5 seconds later. <br />
<br />
In term of dps it would also mean that high end warrior would outdmg monk all the time and rogue most of the time.  It would probably be more fun thought indeed, switching very often, trying to avoid the riposte for 4.5k and doing more dmg then all the other melee or so.. but it would not be very balanced.<br />
<br />
I don't really feel that warrior have that much a problem at the lvl I play at, I'm certain we could use some improvements like most of the classes in some area, but I would really be against this solution for the reasons I stated.<br />

We only need to be concerned with how much damage we do in relation to other tank classes IMO.  Warriors are not damage dealers, never have been, never will be.  I think we should be focusing on what our actual role is...tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, on a Raid that is what the role should be ...<br />
<br />
So what do you do if your raid has 4 Warriors?  What does the non-MT Warrior do?  DPS?  Preparing for an MT switch?  Sit on his butt and think &quot;i'm glad they allowed me to come on this raid, 'cause they damn sure don't need me ...&quot;?<br />
<br />
What does a Warrior bring to an exp group?  Aggro control?  DPS?<br />
<br />
Ultimately, what does a Defensive disc do?  It effectively adds more HP's to the Warrior ...<br />
<br />
Why not just flat out add more HP's to the warrior then?<br />
<br />
Do Warriors need more HP's?<br />
<br />
Honestly, I like the idea of a reduced re-use timer for discs ... as it is now 99% of the damn things are unusable.<br />
<br />
What I really want more than anything is better aggro control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe i forgot to mention that only 1 of the 3 (defensive, evasive and aggressive) should be able to be &quot;active&quot; at a time.<br />
<br />
 Perhaps each of the 3 would have to be slightly less effective if they were always available , but it just makes sense to me that  a warrior (or hell any melee) should be able to decide at any time to be more offensive or more defensive in fighting technique. Like i said before , if your getting beat to crap too fast , who wouldnt go into a more defensive style of fighting , its silly that it should only last 3 mins.<br />

<br />
This is true of pretty much all classes though.  Besides clerics there's not many classes that could say you &quot;need&quot; more than 4 of them on most raids.  The extra warriors can do a little damage, tank adds, and step up if the tanks ahead of them go down.  No less useful than say the number 4 enchanter on a raid, or the #2 shadowknight or paladin.  The only classes that truly &quot;stack&quot; on raids are damage dealers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been suggested for a long time to scrap defensive disc and put warriors on their own defensive table and not on the same one as the knight classes and I agree. This already would make warriors more attractive for almost all groups since they would get damaged less than a knight class over time and thus require less healing in the term of any group compared to a knight. Yeah the knights will bitch and whine about the gap opening again, but that's why they have compensation in terms of spells and utility when warriors don't. Warriors should take the least damage over time than any of the melee classes. If you want to play a melee that can cast spells, well then you forfiet some damage mitigation compared to those who want to play a warrior class. It's common sense. The way it is now is ridiculous, the only defensive ability that seperates warriors from the knight classes is...defensive disc, thats too funny, in all other facets of defense ability, knights = warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors should also have their offense table upgraded, not a whole lot, but not so that we are so far behind rogues/monks/rangers as to be considered DPS fodder. A slight increase in DPS will also go some way into improving warrior ability to hold agro without messing around with the way taunt works as it stands now. It will also allow the more average warriors with average gear to be able to slot in with some increased DPS to the benefit of their own maintenance of agro and to the benefit of the group. Once again it's fair compensation for being a class that has no real spells/utilities apart from the armour they wear and the weapons they wield.<br />
<br />
Let the other classes bitch and moan about it. Verant was way too soft and always bowed to the whining of the other classes and always left warriors alone because warriors are &quot;the benchmark which all other melees are compared to&quot;. What complete crap. The way it stands now warriors *aren't* unbalanced but the way the other melee classes have been upgraded over umpteen times to get to where they are now has managed to erode warriors from being seen by groups as viable in mainly places like PoP. I'll give you an example of how....<br />
<br />
I was in a south top group in BoT only just yesterday and we had to find a replacement for a group member who was leaving. We found a paladin and he joined us. Now bear in mind I had been the MA for hours up until then but 2 of the group members asked &quot;so who is the MT now&quot;. It struck me as a surprising question but there you have it. To me the answer was obvious...the group had been working well up till then, then why shake the roles up. I was told the paladin can maintain rock solid agro...I didn't get angry...in fact they were bloody right. I cannot compete against a paladin for rock solid agro....so I didn't argue, there was no point. If it wasn't for the fact that I had nearly 2k more HP than him with the same buffs the group would have suggested that he becomes the MT. So according to the eyes of the group THATS THE ONLY THING THAT SEPERATED ME AND THE PALADIN WAS MY HP. Other classes don't give a rats ass what warriors think about what OTHER warriors should have be it in game or on these kinds of message boards. At the end of the day it's how your group or raid percieves you and what it is you bring to the table for them to be able to find a role for you. So for a little while there I was about to be relegated into a role where all I was doing was delivering subpar DPS compared to a rogue or monk etc who could have taken my place and made the group more dps efficient. Knights take damage the same way warriors do and because of the fact they have taunt on demand while warriors use a random number generator makes it difficult to argue with group members. I wasn't angry...I conceded that yeah the paladin would do a better job at maintaining taunt. However, that's not how it ended up in the end and that was cool. It was a very very fun and competant group all day (wish I could carry groups like that in my pocket actually) but it was a point of reflection that the only reason i maintained MA status was because of my HP.<br />
<br />
This isn't a rant...this is HOW IT IS. <br />
<br />
So I believe evasive/defensive etc should be scrapped and warriors be given upgraded offense and defense tables so they stand alone...as warriors.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are supposed to deal as much dps as rangers. Monks were supposed to deal more dps than warriors ( never saw a quoted number )and rogues were supposed to deal more than monks ( agian no number ) to sit as the kings of damage over all.<br />

Scrap the idea of the disciplins, and just make a sliding toggle bar like for selecting coins.  in the middle it has no effects twards offensive or defensive ability.  On one end make your defensive output go up by say 20% (half of defensive disc iirc) but like the /disc def you do 20% less damage, on the exact opposite end make it the reverse, your offensive output is increased by 20% but your def output is decreased by 20%<br />
<br />
This would allow warriors to decide how they want to play, offensively or definsively, but not overpowering to either extreme.  honestly i think it would be fun to have something to do other than autoattack then kick/disarm.  Hell, at this point i swap weapons constantly just for something to do, having a scale to play with might make our job a little more fun.  <br />
<br />
Or if ya don't like warriors being offensive, just remove that end of the scale.  Make it go from 20% defensive improvement to normal.  Either way i think it would give us atleast a feeling of having more control over our role in the game other than which item/weapon do i get.<br />

To clarify my points, I wasn't comparing our dps to casters, to compare the dps of a warrior to the dps of a wizard is completely irrelevant, the wizard's only job is to deal damage, ofcourse they're going to be better at it.<br />
 <br />
Rather i was comparing the dps of a warrior to that of a monk, rogue or ranger. Right now our damage is comparable to a monk if not superior in some cases. Is it supposed to be? No. We're supposed to be a fair deal bahind the dps focuesed melee classes, but we're not.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I'm not sure how your guild NEVER has a tank die, but you guys dserve congratulations. My guild however, still has tanks die against xegony on occasion if there's a blip in the chain with defensive down, and it's caused us to fail before too. Ofcourse if defensive never fell, the clerics could use a slower chain and stay fm the whole time, I don't see how you could believe that it wouldn't affect the game at all.<br />
<br />
Now lets go back to the monk, right now they're right on par with us dps wise, suddenly /disc aggresssive is on the whole time and they've just fallen behind by a good 40-50dps. We're now matching up with rogues, all the time, as long as we're not tanking. Whats the point of being any other class?<br />
<br />
Warriors are now the perfect melee in every way. By choosing the right perma disc to keep on we're the best dps, highest hp/ac, and have the best innate mitigation, we also have the broadest choice of equipment availible to us. Doesn't it sound just a tad overpowering?</div></div><hr />

Because at 55, when you have it, it's a great, fabulous tool. Between 55 and 60 defensive is great, and what make us different and powerful. There was always this aggro problem, but for xp pre-pop it doesn't matter : Juggs in sebilis are hitting for... 175 max, and most xp mobs are less dangerous...<br />
<br />
But for Pop, where tier 1 trash double or tripple for 300, and later you must fight 800 hitters, this aggro problem become HUGE. most Casters are very very poor in hps, and even unslowed trash can kill an average tank quickly, so robe guys...<br />
Yesterday I was fighting golems in PoV, our bard (with 45% slow song) gone LD, guess what ? I was a mana sponge for the cleric, even with virtue, BSS, Cotr, SoV. Unslowed mobs are the evil. I dream of a zone who do not need slower, where all mobs are at the right speed and are not SUPPOSED to be slowed. Like Sebilis was, like every Velious dongeon was.<br />
<br />
I think we can reduce the question of balancing to the question : Considering the lack of aggro we have, and the lack of diversity, what are the ways SOE can dig to make us more attractive and balanced especially in xp group ? I see 2 kind of answers :<br />
1 - correct our aggro generation to make us lock aggro like knights do.<br />
2 - Give us more tank related things to do beside &quot;Autofight - Taunt - Keep timer ready for Defensive&quot;. like separate disc timers, group friendly abilities and such.</div></div><hr />

Kal you keep missing the point. The aggro issue is not that warriors can NOT lock aggro, it's that knights CAN. <br />
<br />
If you can only see one side of the answer: make warriors have snap aggro lock just like pallies (despite the fact that most agree that this would simply unbalance the game even more than it is), then you are just making SOE's case for them when they say 'the warriors are just whiners who are asking to be overpowered'. You are in essence supporting the case to keep things as they are.<br />
<br />
Here is the logical equivalent and a more practical alternative to your suggestion:<br />
<br />
1. correct [knight] aggro generation to make [them not] lock aggro like [warriors don't].<br />
<br />
It gets to the same place, but does it in such a way as to ameliorate, not exacerbate, the existing game imbalance.</div></div><hr />

Warriors, Monks, and Rogues with equivalent weapons are reasonably far apart.  I see too many posts comparing warrior, rogue and monk damage when the weapon levels are varied.  Just because the BoW is easy to obtain compared to a similar weapon for a monk doesn't change the base difference between a monk, warrior and rogue with equivalent weapons.  Those differences are fine at the moment.  Monks in my guild with Zha routinely outdamage me to the tune of 30-40%.  Rogues routinely beat me by 50-60%.  Rangers situationally do 120%of my damage but mostly are right in line.  That is just fine.  Should a wizard outdamage me by 80-100%?  Not sure that is fine, but I don't really care that much.<br />
<br />
Let me give you an example of our Xegony fight.  We use six clerics, two necros and two SKs to keep a single tank up.   Occasionally we switch to a backup tank due to lag.  would the job be any different if the warrior was permanently defensive?  No, it wouldn't.  We'd switch to 4 clerics but the necros would still be feeding them.  Does it make the encounter any &quot;harder&quot; because it needs more people?<br />
<br />
Making an event REQUIRE more people does NOT make it harder.  It just makes it require... more people.<br />
<br />
And no where did I advocate perma agressive for warriors.  I was simply disputing that warriors have &quot;overpowered&quot; dps or that perma-defensive would &quot;trivialize&quot; the game.  I'm still waiting for an example as to how it would make it any easier.  I do think that warriors should have noticeably, significantly better ability to tank at all times than any other class.  Otherwise, there is no point to our class.  I would also like to see defensive removed and replaced with permanent mitigation advantage.<br />
<br />
However, there is still no reason to take a tank for an xp group.  I've hated xping ever since Sony decided that camping for AA was more fun than camping for loot, so it doesn't really matter to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because you now have 2 clerics that are free to heal the add tanks, and (assuming no lag) a tank that will never die to an unlucky round, where it may be possible for him to die with defensive down.

My god of course it makes any encounter easier if you can use less clerics or less of any class. Those people are now free to do damage, heal people other than the main tank etc. That doesn't make any specific encounter easier?<br />
<br />
Things should be hard. Fighting Gods should have an extreme risk of death, every second of the fight. You are asking that warriors suddenly are able to take half damage in fights that are already trivial to high level guilds. And then you say it wouldn't imbalance the game or trivialize the encounters even further.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deriana</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Playing a lvl 65 warrior as main character, i saw some big mobs (didnt get to elemental yet, but we are 1 or 2 mobs away from it).  I tanked bertox with defensive, and without it...  Believe me, defensive MAKE the difference for my healers, thats why i gotta let them know that i lost it.  Having a perma defensive WOULD help tons (when we first tried AoW, we had to do 3 tank switch cause of defensive wearing off).  Am i suggesting SOE to allow us to do that ? No, in no way.  Why ?  Because its part of the game, the trill to have to switch, ask us to control more and more the tanking, ask our clerics to always keep an eye out, it brings a guild to work as a team, and it allow other warriors to be usefull too.<br />
<br />
Are we suppose to do a lot of dmg ?  No.  If im doing 30% of the dmg my lvl 65 magician is doing, holly shit im hella happy !!!  We are tanks.  We have at least 3k more HP than most other classes.  We CANT ask to do more DPS :) That would effectivly be unbalancing the classes.  Why having a wizard in my group when i can grab a second warrior who can do maybe just 60% of their dmg, but take up the mob if the MA die ?  That would be stupid to allow us to do more dmg, IMHO.<br />
<br />
As it was mentionned, the only thing that need to be fix for warriors is taunt.  Even with a SoD and a BoC, i cant keep aggro on some mobs (mostly in PoTactics, when you have to attack those who do what, 800 points of dmg as AE ?) if i dont take time to build this aggro.  And in PoP, you cant build aggro on all the mobs, what means that there will be pong between all the fighters and what can make you loose instead of win.<br />
<br />
And for those who state that its boring to play a warrior because all you do is press kick, taunt, and attack...  Well, every class has its problems, people will always complain whatever the class they play.  I have a lvl 65 cleric, 65 enchanter, 65 magician and 65 warrior.  Also a lvl 55 druid and 58 monk.  I switched between them a lot of time, cause there is always something that doesnt fit with your personnality, at one time in the game.  Maybe, if you find it boring to play a warrior, you need to switch class.  I love the feeling of tanking a mob, i love the feeling of having a cleric healing me at 5% health, i love receiving tells during a fight from our raid leader asking me to move some to position the mob, or telling me to keep goign that i do an excellent job with the placement and the AE calls...  Its all a matter of interests.  Warriors ARENT boring when you love the class, if you find it boring, maybe you didnt pick up the good class :) took me 4 classes before deciding to keep the warrior :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far we've established that a warrior tanking Xegony permanently defensive would allow you to be able to complete the encounter with fewer clerics.  We have not established that it makes anything any easier.<br />
<br />
For those of you who have never fought Xegony before, you tank her for 45 minutes.  Most of the time we never lose a tank on her.  When we do it's due to a cleric missing a heal.  It has never been due to a lucky round in our experience.  I don't even think about the MT during the fight, because I expect him to stay alive and even if he doesn't, the secondary MT who has been fighting Xegony the entire time takes over and omg, hits defensive.  The clerics pick up on him, MT gets rezzed, and the fight goes on.  This switch doesn't really take much &quot;skill&quot;, it's not difficult to accomplish in any way.<br />
<br />
When my guild killed Avatar of War shortly after Luclin came out, we didn't have AE taunt, and most of us didn't have defensive AAs.  We did have to tank switch then because our tanks had 6300 or so hp, and couldn't survive for long on him.  We tank switched by managing aggro and using rangers to weaponshield so the next tank could get aggro.  That was necessary for us and fun.<br />
<br />
In Vex Thal, we needed to tank switch again, as the melee damage output plus the proc was often too much for a non disc tank to manage.  We would go through a tank rotation using AE taunt because there was no other way for us to reasonably do the encounter.<br />
<br />
There is not an equivalent mob in tier 1-4 in PoP to either of these mobs.  Zero mobs require tank switching in tier 1-4.  Furthermore, many, many mobs die either before defensive wears off or shortly after.  If a mob had the damage output to actually put a tank's life at risk undisced, I'd agree with you, perma-defensive would make it easier.  The reality is that since no mob in tier 1-4 of PoP requires a tank switch, a refresh on defensive discipline doesn't matter.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, if you lose a tank on Fennin, your encounter is over, unless Fennin is low enough for you to riposte tank/zerg him.  The moment the main tank dies on Xegony your cleric chain is summoned one by one; often half of them are dead before anyone else even notices the main tank is dead.  Is there any amount of skill that can save you from this situation?  I suppose you could get extravagant, keep clerics in reserve ready to start a rotation on a new defensive tank that hopes to get lucky with AE taunt, but I don't call that skill, I call it zerg and luck.  Zerg because that means keeping at least 5 clerics sitting on the sidelines doing nothing, luck because AE taunt doesn't always work on mobs as big as Fennin, and surviving AE rampage to get there, Fennin's movement and managing position with the clerics leaves much to luck.<br />
<br />
Explain to me, &quot;Ainmerisgay&quot;, how an encounter that requires more people is more difficult than an encounter that does not.  I rate pre-nerf Spider island in air as a difficult encounter, but it required fewer people than Xegony or Fennin does.  I rate Rydda Dar as a difficult encounter, but again, requires fewer people than Xegony or Fennin.  Our success/failure rate on Xegony or Fennin is much better than our success/failure rate on either of those two encounters.<br />
<br />
I'm particularly frustrated with the game mechanic of &quot;more difficult = requires more people&quot; right now due to our experiences with the Rathe encounter.  This encounter still has a pretty much hardcoded minimum of characters to do well, and despite 9 hours of near flawless play from our intrepid band of 55-60 adventurers, we would always run out of steam when managing the final two councilmen.  It wasn't a question of how well we played, it was a question of needing an additional 6-12 people to bolster our force that was stretched too thin.<br />
<br />
What frustrates me about this is that I certainly like raid sizes of 48-60, which in the &quot;old days&quot; was quite zerg indeed.  It frustrates me that most encounters are tuned for a certain minimum number of individuals, yet there is one (the rathe) that requires you to swell your ranks to complete.  What do I do with these extra people on the other 99% of the encounters we face?  I should increase my average raid size for the sake of one encounter?<br />
<br />
That was an aside.  No one has still given an example as to why any particular encounter in PoP would become easier due to a perma defensive.  Merely comments like these:<br />
<br />
With perma defensive most elemental encounters would become very trivial, as it is now our MT's only die if they get an unlucky round with defensive down, and if DI doesn't doesn't go off. <br />
<br />
It would remove the necessity for clerics to be in the CH chain, but since the only dmg a cleric can do is with their hammer, they'd start leaving in droves or complain even more that they're now useless.<br />
<br />
Because you now have 2 clerics that are free to heal the add tanks, and (assuming no lag) a tank that will never die to an unlucky round, where it may be possible for him to die with defensive down. Seems to me that'd be quite a bit easier.<br />
<br />
Can't you see how stupid your argument is? My god of course it makes any encounter easier if you can use less clerics or less of any class. Those people are now free to do damage, heal people other than the main tank etc. That doesn't make any specific encounter easier?<br />
<br />

<br />
These aren't examples.  The theme seems to be &quot;They'd be trivial because they need less clerics&quot; (the horror), or &quot;They'd be trivial because they would make tank switching obsolete&quot; (wake up son, they already are), or &quot;all these two or three extra people that aren't healing the MT now will make the encounter easier because they can nuke and heal and stuff!&quot; (Or maybe you just don't guild more people than you need)<br />
<br />
I do find Thorbadin's comments thoughful, and agree with him that it wouldn't really help anything, which was really my point from the beginning.  It would help you use less clerics for an encounter, but it wouldn't improve the valuje of a warrior.  If EQ's engine were able to actually allow you to truly &quot;interact&quot; with a mob, changing defensive and offensive styles to match the mob's styles, it would make our role much more enjoyable, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
EQ's engine doesn't really support this, however, and probably never will.  I am certain WoW will, however, and perhaps EQ2 as well.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line:  The impact perma defensive would have on the game is that you would go from a 1% chance of losing a battle like Xegony or Fennin due to tank death to a .01% chance of losing a battle like Xegony or Fennin due to tank death.  Wow, big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys have really gone off the rails with this. Yes the MT on big raids / god kills is almost always a warrior yada yada yada. Pulling out figures as to how many clerics you take on a raid etc etc. Who cares, you are all getting inflamed at each other for something that is crying out loud obvious anyway. What about the poor schmoe who just wants a damn BoT exp group for crying out loud? What does Joe Average Warrior bring to the table to compete with rock solid agro hold of the knight classes? More HP...that's about all. He maybe in a situation where he doesnt have many more HP than a well equipped knight class who is also in the group. Guess who everyone is going to want to MT? Chances are is that Joe Average Warrior isn't dual wielding EB weapons. The current reasoning by most classes that DON'T play warriors who are in YOUR exp group when you go to these places is that the knights can keep them safe and sound because they have the agro capability. Knights and warriors are on the same damage mitigation table, so why not let the knight tank? So what is the poor warrior left with. No tanking role...and crap DPS. Hit attack and go make a cup of coffee. Aren't warriors meant to be tanks like everyone keeps saying?<br />
<br />
I'm lucky in that I haven't been in this situation, although it's been suggested by a few groups of late to let the knight tank. It's only my HP that changes their mind. It's a thin line now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your logic to have permanent defensive is that mobs have to be one tanked to win anyway, then why have mobs even do melee damage?  That only requires more cleric as well.  After all if permanent defensive makes the warrior tanking Xegony for 45 minutes only need 4 instead of 6 clerics, having Xegony doing no melee damage only makes the clerics needed from 4 to 0 (at least on the MT).<br />
<br />
Why have mobs do damage at all if you can win?  Why have adds if your CC team can always lock them down?  Adds only serve to increase the number of CC classes and by your logic that's bad and there should be no adds ever if you can handle them at least once (since after that it's just adding # of people you need).  <br />
<br />
Why not just have a mob roll over and die if it deems your raid force too strong for it and save all the trouble of the actual fight?  Given an encounter that you've done before, the player will usually win, so why does the mob even bother fight back?  Why not make combat in EQ where the mob just looks at who's at your raid, computes their gear/AA/composition etc to get a *strength* of your raid and rolls a dice based on that chance.  If you win mob dies instantly and hands over loot.  If mob wins everyone in the raid gets DTed and you can't try again until an hour later.<br />
<br />
Needing more people and longer fights is inherently challenging.  The fact that you need 6 instead of 4 clerics on Xegony is what makes her hard.  The fact that you need to fight Xegony for 45 minutes instead of 4 minutes is what makes her hard.  Maybe it's no longer challenging to you, but I can assure you if Xegony only needed 4 clerics and only need 4 minutes to be killed (every other aspect can be keep the same), she'd be a much easier fight than her current form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The truth is that I don't feel that warriors are badly broken as a raiding class at all; warriors are suffering in an exp group environment, and their problem is that they are not generating sufficient aggro.<br />
<br />
Warriors rely on procs a lot to gain aggro, and procs are inherently unreliable.  The taunt key doesn't work often enough for a warrior to compete effectively with a knight class in an experience group, and I feel that if that were fixed, then a lot of warriors would be a lot happier.<br />
<br />
How about...<br />
<br />
/disc insult:-  The warrior's next taunt will automatically succeed if the target critter is level 62 or less; three minute reuse.<br />
<br />
/disc taunter:-  The warrior's melee attacks will generate twice their normal amount of hate.  Duration fifteen seconds; three minute reuse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok I'd like new discs, but I dont think its a answer to the problem of early aggro in xp group... We need something that do not work 1 time every 3 mins. in xp usually you make 2 pulls, sometimes 3 in those 3 mins.<br />
<br />
This is how I see the Warrior game :<br />
1 - You start fighting the mob incoming when he's in camp.<br />
2 - Mob turn on the early casting slower.<br />
3 - you taunt the mob. if it works, go to 9, if not continue to 4.<br />
4 - You AE taunt the mob (go to 9). If you can't (not bought the AA, or already used it, or cannot use because there's npc...) go to 5.<br />
5 - you shield the caster who aggroed. if it works, go to 9. if not, go to 6.<br />
6 - you pray for a proc. If your god answer, go to 9. if he has been killed (happen a lot those days), go to 7.<br />
7 - the slower is in danger.<br />
8 - Taunt is up again ! you have another try ! Beside, melee damage will certainly make the mob turn on you.<br />
9 - CONGRATULATIONS ! you have aggroed the mob !<br />
<br />
and the knight one :<br />
1 - You start casting stun/dot/snare when the mob is in range.<br />
2 - Mob stay on you<br />
3 - You cast another spell to lock aggro.<br />
4- CONGRATULATIONS ! you have aggroed the mob !</div></div><hr />

Ainmer, why are you still playing everquest if it obviously causes you so much strife? Why are you on the game 6 to 12 hours a day if warriors are just the laughing stock of Sony?

I don't feel that getting rid of disc timers is the answer to warrior problems.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The /disc thing was brought up as a melee class problem, not just for warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
That out of the way, take a look at warrior /discs some time, other than the three min ones and the ones below 50. There are some nice things that are useless most of the time because we cannot use them.  Now take the /discs off the one overall timer and onto their own timers and all of a sudden warriors have all kinds of things they can do.<br />
<br />
And I can quite assure you that being able to do one of those 9 second /discs every pull will help the group situation.</div></div><hr />
