<br />
EverQuest Chat on November 24th at 6:00pm - 7:00pm pacific time. Melee System Enhancements!<br />
You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com <br />
<br />
<br />
Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting <br />
Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes <br />
Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat <br />
Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay<br />
<br />
Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill! <br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a combat example:<br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the &quot;opening icon&quot; and the word &quot;Parry&quot; next to it (this information also appears in the chat window). <br />
<br />
Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC. <br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round. <br />
<br />
Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills <br />
<br />
<br />
Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool <br />
Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills <br />
Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose <br />
Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters <br />
Disciplines will be transferred to this new system <br />
Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer <br />
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost <br />
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward. <br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat. <br />
<br />
Talk to you in the Live Chat! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like stances and 'stamina pool' are carrying over.<br />
<br />
 Start thinking about questions - I'll assume this one's not gonna be on Test long if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't help but to fear either it's going to do nothing, or it makes people who are actually not AFK so good that Knights will come out crying they're now useless because a warrior just does his dragon punch into super fireball combo on a mob on incoming and has aggro lock for the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
Now, my history of posts should suggest I, of all people, have a lot of faith in SoE.  But stuff like this just seems really hard to get right.  It's too easy to mess up on something like that.  I hope they'll get it right though.  Or if they can't, it wouldn't be bad if we can be overpowered for a while until they do figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What's the point of all this, if the rest of the melees who aren't actively MAIN TANKING have to stand BEHIND the mob, to avoid the stupidly large amounts of riposte damage that certain bosses dish out?<br />
<br />
In other words, will I, as a monk, ever see an opening worth trying for, if I'm at max melee range, behind Mob_X, bunched up with 30 other people jockeying for a clean shot at Mob_X's ass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I imagine there might be something like say, after executing an extraordinary dragon punch, you now have an opening to combo into a super fireball, which will do additional damage, or you can combo into a super flying kick which gives you improved attack for a short duration.  I don't see how it's only limited to the person tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the article Absor posted, there will be openings that everyone will be able to exploit, and others only the MT will.<br />
<br />
Here's the quote from the above article...<br />
<br />
Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters <br />
<br />
Also disciplines will be tied to this as well, so you could conceivably hit Ashenfist or something similar and really whack the hell outta the mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well consider that casters always say they've to get their spells blah blah blah, I think it's fair we have to do the equivalent of hunting for spells as long as it makes us appropriately powerful.  I mean if you take a Knight with only level 60 spells, he's not exactly that powerful either.<br />
<br />
I just hope there are no such tomes in Legacy of Ykesha since that's the only expansion I didn't buy.  Doesn't seem like it'd make sense for 60+ tomes in an expansion geared toward the low level crowds, but you never know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HELL YES!  I am so damn excited.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and the openings that appear for you will more often than not only appear for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At a guess ... think parchments/runes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Which then completely screws the casual/family-guilded players again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oogmol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally, I see the tomes dropping from various levels of mobs, the lower tier skills should be fairly common drops, imho, up to the &quot;uber&quot; skills which should be rarer and harder to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can't imagine these tomes to be any different from Runes/Parchments.  While the casual player won't have everything right away eventually the tomes will trickle down.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hope not.  But, with that concern, which is a concern of mine as well since I am a casual gamer, we have come up with a question to ask during the live chat.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
These tomes/tactic manuals etc...  Will casual gamers have a chance at getting those or at least some that are comparative to their level of play?  Or are they going to be in PoTime just to get something silly?  <br />
<br />
P.S.  Gotta remember if they make these &quot;items&quot;  they might just fuck up itemization as far as &quot;where&quot; these things are.  I am not going to think negative but you neverk now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Oh, we may have a chance to get them, as long as they (or some end result) aren't No Drop, which I strongly suspect they will be. Even if they aren't No Drop, the casual gamer is going to have to save up tens of thousands of plat just to get their 'balance' in the bazaar. Somehow that doesn't seem very balanced to me.<br />
<br />
You don't have to think negatively, Gunrack. I'll do it enough for the both of us. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oogmol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Phantron <br />

<br />
If they do that, then once again, its all about the &quot;uber&quot; warriors getting anything, and joe schmoe warrior getting reamed without vaseline once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At least it is a start.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This seems like...a fighting video game?  And as Wubao points out are all of the melee on raid going to be jockying for the same &quot;openings&quot;?  Sounds like what most melee do now (that is stubmle over each other for position).<br />
<br />
It may work I don't see it conceptually.  I guess I will have to see it work first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Considering 'balance is not bought through expansions' ( loose quote ), these skills would have to 'drop' from old school zones... Looks like us lvl 53+ are screwed if they drop off of Naggy and Vox.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Ok, that was a cheap joke, but you get the idea. My concern is the duration of 'Endurance' when used in disciplines. Will we have enough for the basic 3 minute /disc Defensive? Right now a naked 55 halfling warrior can disc defensive for 3 minutes, I sure hope they give us enough base to remain the same otherwise this may be more of a nerf than a fix.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with spending your 'Endurance' wisely, as long as we have enough base endurance to atleast do our old routine normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wow, even more of a way to beta test EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">But then again i dont know how this will help make warriors more needed as the MT for any situation, it just seems like it will make warriors harder to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is definitely a step in the right direction...<br />
<br />
Let's hope the implementation of it is well thought out...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am very excited</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This helps warriors how exactly? <br />
<br />
Guys don't get caught up in the glitz and flashing lights. We were screaming we are deficient in agro generation and taunt, that our mitigation table should be the best of any class and dual wield dps needs a boost etc etc. If none of the improvements to follow actually implement any or even only 1 out of all these things we STILL LOSE and you can forget about warrior revamp for the next millenium because hey we just got &quot;cool new flashy stuff!&quot; bleh.<br />
<br />
I'll be waiting to see what else comes forth from all this. I don't give a rats ass about &quot;strike openings&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit.

<br />
I'm very interested in getting more detail on these things.  I think it has potential.  Frequency of openings had better be higher than chance to proc =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">This helps warriors how exactly? <br />

Might not adress EVERYTHING.  But like some have said its &quot;a&quot; step in the right direction I think.  If its implemented correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Its a spell system! And therefor should be about as twinkable (in the adjust sence) as the regular spell system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Valorie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">We should get them to clarify:<br />
<br />
1): What form will the endurance items be, ie quest, uber mob drop, aa points?<br />
<br />
2): Make sure that the endurance pool is coming from melee based stats (im thinking sta, str maybe) and not off int or wis stats P<br />
<br />
3): Will common items with hp mana class all race all have the conversion from mana -&gt; endurance?<br />
<br />
4): Thats one change any other changes in terms of agro? <br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I hate being negative, really I do, but while this sounds like it might be fun, and a nice toy, it does not sound like it is going to do much to get us groups.<br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the &quot;opening icon&quot; and the word &quot;Parry&quot; next to it (this information also appears in the chat window).  <br />
<br />
This sounds like the openings will come randomly, so will be akin to hoping for a proc, and will still leave us at the mercy of the RNG.<br />
<br />
Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool  <br />
<br />
Joy, itemization is going to be a mess, as we now have something else to worry about on our gear(and will any of our gear be retrofitted to have some 'endurance'?).<br />
<br />
It sounds to me as if knights will still have agro on demand, and warriors will still have random agro.  Hence, knights are still going to dominate the exp game, while warriors dominate at being lfg.<br />
<br />
I am cranky tonight and should be asleep intead of typing this...maybe it will look better in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">even tho in the back of my mind it sounds like they are just giving us mana and spells, i actaully think is in &quot;flavor&quot; of a pure melee character. you go to any martial arts school and all over the walls will be diagrams of everything from how to hold your fist, how to stand, the proper way to force an oponent to the ground. i dont see why scrolls up until now have only contained arcane incantations and not diagrams and instructions on how to strike quicker, or hold a sword to parry better.<br />
<br />
i think we'll actaully be better off than spell casters if our disciplines and special attacks dont require cast time and cant be resisted or fizzle. <br />
<br />
as of now, i think it's hard to tell how our current problems will be relavent after the new systems is implamented until we actaully see it in action. i'm actually very interested in how this will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">&quot;Joy, itemization is going to be a mess, as we now have something else to worry about on our gear(and will any of our gear be retrofitted to have some 'endurance'?).&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
-Will there be Endurance added to existing items? (Most likely, but who knows).<br />
<br />
-Will it create even more itemization imbalance (allowing hybrids to reap the rewards of high ENDURANCE items because they already share the same armors with melees)?<br />
<br />
-Will there be an endurance regen worn effect, akin to Flowing Thought? <br />
<br />
-If so, will this be capped like FT?<br />
<br />
-Also, if so, will this effect, whatever it is, be retro-fitted to items as well?<br />
<br />
-Will there be melee FOCUS effects, now that we are going to have a melee MANA bar?<br />
<br />
-Will these also be retrofitted to items already in existence?<br />
<br />
You see, this is a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Enjoy those worms SOE, that can you just opened is FRESH!<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">These tomes/manuals are really the only thing about this so far that has me concerned.  When I think of this my thoughts only go back to what has happened with the planar armor molds/patterns and runes/parchments.  Classes that have no need of these tomes/manuals rolling on them and winning them just because they feel they are entitled to the loot.  So my question is:<br />
<br />
What steps will be taken to assure that these items will go to the classes that actually need them, rather than to johnny jackass druid who I then have to pay ridiculous amounts of plat to in the bazaar to acquire it?  <br />
<br />
I mean, seriously, these steps are being undertaken to benefit the melee classes, there is no reason that anyone should benefit whatsoever, even in a monetary fashion,  from these new skills being implemented, besides melee.  If this is indeed a fix for something that was broken there should be no reason for me to have to pay for it.  Heh, maybe i'm overreacting, a bit tired at the moment, but I think the gist of my idea is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Some thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) I don't see anything here that will allow the generation of &quot;snap&quot; aggro.  If we don't have the ability to snap a mob into place (and frankly, I'm ok with that) then we DO need a vastly improved ability to mitigate the dmg caused to the GROUP as a result.  I'd love to see knights maintain their snap aggro advantage while we are more able to throw ourselves between the mob and that poor enchanter... and over time develop solid aggro.<br />
<br />
2) I have no problem with some or many of the tomes needed to learns skills being both no drop and off of high end mobs.  While warriors need tweaking at all levels, the problem grows more and more extreme at the upper ends of the game.  In other words... the really high end warriors need more help then the casual warriors do (/em braces for the flames).  <br />
<br />
3) This system does sound a bit twitchy.  I wonder how long it will take someone to program a macro so that your average warrior can go right back to afk fighting.  It also seems likely that this will make it more difficult to chat while fighting which may be realistic, but will also remove a large component of the fun.<br />
<br />
4) mana bar = no thx.  If I wanted to play a caster I'd invest in some prozac so I can sit on my ass and med up.  <br />
<br />
5) anyway you look at it this appears to be an across the board increase in player power.  Will content be adjusted to compensate?  If so, will content be adjusted up so far that knights are kunarkified?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">&quot;I have no problem with some or many of the tomes needed to learns skills being both no drop and off of high end mobs.

<br />
To keep it fair, many of these &quot;skills&quot; or &quot;abilities&quot; up to LEVEL 60 should be PURCHASABLE from the library in PoK.<br />
<br />
To keep it fair, many of these &quot;skills&quot; or &quot;abilities&quot; up to LEVEL 60 should be quested and dropped about as normally as their spell counterparts (funeral pyre comes to mind, with how it's now researchable, compared to previously just being a rare drop spell).<br />
<br />
I don't mind making melees jump through SIMILAR hoops as casters for whatever the heck this crap is.<br />
<br />
BUT ... melees should not have to jump through MORE hoops than casters.<br />
<br />
Which brings up the whole issue of Endurance REGEN being close to MANA regen ... and ENDURANCE on items being close to mana on items to create similar sized pools ...<br />
<br />
And for these melee spells to be about as &quot;common&quot; as their spell counterparts.<br />
<br />
It's a strict set of itemization issues here.<br />
<br />
And I fear that some of the devs aren't considering that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Keep in mind they've been saying for a long while now it is easier to twink spells/mana etc than the melee ... so by making this change, if they need to fix it, they have one less excuse for not doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Thorwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">This looks VERY intruiging both for my rogue and my warrior.  I am so stoked!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Obviously none of these will let you do a dragon punch super fireball combo on a mob that's incoming for permanent aggro lock.  They're supposed to be ways to make you more useful not duplicate the broken mess that is Knight aggro.  <br />
<br />
One change that can trivially fix any aggro issues in XP groups is that if a mob is killed by a combo it gives significantly more XP.  People will put up with you doing your useless 15 hit combo gimmicks and whatever lack of aggro you have to get more XP.  <br />

If you are still hoping they make you into Knight #2 then you're looking at the wrong place.  If SoE isn't going to nerf Knight freebie aggro they sure aren't going to give it out to more classes to break the game further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I hope they don't make any of these manuals and tomes drop in PoP unless they are the result of a etherial/spectral parchment or rune turn in.  I think that is the only fair way to do it.   I really hope someone asks if this will be the case.<br />
<br />
My concern is (if the tomes are no drop) that time guilded warriors will end up having abilities proportional to the equipment they have and the average warrior who doesn't belong to some uber guild is gonna be dead last on the list to group because he isn't flagged for poearthb and doesn't have access to uber tome_of_flaming_deathtouch _skill_005 that drops there.  If some no drop tome is completely beyond their ability to get, the average casual warriors are going to be even more at a disadvantage than they are now and the gap will just get so wide that anyone not in Time guilds will be unable to get groups at all.   People already look at what guild you are in to decide if they want you to group because they know a warrior in a time guild can most probably tank circles around a warrior who isn't.  They may not ask how many AA you have but they definitely look at level and guild to choose who to ask, at least for pick up groups.<br />
<br />
Someone said that the higher level warriors need these skills even more than casual warriors.  I just think this is completely backwards because the average warrior doesn't have access to high agro, high DPS weapons like SEWS or BoWs and have 7k unbuffed with 1800 attack/1600 AC.  The warriors with those things do just fine holding agro and doing damage and tanking in experience groups when compared to a warrior with 4.5k unbuffed and a CHoS/SotB combo and 1100 attack/1200 AC or less.   I think the average warriors need way more help than the time equiped ones.  I am sort of in the middle of these two extremes and I have grouped with both levels of warriors before and the difference is huge between low and high end.  It will do no good to make it even worse.<br />
<br />
Making tomes dropable is a similar problem, that will just be like some of the harder to get ornate pieces that cost 90k for an armor upgrade and just encourages people to spend huge amounts of money buying plat on player auctions.  I hope these tomes are dropable and VERY common otherwise its gonna be rediculously expensive to get them.  I hope someone asks about this as well.<br />
<br />
Also, I hope someone asks about what kind of difference in abilities will exist between hybrids and pure melee.  If its going to be some pidley 2 percent difference we can use every 20 miutes then its a complete waste of time and pure melees will be far worse off then than we are now.  Boosting pure melee and hybrid abilities by the same amount will solve nothing and if they do this we all might as well just quit now and wait for WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">There were rumors a few months ago about adding some form of a taunt bar where taunt took power from the bar but you could spam it as much as you wanted until your bar was depleted / regenned, and it would actually accrue hate. I'd imagine theyre going to add some form of that and tie it to the endurance bar as well.<br />
<br />
With an endurance bar the possibilities are pretty limitless, I'll admit I'm very pessimistic when it comes to Verant but on the same note I'm very excited about all of this, all we can do now is wait and see what happens really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Afraid I'm slightly negative too. I'm not convinced that any super cool special abilities will be more than a sop to the ego for no longer being a tank. The opportunities to execute will be random, the actual skill success is described thus : He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike<br />
<br />
More RNG crap except now you get to 'hit the correct button in the limited window of opportunity'.  <br />
<br />
Woo woo. <br />
<br />
Well, whatever those abilities are they'll NEED to be a darn sight better than a random success stun possible only when the program chooses (as described in the 'exciting' description). We need ACTIVE tanking aids where the warrior makes the decisions, not pseudo-twitch shit to give us pretty numbers to fondle when the RNG decides we can. A spell cast always fires (barring fizzles) and you can cast it whenever you want - why is that such a no-no for melee?  Unless the special melee skills are VERY noticeably significant I'd expect interest to tail off again after the initial curiosity, knights have plenty of their own special abilities (spells) to go along with their aggro superiority and they get to use 'em on demand not pray for a chance to aid the group.<br />
<br />
The boring old discipline changes might be more significant in the long run. :p<br />
<br />
Welp. Perhaps I'm overly pessimistic and their's more complexity and control to this system than the initial overview suggests. I can but hope that's the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I do totally agree with Valeris. While this sounds cool, and is something I wanted in the field of &quot;|&lt;3\/\/L&quot; tricks to do, this is by no means fixing our aggro issues. In fact this just looks like a bone SoE if giving to us to calm us down. Soon, I will be able to wait for a POSSIBLE &quot;exceptional parry&quot; then hit a button for a POSSIBLE successful special strike... W00T !!! So, while LFG, I can keep dreaming on what ubah new combat moves I could execute... if only I had a group.<br />
<br />
I want once and for all a f00king way of taunting mobs effeclively, ON DEMAND, with a reasonable chance of success. I dont want to be as good as knights at it, but it would be only fair to be as good at aggro control as knights are at tanking. So, please SoE, give us either a decent aggro control, either nerf the knights (hate to say this but... it is a possible way to fix the problem).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">While this sounds interesting, it still doesnt resolve a couple issues that have arisen lately, such as other classes tanking end of expansion mobs. Until more information is released about the new system I can't really comment, other then to say it does sound very interesting, and I just hope there's some way to automate certain skills on openings because on large raids, you can run into alot of lag and if the window is small enough you might miss openings, plus you might be typing and miss it as well.<br />
<br />
Just one other thing about someone saying big tanks with weapons like BoW etc not needing a boost as much as midgame warriors really should experience what we go through before commenting on it, sure you see them doing good in exp groups, but thats with people who arent at the end game. You would be surprised how often you can lose aggro with a augmented BoW, or a Dark Blade/EoE combo when your grouping with 300-400aa wizards, Rogues with Jagards etc, it becomes a bigger issue on raids when you don't have snap aggro and healers, enchanters and shamans get killed on engage. We don't have many problems of course once aggro's establised, but its always the first 30 seconds where a paladin/sk will have the advantage over us unless theres some new ability inc, we'll see.</div></div><hr />

yea, but I see nothing particularly wrong with the ladder..<br />
<br />
As for these changes, I'm concerned with one thing; macros. I've got 10, all of which I'm using at the moment. Gonna be a fucking pain if this creates about 10 additional macros, which means I need to Shift-1, taunt/disarm, shift-2/skll, shift-1, shift-2, shift-1 assist, use inc message, shift-2:skill. etc. Does sound like a fucking fighting game.</div></div><hr />

This is the imediate good part. I bet every warrior will still be able to play as always if he want, and use BETTER disciplines, not only defensive and evasive.<br />

Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool<br />
They could use vengeance as a &quot;melee FT&quot;. <br />
And I bet monk Endurance bar will be based on agi, warrior one on strengh, rogue one on dexterity.<br />
<br />

In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC. <br />

 I, for one, never wanted anything handed to me on a &quot;silver platter&quot; and that is what would happen if changes had come as your saying.<br />
<br />
All our EQ lives we(everyone) have had to quest,exp,collect,kill mobs for anything, to me it makes things interesting and keeps me playing and advancing, yes warriors taunt is broke now, and sony isnt going to out right fix it the way some would like to see it fixed, but this is MORE what we asked for .. for sony to &quot;talk to us&quot;, &quot;initiate improvements&quot; not just &quot;fix&quot; things or &quot;nerf&quot; others.<br />
<br />
I see this as the step in the right direction, it will once again put skill and talent back into the classes that have become a mere /attack class...hitting a disc once in awhile. <br />
<br />
I am looking forward to this, and I feel its is more than what we have been asking for...<br />

Certainly. The way that work will give us ADITIONAL things to do. more stun or more attack or more debuff = aggro.<br />

Yes. People will say &quot;monk rocks, they can do this and this.&quot; or &quot;take the warrior, now he can do this and this&quot;.<br />

They gave us 4 brief summary items in their snippet of text blurb:<br />
<br />
1 - Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting <br />
2 - Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes <br />
3 - Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat <br />
4 - Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay<br />
<br />
They then went on to focus in on the &quot;openings&quot; addition.  Item 4!  &quot;without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay&quot;.  The opening portion of this is just a fun twinkie they are giving us to address the EXTREME BOREDOM OF MELEE COMBAT IN EQ!  They are going to speak to us for an HOUR on the changes on the 24th.  STOP JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS!<br />
<br />

<br />
- Disciplines will be transferred to this new system <br />
- Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer <br />

- Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">/agree Darkoan. In fact I really think those changes could be good.<br />
<br />
What did you expect ? <br />
more hp and ac ? so any naked warrior could go and level without gear and tank every velious mob with crafted armor, and the next expansion yard trash in level 50-55 zones hit for 700, requiring a warrior ?<br />
a no-fail taunt ? so every 6 seconds you tell your raid &quot;nuke now !&quot; and you taunt after, with no chance of failling ?<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS is the way to go. Alternate skills ADDED to the warrior arsenal. Disciplines unhooked and reworked. Maybe in a month you will use the Precise discipline, or another one you never used for 3 years !<br />
<br />
If you dont like those, you could play just like those warriors that dont like /shield. Autoattack, mash kick and disarm, mash taunt when the mob is not on you, hit defensive or evasive if the mob is really big, nothing more. <br />
If I can do more, as long as it is tanking friendly, correctly implemented and give me specificity the other classes do not have, I take it.<br />
<br />
Of course I dont want to meditate or to seek +END items... but It look like the endurance bar will replace the old useless stamina bar nobody cares. So we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Chagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I'm kind of disappointed that so many are excited about these new changes.<br />
<br />
We have outlined the issues we are having over and over again and they have responded with a new gimmick which will require massive balancing and rebalancing.  I fail to see how making the current game (which they can't manage to balance) more complex will get us anywhere.<br />
<br />
To reiterate some of the points made by others:<br />
<br />
&gt; We will still be slaves to the random number generator...IF this happens and IF we see it happen and hit the proper button in time and IF &quot;luck smiles upon&quot; us.  It seems to me that Im already waiting for luck to smile upon me to hold aggro, we all know its not fun.<br />
<br />
&gt; We will still have an insignificant Hitpoint, AC and Mitigation advantage over knights.  Even if they add temporary &quot;twitch&quot; bonuses to HPS, AC and Mit they are still temporary and require items. Ugh, more items.<br />
<br />
&gt; I don't know about you, but I was sort of hoping we were done being screwed by the itemizer...These scrolls basically further increases our already ridiculous reliance on equipment, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if most of this crap was ALL MELEE anyway.  Last time I checked we didn't ask for more hoops to jump through to get what we need to do our job, we asked for our class to be balanced versus other classes.  Spending more time camping or praying for rare raid drops is a tactic to keep us around longer while we fix ourselves.<br />
<br />
&gt; And parish to thought that we would get our class fixed without having to quest!  Can you imagine being told by your power company that you must quest when your power goes out, or that in order to get your car fixed you had to travel to Hoboken with 30 of your closest friends to find that rare NPC that MAY have the piece you needed?<br />
<br />
Bah, things are broken, and they've responded with yet another set time traps to keep us around longer, WHILE they implement, and WHILE they itemize, and WHILE they balance, and rebalance, and rebalance and rebalance ad infinitum...<br />
<br />
Please don't get me wrong, I like this game (though I don't play it much anymore).  There is so much potential for fixes within the current frame of the game that I have a hard time stomaching more class content.  It sure feels like they really dont want to fix the game as much as they want to keep their hooks in us.<br />

<br />
Id like absor or alan tell us if they approve that Quarm got tanked by someone else than a warrior, as far as i know, they are happy that we are 1 in 3 tanks now, in which case the new combat system has to provide enough utility to be equivalent to what knights get with their spells, and im sorry to say, but a few openning per fight seem kinda low compare to chain casting.<br />
<br />
Monk will be more fun to play while in combat, but how does the combat system help them regain an edge to pulling? Are they suppose to have an edge for pulling or they are always 1 in 3 class to do it on raid and xp group too...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Mulberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">This change addresses the lack of utility warriors have, by giving us special moves and unlinking our discipline times, which i think is a good step.<br />

However, it doesn't address AT ALL the mitigation issues vs. other knights and the horrible itemization which brings Knights to the same HP levels as a warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm all for the idea of some extra utility, but  as a purest class, I'm a tank, dammit. I want to do it the best, and this doesn't address it...it just distracts from that core issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Hulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I believe there is a general consesus that there are 3 issues that warriors wanted addressed. In order of importance they are:<br />
<br />
1. ranged/snap agro<br />
2. ac/hp/mitigation nullification<br />
3. group utility<br />
<br />
If issues 1. and 2. were addressed then our group utility would be a non-issue because we would be able to hold agro while needing fewer heals than our hybrid bretheren. This would balance the utility knights bring to groups derived from thier spellbooks.<br />
<br />
It appears to me that issue 3. is being addressed while the fundamental problems 1. and 2. are not. Disciplines &quot;probably&quot; will be unlinked, knights will have &quot;limited&quot; endurance pools (limited to what, 95% of melee?). Warriors will still have to rely on the RNG in order to add agro, this helps us how? How is the nullification of ac/hp/mitigation advantage warriors had addressed? Instead of makeing warriors more like warriors, they have decided to make warriors more like knights. The hybridization of warriors has begun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I'll say what I said on my guild boards.  This does sound cool.  I have a couple of concerns though.  First, how often will these opportunities present themselves?  Once a fight?  Okay, that really won't help.  Second, how often will these special abilities (hate generation, stun etc.), connect? If its like 20%, then again, it really won't help us.  Relying on randomness and the damn RNG for us to hold taunt is about the same as how useless the taunt button is today.  I'll say it again, Warriors should have the class given ability to hold aggro without having to rely on the RNG, or ESPECIALLY on weapon procs.  Its just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Phatron is right.  All of this addresses one failing aspect of melee (it sucks ass).  Another glaring problem with melee is mitigation broken and nearly meaningless.<br />
<br />
These are two seperate problems requiring two seperate fixes in all likelyhood.<br />
<br />
What this does is add some skill to Warriors.  Remember how I harp that Paladins are sought after more than Warriors because Paladins plainly do more?  This will help out a little.  By adding extra things a Warrior can do to a monster, agro will natrually follow.  It also addresses some stackability problems.  Now having a Warrior in a group that has already picked up a tank won't be such strange baggage.  This Warrior can now look for different attacks to make instead of waiting for the first tank to die.<br />
<br />
I'm all for SOE to give this a whirl.  My big concern is that they might break everything before they get it right.  Would a phase in approach be better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">This is the line that caught my attention:<br />
<br />
One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC. <br />
<br />
I am intrigued. Although this is not a fail safe method of aggro it is another useful tool and should give some extra DPS. I do not the the manuels or tomes will be that bad. Even as a warrior I can loot parchments as well as the next guy. Hopefully if it is not class based they will have it set up like a spell where it is turned in to a certain class mob and dropable afterwards. <br />
<br />
Excited ... hope it's not a let down but I look forward to trying it out.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how I feel about these changes, but I appreciate the work of all positive posters on this forum.  You are the people who forced developers to look at the issues at hand.  For that, I thank you.<br />
<br />
These changes seem to suggest that we will be getting a few new benefits, which suggests that things won't be getting any worse for us...and that is all I ask.  If it does not indeed fix the core shortcomings of the melee classes, perhaps it is a step towards further examining how to implement the more difficult class-balancing issues.<br />
<br />
I look forward to this, not because I think it will solve all warrior problems, but because warriors are the biggest and baddest in Norrath -- not necessarily because we are the most uber, but because we face adversity every time we get up in the morning and never ( ;) ) complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will hold my criticsm until after the Monday chat.  <br />
<br />
They have given us an appetizer, that is all we have at this point, and it has done its job.<br />
<br />
My fear is that the live chat is going to be full of idiots screaming and yelling with too much attention focused on the minute details and nit-picking the devs to death.  I want to hear what the over-all plan is, some detail and game mechanics behind the plan is a good thing, but not focus on it.<br />

<br />
I really hope they havn't announced it all yet but it seems to me as is they've missed the point completely. <br />

Im kind of surprised so many people seem to be falling for what is effectively a gimmick. Yes im glad the changes are happening, yes they will no doubt make combat more interesting but it seems to me as if these changes will benefit Rogues and Monks more than Warriors who already have stuff to do other than press auto attack and follow the mob about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will it address every problem? No..<br />
<br />
Is it a great start? Yes..<br />
<br />
Why do i say that? because now we will have Tools. Tools to work with, tools that SoE can tweak and fix to get better. What is our biggest complaint about Paladins? Not the Hp's/AC its their aggro generation. And why is it so much better? TOOLS.. they have many more tools to work with, we have very few.. Sony is opening up the damn toolbox.. We need to use it to build better. <br />
<br />
What was the line...<br />
<br />
 give a man a fish and he eats for a day.. teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime...<br />
<br />
They are giving us tools..  We need to discuss and work to make them the best..not bitch and moan, that our simple lives are being changed.<br />
<br />
SoE has always said'spells' are so much easier to fix than anything else.. well now we will be a lot better to fix.<br />
<br />
As to openings, that is just one aspect of the new combat system, I am sure there will be more... <br />

Our loud protests has forced their hand to a degree..now we need to be constructive with what comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">No amount of improvement on warrior will take away from the fact that other classes can tank the end bosses. <br />
<br />
<br />
That was on my mind as well. But if they do it right. It could.<br />
<br />
What would you rather have? A pally that can snap aggro but take full damage. With 0 new abilities (cause thats what they getting)<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
A warrior that can hit furious at the beginning of a round and has enough endurance to keep Defensive up for 10 min and can exceptional reposit that opens up every melee to perform specials for the next 3 combat rounds. That can also throw up fortitude during the fight if a cleric falls asleep.<br />
<br />
That would solve our mt issue. Yes you could use a knight but it would be a hell of a lot safer to use a warrior.<br />
<br />
What if you did not need defensive? Hey maybe furious could last 45 sec. <br />
<br />
Tell me that would not rock? Aggro lock? You got it.. Need to heal for the first 30 sec? Nope maybe aoe damage but not melee. Need to nuke it hard? Nope. Got aggro for miles when its done? Yep.<br />
<br />
<br />
It could rock if done right. It could be so overpowering that they nerf it after its released.<br />
<br />
But in the end. We get some group utilities. Makes us a better tank in the long run.<br />
<br />
Wont allow us to solo or anything but gives us a nudge in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I so want to be at this meeting.</div></div><hr />

the tidbit on eqlive is only a preview, much of the new system is still being tweaked.

You are exagerating a tad their Ian.  I am not suggesting that these changes will suck(in fact some parts of it look interesting), and I do love the fact that we are getting attention finally.  I do have questions of whether this will solve warrior balance problems(warriors look to still be slaves to RNG, while knights will as best we know retain snap agro at range), questions about how lag will affect this, and questions about just how much we will actually gain from all this.  Even with all those questions, I am still very excited about some of the potential, and am looking forward to hearing more.  I am just not going to blindly jump for joy and say 'Yay, we are fixed'.</div></div><hr />

Well it looks like they want it to be in group and raid enviroments. I believe with these melee changes has some great potential. Wich will make Wars more wanted in a group setting.<br />
<br />
All of you that are whinning about snap agro, try reading better<br />
<br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat. <br />
<br />
I believe that since not all the combat skills will not require openings that those will tend to be things like snap agro attacks. I believe there is a lot of potential here lets hope they dont screw it up.</div></div><hr />

Hey Absor, Release a sneak peak of what we have planned so you can go read all the mssg boards and not get totally blindsided before our chat on the 24th.<br />
<br />
And that my friends is why we see this little preview!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I'm happy because they seem to have spotted flaws in similar mechanics in other games.<br />
<br />
EQOA warriors had &quot;real spells&quot;, and their power pool was the same as the casters mana pool.  They even had targetted buffs, IIRC.<br />
<br />
DaoC style system had swing-based openings.  You had to activate your style before the next swing.  Styles also boosted damage by 100% or more, which meant that non-styled combat was gimp.  Combat typically dissolved to pounding your &quot;any time&quot; style key.  They hacked on the ability to select 1 other style to activate conditionally, but there wasn't any real tactics: you didn't have time to think tactically.<br />
<br />
By having windows of time after an event to use a special, you will have time to think tactically.  If they are as long as 6 seconds, that is enough time to think &quot;taunt stun or reduce the damage I'm taking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lastly, it fixes the warrior/hybrid problem, that a hybrid with good enough gear is better in every single way to a warrior, including defensive.  If a hybrid has 50% more hps than a warrior, and weapons that are twice as good, there is basically nothing important that the warrior can do that the hybrid cannot do.<br />
<br />
However, a naked hybrid can do things that the best geared warrior cannot.<br />
<br />
There was an important asymmetry here, and I think it is the core of the real warrior/hybrid balance problem.<br />
<br />
The combat style system changes this.  Naked warriors will have useful and intrinsic abilities that a hybrid cannot duplicate (I hope).<br />
<br />
And lastly, it opens up some additional symmetry between casters and non-casters.  Now, non-casters will have the same &quot;every expansion bring on new abilities&quot; that casters have had for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">This still wont fix the problem of knights now being the prefered tanks for most situations...unless during a fight, you can somehow temporarily boost your hpts/ac for the duration of the fight, by hitting certain blows (yes i know it doesnt make sense, but neither does disarming a tree snake)</div></div><hr />

I have NO problem with Hybrids being able to tank all the PoP gods.  I do however have issue where the is no inherant benefit to having a Warrior tank them.  All the fast moving guild on my server use Pallies exclusivly to tank gods.  The 'tradidional' guilds on my server preferentialy geared there warriors so there Pallies cant tank as well so they are now having to switch there gearing strategy to gear up there Hybrids as MAs.<br />
<br />
Will these changes mean there is a inherant advantage to using a Warrior to tank?  Will some openings only be provided to the rest of the raid when the Warrior is actually tanking?  Can a token Warrior or two be used just as debuffers (attack from the back with the rest of the pack) with the sole purpose of providing openings?  Too many questions left open to me.  <br />
<br />
I do not see the trend of using Pallies as MAs in ALL situations changing.  Why should it?  If you Preferentailly gear your Pallies as MAs (much lie many guild gear there Warrior MAs) they can and do tank better than current Warriors in ALL situations, not just on older content.  <br />
<br />
This could end up making warriors the Enchanters of old, ie your just hear to proc xxx_opening for the rest of the raid.  Much like Enchanters in Velious content (just there to tash).<br />
<br />
It could also be the begining of something quite useful.<br />
<br />
Only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>djjinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">This sounds very interesting, but I want to know is why hybrids are getting access to these abilities at the start?  Do Beastlords really need these combat options? Is ranger dps so low that it needs boosting like this?  Are bards that underpowered?   And lets not forget knights.  <br />
<br />
Giving hybrids these ablities gives them 2 spellbooks to pull from with combinations that might prove very unbalancing.  <br />
<br />
I'm not against hybrids ever getting these abilities, but I don't think they should start off with them, it would be too hard to take it back.  Unless hybrid abilities &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; melee abilities, hybrids will absolutely rule since they can just switch between the two.<br />
<br />
If you thought pally's could chain stun before, you haven't seen anything yet.  Between the two spellbooks, with their own regeneration, it might be able for a single paladin to stun a mob continuously on a regular basis.  Remember it's, the speed of regeneration more than the size of the pool that is important in xp groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>solinear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">My opinion on what needs to be done is pretty simple.<br />
<br />
A) Make warrior damage mitigation ALWAYS work as if the warrior is /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
B) Fix taunt.  This is simple.  If taunt works, then they move to the top (no matter where they are), if they are already at the top of the aggro list, OR if they fail with their taunt, then they add 1 point of aggro for every level of the warrior.  Every time you mash taunt, you're guaranteed to get 65 points of aggro at level 65, if you're not at the top, then it puts you to the top +5 or whatever.  Also, increase the chance of a success (like make it skill/250 with a cap of 95% chance of success).<br />
<br />
C) Increase warrior damage the way they did with Rangers.  It's really easy to do, make Weapons Mastery AAs just like they did with Rangers for Archery Mastery.  Do 3 levels for each type of melee weapon (1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs, piercing).<br />
<br />
D) Fix all disciplines, almost all of them are worthless.  Mighty strike?  It's about as worthless as it can get.  Separate all of the discipline timers and make all of them LESS than the timer on Defensive.   There shouldn't be a timer of more than 15 minutes on any of them, more like 5 to 10 minutes on most of them.  Also, allow warriors to stick their disciplines in the spell gem slots so that you're not using up your hotkey slots.<br />
<br />
Wow, you just fixed Warriors, or at least are 75% of the way there.  The only thing that I can think of is to make a discipline that will basically allow the warrior to have snap aggro that is usable once every 5 minutes, or better yet, don't make it a discipline, just give them a button like Lifetap or LoH and have it repop every 5 mninutes.  All of a sudden, the warrior is almost completely fixed at that point.  No more of this &quot;give him 3 minutes to get solid aggro&quot; crap that we always see, or making the Wizard stand there hoping that the warrior can taunt the mob off him.<br />
<br />
This crap that they just posted will do nearly nothing for warriors except send them on the path to 'click and twitch' gaming.  I mean it's bad enough having to chase the mobs around right now.  Most of what they just posted just looks like more 'eye candy' crap and only goes about 25% of the way toward fixing Warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets wait and see wtf it is before we condemn or laud it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I'm going to hold off my judgement, hopefully this is only a sneak peak and not all they're going to do.  However, a couple things piqued my interest.<br />
<br />
 - Do you have to be tanking (or even in front of the mob) to cause the opening?  If not, then the chance is there for something warriors have (I think) wanted...stacking.  Knights stack with each other (much better than warriors anyways), more paladins means more stuns/heals, and more shadowknights means more and more damage (and you don't want to know how near-unbalancing multiple SKs with Zevfeer's Bite (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3408&amp;source=Live) is to a caster group).  If you don't need to be tanking to cause the openings, then more melee classes means more openings...which means more chances to use the abilities.  It's possible...you may now have something to do on raids besides be &quot;#3+ in tank rotation&quot;.<br />
<br />
 - Casters could possibly be getting spells which can increase endurance...or possibly have endurance regen added to spells (Acumen anyone?).  If these abilities end up being nice, and endurance regen is added to say, the druid AA Spirit of the Wood...it'd add a great use for those classes in melee groups.<br />
<br />
 - Old disciplines.  It interests me greatly as to how the old disciplines are going to work with this system...notably defensive/evasive/aggressive/precision.  Perhaps the duration on these will be dependant not on a timer, but how much Endurance you have.  A Warrior could perhaps switch to defensive and stay that way for as long as he still has the Endurance to use, and each tick a certain amount of Endurance is used up.  Or they might make it use up a certain amount right from the start, with the timer intact.  I'd love them to put Furious or Fortitude on a decent re-use, but only allow it during Berserk perhaps...hope this ends up decent.<br />
<br />
 - New Abilities.  The major problem with balancing casters and melee is casters are very very easy, they just add/alter spells in a database.  Melee abilities required them to code new abilities.  It's sounding like they're implementing a new system which allows new melee abilities to be added without brand new code each time, similar to the spell system.  Perhaps melee won't be getting nothing each expansion...<br />
<br />
And on the &quot;tome&quot; issue...I remember one of the larger complaints about the parchment/rune setup was that anyone could turn it in to any caster quest NPC for a spell, and they didn't like how melees would want to roll (I agreed with the melee tho, casters were getting upgrades and melee weren't...if nothing else the melee could perhaps get a nice spell to sell...).  I'm thinking they'll be spread out, perhaps some will be dropped randomly, some will be result of a quest, some will be dropped and require turn-in somewhere for other tomes, some perhaps might come from those adventure merchants...just like spells, but now melee will be getting something besides just equipment.  It's possible...<br />
<br />
Hope this isn't all tho, since this wouldn't do much.</div></div><hr />

Before you start /flaming stuff bleh bleh, take time to re-read.<br />
<br />
- Hybrids are getting these abilities also. No they are not.<br />
--&quot;Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines &quot; <br />
Meaning, since all disciplines are going to now use Endurance Pool, hybrids are getting a pool so they can continue to use thier current /disc.  They are not getting another spell book or anything.<br />
<br />
-So I have to wait for a &quot;opening&quot; to get agro and I still don't have SNAP agro. You can't tell yet.  Not all abilities need openings.<br />
--&quot;It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings.<br />

You depress GROUP DPS and the rogues/rangers etc get a damage boost [perhaps you had five seconds to depress it, i easily hit my SLAM button in less than 5 secs when it pops up ;p ]<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is about as complex and all-involving as depressing the KICK/SLAM key.<br />
<br />
Now I may be totally wrong, everything here is hypothetical.  But this isn't all there seems to be.<br />

It seems to me that if you have enough ENDURANCE you might be able to furious and then defensive back to back.<br />
<br />
The point is, there are all sorts of possibilities but let's wait and find out instead of griping and whining and complaining (at least until we know).  There are a lot of other classes and people interested in us right now and acting ungrateful before we even know what we are getting is low class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't need a variable combat system with anemic results to relieve bordem througout the middle of the battle as much as I want taunt to work at the beginning of the fight.  And it looks like I'm waiting for % chance for an &quot;opening to occur&quot;.<br />

The game is made for the lowest common denominator and has accessability enhancements.

<br />
EQ is not handicap friendly in some reguards, most thinks in life are not. If you're too slow to hit a button to do special attack06, tough shit =(, the current melee system, as far as I know it, isn't going away. They are just adding to it. So those that cannot hit that button fast enough cause they only have 4 fingers total isn't going to have to quit EQ because he can't play anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can STILL play the game the same way you could/would before the targeting enhancement.<br />
<br />
So if a color blind person wasn't affected by the game PRIOR to the targeting enhancement, they won't be affected by it after.<br />

This is so much more then I expected, it's actually combining the few ideas I wanted to see into the game.<br />

Even IF the &quot;opening&quot; skills arent too usefull, or too hard to use due to lag or whatever....<br />
the DISCIPLINES are being changed as well...<br />
<br />
and they said we'de be getting CATEGORIES of skills... and QUESTS or close enough, to get NEW skills!!<br />
<br />
FUCK YES!!!<br />
This is my dream come true!! All my dreams...<br />
Endurance bar, linked to disciplines, as well as new skills lots... as well as means of getting new skills, AND the opening system, close to an idea posted by someone some time ago (forgot who).<br />

Well that describes how I feel about the snippets of information provided by SoE.<br />
<br />
There clearly is not enough detail for any of us to reach a conclusion on whether this will be good or bad.   The key for us warriors is to get good hard hitting questions lined up for the 24th so that we can make sure that our concerns are addressed whether it is the existing balance issues or concerns about the new toys being thrown our way.<br />
<br />
I wish SoE luck in pulling off such a major change.   They are going to need it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok.. one more time.<br />
<br />
warriors with snap aggro and defensive are overpowered.<br />
<br />
Argue all you want but its true.<br />
<br />
what this MIGHT do (as we know less than shit atm)<br />
<br />
1. warriors get some grouping advantage (higher dps, new abilities)<br />
2. Break off disc's to seperate timers. these will feed of endurance maybe making them last longer (pray for fellstrike that lasts 60 sec)<br />
3. Increased aggro control but not to the point of breaking the game even more than it is. (yes that means no snap aggro or rare as hell snap aggro that drops in pot)<br />
4. Allows us to become a better choice of MT over another class<br />
(this goes back to say the ability to hit furious and then right into defensive, maybe hit fortitiude while defensive if the healer screws up)<br />
<br />
and the biggest + atm seems to be<br />
<br />
They do this all without nerfing hybreds.<br />
<br />
yes they still could tank rallos zek. but they are no longer tied with us for #1 spot. they are 2nd (where they should be) and we are preferred as it would be safer to use a warrior.<br />
<br />
again... nobody knows what it will do.. they gave one example<br />
You cannot say this sucks or it rocks till we see it.<br />
<br />
untill then people should calm down and limit it to <br />
&quot;It would suck if they only do __________&quot;<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
&quot;its going to rock if they make it like _______&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Im hoping for rock rather than suck. time will tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">&quot;The system as described will not help a warrior &quot;<br />
<br />
It might, nobody knows, really.  The 'generate more hate for a few rounds' skill might be something that pops up very frequently.  The fact is, nobody knows.  There might be a skill that works at range.  Again, nobody knows.  <br />
<br />
I've never been one to trust verant with a wait-and-see attitude.  Back when the cleric changes went in that were supposed to 'balance' us in groups (I'm a cleric, but play a couple of melee classes as well), I was really skeptical.  And when they went in, they were somewhat cool.  And now they're completely useless again, really.  Their history has been to throw people a bone to get them to stop complaining, then move on to doing something else.  <br />
<br />
With all that said, these changes have some promise if they are done right.  They'll just be different, and everyone's usually resistant to big changes.<br />
<br />
And, this:<br />
<br />
&quot; Think they benifited from the colored silluette in the target box to know what con a mob is&quot;<br />
<br />
They didn't really release this fact, but you can have a different graphic for each con of a mob, so, in effect, yes, color-blind people did/could benefit from the new targeting indicator by making different targeting rings for each con.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>icsdave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">I posted this in the Tavern but this seems to be the right spot so reposting.<br />
<br />
OK let me ask one simple question what in our past history with SOE would lead you believe that this is for the BEST, WHAT?<br />
<br />
I saw nothing to lead me to think this will help with our problem of RANDOM aggro. This is nothing more then give the tanks some new toys same as freaking shield. Sorta makes me think of monkey testing , you know monkey see, monkey do. Dumb tank see new icon on screen, DUMB tank get 2 sec to push buttom WOW am I one freaking happy tank or what.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way we will have a RANDOM chance to get this ICON and then IF (BIG BIG IF) were smart enough to select one of 3 keys we get another RANDOM chance for it to work and maybe stun the mob when all a knight has to do is push one button with NO RANDOM chance to get the SAME thing, my GOD are WE lucky or what? Lets all get down and KISS the ground that SOE devs walk on!<br />
<br />
Oh and we all know what lvl of mob and what zones to get this new thing(what ever its called) when casters get most of their spells from a vender. BL's get ALL but 2 spells till 61 from venders, hmm, yep I cant wait!<br />
<br />
Go read the knight boards, their already bitching about not getting this super new secret weapon.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong I love my Warrior but I want the problems fixed not new tricks, I want to be a ONE trick pony not a jack of all and master of NONE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Bonegnasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">my first take(given that we have very, very little info):<br />
<br />
'man, there are like 10,000 ways to screw this up'<br />
<br />
Now, I may have a low opinion of SOE fixing things ATM(mostly due to my current stint on PlanetSide) but here are the big landmines waiting for the Dev boys:<br />
<br />
Itemization : put this stuff in the wrong place, or give the wrong ones to the wrong classes, and it is the prenerf monk all over again...or the pre nerf manastone(where magic users who didnt have it were passed over for lower lvl ones that did, for those that wernt around then)<br />
<br />
this endurance bar : too little, and this whole thing is eye candy(mighty strike anyone?) too much, and it will trivialize their precious content, Leading to 'L33T ubermob4 is now immune to special moves' patch notes<br />
<br />
folding too much 'knight nerf' into this change <br />
<br />
failing to actually address the mitigation and aggro issues in this change : all this will give warriors(and monks and rogues) more versatillity, but if there arent real improvements to aggro managment and tanking abillity in the bells and whistles, it dont mean jack, as all the knights(and bards and rangers) have been trying to tell us all along...[</div></div><hr />

<br />
 -It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings.<br />
<br />
Also this system kinda works the same as spells.  Therefore they can have a set range as spells do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Ok in from what i see i am excited to see what SoE is bringing to the table.  It has lots of opportunity to be the best thing since sliced break, and the potential to break us even more than ever.<br />
<br />
My top concerns:<br />
<br />
1.  Where are the tomb's manuals etc going to drop?  Better yet i really think that for the 60+ crowd we should be able to simply buy the former skills or have them pop on our bar already.  I really don;t want to fight 100 green mobs to get a skill for a level 25 warrior.  I also don;t want to have to farm Kael, elementals etc for these drops.  Would be nice to add special ones at the top end, maybe from LDoN vendors etc; but don;t make me have to camp silly crap.  I'm also 65 not 20 so don;t make me have to jump through hoops again, their should be a way to impliment this so initially we get some valuable manuals (depending on our level) to start with.  When they add new ones in that's fine, but i certainly don;t want to be forced back into some content that I long ago abandoned.  Drop rates should be significantly high for the first few months this new system is realesed too, just simply so if we are able to buy manuals in the bazaar we are not gang raped by casters who quad kite where they drop.  <br />
<br />
2.  What skills will we get to start with?  I am hoping for some that address range aggro, and aggro in general.<br />
<br />
3.  Which disciplines will be unhooked, and can we please have more than 14 seconds on every discipline (and maybe a longer defensive so that it would last thourgh a boss mob)<br />
<br />
4.  What exactly is the endurance pool going to look like, what will we need for regen?  Will i need to go back and farm for this?  Will I get some use out of the +mana on my items?  Specifically will this benifit a hybrid more than me?  are we going to have more of an itemization problem?<br />
<br />
5.  Will this be enough to offset the curent situation with knights?<br />
<br />
6.  lastly can we get these on spell gems or something because i don't know how i am going to fit all these on my control bar with all the macro's i already run.<br />
<br />
Overall it is exciting, but i'll wait and see how SoE addresses these things before getting worked up into a frenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">I agree with BB ...... If you don't address the root problems, then no ammount of bells and whistles are gonna take up the slack.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that a ranged aggro ability that<br />
<br />
1) Created about half as much aggro as a snare or a stun.<br />
2) was range only(sorta like trying ot attack with a Bow when teh mob is close).<br />
<br />
In addition with:<br />
1) A Taunt that either refreshed quicker or had a higher success rate.<br />
2) Top of list + 100(if NOT at top of list allready)... <br />
<br />
Would improve our ability to hold aggro in the early fight enough that we would have less slower's kicking the bucket, and even on the (much more rare than now) occasion we did lose aggro the enhanced taunt would enable us to get it back quicker and more solidly. THis would STILL give us less aggro than Knights, but would make warriors much more desired as a tank in group.<br />
<br />
Any solution that they come up with that don't give us some type of aggro generate like I described above that DOES NOT depend on the random Number generator is unacceptable to me.</div></div><hr />

All of this sounds like great steps in a new direction.  I hope the first cut is a good enough taste to show everyone that melee still means something in EQ.<br />

<br />
I'll give you this - IF they get off their butts and add new skills that don't require openings and that YOU the player control the timing of then maybe we're getting somewhere, why they felt the need to make any of 'em random is beyond me. <br />
<br />
Lets not forget that the wording at the moment suggests they are not including personal control at the get go. They're still suggesting that 'in the future' they 'might' be able to add skills not dependant on openings. There are as yet no definate commitments to additional stuff and those commitments need to be pushed for, or else the change will not have the required effect.</div></div><hr />

First of all, those small openings are time based.. I've seen a few people talking about hitboxes... you don't have to go click on whatever box you know....<br />
<br />
Second of all, these opening skills are bonuses.. you dont HAVE to do them to do your work properly, since your current EB weapons are still available....<br />
Those who had trouble with aggro now have these abilities to help them,<br />
those who dont need much help, now have these abilities to either use more disciplines, or do more damage or whatever...<br />
<br />

<br />
How is this all that different from a rogue BS? or A Monk Dragon Punch? or Kick/Slam? IT NOT... it is just a little bit more feedback oriented...<br />
<br />
What people are failing to comprehend is this... <br />
<br />
This combat system gives SoE a very very important tool. If you know anything about programing, you know that modularity is very important. What this appears to me to be is a modular system to implement skills, abilities effects etc.. that are very similar to spells, but that work on conditional host/client actions. This will allow SoE to now give us new skills/abilities/effects EVERY expansion. Through the use of modular code. They dont need to recode and create all new code, such as they did when disciplines came out or the addition of /Shield. or the addition of Hokeyed AA abilities... This finally givges melee the same chance to upgrade  and expand as all casters have had since day 1...<br />
<br />
Its About damn time...<br />
<br />
For those saying that it doesnt address all the issues.. that is true.. but then No One Ever believed that we would get a 'mana'bar' and spells either...<br />
<br />
Lets get this system in place and then see how it affects balance.. Unless you all are calling for complete and utter superiority.. changes need to be done in moderation to preserve balance..</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are certainly similarities to our combat system. There are also similarities to EQOA's combat as well as that of other games. <br />
<br />
Again, EQ is not a testbed for us. They had a problem they needed to solve, saw some of our concepts that they liked, and adapted some for their use. If anything, they need to test their system to make sure it will work well in their already established game. Since our combat system is at the core of our game design, we don't really need them to test anything about it on our behalf.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">This is the perfect answer, if SoE implements it properly.  Let's use some imagination, and pretend Sony would be willing to do this:<br />
<br />
Openings<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). <br />
<br />
Ok, these are RNG based, melee only actions. They are only executable 1) after a certain situation (ie exceptional parry in the example) and 2) once the melee has learned a skill.  While they are subject to the RNG, we're still unsure how exactly they'll work, and what other peramiters outside of Parry.  For imagination's sake, let's say it can activate when you Parry, Riposte, Block, Critical Strike, Bash/Slam, Taunt, Proc, or Disarm.  We've been told that once an 'Opening' appears, we can then select a skill under a certain category (ie Tactical) to activate an action.<br />
<br />
For example, say while Disarming, an &quot;Opening&quot; appears.  You could then select skills from categories that work with that condition.<br />
<br />
Disarm<br />
Tactical: Stunning Disarm: Lvl 50 (6 sec stun - 50 Endurance), Hesistation: Lvl 30 (20% slow for 60 seconds - 100 Endurance), Disempower Lvl 60 (-10% AC for 36 seconds - 500 Endurance)<br />
Offensive: Advantage: Lvl 55 (+100 Atk 36 sec- 200 Endurance), Flash Strike: Lvl 20 (3x damage next attack + blind - 100 endurance), Power Slash: Lvl 65 (9999 damage, 2HS weapon only - 3000 Endurance)<br />
Defensive: Defiant: Lvl 50 (+15% mitigation 60 seconds - 300 Endurance), Magicbane: Lvl 25 (+50 vs. Magic - 90 seconds - 100 Endurance), Dancing Feet: Lvl 65 (+30% avoidance 45 seconds - 500 Endurance).<br />
Agro: Humiliate: Lvl 55 (Increase hate 600 - 100 Endurance)<br />
<br />
This in my opinion is a great idea, if the system can be worked out for flexibility and there is a large enough selection of skills to enable.  It would also allow for specific skills for specific situations (ie Defensive only when taking damage, groupwide/AE skills when in DPS role, skills that activate when below 50%, skills that activate only when Endurance is 100%, and so on).  The randomness of the openings should be offset by both the power and the flexibility of the skills.  It's here where groups should be considering whether to take a melee vs. a hybrid class.  Do you take the guaranteed snap agro of a knight with their spell flexibility, or the increased power and superior tanking Potential of a warrior.  Or, do we take a beastlord for guaranteed DPS or a warrior (!) who has the potential to recognize openings?  <br />
<br />
Disciplines<br />
Disciplines will be transferred to this new system <br />
Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer <br />
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost <br />
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's hoping the devs do this right.  But lets take a look at a possible &quot;What if&quot; scenario.   Putting discs on their own timer means the ability to activate it individually more frequently, or perhaps simultaneously.  Let's be honest, enabling warriors to Defensive and Evasive back to back, or at the same time would be a huge boost over knight classes.  With this new system, it's a possibility (will it happen? who knows).<br />
<br />
Now let's take this a step further - with potentially better reuse times and individual timers, you can use Fell Strike in a DPS role.  Say the refresh is 6 minutes vs. 30 minutes.  Then you can use Aggressive in the same role, increasing your DPS.  Chain using Defensive, Evasive, Furious, and Fortitude could be an option depending on refresh times.  <br />
<br />
Now let's go even further and combine /disc with &quot;Openings&quot;.  What if there is a riposte &quot;Opening&quot; that Quadruples damage on riposte for 12 seconds.  Couple that with Furious, and wow!  How about a Defense &quot;Opening&quot; with increases mitigation +25%, while you're already /disc Defensive?  How about a critical &quot;Opening&quot; that makes every crit into a double Cripple for 36 seconds, coupled with Mighty Strike? The potential for &quot;Stacking&quot; of abilities is only limited to what devs want to enable, and balance.<br />
<br />
Non-Opening Skills<br />
It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. <br />
<br />
The potential for skills on the Endurance-use list that can be activated outside of &quot;openings&quot; on demand is huge.  It's a perfect spot to stick a ranged taunt + hate ability!  Sure it costs Endurance, but a small price to pay for on-demand, non RNG, hate boost.  Warriors mitigation not balanced with knights?  Just add an Endurance based, non opening skill with a +% mitigation boost.  HP difference not great enough?  Add a +X% hp boost skill which drains Z amount of Endurance/tic.  This category of Non-Opening skills is where the biggest tweaking will occur I'm guessing, since it can be activated on demand, and doesn't rely on getting lucky with the RNG.  <br />
<br />
Is this the &quot;hybridization&quot; of melee? In a sense, yes.  But it is a valid solution to the balance problem in my opinion.  Of course, if SoE fails to implement solutions that address the main warrior concerns with this system, it really isn't a fix, is it?  <br />
<br />
I'm willing to give Sony a chance with this system.  However, with such a powerful, customizable melee combat system, they have NO EXCUSE not to get it right.  Mess it up, and bye-bye EQ for me. Cause if this doesn't work, nothing will - the system is too flexible for it not to work, if SOE wants it to.</div></div><hr />

Y'know, i'm not sure why you all equate having reservations with trying to 'veto' the change. Yep, it has the potential to make things better and yes i welcome that, doesn't mean that I should sit here with a silly grin on my face thinking all is right with the EQ class balance world :)  <br />
<br />
The fact is that you can't possibly make any judgement on what they are going to do until they tell you WHAT they are going to do.  Based on your previous posts I wouldn't have expected you to be so reactionary based on a tiny snippet of data.<br />
<br />
I very seriously doubt that warriors are going to get a button to push that gives them uncontested aggro every time with no doubt.  I will be very disappointed if they do.  If my warrior came down to pushing my autoaggro button on inc then what's the skill in playing a warrior? <br />
<br />
Anway, this thread is pointless, because they haven't told us what they are going to do, and even when they do tell us, we won't know what the real effect is until it shows up in the game and we can test drive it.  My theory is to wait until you have something to base your opinions on before going off the deep end.<br />
<br />

Just as many other classes have to do various &quot;timesinks&quot; to achieve their skills/abilities, our having to do so seems equitable.<br />
<br />
If you wish to equate these new abilities with spells, then it is reasonable that they might have to be researched, looted, bought, etc to use.  That doesn't seem out of line.<br />
<br />
Of course, that is said, like all of this, without knowing the details of what will be needed to get these.<br />
<br />
As to how this is balancing, if we and the monks and rogues are given the capability to fill our roles better to match the other classes, and this is how it is done, then that would be balancing.<br />
<br />
And note, I said &quot;if&quot;.<br />
Do I know for sure this will do so?  No.<br />
Could it?  Yes.<br />
When will we know for sure?  About 3 days after implementation at the latest, most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Personally, I'm very excited about the prospects for this.  They're basically giving us a mana bar so that means as time goes on and new expansions come out they can add new abilities for us just as easily as they can for casters.  This may not balance us to our satisfaction right away but it opens up HUGE possibilities for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">For the love of god. People, this is the first real positive improvement warriors have gotten in 3+ years (we're not gonna count the PE AA (this was bullshit to begin with), or /shield). The first one. This is the first indication that SoE even knows we exist. It may not be exactly what people were asking for, but it certainly seems like a very intriguing change, with some serious posibility. And you people are actually fucking COMPLAINING?! YOu have got to be out of your fucking mind. <br />
<br />
If this system is implemented properly, can you even phanthom the kind of benefits that come out of this for warriors, and most likely, melee classes alltogether? Do you even realize that these changes will finally realize the concept of warrior stackability in XP groups and raids as something other than DPS (which can be filled much better by any other class). Do you realize the reconstruction of the disc system may finally make people use a disc other than defensive/evasive. Do you realize that they are actually talking about fixing warrior agro (granted, not instant agro generation, and you can be sure I will personally bring this particular subject up in the melee chat, so don't fret). Warrior agro hasn't EVER been discussed in the history of Everquest.....<br />
<br />
Of course. all of this hangs on their ability to implement this properly. But I can tell you this, not even SoE is stupid enough to entirely alter the game mechanics of EQ without carefully planning this out beforehand. Irregardless, STOP FUCKING COMPLAINING. These are POSITIVE changes, they are a GOOD thing, so please shut up and at least wait for them to be implemented before spewing this bullshit.</div></div><hr />

I have not seen too many going off the deep end, but a number of us are pointing out things that we see, with what information SoE has given us, as possible concerns.  Hopefully(and I suspect this will happen), some one from SoE is actually going to read threads like this before the chat, and be able to address some of these concerns.<br />
<br />
Despite having some concerns, I am excited about some of the potential in this, and cannot wait for the chat, and for this stuff to start making it to test(you players on test will give us the lowdown soon as you can start playing with this stuff, right?), let alone for it to make it live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward. <br />
<br />
That it just the latest version of this:<br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. Some options being considered are: <br />
<br />
Its the same thing, they finally realized how rediculase they sounded copying and pasting for 10 months.<br />
<br />
Also, the message, and the lovely example (read the warrior tanking the goblin) is exactly how it's going to be. SoE is a corporation. They have been paying some dev team for the last X # of months to work on this (the same group of people that have been telling Absor that there isn't anything new that he can tell us about until now, sound fishy?). They aren't going to deviate from this system at all. This is it. The SoE higher ups can't suddenly decide to chuck this out the window and write off everything these devs have been working on for the last X # of months. So this is what we get, as soon as they decide to patch it in. After patch, the move on to next item on gant chart and are greatful that &quot;melee&quot; is now a retooled &quot;spellbased&quot; system that they can easily tweek.  They have to think this way, because AS a maojr corporation SoE has obsurd ammount of turnover in their developers. THAT explains why they can't fix anything bugged in the game, because the people that origianlly wrote the code have moved on to a different employer.<br />
<br />
Is it step in the right direction? I suppose it is in that they actually devoted some time to melee instead of spells, but thats about as far as I'm willing to give them. Sounds to me like they are trying to dazzle us with winky blinky lights so we quit bad mouthing them. <br />
<br />
I'd be happy with either being able to hold aggro over every other class OR neft the aggro lock the other classes have over us. Make aggro RNG for all forms of spells would be the same as hitting that Taunt skill.  But, then again, the fired the guy that made the Taunt skill becuase the assclowns that were coding spells couldn't figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">Ok... let me get this straight...<br />
<br />
The StandDown everyone wanted to participate in, was just to piss off SOE??<br />
Seems most people don't give a sh*t wether SOE do anything or not...<br />
<br />
People have been proposing things in The War Room for ages.. such as changing discipline timers, giving us new means of aggro, giving us for group favorism.....<br />
All this was obviously just for laughs right??<br />
<br />
They finally announce something higher then we ever expected,<br />
and some of you seem madder then before...<br />
<br />
Will this affect the core of the problem??.. well.. let me ask you this:<br />
WHAT is the core of the problem?? <br />
<br />
Aggro??? I thought most of you though Paladin aggro was overpowered... now you want to break the game just as much??<br />
<br />
Yes we could use a small boost in aggro, and these changes ARE giving us a boost, and they CAN give us a BIG boost...<br />
They could easily implement an &quot;opening&quot; that happens when a mob is hit for the very first time... <br />
You'll have to ask group members not to damage it until you have... then you hit it (maybe with a bow), get a 5 second opening to use &quot;Cruel Welcome&quot;, a 600hate inducer with knockback.<br />
And voila &quot;core&quot; problem fixed....<br />
<br />
Though we are already potentially fixed just by a discipline change.<br />
<br />
The Warrior Community thought a discipline change would be good enough...<br />
and now that they propose that change AND much more.. you change your minds and spit at it...<br />
<br />
Either be dangerously excited or sadly dubious... but finding this bad, is being a retarded spoiled brat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>snoedog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">na, it pretty simple.<br />
<br />
They say &quot;Ah, lets give a warrior a disc that will let you hit for 100X normal damage!!&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The warriors rejoice.<br />
<br />
Its implemented.<br />
<br />
It has a .5%chance of being successful.<br />
<br />
The warriors scratch their heads.<br />
<br />
That is SOE's style.  It is their history of doing things.  They give you something that looks real cool, but it hardly ever works.  So then they 'fix' it by saying &quot;There is a new AA that will in crease it to 1%, 2%, 4%!  Its only 6,8,10 AAs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Its SOE's propaganda that feeds us this 'wonderful' new enchancements without telling the whole story.<br />
<br />
I just hope they untie the discs, that would allow warriors to at least hit 2 more buttons over 10 min and add maybe 1% more dps, but I bet its more than anything else that gets implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">Excuse me Bunnie but you were hammering on people for being 'sadly dubious' just as much as on anyone saying this was 'bad'. :p<br />
<br />
Potentially it's great, presently, and with the information given (which i agree is not much but even so) there is some cause for concern since those changes that this system 'may' allow SoE to implement are not in any way confirmed as being a definate implementation. <br />
<br />
Oh and the fact that i think knight aggro is overpowered doesn't negate the fact that so long as it is allowed, warriors need to be able to compete with it if they wish to tank.<br />
<br />
...and for the record I certainly never subscribed to the idea that unlinking the disciplines would balance my class in totality. <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">Hrm.. don't remember being against dubious people, maybe I just badly expressed myself :p...<br />
I understand totally the idea of being dubious about how much SOE  will balance us...<br />
But I find it odd to see people hammer the balancing, only after seeing part of the idea, when that part of the idea, is already more then most people expected...<br />
I guess people are 100% sure that the only we'll be balanced is by &quot;fixing the Taunt button&quot; :( <br />
<br />
<br />
And Snoedog, I disagree... that isn't the style of SOE at all... because they never &quot;fed us any propaganda&quot;...<br />
it's actually one of the problems this community faced.. lack of information...<br />
<br />
The only ability we got during the troubled days, was /shield. Which wasn't announced as any &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;balancing&quot; tool.. hell.. it was hardly announced at all... (it was first thought of as an AA, then they preferred to have the AA enhance an existing skill.. so, they stealthly implemented it some day, with a small announcement to it's usage).<br />
<br />
The true problem was ignorance. We've been overlooked, pushed aside, and ignored for years...<br />
Now, even if this new idea is badly implemented at first, we got one of our biggest troubles fixed... we'll be cared for.<br />
We'll be on the front page... because what's happening to melees, is bigger then anything that's ever happened to any class.</div></div><hr />

I believe there is a general consesus that there are 3 issues that warriors wanted addressed. In order of importance they are:<br />
<br />
1. ranged/snap agro<br />
2. ac/hp/mitigation nullification<br />
3. group utility<br />
<br />
If issues 1. and 2. were addressed then our group utility would be a non-issue because we would be able to hold agro while needing fewer heals than our hybrid bretheren. This would balance the utility knights bring to groups derived from thier spellbooks.<br />
<br />
It appears to me that issue 3. is being addressed while the fundamental problems 1. and 2. are not. Disciplines &quot;probably&quot; will be unlinked, knights will have &quot;limited&quot; endurance pools (limited to what, 95% of melee?). Warriors will still have to rely on the RNG in order to add agro, this helps us how? How is the nullification of ac/hp/mitigation advantage warriors had addressed? Instead of makeing warriors more like warriors, they have decided to make warriors more like knights. The hybridization of warriors has begun.  <br />
<br />
Uh, read Absor's article again. These openings, and the resultant &quot;moves&quot; are just part of what is being addressed, its not the WHOLE enchilada, just a teaser to get folks at least listening. Be patient, let's see what all they are going to unveil the 24th, then if they are still ignoring the crucial issues, bitch to high heaven and let all of Norrath hear you. But it's myopic to focus in on the &quot;new&quot; as though that is all they are doing, when what everyone is focusing on is merely 1/4 of what Absor said is going to be dealt with in this upcoming patch.</div></div><hr />

Most of the whiners have not read the article fully and has not read or at least not comprehended the meaning of &quot;This is not all the changes but part of it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you do not know anything and can't comment on it then it follows that you can't frigging whine about it either.<br />
<br />
The changes does not bring anything bad, it adds to pure melee so it cannot be bad period. If it's enough isn't anything you can discuss because they already said it isn't.<br />
<br />
The only people I can think of that will have a complain is the ones that aren't very good today and just see themselves being left behind because they do not have the attentionspan to actually use it.<br />
This is just a good thing, it will become easier to seperate the useless players from the useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">I dunno what theyre planning.<br />
<br />
But I know lots of things wich are new in EQ are a result of other games ( linking Items from AO ... ).<br />
<br />
So you can take a look at other games to find things/ideas they may have taken.<br />
<br />
Styles<br />
<br />
Oh Styles can fill several roles and fill several of the wishes of warrior.<br />
<br />
1. Snapaggro.<br />
In DAoC there are Styles for each melee class without an opening. You can name them Startstyles. These normaly cost a bit more Endurance than others and often have not so much damage benefits.<br />
<br />
So maybe they make a warrioronly start Style who has a great aggropart. Several upgrades when the warrior grows up.<br />
<br />
Reactionstyles would be styles you only can do when something special happens.  These styles normally cost not so much endurance and bring more damage ... .<br />
<br />
Followerstyles are styles which are only possible when another style was successfull. These dish the most damage with the less of endurance.<br />
<br />
That are the basics.<br />
Out of this you can make Styles for beeing in the back, standing in front or also make styles for all standing in back or in front or all using 2hblunt or 1h slash or what you want.<br />
<br />
So the benefits for us warrior could be<br />
1. a nice form of start aggro, big enough for beeing welcome in exp groups.<br />
2. a nice form of extra damage<br />
3. a steady stream of more aggro during the fight<br />
<br />
You can fill in the dotidea from furor with some bleeding styles ( exist in DAoC ) and you can nearly bring everything in when you want it.<br />
<br />
The Idea behind the styles .. is good.<br />
<br />
The result out of this Idea is .... .... yeah ... thats the question only sony can answer in the moment.<br />
<br />
But one thing is clear. The styles will differ the real good tanks from the lazy and .... tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Macbrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">I am going to bring up a suggestion that might need to be adressed at the chat.   Itemization has been broken for awhile, which has resulted in all melee classes getting lumped in with casters. This means that all combined class items have a useless stat on them to us.   I was trying to figure out if they are just going to add Endurance or make Mana=Endurance for melee classes only. <br />
<br />
Here is an example of an item if that was true.<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Chain Tunic <br />
MAGIC ITEM <br />
Weight: 5.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Slot: CHEST <br />
AC: +45 Str: +5 Dex: +5 Sta: +8 Wis: +11 Agi: +8 Fire Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 Magic Resist: +5 Poison Resist: +5 HP: +50 Mana/Endurance: +50 <br />
Classes: Ranger Shaman Rogue <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
<br />
Assuming Mana is for casters and Endurance only adds for Warrior/monk/rogue. If done this way Hybrids wouldn't gain any endurance boosts and therefor should be using spells to add to their effects.  Which is how it should be. Their pool would stay limited and not become overpowering. <br />
<br />
Now, if seperated to look like <br />
<br />
Tae Ew Chain Tunic <br />
MAGIC ITEM <br />
Weight: 5.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Slot: CHEST <br />
AC: +45 Str: +5 Dex: +5 Sta: +8 Wis: +11 Agi: +8 Fire Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 Magic Resist: +5 Poison Resist: +5 HP: +50 Mana:+50  Endurance: +50 <br />
Classes: Ranger Shaman Rogue <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
<br />
With no check this means we still get a crap stat and hybrids gain yet the same effect over again we had before. They gain the same boost we have plus extra mana.  This may want to be addressed in the chat. <br />
It does mean they would have to go back and change class specific items but that is much less a task then to actually balance it out so that we gain real benefit from the items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">What could possibly happen is armor that is warrior/monk/rogue useable but has mana on it might instead be transferred to endurance at a ratio depending on which class gets ahold of it, or how big the Endurance pool is, or perhaps an AA might be added later to do so.  Okay, I can dream, can't I? :D<br />
<br />
  The Endurance pool might be on a different scale than Mana pools, which can reach well over 5k. <br />
<br />
At the last Fan Faire they stated that an equipment guy had a reason why LDoN Plate class/all armor didn't improve hybrids more than pure melee, but he wasn't there so there might be an announcement with the information...anyone know what happened to him/that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">now that we get our very own pool... making it depend on other classes pools would be a horrible mistake...<br />
mana to endurance transfers should never ever happen.<br />
<br />
What will hopefully happens, is an addition of endurance points, to all items...<br />
-All the items with mana currently that have an importance to melees as well, with be given endurance points.<br />
-Melee only items will be given a boost in endurance points, maybe more then the mana holding items.<br />
-Items will be added with endurance related enhancements.<br />
<br />
Mana and everything related to it, will stay exactly as is... none will be removed from items, none will give Melees an advantage that never existed before....<br />
the work on it would be way too huge, forcing more balance then necessary, AND it would create big unjustices out there...<br />
<br />
I do hope though, that itemization compared with endurance, will have the same consequences as the mana oriented itemization...<br />
giving a well equipped melee a gigantic use of endurance,<br />
and allowing a Warrior to stay permanently in Defensive/Evasive states, if he manages his endurance well enough.<br />
Only then, will we be up to par with current EverQuest class power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>snoedog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">quote:<br />
&quot;And Snoedog, I disagree... that isn't the style of SOE at all... because they never &quot;fed us any propaganda&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you know that SOE said we would get player housing?  Do you know how many things SOE has said that isnt true or just half truths?<br />
<br />
Here is a quote from their website (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp)<br />
&quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you think this is true?<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle. &quot;<br />
<br />
How many honestly think this is true?  <br />
<br />
This is why I mistrust SOE.  From being a cleric and how they totally messed with them with all the changes and broken promisses.  DONT GO FOR THE BONE!  They are just trying to pacify a group of customers, dont keep quiet untill you are truly happy with the results!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>Macbrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">Odd in my first example in which I made mana = endurance the warrior gets something that the paladin/sk does not.  But in my second example the paladin/sk get same benefit from it as the warrior and therefor the warrior falls behind.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe, I am looking at it from a wrong point of view.  Do you not think that items will say all plate class useable?  They aren't going to destroy all items that are useable by both paladins and warriors just to go back and hand them out new gear.  They are going to change the gear you are wearing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Just from reading the article, I would guess that hybrid endurance pool is capped. Lets say hybrid pool is 1500, so even if they just slap +endurance on a lot of items, hybrids can't go above that 1500 cap, whereas pure melee have a higher cap or perhaps have no cap at all and therefore get to reap the benefit of all the endurance. This is only speculation, but it seems like the most reasonable course of action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Janus_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">*snip snip*<br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. <br />
<br />
Disciplines will be transferred to this new system <br />
Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer <br />
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost <br />
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
<br />
*snip snip*<br />
<br />
Hybrids don't get these skills, they only get endurance for their few disciplines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont get me wrong, I don't trust SOE in making good decisions, or being knowledgable about their own game.<br />
Ya they are pretty clueless on many things...<br />
<br />
but I've never seen them announce something, that ended up being something totally different.<br />
They actually didnt give any information at all for months, to avoid this sort of thing...<br />
<br />
Ok... Verant announced player housing for EQ...<br />
well.. that was Verant, not SOE,<br />
and bascially every company promise a few things that end up not making it live.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying that nothing in SOE's history, can make us think they would back off this idea....<br />
on the other hand, history shows they might badly implement it at first.<br />
But with the competition showing it's nose, and the community's uproar, you can bet that they want this to work... and are not just throwing another bone...<br />
if they wanted to throw a bone, they would said something about &quot;fixing Taunt&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">This all seems nice and glitsy, but there are still other things that should still be on the plate. <br />
<br />
It was mentioned before that if we are &quot;recognizing weaknesses&quot; this does have the potential to be as random as procs are, then we are just where we started with a harder, yet arguably more fun, character to play. <br />
<br />
Someone else mentioned that we could get some kind of skill that gives us enough innitial agro without having to parry/block or whatever first to keep our shammies/chanters from dying. That would be beneficial and possibly boost our need and tanking ability more, but there is more that needs looked at.<br />
<br />
I think taunt needs to be reconsidered. The taunt cap is 230, it needs to be raised for warriors. 250 sounds like a good number, this would lower the chance of our fails and in turn increase our agro generation. Now thats one simple fix that wouldnt take to much brain power to impliment and balance it.<br />
<br />
Also, it has been mentioned time and time and time again. We need to do more damage. More damage will increase our ability to generate more agro...<br />
<br />
This is what its all about isnt it? I dont want to see us blinded by this new system and forget what we were all here for. Again, mentioned earlier, if this system is implimented and it doesnt get the job done, we are screwed for a really long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Will you test the new system with a 55 warrior tanking in HoT before enabling it on  test please ? a goblin my ass.... <br />
<br />
2.Why can't you just increase our existing system with say , higher skill caps for melees, better melee only gear, and in-character penalties for hybrids ( i.e. a paladin who kills someone on good faction loses status until he atones, an SK with positive Kelethin faction can't HT til he gets it negative again, etc )  instead of completely negating 4 years of learning how to play a class ? not twitch skill oriented my ass<br />
<br />
3. are you testin it in PvP situations? <br />
<br />
4. did it hurt when you stuck your head up your ...<br />
<br />
ok maybe not that last one. point being, what possessed them to completely redo melee combat now, 4 years + into things ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">I would assume they would make changes to preexisting items.  There is plenty of room on elemental armor to add an actual Endurance and Endurance focus effects.<br />

I can already answer your secnod question...<br />
they're not upgrading this system because it sucks ass, and it drove them into a dead end...<br />
Discipline system sucked... they could of added new discs and all.. but the base problem would still be there.<br />
<br />
And what is a twitch oriented class to you?<br />
Did hitting Kick and Taunt every 5 seconds seem none-twitch oriented to you?<br />
<br />
And as for in-game penalties... the last thing wanted is a nerf.<br />
And the concept of class penalties never works..<br />
<br />
Instead of just throwing us a bone, by making aggro work, so we would shut the fuck up,<br />
they're fixing everything. (ya.. aggro was NOT the only problem)<br />

<br />
The fact is Knights can become the preferred tank in groups by having average gear and vendor bought spells......I don't think to catch up we should have to spend weeks aquiring these skills.<br />
<br />
The fact we don't get these skills automatically(we are warriors, I picked a warrior so that I wouldn't have to worry about campng, researching spells),  and no mention of a ranged aggro ability is the problems I see so far.......otherwise the system has the potential to make the game more interesting, albeit more complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">What scares me is the opposite... skills dropping in lower raid zones.<br />
If they put skills in Vex Thal for example, I won't be very happy :p<br />
<br />
Thats something else people could start thinking of for the chat,<br />
possible places and ways for the skills to become available.<br />
<br />
Here are my thoughts:<br />
<br />
-merchants &lt;basic skills, newbie skills&gt;,<br />
-all dungeons with mobs soloable by lvl65 melees &lt;abilities available to melees of the dungeon's level&gt;,<br />
-farmable boss mobs like vindicator, AoW, King Tormax, NToV etc... &lt;abilities of high level&gt; (this can be done by basically every high level),<br />
-a few drops in much higher zones like EP or Time &lt;special abilities, a bit like caster's ancient spells&gt; (no drop)<br />
-quests ranging from newbie to high level &lt;variety of skills&gt;<br />
-and finally, most important, a same system as the Research for spellcasters, variety of items dropping all over the popular zones counting LDoN, once brought together can form most dropped tomes..<br />
<br />
All in all, it should work a bit similar to ways spells work... <br />
except zones like sebilis should be avoided...<br />
the biggest problem being high level melees having to go back to old dungeons to farm skills....<br />
so skills quested, &quot;researched&quot;, and soloable are fine...<br />
and a few higher ones that can be either normally raided with a low end guild, or single grouped with a high end guild (like velious encounters)</div></div><hr />

I'm all for pure melee balancing. I hope they take care of you guys with this carrot they are dangling right now. But, Valeris needs to use some common sense. Or maybe he's just never played a caster toon.<br />

Spell casts do not always fire (barring fizzles):  RESISTS<br />
You cannot always cast it when you want:        OOM, Early aggro<br />

So if they put your new ability success/failure on an RNG, you will be hoping not to get a RESIST, per se. And, just like casters, if you are out of endurance (OOE, lol) you won't be able to pop off an ability.<br />

 I have yet to see a Pally go OOM in either an XP group or an LDoN adventure without some serious fuckup going on, on the order of pulling 5 with no chanter.<br />

Oh, and if i might ask Xevchanter, have you ever seen anyone 'resist' a heal spell? <br />

Not to mention that when a mob resists a root spell for example, you can just recast immediately after. We get one shot with a melee opening - if that fails you don't know when you get another chance. I think YOU need to look a bit deeper bud. Not I.<br />

SOE: We just fixed melee balance, we're going to work on adding more spells now.  Oh yeah, here's our new product........<br />

They know all these message boards exist, they can read them and they can figure out what we think will fix us.  If the fixes we are suggesting are going to break the game, then they have a lot more going on that's just plain wrong than one would think.<br />

And yes, we have Openings being mostly random already... the skills derivated by openings SHOULD land 100%... sure have some mobs immune if needs be....<br />
but having the skill shoot off randomly as well.. AND having resists too.. no way in hell.<br />
<br />
Thats one thing everyone needs to accentuate on during the Chat.<br />
Once the opening passed, once the skilled used in correct time... it WILL land.<br />
Melees have to get an advantage out of these openings... the advantage being unresistable, 100% successfull skills...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">OK... I read that.  What I read says that basically they're going to steal the styles system from DAOC.... but they're only going to steal the reactionary half.<br />
<br />
I notice they totally glossed over the innate HP gap.  Between 5-6K of buffs and gear (all twinkage being equal) facing a mob that can quad 1400's is 500hp of an innate hp gap really not laughable?<br />
<br />
What about the agro lock?  Just to give you all an idea on how much agro we don't generate-  I two box.  I play a 65 warrior, and a 65 shaman.  My warrior has a BoC, and a PoI hammer he dual weilds.  My shaman more than half the time stacking Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryn, and the epic spear.. (so 131+320+ 11-180ish ish- call it 100 DPS) at max will end up tanking.  That's right boys and girls.  Our agro generation is less than ~100 DPS.<br />
<br />
I see no mention of looking at Warrior travel versatility.  Take any other class in the game, kill em dead in the corner of the zone, and stick a low blue on top of their corpse, and only the warriors won't be able to CR themselves before the res timer is up.  Even a mage can nuke greens enough to buy a couple malachite, and they can invis.  Monks can flop it out, Rogues can stealth it out, clearics can Pac it out, and so can pallys.<br />
<br />
Hey, I'm all for changing up the combat system to something interesting, but it aint the combat system that's broke.  Its warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have read the entire message you would have read that not all the moves are going to have to require openings to be used. Has anybody thought those might be the agro moves? Everybody is automaticaly jumping to conclusions on how bad its going to be, we ned to just wait and see how it turns out.<br />
<br />
For everybody out there thats crying cuz this thing was stolen from such and such game, who gives a damn. is every side scrolling game a rip off of pitfall or every rpg that has a STR stat a rip off from D&amp;D? who cares, if it works it will make the game better. <br />
<br />

Peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">There has been no confirmation that ANY skills not dependant on a melee opening exist. We have a vague reference to it being possible. The option is there, wether it's been taken up is anyone's guess atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Heimdall-RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">By the way... wouldn't the opening after an exceptional parry be.... a riposte?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">Not necessarily, though it would certainly be an option.<br />
<br />
It could also create an opening for a rogue from behind for a higher damage backstab, could tick off a mob because you made it look bad, could unbalance the mob (lower ac), momentarily surprise the attacker (stun), give you a morale boost (+atk), a defensive advantage (+ ac), and of course allow for a counter (riposte) of greater damage.<br />
<br />
Logically, there are lots of possible reactions that could happen from such a move.  Hopefully the new system is being built to represent these, which would add a bit of strategy to playing a melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">I just hope we will be able to hold aggro in long fights without running out of endurance .. I mean, what will it be worth if everyone else starts getting more moves, that gives more aggro, so we still cannot hold aggro ?<br />
<br />
Apart from that it's a neat idea dna conveniently ripped from DAoC.</div></div><hr />

  Anyway last night I made a 25 test war and ya know what the STA bar is no more its now a endur bar (was not marked).   Log'd in with new char, did /testbuff to make a new lvl 25.  The yellow bar was empty but was filling very very slow so  I got out a stop watch and timed it from 50 to 70 %, took about 6.5 mins, so about 30-35 mins for complete refill.  Fighting did not lower it not did running.  So I would guess that to use def you may need 30% endur.   Also did some testing for the new &quot;your taunt failed&quot; message.  Lvl 25 taunt on lvl 2-3 in wfp newb area, taunt failed 1 out of 3 times. on the big bears in WC it failed 6 out of 10 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u205"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p205">Hmm .. Taunt is 5 x level + 5, right ?<br />
<br />
So that would make your taunt skill at level 25 about skill 130, correct ?</div></div><hr />
