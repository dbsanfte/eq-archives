I was just reading the Steel Warrior site and found it quite interesting (and yes, disgusting) just how much h8 that Warriors have for Paladins. <br />
<br />
Could it have something to do with the fact that they can't hold and maintain agro in comparison to a Paladin/SK? Or the fact that many experience groups now perfer Paladins/SKs over Warriors? I say be done with it...give knights the Warrior disc. and just make Warriors obsolete. Problem solved. <br />
<br />
/rant off (Okay, so I am a bit moody after reading the Paladin h8 posts on the Steel Warrior site) <br />

my question is this. if the aggro deficiency is between Knights (i wont say hybrid even that is the real case) and Warriors....why are all the warriors complaining about Paladins on our board, when i go to look at the SK board i see NO warriors complaining the issue there. SKs are just as comparable to Paladins in tanking and aggro but they get no grief about it, why should we? <br />

It's because warriors are big, DUMB , UGLY SMELLY, BRUTES with terrible haircuts, bad complexions, athlete's feet, and no friends.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Paladins are handsome, beautiful, wise, fit, witty, talented, and loved by all.<br />

<br />
:D  <br />
<br />
Of course good SKs are non-existant.  We live to spread death and disease to the masses.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Skilled SKs are even rarer.<br />
<br />
In all honesty it's because SKs have abilities to give warriors agro, and lose it themselves...while Paladins can only gain and hold agro.  It's easier to work with SKs than Paladins for a warrior.  That and the majority of Paladins seem to have an ego the size of a small planet (see the first and third one you quoted), downplay their abilities (I've seen some SKs do this tho, more common in Paladins), and seem unable to comprehend the fact that balanced power requires downsides, since this is a game not real life.<br />
<br />
Also, SKs get one 150hp/279hp buff they can buff themselves with.  Paladins get up to 1800hp in 4 buffs at 65 they can add to themselves, 674hp (2 buffs) of which is specific to the Paladin (one, Aura of the Crusader, is 344hp and self only, stacking with all others except druid line because of the mana regen.  They have Heroism, 425hp at 65, to counter that.).</div></div><hr />

I can't believe that they have a whole forum just for them to cry about Paladins. Is it just me or is that fairly tasteless? Isn't this also a SK issue too? I wonder why they decided to pick on us?<br />
<br />
There is some funny stuff in it, though.<br />
<br />
Were we that whiney during RoK? Maybe we were...but I didn't think so. I guess its all a matter of perspective.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is, they are CRYING so much, that we should all be prepared for the worst  :o <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a statement of my opinon<br />
<br />
I troll these boards alot and post very little but the Hate you see comeing from warrior stems mainly from the fact that I Have seen very few post here from Palladins that are anywhere near constructive in nature. Almost all of them that I have read are from onepost wonders who troll through and hit /rant, curse alot, and post very few facts and even manage to misquote what fact they do use.<br />
<br />
Personally I think alot of people forget that these are all pixels and what matters is the person at the keyboard,and not the graphics depicted image you see on your monitor 3000 miles away</div></div><hr />

<br />
WHAT<br />
THE<br />
FUCK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">people flock to an easy class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Think my guild has....lessee....8 or 10? But then again, we got 300 toons in the guild (Mains + Alts) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not sure myself. I actually find PON a pretty respectable board, with a lot of decent discussion. More than a lot of other boards thats for sure.  I do know that around the release of POP there were a few Paladins that posted here telling us we had nothing to worry about hehe, maybe that was it.<br />
<br />
Well that and Paladins are the closest tank to us I guess, so warriors channel their anger that way.<br />
<br />
Personally and honestly while I get angry at knights attitudes every now and then the problem is far deeper than just Paladins IMO, its the entire mana/itemisation past Velious game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sonan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I wouldn't say hate but there's definately some jealousy going on now. Way back almost 5 years ago I started a pally for my first toon. I leveled him to level 2 but decided that I may be in this game for the long haul. I figured along with so many of my other warrior brethren that of course the game makers wouldn't give equal tanking abilities to a class that could heal. That sounded like the easy way out and i opted for the class that would be the ultimate defender.<br />
        I leveled up in the most difficult of ways learning early that soloing was not our forte'. I fought for my groups against  the legions of other hardworking warriors and paid dearly for the equipment we needed desperately to survive and our groups to survive. Meanwhile these pallys while playing second fiddle to us rarely tanked and were not dependant on gear as we were.<br />
      Personally I have disdain for people who thought they could get the best of both worlds and because they whined a lot to the devs they got what they wanted. They have heals, rezzes, pacifying abilities and the stun. We still have taunt i guess. I don't mind the aggro problems as much as most warriors do, but I'm very annoyed that pallys are the preferred tank in LDON. <br />
         I think the reason people don't understand our plight is that we have had to fight our whole careers with very large number of warrior tanks and now that we've made it to the top we are second to a class that in our eyes cheated on their first day in class selection.<br />

<br />
<br />
*shrug* we are a decent size guild, raid numbers seem to be around 60-65 on average, with the &quot;everyone wearing the guildtag logs on for this event&quot; spikes of 90ish, not unusual for a guild that is nearing PoTime, the two guilds ahead of us in progression are about the same size if not slightly larger.  Paladins DO have a ton of raid utility, group heals, helping with CC, good DPS, can tank if necessary.  I should also mention my guild also averages about 3-4 warriors a raid, and 1-2 SKs.  I don't see anything odd about having that mana paladins, its not as if there are always 14 online all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'd say its <br />
<br />
a) because a lot of paladin trolls insist warriors are balanced the way they are <br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
b) A lot of warrior trolls insist paladins are overpowered because they are more powerful overall than warriors.<br />
<br />
Both statements are incorrect but common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">and <br />
c) a LOT of people have their egos buffed up when being paladin. I know a few.<br />
They suddenly get on their high horses (ya, the aa one :rolleyes:  ), and think that they're just damn good...<br />
<br />
It's odd, because most SKs I know are humble, and understand warrior problems, they're also generous and helpfull.<br />
Yet the paladins seem to mostly fit the egocentric asshole attitude.<br />
<br />
Quite a few I know, would refuse to join any group, if they're not the only tank within that group.<br />
They also refuse to join groups, and prefer to go afk in PoK, if the groups are not 100% effective..<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it's just that attitude of the player, that makes them want to play a paladin human/elf, in the first place.<br />
Maybe paladin gnomes/halfling are cooler? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Never disliked pally's until I joined serverwide:thesteelwarrior and got booted by a PALLY who was the MODERATOR because I happened to suggest that maybe a pally shouldn't be moderating/giving out advice in the WARRIOR channel.<br />
<br />
**NOTE**  I still don't dislike pally's.  I have alot of good pally friends in game.  I just thought that story was funny.  Sadly it is true, and sadly it mirrors how palladins have come to dominate warriors in the game of EQ.</div></div><hr />
