<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My vote is weighty polearm. Not sure what the stats would be for a level 41 (rec level of 50), but im fairly sure they would beat the Centi Warspear. Either of those 2handers if far and away better than your current 1 handers. I can't really think of a situation where you would use any of those 1 handers over your 2 hander options.<br />
<br />
For help with upgrading your 1handers for free consider running your guy to the ME or UP zone-ins. Frequently people killing there have 1 handers drop that no one will use. Might take a few trips, but could be signficant upgrades. <br />
<br />
To buy upgrades, try looking for something like these in your bazaar ( i just scanned the bazaar on CT and the following were all less than 100pp): Centi Shortsword, Blackhand Berserkers Axe, Sharpened Flotsam, Bed Leg Club, ... Any of these would be better than the 1 handers you have now. (server economies vary, but you can definately do better in the bazaar for next-to no money)</div></div><hr />
