<br />
Least it was not me saying it this time.  Not a popular view, but I agree with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's used in DAoC and it's going to be used in WoW.<br />
<br />
Anyways it's simple.<br />
<br />
Warriors get special attacks, (monks, go fuck yourselves please before making commens). Anyhow, they start at level 25, and scale up.<br />
<br />
Level 25:<br />
Skill: Rupture<br />
Effect: 5 points of damage per tick upon a successful rupture/25 points of hate per tick upon a succesful rupture. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds.<br />
<br />
Level 35:<br />
Skill: Maim<br />
Effect: 15 points of damage per tick/50 points of hate per tick. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds. DPS gain: 3 dps.<br />
<br />
Level 45:<br />
Skill: Disembowel<br />
Effect: 40 points of damage per tick/100 points of hate per tick. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds. DPS Gain: 7 dps.<br />
<br />
Level 55:<br />
Skill: Eviscerate<br />
Effect: 100 points of damage per tick/200 points of hate per tick. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse 24, seconds. DPS gain: 17 dps.<br />
<br />
Level 65:<br />
Skill: Raze<br />
Effect: 150 points of damage per tick/350 points of hate per tick.<br />
Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds. DPS gain: 25 dps.<br />
<br />
Defintions: The warrior, through experience and training has discovered ways to cause harm to their enemy by striking at vital organs and body parts. The abilities cause extreme pain to their victims, enhancing the perceived threat of the warrior to the creature/opponent. <br />
<br />
Too cookie cutter but overall a good idea<br />
Make Maim and Eviscerate reduced damage/hate with longer durations. Make Disembowel do all its damage and hate in one shot with a 9 minute reuse.  Make Raze hate only but unresistable.  Every tick of damage / hate should have a chance to be mitigated (partially or completely), based on AC.</div></div><hr />
