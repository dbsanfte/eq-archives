<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, I'm posting yet another &quot;I'm new to potime, which items should I look for?&quot; question, but with a twist; I'm the newest plate class in the guild, which has reached phase4 a couple of times, and has no problem with phase1/2 any more. Since the guild is on an attendance/dkp system, the only items I'm going to get for a while are ones that go for half or free. This pretty much rules out all of the better items from time for now. So instead, I'm looking for items from phases 1, 2, and maybe 3 which are pretty common, but will last me a while. As you can see in my magelo, I have 0 vt/ele/GoD loot so far, so I've got plenty of stuff to upgrade.<br />
<br />
Ring of Force would be one example; one dropped last night and went for half. Also, some gauntlets from phase2 earth named, 54ac with strikethrough and other stuff i believe, went for half, and i missed bidding on because of rez (grr).<br />
<br />
So what other items? The actual name of the item, and who drops it, would be helpful, since I'm having a hard time finding the names of bosses and what phase they are in, etc. Finally, any ele stuff I should look for would be good too, as we still do air rings, earthb, and other ele targets once or twice a week.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Tier 2 cudgel of reckoning, girdle of restoration<br />
Tier 3 cloak of wishes, elem legs, earing of xaoth, faceguard of frenzy, fiery crystal guard(i know dups with cloak of wishes but this is a bit better, although wishes is normally an early rot loot), perhaps ethereal destroyer.<br />
<br />
Your main goal should be hps and resists at this point.  You want to accumulate enough early gear so that you are not a detriment to the guild come tier 5+ where aes start to fuck you up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every thread i've read through is one where someone wants to know the best items to spend dkp on, and it ends up being stuff off quarm, RZ, phase4 stuff, etc. I'm looking for stuff that isn't necessarily the best items in potime, but the ones that drop commonly that I will be more likely to get, ones that I should keep an eye out for. Feel free to post similarly to Deth however, but thanks in advance to anyone who posts useful stuff.</div></div><hr />

I agree.  I really no don't look at Time as being &quot;high-end&quot; anymore.  A lot of us clear Time in our sleep now.</div></div><hr />
