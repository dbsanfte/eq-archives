This thing is due this coming Monday so post your ideas on what AA's / Disciplines we want on the next EQ xpac where we lvl up to 70.<br />
<br />
Here's the EQ link for our class, and please guys no dumb shit, the ranger class already tried to flame and verant shut down thier forum a week early.<br />
<br />
Warriors of Tommorow (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=warriorbalance&amp;message.id=613)</div></div><hr />

why are so many people asking for endless quiver. i highly doubt many warriors even *use* a quiver. with the LDoN bag, it takes me a week just to go through 1 stack of crystals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't matter, they consider endless quiver broken, and don't even want rangers to have it anymore either.<br />
<br />
Warriors won't be getting it.  Well, that is if the Dev team has any sense of consistency at all (which is asking a lot).<br />
<br />
Edit -- Oh, and by the way, that thread is a black hole of idiocy.  It's like the druids grove...only gayer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Innate Reflexes 3.0 <br />
- Innate Defence 3.0<br />
<br />
- Spell Stun Resistance (we are supposed to be resistance to magic &amp; stuns)<br />
<br />
- Improved Planar Power (355 Cap to Melee Stats please)<br />
<br />
- Improved Taunt Rate (20 Fail on a red mob is a joke)<br />
<br />
- Faster AE Taunt (Please 10:30 is way too long)<br />
<br />
Other than that ...  Well if other classes get DPS boost, so should we.<br />

I think todays warriors are perfect  :D</div></div><hr />

If the only aa's they give are ones that increase the gap between war/pal/sk and all else I'll be happy, specially if I get tanking abilites that make me a better tank then a ranger/monk/rogue/ber etc by at least 30% all the time.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of anything class only that'd be really cool that wouldn't imbalance the game.  Maybe increased DS effectiveness (why do Rangers get it of all classes) or allow a chance for crit to be a crippling blow.  Other than that, I don't see anything we would get that wouldn't be along the line of the generic all melee or at least all plate melee line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of  these seem like good ideas but id hate to get any of them at the expense of a truly usefull aa. There are only going to be a certain number of aa's.<br />
<br />
Also we want to keep ourselves as pure tanks, getting skills that lets us snare, do rediculous stuns or gate is gunna complicate things. The more versatile we get the more we infringe on hybrids and greater the knight cry for defensive gains credence.</div></div><hr />

In all seriousness i don't forsee anything major coming our way if any at all.<br />
Maybe some unusefull glorified AA that will allow us to do something spectacular like regen 3 more hp / tick or so *insert sarcasm*<br />
<br />
What i would rather see is that they scrap the whole idea and actually go back and take a look at the good expansions that we have had , Velious , Kunark and PoP.<br />
Stop this GoD crap that has no storyline whatsoever , i want real badass mobs , not some crap that looks like outa a B movie and sounds like a 7 year old getting spanked when i hit it. But yet somehow manages to make my god (RZ) look like a blind no legged toothless wilderbeast in comparison...where is the storyline...??!!<br />
<br />
I want mobs that look mean , not to beat up shadowpixies !!! <br />
<br />
If they did that i could live with no more AA's at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a storyline.  The reason why you haven't seen any 'boss' enemy is because the Mata Muram guys are just moving their forces and staging up for an invasion, so of course the big guys are still behind back at the realms of discord.  The guys in Taelosia is at best just a scouting/initial force so of course all the big guys aren't there yet.  There's a reasonable amount of lore in GoD, though a lot of it isn't exactly easy to access due to the danger of traveling around in GoD zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I m gonna guess with the storyline of EQ2 that our Gods are gonna get Whooped and that is why they are no longer there in EQ2. Or maybe I should mention the fact that we go to their Planes a kill them.<br />
<br />
Of course that's off topic...<br />
<br />
I am not sure what we could use for a new AA. I don't see us getting stun b/c that will cause the new Berserker community to scream as that will probably be their contrabution. Maybe we could ask for.... I hate to say it... some new line of AAs that improve or shield use. Give us an chance to special things with a bash, or give additional hate with shields, or even an AC bonus discipline when a shield is equipped (like dmg bonus with weps)... Shields give great AC and our job is mitigation so maybe this would be a viable route. I know everyone is used to 2-handers or duel wielding, but what do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we really need to do something about the sheer number of retards posting on that thread asking for totally rediculas if not useless AAs. i believe we should compile a list here of what we want to send in as well as things that we DONT want/need with reasons they are needed, as well as reasons for the stuff that's garbage. i (and i'm sure i'm not alone on this) would rather NOT get a bag of parlor tricks (endless quiver, war boar?!?!, pets/fimilars/etc) and focus on being tanks.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see how having them all would be overpowering anymore. Downtime shouldn't be challeging. If my bp effect drops I spend 10 seconds after mob is dead to redo it. Stupid imo. I can't see how clicking a 300hp buff mid battle would be overpowering. I'm never paid attn but I don't think that it gives you those hp. I thought it just added them to your max and you had to regen them (like sta buffs). If i'm wrong, ok change it to instaclick and change it so it's not like a 300hp heal.<br />
<br />
Sta to 355 is a good Idea along with dex, str, agi. Never understood why we didn't get that. Could have been 2 seperated skills 1 for Str and Dex, 1 for Sta and Agi. Lot more usefull then the waste of space like bind wound AAs.</div></div><hr />

  How silly is it for a group member to walk by while you're clicking a 12 second cast time spell after a mob dies and interupt me? I don't want to cast during battle at all, but I do want to not be annoyed by completely silly little inconveniences.</div></div><hr />

That's the reason you got clickies in the first place you know.  Asking for buffs all the time was inconvienent.  Being completely dependant on others is inconvenient.<br />
<br />
Now, getting interupted is inconvenient, so we need channeling.  How long before clicking the item is inconvenient and we should just get spell gems so that we can leave the gear in the bank?  Sounds ridiculous eh?  So does asking for channeling, yet here we are.</div></div><hr />

Well, healing will is just a step towards self CH then, isn't it? So is bind wounds? And heck, they gave us a blazing bracer of fennin ro with a clicky fire bolt, so we should be getting mana burn soon, right? All I want is to be able to click my little self buffs out of combat without a passing breeze stopping me. It isn't the path to the dark side; there is no need to be so melodramatic.</div></div><hr />

The point is that it's a slippery slope, and in case you haven't noticed, there isn't exactly a whole lot of rational thought stopping the fall at SoE anymore.  <br />

If you wanna make a tank mage tho, feel free to keep asking for it.  I'm sure your day will come.</div></div><hr />

 Uh, nope. Not what I'm looking for. I'm just all for removing worthless irritations in the game. All me being interrupted casting my shielding or call of sky does is waste another 10+ seconds so I can recast it. Important? Nope. Irritating? Yep. Step to becoming a warrior mage? WTF, not at all. I'm not asking for more spells, I'm not asking for combat casting, and I sure as hell don't want them. <br />

<br />
The only times I noticed I got interrupted with a clicky was if I was running and suddenly stopped and casted, I came to the conclusion that I had stopped on my screen but its possible that the second I started casting, I was not really totally stopped (lag spike?) thus the spell got interrupted because I was still moving somehow.<br />

<br />
Yeah, it has to do with server sync.  I found this out a long time ago on my first high level toon..my necro.  Basically stopping won't necessarily force the server to realize that you've stopped, but if you stop, then spin, the server will immediately find out that you've stopped, so what I used to do when I was kiting and the like was run, then as soon as I got where I wanted to cast, hit the cast button and start spinning around -- the spell would almost always go off.  <br />
<br />
In fact, it's that one thing alone that has prevented me from playing Hybrids.  I spent so much time on my necro when I first started playing the game that switching to any Hybrid, I'd instinctively start spinning whenever I cast something...which turned my back on whatever I was meleeing hehe.</div></div><hr />

This comes from levitating.  If you are levitating, people have the ability to push your character (there was an incident a while ago where people found an unpopular character afk in the bazaar...they levved him and pushed him into the arena, dotted him and forced him to lose exp).  If you are leving and somebody runs by you or bumps into you, you may get pushed a little bit (and therefore get &quot;your spell has been interrupted&quot;...this happens to me all the time in groups).  <br />
<br />
A channeling skill of 1 would be okay, I guess, but really I'd just prefer them fix the levi bug.</div></div><hr />

Frax's sarcasm definately hits the spot on AAs.  I personally think Warriors are Overpowered, but then again so is every god damn class in EQ.  Instead of asking for more, look at what Sony gave us so far, and ask that they fix/remove/change some of it.</div></div><hr />

Respect (Level 70)--mobs that con green will not attack you unless you attack them first.<br />

It has always bothered me that green crap 40 levels below me attacks me when it has absolutly no chance of winning.  It would be like a level 20 player walking up to Dain Frostreaver and starting something.  All it could do is annoy him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree with this earlier in the discussion:<br />
<br />
I know there is lore , just that it doesn't make sense why the gods in PoP now look like muppets in comparison.<br />
<br />
With the PoP expansion they invited us into the god's realms. Once there the gods themselves have nowhere to retreat, we are killing their actual forms, not their avatars, not their pretend-beings. No we killed the gods. Any expansion further has to weigh heavily on this point from any perspective of having any continuity in lore and yet what was GoD? Some invasion apparently. And the new expansion is going to continue this? This game is so far from dynamic it's untrue and so far from any believable story...<br />
<br />
So the end-game mob in GoD has to be higher lebel, has to be harder than then end game mob in PoP, otherwise there's no challenge for the top guilds. So WHY THE FUCK didn't that mob just kill our gods, destroy our powers and just utterly dominate our world? Because no one gave a damn about the next expansion when designing the one before.<br />
<br />
SO what is left to the developers in terms of lore? There are a few gods who have not been involved in PoP.... You remember Veeshan? Her claws caused the mountains in Velious or some such. She is the size of a continent or some such... <br />
<br />
So... there is Veeshan and some others I assume - I really wish I read more of the lore. Make Veeshan repel the invasion, screw the expansion (GoD) as merely ever forthcoming tropps  and the one to come as a bad mistake and get us back on track. Let us NEVER confront Veeshan and the true gods who would wipe their asses with us mere mortals and give us back opponents to kill who might just maybe one day challenge the gods' might if left unchecked. <br />
<br />
Make the multiple. Make them unmezzable. Make them need a real tank (warrior) and a heal chain of some kind per tank. Give them some real AI. <br />
<br />
Give us something new and don't tell us we are killing the gods because that just looks stupid. <br />
<br />
And why won't it happen? Because building new mob AI from the ground up is nigh on impossible given the ground already covered. So welcome to more mob dps, bigger AE's - in damage and range. Welcome to more levelling up, more need for better equipment, a greater need for more players - just as every guild is losing them to other games like a leaky fawcet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-----------------<br />
How about an AA that, for a relatively cheap price, gives us a pet...but before all the warriors roll thier eyes, not a pet like a pet class has. Something along the lines of a falcon, complete with cool graphic of it being called to the character's arm, and resting there or on the shoulder so it doesn't flap incessantly. The point of the thing would be to give you a bird's eye view of a zone, along the lines of Eye of Zom, or some such. Something you could use to scout around, but if you got too close, would agro a mob. You could fly it up out of reach, or around a corner, and have it be forgotten quickly. Just something interesting...not in any way overpowering, and sorta cool looking. You could do it with Falcon's, eagles, fire lizard looking things, vultures, etc. Should tick off a mob and get you in trouble if you are dumb enough to run it right back to you, but it should be easy to make the mob forget about it as being a minor irritation once it's out of sight or range. <br />
--------------------<br />
I cracked up reading that one ) Not only is the idea just silly, implementing it would be nearly impossible in eq =P. A pet would be cool though, so we can screw up mob positioning like other classes !</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should have 3 levels of effectiveness and would be passively activated everytime some some wizard, or shaman, or enchanter drew aggo. If that happened right after I positioned a mob for my mage friend's backstabbing pet, then a Critical Caster Spank would fire off. <br />
<br />
The AA would have a graphic of me reaching out and jack-slapping them, along with that wonderful yelp that female high-elves make when a mob smacks them.<br />
<br />
Failing the introduction of this AA, I'd just like to see the dev staff review the warrior's role in the game and enhance our ability to do that job.</div></div><hr />

ie: things go bad you can hit the Fortitude then Dimentional Slip and run like hell. the mob will  stay on the copy of you that is left behind while you run away. <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
it will alow you to use 2 discs at once. you hit reposte disc then dimentional slip and while your clone is reposting the mob this leaves you free to fellstrike.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
for some reasons you have to switch MT's you can Dimentional Slip out while the 2nd Tank goes in and waits for your clone to die.<br />

We wield big sharp metal weapons, right? How about an AA that gave us a percentage chance of killing a mob with a single blow. The percentage could be insanely small (0.5% per level with 4 levels, maybe). <br />
<br />
It seems reasonable to me that an overlord could kill one in every 50 mobs with a single blow. But maybe I watched Conan one too many times as a kid.</div></div><hr />

I dont understand why. There was a time where we didnt have AE-Taunt and we had to learn how to take over a mob without AE-Taunt if the first MT dies. In the old days you could see who has control over his aggro and who not.<br />
<br />
Now we have great things i dont wanna miss. Like the Incinte Aggro Dot. It was the right way to give us some controlled aggro instead of hoping for a proc. But i dont want to have a 100% single target aggro Button. I want to play a game and dont wanna be a Bot who presses buttons and always gets a 100% success.<br />
<br />
I like to see in next mission Pack AAs or Skills where you can raise your Buff Amount over 15 Buffs. <br />
<br />
Give every Class or Race a personal Trade Skill in which they have less Fails and faster Skill ups.<br />
<br />
Some Fun Skills like a personal DS which increases DS only if you have one on you.<br />
Like Aten Neck<br />
<br />
More Crits and random Crits.<br />
<br />
Large Quests which you can do single or with max one Group. It sucks to get 3 Groups for Breakdown Quest if you dont have much play time besides Raids.<br />
<br />
An Augment which only fits on Aid Grimmel. The Earring on Trial Nr. 7 in GoD is a /fuck you Tradeskillers.</div></div><hr />

I feel our aggro is basically good as is. Decent affordable aggro weapons for all, though I'd prefer they add some even lower level ones. Aggro augments are decent, though I'd also like an anger 1 to be added for very cheap for lower level players. The incite line is very effective, both immediately and over time. Taunt fails a bit more than I'd prefer, but I wouldn't want it improved above about 75% success rate on an even mob.</div></div><hr />

Another is that SoE seems to have no intrest in changing things that are clearly borked - I am so tired of Criting for the ocassional (1) or (15) that it's become an actual distraction.<br />
<br />
Finally there are waaaay too many Effects in the game right now on equipment. I saw a backpiece in Inktu'ta today that actually had more stuff on it than Shroud of Eternity.<br />
<br />
A good example of too many in game Effects is something I tacked on the end of a post intended to make fun of one of our brother eheh plate tanks. I wrote:<br />
<br />
Skeptic's Resistance 1, 2, 3 - reduces the damage a Warrior recieves from Magical Atacks 2% per level - not being a magic practitioner, Warriors are naturally less affected by Magical attack.<br />
<br />
It's actually not a bad idea and it's class consistant, but with Spellshield on equipment already, SoE doesn't leave a lot of room for such things.<br />
<br />
Cleave is another example. Obviously much better as an AA ability than an equipment effect.<br />

I really hope that's not the given reason warriors have innate magic resist, because that makes no sense, someone who isn't a practicioner of magic would logically be more susceptable to it's ill effects. I always thought we had innate magic resist because we were adverse warriors, honed to battle against a diverse selection of war parties. <br />

What happened last time he was attacked by a guy who pulled a knife ?<br />
<br />
Was he more susceptible to cuts cause he hates knives ?<br />
<br />
No.  He flew into a rage, picked up a chair, rushed the guy, rammed him against<br />
the edge of the stage, and with most of his weight on the guys arm holding the<br />
knife he turned the guys face into a bloody mess with a few right hands.<br />

<br />
<br />
Note : there is a difference between over reacting (being mentally affected) and being more/less phisically affected (domaged). I mean, it's not because your friend don't like knife, that a knife cut will be more/less dangerous for him.<br />
on the opposite, a boxer is so used to get punched that he become toughter and thus it's harder to land on him successfully a stuning blow.<br />
that what GranitMG was saying, a smither gets burned so often than his skin get less fragile to burns. samely, a magic user should know how to be more resistant to magic because he is used to get hit by it.<br />
on the opposite hand, somebody that never meet any kind of magic should be the easiest target for a magic caster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, something that saves on Fire or whatever isn't even necessarily magical in nature.  For example a fireball is probably magical, but there is nothing magical about a dragon breath fire.  That's a natural ability and you get hit with plain old real fire.  Maybe someone casting a hold-like spell can be negated by magic immunity, but how does not believing in magic have any effect if you're hold by say any variant of powerful, sticking root (ala root lines)?  If you don't believe the roots are really there, they'll just go away?  Then we should be able to damage to summoned mobs by just believing it's not there.  Actually, according to the lore, the Gods at least are sustained by their followers, so does that mean if you believe Rallos Zek isn't there he will take damage too?  <br />
<br />
At any rate, even having protection versus magic usually requires more than 'I don't think there's magic' even in the fantasy world.  Magic doesn't work on say golems by most lore, but it's not just because golems don't have much of intelligence.  It's because golems are made out of stuff that magic (or for that matter anything in general) is not likely to work on, i.e. stone, steel, etc.  You wouldn't expect throwing a fireball at a block of steel to do much good, so magic doesn't work on golems.  On the other hand, a zombie doesn't have much intelligence either, but that doesn't mean spells don't work on it.</div></div><hr />

The arguments are not convincing either way.<br />
<br />
I think the arguement would be more along the lines of knowledge about the spells makes one more immune to its effect.<br />
<br />
In your example, experience with previous casters using a cloud of acid allows you to know to move upwind or dodge the cloud by rolling underneath it. Or perhaps your experience with fireballs has given you knowledge that although they are indeed made of fire, they do not engulf the target directly and behave as a ball otherwise would, so you know that precise parry or use of your shield allows you to deflect it like a baseball.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing for or against it, warriors do have a natural class advantage to magical attacks, although it have been watered down to nearly worthless due to itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in EQ warrior have better resistance to magic because their are meant to be the primary tank, thus to recieve domage from the target, thus to be the more efficient in surviving these attack. going this way they have bigger HP, bigger AC to help versus physical attack, and bigger MR to help versus magic attack. they justed added a lore to it to justify it nicer, but it's heavily subjct to discussion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, Pig, I may have not been clear enougth so I will repaet again what I think, and developpe it even further.<br />
somebody that never meet any kind of magic should be the easiest target for a magic caster.<br />
1. so I will replace magic caster by magic attack, so that you won't ague around the difference of a caster and a proc or magical weapon.<br />
2. I said 'never meet', not 'never learned', so this state of been doesn't apply to somebody who have often been hit by magic (whatever the source). This is inplying that a warrior you are used to get magically hit will have a bigger MR that anotherone that don't.<br />
3. EQ make trivial the use of magic by caster : they copy a paper in their book and 'tadaaa' they can cast a new spell. and when they does they either success or miss, their never make any mistake that domage then partially. ex : the mage summon a fireball in his hand to throw it to his opponent, and 'oh shit' a beautifull girl pass by and catch his attention, his fireball (out of his control) fall on the floor turning his hand in a peace of coal...<br />
what I mean is that in every magic lore there is a part of 'control of dangerous magic' and since the caster is the closer (most often) and the cause of this 'upheaval of  magic's balance' he is the more likely to get hit by magic either because of a lost of control or by a feedback of the angry source of magic or whatever you want. so a caster should be at least aware of what enduring a magic domage is and thus having more resistance to it than somebody with less experience in getting magic domage.<br />
<br />
4. conclusion :<br />
I wnated to link the resistance to something to its history of multiple domage from it, not from it's theoritical experience. That's why I took all the exemple, like the smith (actually his skin get burn as everybody else, but it regen faster than someone you isn't used to get burned), the boxer (he doesn't get a stun immunity from know how to punch but from being punched a lot).<br />
But once again, all this discussion is pointless because it won't change anything to EQ,  neither will make SoE to change Lore.</div></div><hr />
