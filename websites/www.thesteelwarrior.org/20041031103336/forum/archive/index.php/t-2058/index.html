<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently using a Frosty in mainhand with a BCA in offhand. I've noticed a weapon called Lurid Dagger that has an ac debuff proc like the frosty. My question is, do you guys think that mainhanding this dagger with the frosty offhand would be better aggro than the frosty main with a BCA offhand:?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BCA = the biggest piece of crap ever.  Please get rid of it asap.  Lurid Dagger would be many times the taunt/dps vaule of the BCA.<br />
<br />
Reason I hate the BCA is becaue I bought one for kicks, to see how it panned out even in a regular PoV xp group.  Suck.  I used it for 45 minutes in my off hand and mixed in with primairy.  In off hand, it proced like 2x, in main, maybe 5x.  Hate is not resistable, but the DD is, the DD got resisted about 1/2 the time.<br />
<br />
Now keep in mind I wasn't testing the proc/agro of it, I was purely testing the proc rate.  Horrible, with a 280 dex and Celerity (/shudder grouping with 57 shamans!).  I would have expected more out of the dern thing.<br />
<br />
Then again, if you're level 36, or whatever the min level is, it might help you out with it.  Thouh I guess for 200 plat, you can't buy a better hate weapon.  I'd still have a bunch of other options instead of BCA.<br />
<br />
Ok, sorry, /hijack off.<br />
<br />
Dagger Main, FB off &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Frosty/BCA<br />
<br />
You get better speed of first combo, and AC debuffs piss mobs off.  Even if its resisted, procs still piss mobs off.  Even AC debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool, thanks for info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone have any first hand experience with the Lurid Dagger? Proc rate , etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lurid dagger procs fairly well. I only remember one or two fights where it didn't proc within the first 5-6 rounds of swinging for me. I normally switched it out after the first proc though, because I wouldn't see aggro jump again the subsequent times it procced. <br />
<br />
I also liked that not only did it debuff the mob, but it gave the AC to you. Made a great junk buff when you needed it. I used it when one of our druids fought Fay and it went of 6 times during the fight. Saved quite a few of my nice buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had a lurid dagger before the patch came in to nerf agro from 'tap' spells ( hp tap, ac tap, atk tap, etc ).  I remember the agro being much better before the nerf to 'tap' spells and after the nerf I remember the lurid dagger not holding agro as well as a frosty. <br />
<br />
Might want to run some tests... I don't have my dagger anymore though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lurid procs fairly well, personally I would consider offhanding it and mainhanding the Frosty.  Frosty proc &gt; Lurid proc for aggro from my experience but Lurid does proc at a decent rate.  Also, atk is higher with Frosty main (higher cap) although you may lose a lil dps due to delay differences.<br />
<br />
I used the Lurid dagger as my main aggro weapon until I got a Frostbringer and it served me very well.</div></div><hr />
