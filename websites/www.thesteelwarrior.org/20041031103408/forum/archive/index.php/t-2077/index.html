<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know where to find a weapon analyzer? I've been searching for almost an hour now, but all the links i'm finding are broken  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seneder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Weapon Analyzer? I'm not sure if I understand correct as to what your after; You can search weapons side by side at EQMaps.com then search Allakhazam's for more info on weaps that interest you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Copeland's Weapon Analyzer is woefully out of date now and would give nowhere near accurate numbers or even comparisons. I believe Luthair's is a little more accurate for comparisons, but still not *that* close.<br />

 Weapon Analyzer's just can not hold up to real parsing.</div></div><hr />

I think I know what he is referring to.<br />

Used to be a program called Copeland's Weapon Analyzer. Not a bad little piece actually. It allowed for class (melee types), level, base STR, Haste item, and what weapon(s) you wanted to see.  Gave you Weapon info, dmg, dly, max, mode, mean, and swings per minute. Showed you average damage per minute as well. Also gave you the ability to add weapons to the database. <br />
Alas, the last version I saw was 1.85. I think some of the damage factors for 2-handed weapons have changed, so it is no longer accurate.  Still, was a neat little program in all.<br />
