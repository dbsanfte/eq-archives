<br />
Harry Potter movies are closer to the books.  LotR has some major changes to key characters and plot lines that I don't like.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like both Xmen2 and Matrix2 alot. I would give the edge to Xmen2 just because it was more nostalgic for me I enjoy remembering the days when comic books were really important to me.<br />
<br />
LotR is hands down the answer to the 2nd question</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Matrix 2<br />
2. LotR<br />
<br />
I'm a huge Matrix fan (like so many others), so I absolutely loved it.  <br />
<br />
Finding Nemo, I took my 2 year old daughter to see it.  Well, didn't go so well.  The previews gave her some high anxiety, and then when the movie got to the first shot of the big shark, that was all she wrote.  That poor little girl was telling me 'Daddy, go go go go - home home'.  So, we left.<br />
<br />
At least we got to go to a movie together, that made it worth it.<br />
<br />
I'll rent it or buy it when it comes out, she'll love it then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harry Potter movies sucked a fat one. Of course like any film, they do the books no justice. Worst of all, the second move.. the end sequence was SO much more elaborate in the book. The movies way just made it look so cheesedick. &quot;Hey look, there's the sorting hat with a sword sticking out of it!&quot; C'cmon.. really could have elaborated the book ending a bit more. That awful ending just left a bad taste in your mouth as you leave the movie.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and read the books. You wont be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have read all LOTR / Harry Potter books (well halfway through the 800 page latest). I think they are both well written but each has its own ups and downs. Honestly, I couldnt pick a favorite between the two for a read. But, I would choose LoTR anyday for a movie over HP. Even with the major re-writes in the LoTR movies.<br />
<br />
Thumbs up Peter Jackson on a HUGE task of putting this story to film.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yea.. the first question. I would have to go with X-men2. Simply because I went in without any expectations and left thoroughly impressed. I thought it was actually better than the first one.<br />
<br />
Matrix2 on the other hand, I had huge expectations like everyone else. So, it was a bit of a disappointment. Some parts very very unnecissarily drawn out (love / rave scene). Ooo Morpheus dont fall off the top of the truck for the 10th time now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">X-2 went downhill fast after the opening sequence with Nightcrawler.  I was hoping the entire movie was going to be that good, but it wasn't.  I'd like to sneak into the beginning of the movie to see that again though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Old School     Still the best movie of the year (so far)<br />
<br />
As for the series, Rings, no contest.  Potter has stay ed close to the book but lost all the soul of the books.  Jackson has kept the soul of Tolkein's books but had the balls to make adaptations to story in order to make the whole thing work as a movie.  I'm trying to give Matrix 2 the benefit of the doubt since it really needs #3 to be complete but I was not impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've only seen 2 of the top ones national security and 2 fast 2 furious. i'd say national security was funnier but 2 fast 2 furious was better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">X2 all the way. The Nightcrawler scene was hot but I liked the whole movie, wasn't disappointed at all yet I had high expectations. Reloaded, hmm...many awesome scenes but to me there wasn't the syncrosity (woo let's make up words) between the music and the action that was in the original. Also like many sequels it seemed to be paying tribute to itself, don't much care for that.<br />
<br />
LotR vs. Harry Potter...I haven't read any Potter books but I do like both movies, both acted and produced well. Gotta give the edge to LotR though because it has swordfighting, most of it well done. Each of the characters have distinct fighting styles, most are accurate in that movements are simple, direct, and based on survival, not style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">X2 is the best movie I've seen this summer.  Better than 1st movie in my opinion.<br />
Matrix Reloaded disappointed me a bit, but I still liked it just for the (pointless if you can stop bullets and fly) fight scenes.<br />
<br />
LoTR has replaced Braveheart as my all time favorite movie(s).  Yes Peter Jackson changed some stuff, because he had to for it to be a good film.  And besides, I think I can live without Tom Bombadill and 800 pages of eating and walking. :)<br />
<br />
And let's face it, every fantasy RPG has borrowed from Tolkein, some of them extensively.  As I recall theres a halfling NPC in EQ with the last name Hobbitfriend.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget his other classic films, such as Dead or Alive, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">X2 on the first one (mighta given it to M2, except for the dance/orgy scene - what was the point in adding that scene??...I think it really devalued the whole movie)<br />
<br />
Lotr hands down on the second one.  I liked HP, but Lotr is a classic and it's great to see it finally made into a good movie!<br />
