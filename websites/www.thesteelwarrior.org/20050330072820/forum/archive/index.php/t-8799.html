<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellenial</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paludal cavern recondites seem to be overrun by the mid-teens who think a 24 warrior eats too much exp. The experience from the shik'nar and fiends seems to have started drying up. <br />
<br />
In addition, there are not a large number of people around my level on Tunare, so I'm looking for ideas on where to solo. I am moderately twinked with the best gear 1k pp could buy.<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead of time for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - 4 Orc Hill by Kelethin<br />
4 - 10 Crushbone &amp; BB  (got JBoots at lvl 8 so I could out run trouble from here on)<br />
10 - 16 Yard trash in Unrest  (this was tough to solo due to trains)<br />
16 - 24 Paludal Caverns  (very hard to single pull here)<br />
24 - 28 M. Seru  (Lightcrawler adds are a PITA and they outrun JBoots &amp; SoW)<br />
28 - 33 OT  (watch out for Dragoons, they get on your butt your dead)<br />
33 - ??  Gunthak  (I'm here soloing now, so far piece of cake, and real good XP.  It's about 35 - 40 Dk. Blue kills per level soloing.  Come by and say hello. I'll be relaxing on the beach. I've done 2 levels in about 5 - 6 hours or so...)<br />
<br />
Valerious Goldnite<br />
35 Warrier on Torvo<br />
<br />
p.s. Looking for a good Guild too...</div></div><hr />

Once there were dozens of players there, heh, and you could get groups at the Aviaks. You'll have 'em to yourself now.<br />
At about your level, for a normally geared warrior, you're going to start losing traction as a solo fighter. You'll be better off grouping when you can, and when you can't, then farm stuff. You'll level faster and have more plat.<br />
If you really want to solo for most of your career in EQ, a warrior is not the class you want to play.</div></div><hr />

you should be able to get to about 24 and they should get real slow...</div></div><hr />
