<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild spawned Garudon the veksar dragon last night -- which you do by camping the theater in veksar and looting 4 dragon bone shards and handing them in to some npc.<br />
<br />
He has a dracoliche model, a relatively small AE (100/tick dot I guess), is undead, is slowable, hits for 990 or so..<br />
<br />
..but has the hitbox of a willowwisp!<br />
<br />
I'm not kidding, this thing is almost unhittable. And you have to be in melee range to cast, so all the casters have trouble too.<br />
<br />
I was MT and completely lost aggro because I simply couldn't hit him. The moment he turned from me I couldn't locate his hitbox again and get aggro back consistently.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking this is a mob best tanked with a knight, since for the times the MT can find the hit box it's probably best to maximize aggro. Aside from the hitbox thing, I really don't think he's likely to be very hard.<br />
<br />
I think we also messed up our positioning -- wasn't really able to hit him until we had him bunched in a corner, but by then it was too late and we wiped. He proceeded to camp our corpses, and hadn't despawned for at least an hour after the wipeout.<br />
<br />
My guild is a fairly wimpy one with a fear of raiding, so after the one wipe over half the raid simply left. Didn't get a second shot.</div></div><hr />

Just info one of the guilds on my server gave on our msg board.<br />
Decent RvR loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brayle</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We dropped him and some of his friends after having them pulled on us by suprise. Three decently equipped groups should be able to do him given time to buff, our 23 nailed him with the few buffs we had on. I think we had one cleric, two druids and a couple palis making sure I didn't eat dirt.</div></div><hr />
