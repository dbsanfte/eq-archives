<br />
I quit playing Everquest back in November because I was sick and tired of the imbalance. Some friends told me about the some of the changes tho, so I'm reactivating my 65 warrior now to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if anyone could point me to a thread of place where I could get a complete listing of the changes that have been made to the warrior class. Maybe I just haven't looked in the right places, but I haven't been able to find anything like that on these boards or Sony's site.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
  I, and most other warriors, feel we're right where we should be.</div></div><hr />

Well, those are words that I never thought I'd hear spoken lol. Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if they could just figure out a way to let melees solo BoT named..... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about just allowing us to solo anything dark blue. :D <br />
<br />
With the incite line to allow a aggro over time effect and the ability to add anger procs to weaposn via LDoN adventure point spendings, increased proc rates for those anger causing procs via the Weapon Affinity line of GOD AAs, etc,  the ability to grab and hold aggro is much closer to where it needed to be than ever before.  I think that this was a primary concern and frustration for many of us warriors for a very long time, and these things have helped with that quite a bit.<br />
<br />
In addition, the previously mentioned splitting of disciplines over a couple of different lines is very nice since it allows you to use a couple of them back to back if you have the endurance to do so.  For example, say you are going to fight some big boss mob.  You can start out with and Incite for your aggro over time and then use Furious to offset the initial brunt of the attack while the mob is slowed and the heal chain gets started.  Once that wears off, you can then go right into defensive/evasive/stonewall.  This adds a new dimension that was never available before when all of the disciplines were all on the same timer.  You usually will not stack like that, but it is very nice to have it when needed.  You can also click off a discipline and start another if you ever should find the need.<br />
<br />
We still can't solo for squat, but they have provided some nice changes that make doing our job, which is tanking and holding aggro, a much more reasonable task...epecially the holding aggro part.</div></div><hr />

no, you just havent seen them for a while because their froglok wizard twink got boring and they couldnt get a guild due to the no frogs clause, so they've been leveling up their twink warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to say, I'm very pleasantly surprised. I logged back in to find myself still in my old guild with a raid starting, so I promptly got thrown back into the tank list with no hotkeys or anything set up lol. Anyway, I had zero aggro problems with incite. That and some of the new AAs (especially the +hp and weapon proc'ng ones), and the added warrior damage mitigation, are exactly what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
I never wanted to be a god over the knights, I just wanted to be able to do my job and do it right.<br />
<br />
Back in November during a long patch time I got in a conversation with Absor on the Sony boards. He was polite enough, and we talked for a few days through the forums. I had posted something about bug fixes and class balance. But, in the end, he told me that we would just have to agree to disagree because he didn't think classes were unbalanced.<br />
<br />
So that night I logged into EQ and got into one of those groups that I just couldn't keep aggro in no matter what, and it wasn't the group's fault. It was just one of those nights. I'm not uber-warrior or anything, but I was taunting away and using duel hate proc'ng weapons with anger augs on both of them, and we still had two group wipes from ping pong.<br />
<br />
I know some would say that peeps should be able to manage their aggro, and that's true, but there was a paladin in the group who was able to easily snap aggro from me when I lost it just by using one little stun. (Unfortunately she had crap hp and ac, so she died in a couple of rounds, but she COULD take aggro lol).<br />
<br />
Anyway I logged off EQ that night and never logged in again until yesterday. The paladin could hold aggro in that group with her little finger, and she had complete crap for gear, whereas I had put tons of hours into getting anger augs, better gear, hate proc'ng weapons, etc., just to watch my group wipe twice because I couldn't hold aggro. There was just something wrong with that, and if the devs weren't seeing it then I didnt' see any point in keeping on playing.<br />
<br />
So with that said, I'm happy Sony made the changes they did. EQ was actually fun again last night.<br />
