<br />
If that were to happen, do you think it would be worth holding on to that Shortblade of Lightning, Split Blade of Destruction, GSoT, WMBS and see what happens, instead of selling it now?</div></div><hr />

Other than the fact that the GSoT isn't worth much in the bazaar, I would sell the rest of those as soon as you get an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Just thought I saw a post somewhere by Absor about reviewing the PoP weapons yada yada yada. Giving him the slightest benefit of the doubt that it might happen (God knows weirder things have happened!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Improving (insert expansion name here) weaponry implies that they're going to go into the top zone and add 1 damage to certain weapons.  If you're an average joe, you aren't gonna get shit out of said improvement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think improving through PoP weaponry, by its self is no improvement at all even if they improve ALL pop weaponry.<br />
<br />
It does NOT address the balance issues warriors are having with knights(as they would benefit from these changes as well).  Although it COULD HELP balance out the melee caster issue(though unless the iprovements were truely staggering, more would need to be done here as well).<br />
<br />
No......inorder to balance melee/caster in general, some innate damage abilites are gonna have to improve.  Every melee is gonna have to go up a couple damage tables(even if new ones are gonna have to be created), the minimum damage you can put out on a single hit is gonna have to be increased, and disciplines are gonna have to be made useful instead of something that screw's the timer on defensive.  POssibley some NEW abilities added to melee as well.<br />
<br />
Now, NONE of the things I described in teh paragraph above would have a major impact on the balance issues with Kinghts.  SO, WHATEVER SOE does for melee in general, EXTRA modifications are gonna HAVE to be made to address the particular issue of Tank balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's only one &quot;high end&quot; warrior only weapon in PoP and that's Darkblade of the Warlord from PoTime. All of the other good warrior weapons also have Paladin, SK, and Ranger  or other classes listed on them (like BoWar, SEWS, Vanazir, and Edge of Eternity). You can't upgrade any of the other weapons because doing so would only be upgrading the other classes a warrior is out of balance with...</div></div><hr />
