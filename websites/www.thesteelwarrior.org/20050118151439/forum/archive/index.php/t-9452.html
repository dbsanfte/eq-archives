<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me that OoW generally is a tad too easy, at least compared to Txevu/Tacvi. <br />
<br />
The first 3 MPG raid trials we could easily beat on either the first or second attempt. Corruption+Tactics+Mind took some more attempts, but in reality once you learn them, any guild with Qvic access could probably beat them, its not gear but tactics that count on them.<br />
<br />
And the absurd thing is that IMO insano snake in Tacvi northwing is STILL harder than any of the 6 MPG raid trials. Its very illogical that there are encounters in Tacvi that are harder than the MPG trials, yet the MPG trials yield 50% more and statwise MUCH better loot pr kill, and also 2 very much needed level 70 runes.<br />
<br />
It also bothers me that entire guilds can now skip the progression and not do Zun or learn Tacvi. It should simply not be possible gearwise to beat MPG raid trials when you have skipped Txevu/Zun/Tacvi, or at least it should put you at a big disadvantage. Most of the class specific weapons are now trivialized by easily obtainable MPG trial loots. Hell, we had trouble selling the (for us new) mindreaper monk club because our monks have obviously already noticed that there are new much better easily attainable options for them out.<br />
<br />
So what should they do to fix this disparity in risk/reward? <br />
<br />
Well they could start by making Tacvi bosses drop 3 loots each. As mentioned earlier many of the class specific drops there are now triviallized by MPG loot, so they should start adding a third &quot;general purpose&quot; loot slot on each boss there. It should be usuable by many classes and slightly worse than MPG loot, but they should consider putting some more unique click effects there(which was the plan from the beginning as I understand). <br />
<br />
The reward for having learned Tacvi SHOULD at the very least be that you could use that zone for at least gearing new people up quickly, much like you previously could with PoTime. But thats not really possible atm I think. Raiding Tacvi requires every bit as much concentration/focus from the raid force as raiding MPG trials does(especially the north/south wing snakes), so its not &quot;relaxing&quot; raiding like PoTime was.<br />
<br />
And finally I want to mention that I do find the MPG raid trials to be some of the finest/most fun encounters I have tried recently. But they really need to fix up Tacvi a little, because otherwise it will become the End-Game zone that most quickly become abandoned in EQs history so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on almost every one of your points, and because of how Tacvi is now, i do think alot of the up and coming guilds are going to pull a &quot;Planes of Power&quot; like when they skipped Vex Thal and went straight to the elementals because Vex Thal sucked.  <br />
<br />
On that note, i know there are rumors abound at this point in time, but im really hoping Tunat somehow ties into the Oow storyline, and killing him becomes a necessity.  Its such a cool storyline, and it really would fit, since Tunat is supposedly some higher up in Mata Muram's army, and thats the same sorta vein we are in within Oow.  <br />
<br />
On Tacvi's loot table, i agree, make it 3 loot,  ala Plane of Time.  <br />
<br />
Overall i am very pleased with the direction that high end raiding in Oow seems to be taking in most cases, and even in Tacvi, we are moving onto encounters that require serious thought and skill more than numbers and gear.  However, i agree, we should need the gear  from Tacvi at least to an extent to help us win stuff in Oow.  <br />
<br />
Make it worth our while, give us a purpose to finishing the job so to speak in Tacvi.  Make it fun and a challenge but not ridiculous.  Keep doing what you are doing in Oow, just incorporate it a little bit into Tacvi and lets keep this refreshing high most of are on going for once, instead of the inevitable downfall when we hit the next roadblock.<br />
<br />
I dunno if anyone from Sony will read this but if you do, this is your chance man, you've struck gold so far in this expac, keep it going within the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets look back some...<br />
<br />
<br />
Velious; You used to have a choice of going to NToV/Kael for gearing up, OR you could go the sleeper's tomb path..<br />
<br />
Luclin; You could gear up on all the luclin encounters like ring of fire, burrower beast, ssra hp/xtc/cc, OR you could go the VT path<br />
<br />
In PoP there is no additional pathways for players to take to get to a final destination, theres not PoTime OR &lt;insert random zone here&gt;<br />
<br />
I think they should have just made 3 different end zones... You have 3 connections off of dranic's, that leaves way for extra zones and maybe 2 other hard to get to zones (since there is already Citadel of Anguish) Maybe i'm just blabbing /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my guild almost decided to &quot;Give up on Tacvi&quot; because :<br />
- Too hard<br />
- Obsolete Focus<br />
- Too little loot<br />
<br />
And we have just killed Goat x2.<br />
<br />
After getting royaly screwed by RZ in time (2 DB in 10 months of farming) and stopping.<br />
I was hoping to get a good shot at Tacvi. That wont happen. Sick of this shit<br />
<br />
PVP Trial on 2nd.<br />
Shape Shifter on 1st (no fire form before 10%)<br />
Mister 5K + AE  dead on 2nd.<br />
<br />
Dual Boss havent beaten yet gotten it to 50% in 2 tries<br />
Mad Feran should die tonight 2 tries last to 14%<br />
<br />
Simon says ... We have so many retards gonna be hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
OOW = Totally fucked up expansion.<br />
You can get 210/210 Quarm Clicky items with 1 priest / 1 caster / 1 rogue doing a 15 mins 1 group trial.<br />
<br />
While its nice overall, every passing minute i hate it even more.<br />
<br />
When GoD came out, i was happy having farmed the shit out of Time.<br />
Helped a LOT for KT / Ikkinz / Uqua.<br />
<br />
Now ? just grab 6 random people, make a 15 mins trial. Get 1 Quarm+ loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something needs to give here but I don't have any suggestions as to what.  The game has gotten to a point where I don't see how you can make stuff significantly harder as to slow progression but keep it beatable.

hell, even my stupid little warrior can zone into Dranik's Scar; snuggle up to the Priest of Discord, and forage all the stat food i need. <br />
<br />
y'all who plan to beat each and every new expansion in under a month; lemme say thank you.<br />
you keep us who don't have the time to see the game yet profit from what becomes mudflated from the last expansion well equipped.</div></div><hr />

Seems like OoW did exactly what I thought it would, so I'm quite happy with my decision to quit just a couple of days after it's release. The impression I have gotten from guildies is that it's damn fun stuff, but like mentioned here, the loot is too good and easy to come by... <br />
<br />
Oh, and I know of atleast 5 guilds that are in Anguish already, afaik 3 guilds gained access this Monday (Raging Fury and Darkwind both from Antonius Bayle did for sure with very short time inbetween atleast), and 2 others had access before.. Might be more, not 100% sure anymore since as I said, I quit! 5 guilds gaining access so fast to the final zone (and more guilds to come very soon for sure) is a bit too fast... Doubt they have more raidcontent to add anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

This is mudflation at it's best, I don't see how you guys are surprised.  Tacvi rewards with the exception of a few were always subpar for the difficulty.  10-15 more hp than Txevu or Inku'ta loot with no special or new mods.   You never had to progress past Qvic to really make any noticeable difference.  <br />
<br />
The real irritation is having an untuned zone for MONTHS, be it the snake, Tunat, or the easy ass Zun'Murams.  I feel for Triton, that was a huge slap in the face to them.</div></div><hr />

Grab 1 fat cleric, and 4 random people (totaly random since gear isnt an issue).<br />
Go Do a 15 minutes trial in MPG and here is the reward : http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70613<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">10-21-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread is a boarderline rant. I definitely foresee this as yet another casual vs uber thread. People are saying there's no reason for 200+hp gear to drop like candy; there's no reason why you should have such ill-will towards your fellow players that they are thrown a bone either.<br />
<br />
How many posters on this thread are also posting (or agree) that sub-gear players don't belong in MPG to begin with? Following that logic, only people who are close to this gear level belong getting it anyway, right? So you should still have no problems with it.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with casual folks crawling their way through a dungeon, especially considering most all the trials lay in a pathway filled with see-invis, level 70, hard hitting mobs, and completing themed trials that reward those actually working for some upgrades. After all, isn't that the popular attitude? People aren't willing to do some work to gear up? Well here it is, something rewarding those who put some work into gearing up, and what a shocker, still people bash it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why should the way someone else plays this game impact you in anyway.  So what, casual players can now get some nice HP/Stat gear.  Big deal...it doesnt effect your gaming experience any.  We have access to the same items...and still the more exclusive &quot;named&quot; items from locked zones, on top of this.<br />

Status/Shmatus...much ado about nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't make much sense to upgrade the GoD drops.  It's an expansion before OoW so the loots for raid content that SHOULD be more difficult SHOULD be better.<br />
<br />
What needs to be done is either MPG trials need to be harder or GoD needs to be easier so that things are linear as far as loot is concerned.<br />
<br />
Another thing I wanted to comment on I saw earlier in the thread was the thing about take the burrower/ssra/whatever path versus VT.  VT is the end zone of Lucling, the progression is right there, it is not a seperate path from Ssra.  You have to kill the emp to get into VT afterall and you have to raid lower raid targets to get to the emp aye?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">10-21-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd always been under the impression that GoD was inteded to be the post-PoP upper end game while OoW was more exp/quest oriented (read: nonraid).

<br />
Nor should people be able to get 100 AC worth of augs in an easy exp camp in a matter of a couple hours. Hell, during LDoN it would take a minimum of 19 hours doing nothing but hards to accumulate a mere 50 AC worth of augs. GoD took many hours of camps and raiding to get another 90 AC on top of what was available. And along comes OoW and anyone who puts out the effort in a gimped camp can score 100 AC in mere hours. It's jsut another example of OoW loot being too good for single-groups!<br />
<br />
And yet here you come, prouding displaying 4x Flameshield Stone in your Magelo. Irony much? So which is it? Are you happy that there's excellent loot across the board for people of every caliber of play, or do you hate people getting decent gear, and would happily trade away all your easy-to-camp AC augs?<br />
<br />
Me, I'm very happy for the single-group trials having gear at time quality. it means I can take a new app and go &quot;hey, join my group while we farm runes and loot the rotting shit!&quot; instead of trying to jump back into the time rotation that we forsook participating in months ago. Add qvic molds in on top, and you can have an app brought up to speed in a mere week. Some trials are indeed a little too forgiving in terms of healing/tanking required, but with the exception of sbuversion, the DPS required for these fights still requires time+ level equipment if you dont construct a ringer group. These trials are intended to be &quot;Ikkinz for level 70&quot; and if you consider the drops from Ikkinz and add 5 levels to them, they're not all that far off. People in full ornate and LDoN gear were beating Ikkinz trials for time-level loot. Where was your outrage then? The only difference is that Ikkinz was initially tuned for perfect time-level 65 groups only, then tuned down when there was an obvious problem with necessary class requirements to succeed there, while MPG trials were released already tuned to the general populace.<br />
<br />
As for the original post by Timmok, the MPG raids could probably use a small boost, but I think you underestimate the rift in average gear between even a qvic-geared guild and one that's been through most of Tacvi. I think the issue isnt so much that they're too easy, but that Tacvi loot has become unecessarily obsolete. Pretty much all encounters past Inktu'ta in GoD are unenjoyable. That alone will keep people over by the more innovative omens raids. They should boost Tacvi gear appropriately, given its difficulty compared to the Omens expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totall agree.<br />
<br />
After 400+ LDoN you estimate you have earned your augments,  and worked for them.<br />
Probably a bit too hard since there was no refund but, damn getting A3 felt good !<br />
<br />
4x20 AC (Ore thing) = 2 days camping (total of probably 15 hours).<br />
4x25 AC (Flameshield) = 4 days camping (total of 20 hours, 5 PH is crazy).<br />
<br />
Too easy, just like the rest of OOW. <br />

My Minor gripe.. I was hoping anguish would be Kinda like a PoTime setup with an A/B zone but go to zone into anguish.. &quot;you must bring more than 18 and no more than 54&quot; bleh. <br />
<br />
Unless Anguish Holds some real suprising, difficult and overall rewarding encounters that take more than a month to Master, OoW while definitely fun, will fall Somewhat Short of expectations =/</div></div><hr />

Numbers mean nothing.  54 people max, doable with less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, we just killed our first named in Anguish(Keldovan the Harrier), and in addition to normal loot/runes he dropped a &quot;Seal: Mastery of All&quot;. This is in addition to the 85% rule working in Anguish as well(you can bring 15% people that have completed signet quest but dont have the Seal). So this covers any backflagging issues very nicely, once a guild have 2 wins in all trials.<br />

So there is IMO no reason why some of the easier MPG raid trials couldnt get a bump up in difficulty, to match the nice rewards.</div></div><hr />

But you and I both know that it will never happen, so they need to consider what options/alternatives there are. Doing nothing basically means eradicating all the work some guilds have put into Txevu/Zun/Tacvi to get ahead, and saying that the &quot;new&quot; EQ game baseline gear are the 270-280HP drops from MPG trials, and we all start the &quot;race&quot; over again from there.<br />
<br />
I think its a joke that there are 9 guilds in Anguish already. This means the masses of skipped-txevu+zun+tacvi guilds cant be far behind. <br />
<br />
I also think its a joke we can take 40(14 less than max) people into Anguish, beat the first named on our _second_ attempt and get 3 uberloots, 2 ancient runes + a handy backflag seal. I would at least have expected us to need a day to discuss tactics on our board or something.<br />
<br />
But who knows, maybe this is all part of their master plan, making everything easy and letting everyone, even suckass guilds getting a taste of &quot;uberdom&quot; thus peaking EQ just before EQ2 gets released. Only problem is, when everyone can beat everything, then being #1 doesnt have a whole lot of meaning.<br />
<br />
I know this all might sound very elitist, but I think there are alot of people that enjoy solving encounters while at the same time being in a friendly server or cross-server competition about beating stuff first.</div></div><hr />

Timmok, I can totally agree with the feeling that some raid fights are too easy, and as such not too gear dependent.<br />
<br />
I can ever agree with making the trials 'strategically' harder so each class has to play better.<br />
<br />
What I strongly disagree with is turning those into Ikkinz 2.0 where skill of the player is absolutely useless and there is no tactics involved, and the only factor is how much dps/healing/tanking you can stack into your groups, meaning you are forced into certain group make ups.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, those encounters are hard, and gear is a huge help in those, but it doesn't make or break those encounters the way it did in Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz pre nerf, allowed people to farm the 3 named at zone in of the three trials in under an hour for 3 time+ quality loots, yet people stopped doing it soon enough, simply because merely assembling a group to do those trials was a herculean effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 Group Trials are an entirely different story from Raid encounters ( which is the current topic ). The 1 group are actually pretty balanced, albeit the Loot somewhat hefty for the effort</div></div><hr />

During the 1st time , we got our first fire pop at 5%.<br />
Ended up considering the even way too gimpish for its loot and flag.<br />
Second time ... didnt go as planned at all <br />
<br />
I really dont like the random part events. Xegony was fun and didnt change much.<br />
But getting TPed by a TR when you have been add tanking for 25 minutes sucks.<br />
Just like Getting Fire/Ice in chains.<br />
<br />
Beeing on European server, i have NFC if we have the beta version or the US.<br />
We had Beta Summoner Ring &amp; Beta Ikkinz for about a month and a half.<br />

So far i find &quot;Simon Says&quot; to be insanely hard, i know having a high % of retard is a killer.<br />

So with uber loot dropping non stop, ease to get. This attracts more and more players, giving a chance to all high end players. Instead of the same people winning over and over.<br />
<br />
Also with 100 100 shit dropping like shit. To allows people who arent in high end guilds to buy plat off IGE or some crap or to get high end items with easy. Since 100 100 items go for less then 50k now. Sony's master plan to attract alot of people, showing that loot is easy to get.<br />

One thing thats wrong is.. now with OOW, people farm sooo bad, can pretty much 2box, 3box a ton of mobs.<br />

Unless they are bringing out another expansion to be ready for, with uber uber raid stuff, with 400 400 loot. EQ wont last long at this rate.

*TOTALLY* agree<br />
<br />
Our guild isnt a guild full of retards, but the &quot;you must stand still&quot; message kills way too many people at once.<br />
<br />
For some reason our raid leaders decided simon says to be the first trial the guild attempts.  We tried it 4 separate times without winning because of the Stand Still messages killing people off slowly.  By the time the second of the six died, we were down to 30 people -- and with 30 people in simon says, that's practically a wipe right there.<br />
<br />
We finally moved to the ice/fire/power raid.  First attempt 45%, second attempt should be a win, definately by 3rd in my opinion.  Simon Says is like the single group trial of weaponry it seems =p</div></div><hr />

Yup, pretty much the reason I have not played at all lately even though my account is paid for another 6 months.  Each expansion of retarded mudflation, levels and new buffs kills off a lot of the game imo and makes it smaller. Same happened with PoP, difference was PoP took a long time to advance in so it could  effectively be an expansion where max levels could stay busy forever. Oow seems worse as everyone can go anywhere except for the last zone in the expansion already.  And it seems many have broken in, and we are one month in since Oow was released. The only reason I can see for this is like you said SOE want to purposely attract people to EQ2. Not too sure yet, will wait and see if if big nerf bat hits Oow soon.</div></div><hr />

You see folks bitch, then folks bitch about the bitch that they bitched about. Fact of the matter is SoE implemented fun raids that didn't require people to zerg it or need top notch gear to complete. Lotta folks wanted that, now they are complaining that the raids aren't hard. Remember GoD? How many raids were bugged to make them impossible? You hear all the bitching about &quot;fuck this raid&quot; &quot;Fuck sony for cockblocking&quot; and so forth. Now, once the raid was fixed to be working properly, how fast did the top end guilds beat it? the very next time they tried? Now, fast forward to OoW. Let's say that all the raids were actually now working like they should have. No broken raids to 'cockblock' the cream of the crop guilds. Are you suprised you are beating encounters after a few attempts? seriously, if they were bugged, you would be bitchin.<br />
<br />
With GoD, so many folks complained that the xp mobs were way too hard for xp you got, so they stayed in PoE or PoFire for xp since it was easier, the trials were too hard and needed the perfect group to complete which pissed off the non-needed classes, the raids were too hard or broken. Now we have complaining that the raids are too easy, the xp mobs are too easy, the epics are too easy, the trials are too easy. <br />
<br />
rofl, pick a gripe and quit complaining. As for pushing folks to EQ2, that's just plain stupid. You can not FORCE folks to play another game or lead them with carrots to it. Personally, I might check it out, but I'm not 100% interested in it. A lot of folks in my guild have said they are not willing to put years of time into EQ2 like thier EQ1 character and i'm not sure i am either. Fact is, most folks still like EQ1 and don't want to go to EQ2.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant, but seriously, just enjoy the game and quit complaining about every single thing about EQ just to try and rant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your comment is rather dumb because<br />
<br />
1) TRC 1.0 1.1 1.2 was UNKILLABLE<br />
2) Full Flag Inkkiz Trials was INSANELY STUPID<br />
3) Uqua 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5   was IMPOSSIBLE TO DO<br />
<br />
Do you think peopel enjoy this ? Here is a clue.<br />
<br />
My guild trained in Uqua 1.5 (last version before it was made killable).<br />
For 2 weeks, with wipe every day, knowing a patch would come.<br />
We never made it after the 1st oven thats with 10 clerics 7 wars &amp; some nifty DPS.<br />
One day Uqua 1.6 went live, we did wipe hard. The zone felt doable. And we did it.<br />
<br />
What did i like ? <br />
Time : VZ / TZ  / Inno (VZ was THE badass mofaka of Time)<br />
Uqua : Absolutely amazing zone and enjoyable once retuned.<br />
Inktuta (absolutely amazing events, all of them, they are not hard)<br />
Specially Noqfiel  (Once you have the leet idea its doable, before that its a nightmare)<br />
Txevu (not as good as inktuta but some really nice scripts)<br />
<br />
What i hated ? TRC Xegony Coirnav (because of ther underwater lag only).<br />
<br />
People want hard &amp; doable events, with good loot.<br />
So far i am unhappy with OOW events (exept the PVP one which i ADORE, /BOW to SoE).<br />
<br />
Its not bitching its asking for something we pay for.</div></div><hr />

LDoN becomes obsolete thanks to augs from rs and mpg, potime and god become obsolete thanks to mpg single group and raid trials and new spell focuses.  There's a huge landslide of ridiculously easy obtainable loot all around, for everyone from the gimps to the uber.  end result?  in game mechanics become unbalanced, mudflation occurs yet again, and most importantly, more and more and more zones basically become unused trash.  Guilds on Saryrn that were working on Uqua/Inktu`ta pre-OoW now spend their raid nights in RS, MPG, Dranik city, and WoS clearing nameds and working on raid trials.  Why?  Why the hell would you go through the agonizing pain of High Priest in Txevu, or learning uqua and inktuta, when you can just farm the shit outta gimp crap like king/queen/chalaik/feratha, WoS mini's, Dranik city zun, and the easier mpg trials?

if they wanna apologize maybe they should adjust / fix whatever tacvi in regards to risk / reward, aka 4 loots per mob and those loots better be comparable with mpg trials, and not slap epic 2.0 components on tunat to force guilds to raid it</div></div><hr />

Bit late for that... I don't know about other guilds, but mine has no desire to kill Zun or raid Tacvi any more. They already made a Natimbi portal straight to Qvic for the guilds that are just now gaining access. That's enough of a slap in the face, no need to give them more love that they didn't give the guilds that spent months in Qvic-Tacvi without changes and now have moved on.</div></div><hr />

The AE was increased to 6k from 4500 too.  It is more easily resisted now though.</div></div><hr />

Not that I guess the populace would mind buying them for 10 mill each, but uhhh seems a little out of whack.<br />
<br />
I've seen broken links of the same augments with the no drop and solvent tag but no stats, so I'm assuming it's another database error.</div></div><hr />

Aye :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Changed from 4500-6k and changed aoe from hatelist to pbaoe.<br />
<br />
Still looking at a net negative 550 resist check after you factor in the pre aoe's.<br />

For example Cataclysm of Stone and Fulmination for a long while can be resisted with negative resists (after factoring in resist mod).  Not saying that's what happened since my guild still has lockout but it's certainly a possibility.</div></div><hr />

change hatelist to PBAE and 6k dmg just makes the event more sucks !</div></div><hr />

It was hard definitely, but still doable. Clot probably has a bunch of parses too :P  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

It tends to be much more relaxing (which is what I want to do when playing a GAME) then shifting from crying to anger over untested / broken / retarded content and progression blocks. Couldn't agree more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our guild isnt a guild full of retards, but the &quot;you must stand still&quot; message kills way too many people at once.<br />
<br />
For some reason our raid leaders decided simon says to be the first trial the guild attempts.  We tried it 4 separate times without winning because of the Stand Still messages killing people off slowly.  By the time the second of the six died, we were down to 30 people -- and with 30 people in simon says, that's practically a wipe right there.<br />
<br />
We finally moved to the ice/fire/power raid.  First attempt 45%, second attempt should be a win, definately by 3rd in my opinion.  Simon Says is like the single group trial of weaponry it seems =p<br />
<br />
<br />
ice/fire/power is weighted too heavily on luck.  We did it last night and got fire/ice/fire/ice/fire/ice/golem.  Easiest so far has been the 4k aoe guy.<br />
Hardest has been &quot;Simon says&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The encounter is based entirely on luck. If you get &quot;Fire&quot; mob only once, you can almost guarantee a win. If &quot;Fire&quot; mob pops more than three or so times, winning is near impossible. <br />
<br />
Either: <br />
 - make the DoT reasonably curable<br />
 - change the DoT<br />
 - modify / standardize the morph cycle<br />
 - get rid of the damn &quot;Fire&quot; mob<br />
<br />
Any of these fixes would make the trial at least Fair.</div></div><hr />
