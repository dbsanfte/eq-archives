<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corllon</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hit 52, and exp is going very, very slow in LDoN and PoJ -- Is it just the exp slowing down as I get up in levels, or should I be moving to a different zone? PoI possibly? My hp and ac unbuffed are at ~3500 / 1150 if that helps tell what I can tank.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FWIW it may seem slow to you now, but in PoP/LDoN you can do the 50's way quicker than you could in Sebilis / Karnors etc</div></div><hr />

Its slow but its something you just have to work through... but make sure you farm Naggy/Vox before you hit 53 :p</div></div><hr />

PLed my chanter and BST there and exp slowed way down after 51.<br />
Would still stay there 'til 54, exp will still be better than what you get in other places (old world) and it will be quite hard to get groups in other 1st tier PoP zones (in general on my server and especially as &quot;only&quot; 52 tank).<br />
<br />
If you Bring Your Own Group, you can try (tsetsian?) flies in PoD (hug left wall, circle to the right around the water .. pretty close to GY). They are better exp than POJ and not as hard hitting as the other PoD/PoN/PoI MoBs. That should be viable exp 52-54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can tank PoI entrance np.  I started doing it at 54 with similar gear and was totally fine.  The best XP I was seeing at 53-54 was PoI entrance.  PoJ caves were also good.  PoD flies are also good, but I think PoI is better.  Both of those spots will be slightly faster than LDoN or PoJ exit types mobs.  It just seems to me like those levels are slow, although they are cruising compared to my first char I went through them with through Kunark/Velious era.  I find PoI and PoD pretty boring though, the PoJ caves are a bit more interesting to me, and LDoN is even better.  Yes, LDoN is a bit slower, but not significantly so, and the chance for augs and points is good.  It just depends on what you like...  if you want your xp bar to go fast then try PoI, especially if you've got your own group.  If you like dungeon crawling do LDoN.  If you want to try some different areas, hit Veksar, xp there is comparable to the other spots and there are some nice gear drops although most won't be upgrades for you, you'll make some nice pp.  You can also hit Nurga which has some nice drops as well with decent xp also.  Veksar and Nurga won't compare to PoP, but in my opinion they are much more enjoyable zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoI goes as fast as the 40's outside KC, but it's harder to find pickup groups there than it is at PoJ exit.</div></div><hr />
