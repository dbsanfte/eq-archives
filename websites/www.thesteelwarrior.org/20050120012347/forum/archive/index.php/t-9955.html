<br />
Which weapon has the better aggro capabilities?<br />
<br />
According to lucy, we know that the DBoW has a unkown70 value also known as the procratemod of 30 . Where as the Fleshbiter has no procratemod listed at this time.  Logically, this would make the DBoW proc more and considering the Anger proc has an aggro modifier of 600 opposed to the 400 from the stun proc of the fleshbiter, it would make it the more convenient choice.<br />
<br />
However, I wield a Fleshbiter. I have Max offensive AAs.  And I do not loose aggro on raids, and quite honestly my Fleshbiter procs as much as the DBoW.  I have not been able to parse this yet but I am fairly confident on my assumption from just watching other warriors.<br />
<br />
So, the question is.  Is the Fleshbiter procratemod not up to date? Or is mysterious stun aggro not 400 as determined before?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're shooting yourself in the foot :P, go parse it, the DBoW will come out on top for procs. Also Anger has a stun component and 100dd which adds even more hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3624&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Thats the stats for the proc. There is 650 hate + 100 dd + stun. Using the guestimate agro values puts. <br />
<br />
100dd*75%=75 hate<br />
Stun = something like 500 hate(this puts it better then anger 2 less then anger 3 as most people believe that is truth)<br />
650 pure hate<br />
<br />
so 650+75+500= 1225 hate per proc. <br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5544 is proc on fleshbitter<br />
<br />
Stun=500 hate <br />
125dd= 80 or so hate.<br />
<br />
580 total hate for blesh bitter.<br />
<br />
In procs that is about half as much hate generation. The only way I could see this being argued would be the DMG/DLY of DBOTWL vs Fleshbitter causing agro but the difference is also marginal at best. 38/35 vs 34/30. DBOTWL=Ratio: 0.921 Fleshbiter=Ratio: 0.882 so .04 difference in ratio I do not believe would account for a loss of 700 hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
from theese thread we can positively say that FB's proc isn't 400 as standard stun otherwise it wouldn't be such a decent weapon (on par with DBotW). but nevertheless, DBotW is still above FB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least give the FB a procratemod.  By the way the brutish blade of balance does not have a procrate mod either.<br />
<br />
I will probably just wait for the BBoB since like I said, my aggro is fine at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pure conjecture ... go out and parse and you will see the difference ... it might be hard to notice without a parser these days with augments and WA5 ... with as man procs as are firing constantly, i imagine it would get easy to lose track etc.<br />
<br />
IMO DBoTWL would come out on top pure aggro wise by a decent margin.  FB is more dps and a strong substitute.   I don't think the dps aggro would make up for the lesser proc (by how much nobody really knows) and the lack of proc mod.<br />
<br />
Mini BoW &gt; Elf shoe<br />
<br />
An easy test would be to have 2 warriors with max aa ... one with elf shoe and one with DB go whack on a mob for 20 mins or more with the same augments (or unaugmented) and an offhanded shield.   Pretty sure the DB would win hands down each time with earlier/more frequent procs of greater str.</div></div><hr />

When we tank trash mobs, its impossible for either of us to peel off another purely from procs until we use taunt.<br />
<br />
Logically, DBoW is better at snap aggro, but then again I don't loose aggro at beginnings of encounters either.  I am sticking with the FB until the DBoW goes rot which should be next kill.  <br />
<br />
Brutish Blade of Balance is where the love is at.  WTB procratemod for that item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny.  Everyone who doesn't have a FB will tell you how much inferior it is compared to the DBoW through mathematical reasoning.  Theoretically, it should be.  However, everyone who does use a FB (and the amount of warriors who do aren't that much overall) will tell you that it's right up there with the Darkblade.  <br />
<br />
I don't have an FB.  I too vain to ever wield an elf shoe.  Logic tells me though that since all the Ikkinz/Uqua class weapons are equal, if not better, than their Time counterparts, the FB should be right up there with the Darkblade as well.  If the FB was that much inferior to the Darkblade, than it probably wouldn't be Primary only. ;)</div></div><hr />

Personally, I would take whichever I could get first.  I have yet to see a DBoW drop for my guild, and I have been with them since July, Been raiding Time since Sept.  RZ simply will not cough up a DBoW for us.  On the other hand, we have had a FB drop in about 6 loot kills in Ugua, maybe more kills not sure.  In any case 1&gt;0 at this point.<br />

<br />
It's small stuff tho.I'm sure A FB is just fine for tanking.It won't win a hate calculation contest imo,but, it will be good enough to compete well on fast dying targets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys have really good luck with DBoWs because the last 12 times my pal has killed RZtW in Time it hasn't dropped.  Probably a bit better but harder to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, one of the raiding bodies on my server has had (what seems like) a DBotW drop just about every week.  Just about any warrior that has had a significant playtime with them has one &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Having started to raid with them as of late, the only nice thing about it is that I can go full bore with my aggro weapon setup and never have to worry about making the mob even twitch in my direction for aggro.<br />
<br />
I imagine the Fleshbiter was put in to allow the warriors that missed out on Time (or simply had bad luck, since my normal raiding body hasn't seen a single DBotW drop yet) to have a more superior aggro weapon then an EoE or somesuch.<br />
<br />
My best guess (though that probably won't be known until I see a parse) is that the BBoB at least is equal to DBotW when factoring in its much higher dps aggro coupled with the proc.<br />
<br />
To date, (unless something in Anguish pops out that is significantly better) I'm guessing your best mainhanders will be DBotW or BBoB with your best offhanders being either Epic 2.0 (or if you don't do epics) Thunderclap? &lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rydeon</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The proc on the fleshbiter singularly is greater aggro then a single proc from a DB, its by far greater then the aggro from anger 3 augments. My roomate is always my group mate we both 3 box, he plays wiz/rog/shm I play war/brd/clr.  After xping together for countless hours with multiple setups he equates 3 anger3 procs to 1 magic pulse proc for determining how hard he can go at it.  The darkblade does have the distinct advantage of more overall procs however its hardly a break factor with all other things considered.  IMO Go for whichever one you can get~</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're 9/29 right now for DBoWs, which makes all raiding warriors but 2 with FBs have DBoWs, and one with both! We went 15 or so kills without a DBoW(around what you guys did?), then they started dropped around 2/3 of the time.  :p <br />
<br />
DBoW is no doubt better aggro than FB. I have a FB because I was too impatient to wait for my turn and the DBoW would have been 100dkp(about 20+ raids), FB was 1dkp.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to know how that is greater aggro then DBotW's +600Hate AND stun + DD</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if FB proc would be equal to other stun +DD proc, FB would be far below EoE and JOS so I have to admit that FB's proc must have a specific hate value which is deferent than usual stun's hate. Well indeed pal stuns have two (or three?) hate value depending of their line of spells, and if I remember correctly the longest stun (10s) was like 900 hate. so maybe that static blow (which is unique to FB) has a specific hate builds in that gets close to it.<br />
Indeed, if the stun's part of static blow is 900 hate it makes FB almost as good as DBotW (would be in third position after BBoB and DBotW); while at 700 hate from stun it decrease below epic2.0 and BF.<br />
<br />
FB is really the exception of all standards ...</div></div><hr />

All stuns causes equal amount of hate, doesn't matter how long time it's supposed to stun a mob. The differance lie in that some of the stuns paladins get have DD components as well.</div></div><hr />

While it doesnt have a proc mod like Darkblade i believe that there is a set amount of hate in the proc whether the stun lands or not. I have one and raid mobs will turn on me (stun never lands) if i proc a few times in a row. That tells me that not only the stun causes agro but the proc alone has a set hate generation.</div></div><hr />

That isnt the case for the Fleshbiter, not even remotely true, the aggro on it would be shit if it were and I can promise you its far from it ;)  Personally I love the biter and wouldnt trade it for a DB...and Im on Firiona Vie and could purchase a DB if I desired to do as much.</div></div><hr />
