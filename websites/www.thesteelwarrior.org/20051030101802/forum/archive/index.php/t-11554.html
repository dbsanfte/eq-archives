<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that 95% of the paladins in this game are absolutely utter horse shit players is the only thing saving this class from total invulnerability to anything and everything.  I PvP'd with one for over 6 fucking minutes today...bandaged 4 times, used 3 heal pots.  By the end of that time, he was in the same exact state he was when I found him...full health, half mana.  <br />
<br />
The fact that mana regens in combat while health doesn't is utter fucking crap.  I have 4559HP and when that's gone, that's fucking it.  I killed this bastard 7 times over and it doesn't fucking matter because he can just heal up to full and then not cast for a little while and he's back at square one.<br />
<br />
Got any nifty items to help you out, like really sticky glue?  Yeah, doesn't fuckin matter...Cleanse takes care of that.  I'd actually be fine with cleanse if their goddamned divine aura didn't remove all effects.  The fact that I can burn 75 rage sundering and have it all stripped away TWICE every 5 minutes means there's not a fucking thing you can do against them.  Sunder them up so your DPS has a chance, and you're just pissing rage away.<br />
<br />
SOMETHING needs to fucking go.  Either they need to go down to mail, or DA needs to not remove all fucking effects, or cleanse needs a timer.  I don't care what it is, but currently, if you have someone who knows what the fuck they're doing, you CAN NOT do a fucking thing to them 1 on 1.</div></div><hr />

I find it impossible to beat a paladin 1v1--unless I time my cuncussion blow supremely well (which I have not managed yet). <br />
<br />
I ignore paladins in PVP, they aren't worth my effort. Best thing I can do is beat on someone he is grouped with to try and get him healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont forget they can cast their DA while silenced too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During this fight, he got a critical 1700 heal from a potion.  Umm, okay.  Do Olympic atheletes obtain more protein from a meal than regular slobs?  Then why the fuck do people with mana gain the ability to get a critical effect off a potion?  It's a goddamned heal in a can for christs sake, and somehow they can get MORE out of their can than I.<br />
<br />
That bullshit needs to change too.  It's the same goddamned potion I have.  Either make them crit for all, or crit for no one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than  that, thier really freakin hard, if thier gona nerf anything should be mana and armor! they regenerate mana so fast that the hardly lose it all in pvp... <br />
<br />
I have never pvped, one because i am alliacnce but thier just a real pain with thier seals, heals, and cures! <br />
<br />
I think that we should all email blizzard saying about pallys!<br />
<br />
So far only thing i have found good about them, is 1v1 and group heal, other than that when they fight 2-3 players they get ganked so fast! WOOO to bad i can't since u cant do group duels, we did it in arena though in STV lol wooo....</div></div><hr />

clearly you must be doing something wrong. it's not that hard.</div></div><hr />

I agree, even ZsGohan can kill pallies.  Whats up with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suck a big one in duels against just about every class, especially Paly's.  Yet for some reason, I seem to do quite well in open PvP against most classes barring ganking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no low blows please.<br />
I know this is the outhouse, but that's going too far.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw you can crit on potions too.<br />
<br />
oh and just btw, so he can have mana regeneration in combat he's giving up on DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh and warlocks kill paladins easily. please don't nerf them.</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna have to call bullshit on this one.  When I see a level 60 pally charge solo into the middle of Xroads and take down 6 people  before he even starts to loose health, and that's just on his first life he's got 4 more to go mind you, then the DPS thing is horse shit.  I realize they don't have the DPS of a rogue, but a rogue doesn't have a mana pool, plate, or god mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont forget the free mount, and thems rolling on valor!~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and as an aside, and I'm not sure how many more times I gotta say this, Duels =/= PvP.  Shut the fuck up, kthx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They can have some helacious DPS, especially if they sacrifice mana with warrior gear, a big slow 2H like a reaper.  It all depends on Seal of Command, which procs at a set rate that ignores weapon speed.  It procs an instant attack chance on hit that does Holy damage, but is like hitting twice.  Slower weapons proc at a higher rate per attack because its based on procs per miinute instead of percentage per attack.  <br />
<br />
The problem with this build is luck.  A paladin has to get lucky with the procs and crits, where as a MS warrior can MS consistantly and just needs crit luck.  So a Paly built like this might all of a sudden pump out tons of damage at once, like weapon attack crit and a SoC proc and crit in the same way a warrior might crit an attack plus MS.  This particular build is difficult to duel, because they have enough healing in one fight to keep up with the 3-4 lives and do comparable damage to you as a warrior.  Since you will both be trying to stay in melee range, chances are SoC is gong to proc on you.  Their weakness come out in open PvP though, as a lack of mana means this build is useless healing anyone but themselves, they still cannot catch anything, and when they do get close, they need luck on their side for the proc.</div></div><hr />
