<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'll be going to SoE over June 4th-6th for the meeting they're having about EverQuest.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is what's most important to you guys. So, give me some notes to take with me :)<br />
<br />
Bullet-Form is preferred, and I do need a short explanation of what you're saying (just in case).<br />
<br />
edit: Need Class-suggestions also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  Fix the collision bugs (and the 5/25 patch was a big step in the wrong direction for the collision system  ;) )<br />
<br />
2.  Keep the non-uber raider in mind in new expansions - namely, don't limit access to 40% of the expansion to the uber crowd.  I'm fine with having 1 or 2 limited access zones, but not the 40+% they did for PoP and GoD.<br />
<br />
3.  Allow us to sell back ldon items.  Even if we don't get full points back, at least half would be great.  One of the reasons I don't do that much ldon is I hate the fact that all of the points will be wasted when I get an upgrade.<br />
<br />
4.  No pets for warriors!   :p   Seriously though...I don't have any class concerns unless they start beefing up knights.  (in which case, they need to also give us balancing changes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Fix the collision bugs that all classes are suffering equally from.<br />
<br />
2. Keep the warrior in mind as the premier raid tank when tweaking the melee classes. Paladins and Shadowknights should certainly be able to absorb damage for most groups, but they shouldn't be able to it as well as a warrior.<br />
<br />
3. How about a message when a kick/bash lands for a stun?<br />
<br />
4. How about some new content for levels 20 - 50? LDoN was the last attempt at that, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a re-roll option for everyone that thinks the other class has it better?<br />
<br />
on a serious note, have casters have items with lots more mana and not a whole lot more hps then currently<br />
have more tanking imporvments for the three tank classes and dps/utility be the focus on the others (ie armour should not have same hp from type to type.) increasing the gap between the tanks and all others hp/ac wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only issue I have is does taunt above warrior cap actually do anything or is it hardcoded to stop improving after the warrior max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Peircing cap.<br />
<br />
Upgrade path for us 65/non-uber that is not 30+ LDoNs to get one peice, does not involve having 71 close friends so that you can take the game to the next level. Frankly I would love to do the PoP content as intended--raid style, epecially as someone who capped 50 before RoK and enjoys being high end and uber--but RL does not allow me that option.<br />
<br />
Nor can I commit to a guild that raids 5 times a week. <br />
<br />
Basically GoD broke the faith with me. Its an expantion that was advertized as accessable to the 65 crowd when in fact they mean the EP folks. <br />
<br />
It would also be really nice to be able to find groups with my alts. Really the play options on Kailyn are BoT, PoTac, or LDoN and anyone who is not 65 its LDoN  and one or 2 other possible zones. <br />
<br />
At this point I would say the world of EQ is TOO big--and too small in some ways too. Devs should really look at balancing XP/rewards in others zones as the most popular ones...BoT, PoStorms, etc.<br />
<br />
EDIT to add: LDoN medium woudl be nice too. Something that is harder than the SolB 65/normal setting and easier than the 65/hard Elemntal Planes setting. <br />
<br />
Has EQ really lost so many players that there are only 4 of us who care what you say to the devs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Basically tell them to re-release GOD but this time do it right.  Basically what I mean is re-design the whole expansion.  We can all agree that it needs it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aside from what has already been mentioned here, I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
1) Another AA/skill/disc to give us taunt.  Something like Improved Hastened Instigation, or a shorter-reuse no-fail single-target taunt.<br />
<br />
2) Taunt to work with a larger Z-axis difference, or longer range overall (I can imagine myself shouting at somebody standing up a flight of stairs).  <br />
<br />
3) If we get a &quot;your target is too far away to taunt&quot;, the skill is not usable for another 6 seconds.  Make it so its instantly reusable if the skill check is never even made.<br />
<br />
4) This is more of a want, and not a class specific issue, but something I'd like to see nonetheless:  A revamped LDoN<br />
a. new level of LDoN that is even harder (maybe insane?).  Mobs like an ikkinz trial, with more points and better loot<br />
b. more ldon loot, maybe a 2k point bracket, with higher augs maybe?<br />
c. THE ABILITY TO SELL BACK AUGS AND GEAR!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would like to see our sturdy and end regen reduced in price and moved to a sooner expansion no later than PoP.<br />
<br />
Mabey something that adds a bit of versitilty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Basically tell them to re-release GOD but this time do it right. Basically what I mean is re-design the whole expansion. We can all agree that it needs it.<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Don't you know that a lot of people actually enjoy GoD now? Ok uqua was a piece of shit that should have never been so broken, but pretty much anything else is quite well tuned now.<br />
You do not HAVE to say GoD is a piece of shit just because you think it makes you look cool, I'm really tired of people who say that kind of things just because hating SoE is the trend now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Has EQ really lost so many players that there are only 4 of us who care what you say to the devs?<br />
<br />
Maybe that's just because reasonable people think warrior are in quite a good state now and that we don't really need anything.<br />
And concerning the game in itself (collision, etc), everything that has to be said has already been said by a lot of people anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I couldn't agree more strongly with Throag.  GoD is a GREAT expansion so far, with only a few shortcomings.   Primarily having to do with a lack of mob model variety and aethetics, and some loot ridiculousness, best summed up in Ikkinz raids with 2 words:  Darkglint Blade.   It's the very first &quot;uncockblockable&quot; expansion where people succeed or fail based solely on their own merits and not upon the behaviours of others.  Encounters are interesting and well thought out, and require more than press autoattack and AFK.  <br />
<br />
If they weren't all a bunch of golems or anemic elves, it'd be even better, but as it stands, GoD has some great content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was not really thinking there were class concerns that we wanted addressed at the meeting, but certainly player conserns. While there is a chance I might know whoever is going from Povar--but that my 65/non-EP views would be far more likely to be voiced by my class rep (or Woody, where I have already posted) than by someone from on of the uber guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For me the primary issues are:<br />
<br />
1) Bugs. The main one being the collision system with mobs being pushed through walls. This causes the mob to be unhittable my melee and tanks being sent to the safe point at zone in after being summoned. <br />
<br />
2) Ldon augments. Basically every warrrior has to have Anger 3 if he wants to get maximum aggro. I have purchased Anger 3, 3 times now and the next time I upgrade a weapon I will have to buy it again. I would love for Sony to work out some system where we get something back. (I think a good idea would be to have the choice of destroying an augment or the weapon when removing an augment from an item. They can roleplay it as the removal process is unstable and both the weapon and augment cannot be saved)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">*- Fix the DX9 system, dont scrap it<br />
<br />
*- Add more abilitys to melee combat for EVERYONE, including knights  ;) <br />
<br />
*- Increase the spawn rate of flagging mobs, the challenge should be beating the monsters and the tactics needed, not beating guild_01 to it(which has become harder because of Euro guilds playing on the same server, if you bring this up use the Euro guild time differance as justification) no reason to have the road blocks caused by 3 day - week long spawns, even worse with the cockblock opertunitys, i say this in referance to GoD and PoP<br />
<br />
*- When the put out OoW(not a fix, but i know they will ask what we want) how about new models, i dont care how many times they retexture the PoN werewolfs, and PoN spiders, nothing makes a player feel better than seeing a new, unique monster and i beleave there should be more of them, and less clones, cause you know green and tan army men are boring, give us models not new paint, god knows we are not amazed by tinting since the advent of armor dyes<br />
<br />
Anyhow good luck and enjoy the trip!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It has already been said but it is also great concern for me as a new job has cut me from raiding al together now.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Keep the non-uber raider in mind in new expansions - namely, don't limit access to 40% of the expansion to the uber crowd. I'm fine with having 1 or 2 limited access zones, but not the 40+% they did for PoP and GoD. Bottom line, more high end single group encounters.<br />
<br />
2. Fix the collision bugs.<br />
<br />
3. Allow us to sell back ldon items. Even if we don't get full points back, getting any of the points back would be nice. Or allow an LDoN Tribute character so that you can exchange LDoN loot or Augs (that you won't use) for a few points. It is aweful to watch augs rot b/c nobody wants or needs them.<br />
<br />
4. New item images for our toons... Why haven't they put in a Circlet image or Masks? I am sure these could be done, and it would be nice to see something look new on the PCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BTW read the SoE boards, this is a no-class-issues summit, it is a state of the game meeting where they meet to discuss how to refresh the game and make it a bit more fun.<br />
<br />
So since it is topical stuff they want id like to add<br />
<br />
*- more options for self buffs such as invis and gate, many players suffer pains from the lack of these items<br />
<br />
*- more illuison(sp) items to help with bumping my head, faction is a moot point nowdays<br />
<br />
*- i know many people dont care about this, but how about about making the entire race playing field more level by removing all the penaltys, and give all of them ultavision, I could never play a human because of how damn blind they were, and i dont want to have to whitewash my screen just to see while im on a human toon, it is a shame more people play a race that can see in the dark then a race they really want to roleplay as</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What gerick said. Thanks for the class suggestions though :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">heh i made an edit on what i said, damn your quick :D<br />
<br />
ooh, LDoN is a very topical thing i think MANY would love to be changed, i think what everyone needs to stress at the summit is less timesink, more skill or challenge based progression, it should be about taking down uber mob A, not having a case of bawls or jolt on hand to wait it out for 3 days.<br />
<br />
like to add<br />
<br />
*- capes! new armor graphics that resemble formal plate/ware( have a few items, no ac or stats, that are player crafted that give the character a fancy shirt/pants or gives the player a dress suit of armor that is engraved that they had for partys back in the period, who else would love to have a tux for that wedding :P)<br />
<br />
Mostly I'd throw out as many ideas as you can raaj, but stress the important ones first so they get said before they turn off your mic(not saying that will happen as long as your nice to em)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wait, if they are inviting the board owners, does this mean yantis has 3 or 4 passes he will end up putting on PA?  :D   :eek:<br />
<br />
edit: oh my god it is a trap! they are gona gang rape yantis!  :p<br />
<br />
since this isnt warrior balance doesnt it need to be put in the tavern?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">1:  REPEAL DX9:  it is broke, it does not work.  Collision issues, warping issues, LD issues, client crash issues, and to top it off, for many of us it greatly increased lag.  Return things to the old graphic engine, keep working at dx9, test completely, and reimplement it when you have it working right.<br />
2:  More for 65+ non raiders to do.  My non raid friends all have about the same complaint...after 65 and so many AA's, there is just no point any more.  No new challenges for them that do not involve joining a large raid guild.<br />
3:  Fully instince Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Repealing it is ok as long as they intend to put it back in I know alot of people that have become more stable since the change, but I also know just as many that are unable to play(like my brother for example)<br />
<br />
it needs to be done right, I needed to clarify why I said dont scrap it, on the sony boards alot of people want to roll back every patch to go back.<br />
<br />
reasons why it probibly wont be turned back<br />
<br />
*- all the tweeks and fixes to GoD would all be turned back, the patchs are intermingled so a roll back would mean alot more than just Dx9 going<br />
<br />
*- sony is uses the new engine for the new effects coming with OoW, so that is gona be in so they can put out OoW on time.<br />
<br />
Raaj take a personal battery operated fan<br />
<br />
its hot in hell  ;) (just wondering, are they providing food for the event, as well as hotel and all that kick ass stuff?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">And a padre's game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Okay, class changes being nixed, I still like the LDoN revamp.  Gives people something to grind with.  Maybe look at the ldon raids as well, giving them god instance status (can add/remove people).<br />
<br />
Fix collision (duh).<br />
<br />
Fix the virtual flags in PoP.  Maybe add to the raid interface something pertaining to virtual flags.<br />
<br />
Maybe make time instances like GoD instances, a la lockout.  As more and more guilds get time flagged, there will be more competition for time, and it will become a bottleneck.  Since time gear is necessary to be successful in GoD (which is instancing), this bottleneck is unfounded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No.<br />
<br />
Don't you know that a lot of people actually enjoy GoD now? Ok uqua was a piece of shit that should have never been so broken, but pretty much anything else is quite well tuned now.<br />
You do not HAVE to say GoD is a piece of shit just because you think it makes you look cool, I'm really tired of people who say that kind of things just because hating SoE is the trend now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said in my post that GOD was a peice of shit,  I never said I hated SOE.  All I said that GOD does need serious work.  It was advertise as an expansion for the 65 crowd and not the elemental and time crowd like it is now.  All I want them to do is make the expansion like it was advertise so I can do more than putz around in Natimbi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Add a Z-axis to the game that actually works.<br />
<br />
 Revamp quests and old zones so there are reasons to go to the original to Velious zones. Add experience modifiers, increase items to actually be worth looting and so on.<br />
<br />
 Add additional melee skills (IE the opening system, only better) so that it's not just auto attack and leave. Tie them to endurance or make them similar to kick/slam, but add SOMETHING. Even a cumulative -5 atk kick damage attack on the kick/slam timer would be nifty. They don't have to be powerful, just vaguely useful.<br />
<br />
 Add the ability to soul bind some armor and weapons to make traveling for a CR easier for non-casters (and casters too, but hey).<br />
<br />
 Add low and mid level raid content, so the game isn't just a rush to get to 65 for raiding. If EQ is all about raiding, then make EQ a raiding progression from start to finish.<br />
<br />
 Add more GMs and guides at ALL times. There should never, ever be an 8+ hour delay for help. Perhaps just add a volunteer advisor position that can answer some questions. Simply adding something like a toggle &quot;Advisor&quot; that works similar to LFG would work wonders for sorting out some of the inevitable noob questions that surely clog up the petitions.<br />
<br />
  Add ranged attacks to more mobs. Don't stop kiting, but it should be more limited and summoning has always been a ridiculous cop out.<br />
<br />
  Improve mob variation and AI. Mobs should have variation that they just don't have. Nukers shouldn't just nuke while running forward to melee, and frankly casters shouldn't hit as hard as the other mobs. Bard mobs should play AE mob hp/mana/attack. Warriors should have significantly more hp, but do less damage. Ranged mobs should try, at least somewhat, to stay at a distance. Melee mobs should taunt and lock the taunted player onto them for a little bit. Monk mobs should pull characters.<br />
<br />
  If mob classes actually matter, add an AA or something to show the mob class.<br />
<br />
  Add /stick. It'd be nice to always be facing the mob.<br />
<br />
  Instance more zones. If VT, for example, was instanced even like Time, people wouldn't have to worry about raiding for 8+ hours in a single day to avoid losing their mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I would like to see lower difficulty LDoN raids. Currently, they are not accesible to a casual guild, even when LDoN is aimed more to the casual player, Im in a family guild and sometimes it would be neat to have an instanced raid in case our main target was taken out already or we lack the numbers :)<br />
<br />
Highlighting LDoN augs... I have Anger auged weapons banked, that I dont use.... I would like to at least get some points as reimburse for the Anger augs... I already have to grind for my armor :(<br />
<br />
No fancy new graphics please, if I wanted that, I would go to a newer game and pay for a $600 video card... since I cant, I dont want to quit EQ because I need a 256Mb card because they decided they needed to add detailed boxers to player models :p People already lag to hell trying out the Forgotten Halls, with all the &quot;new and improved&quot; rat models.... I dont care if Hill giants are square, they are The Hill Giants I grew up with, they are simple, they work great, what do you wanna change em for? .<br />
Keep making graphics heavier, people actually cares if the rats look like RL ones *rolls eyes in sarcasm*....<br />
<br />
I rather get instanced events, quest and all that, and not new graphics at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">More armor textures! One of the things I loved about release EQ was all the different armor looks. With the Lucilin models there is not a lot a variation in texture. <br />
<br />
More looks would be nice. Option to have helmet graphics turned off. (I shoudl have an invis helmet, but unless they fixed it, barb NRo plate hats are visible.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">That was what im talkin about kailyn<br />
<br />
Everyone should have more choices then 6 suits(noob, cloth, chain,leather,plate, robe)<br />
<br />
could be as easy to toggle as faces, or it could be based of item AC(such as high AC would be thick and bulky) or effects(bp with thorns effect having spikes) or difficulty to attain(elemental and time armor having engraved armor, or armor with particals/glow maps &lt;think of the golems in GoD if you need to know what glow maps are, they glow in the dark, fade in light&gt;)<br />
<br />
none of that would really make it slower, load it once like the rest of the armor and your good to go, they just have to keep the textures to the same size and format(which they would have to unless they made a massive change to the .nifs&lt;the character mesh that is packed into the character render files&gt;)<br />
<br />
guess this goes back to me wanting more monster/player varity&lt;sp&gt; outside of tinting armor pink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Gerick, when I said to repeal dx9, I did not mean for good, just untill they have it working.  In the long run, it will be a good thing, but as it currently is, it has seriously negativly impacted mine and many others gameplay.  SoE failed to test it properly, and in trying to fix it, are frequently making things worse.<br />
<br />
*- all the tweeks and fixes to GoD would all be turned back, the patchs are intermingled so a roll back would mean alot more than just Dx9 going <br />
<br />
I am not a programmer, so I may be wrong in this, but I do not believe that is the case.  They should, I believe, be able to roll back the graphic engine without undoing all those other things.  Needless to say, if in fact they cannot rollback dx9 without changing them things, then it would simply not be worth doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The way sony does their patchs as far as i can tell from eq emu is it is sort of like Windows update, except instead of launching small fixes to differnt things in self contained files, the lauch service packs monthly that are all packed togeather, they could get the code to keep the changes and repeal the Dx9 but they would have to gut 4 or 5 patchs and that could take alot of time to do properly, and if the servers themselves are running dx9 i dont think you can remove it from the server, so it might slow it down by going backwords compatable, there are some hacking tools you can use to peal directx9 off you rig but nothing offical.<br />
<br />
if the repeal it while they fix it that is more than fine with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">1. Get some damn customer service.  I pay per month for this game and the last thing I want is to wait 2 months to get an item that was ninja'd back to a guildie.  It's completely unacceptable for SoE to have such subpar customer service.  I was blown away when I tried a few other games and their CS responded within 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
2. Do not put out unfinished expansions, and actually TEST things before they go in.  Listen to your beta testers and don't blow them off.  Putting out GoD prematurely (yes it had a bundle of problems when it went in) is not a good move to make.  It gives the impression that SoE is about $$$$.  Yes there are some good parts about GoD but it should have been much better before it was released.<br />
<br />
3. Develop LDoN and consider putting in more instances, with some that allow 2 groups for instanced &quot;mini&quot; raids.  Use the GoD-style 'lockout' deal to ensure that these instances can't be farmed too much.  Have the bosses of these &quot;mini&quot; raids drop a very large variety of things (ala Cursed) instead of one or two boring things like in GoD.  Allow these 'mini' raids to be &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; with normal being designed for VT/high-LDoN players and hard being designed for high EP/Time geared players.<br />
<br />
4. Fully instance Time.<br />
<br />
5. Fix the cornering and collision problems that have been going on for MONTHS.  Your excuses are getting tiresome and old.<br />
<br />
I am a borderline player with about a 90% chance to go to WoW when it comes out.  I'd love to see some innovative things included in EQ that would keep me playing, but quite frankly it'll probably be the piss poor customer service that eventually drives me off.  We never get anything new included in patches (except for that midlevel zone), we don't get any 'freebies' except for an occasional bug fix.    Where are the GM events, where are the unique and rare drops that make you stand out in the crowd?  I want a title, or a goal, something to work toward, something innovative.  Stop using us as guinea pigs for Eq2 and put in the ability to buy a house in original EQ.  Make it expensive so that I have a reason to go farm plat (twinks bore me).  Give us frills like different types of hats and capes that we can quest/pay for, and the ability to turn our existing headgear into something with a unique graphic (headband or pointed cap).  Give us frills, give us goals, and give us some customer service.<br />
<br />
edit: Many people have pointed out the fact that there are a LOT of underutilized zones in EQ.  Veksar and revamped Droga and CT were a hit, some great items came out of there.  I'd love to see a few more zones revamped (or added within) with an eye toward raiders.   For example, adding a raid-only zone off Kael designed for EP-geared raiders with its own little backstory (discovered by an enterprising young giant through a tunnel near the arena etc) and several difficult named that are a fair challenge with a varied loot table.  Give us revamped or added zones within the original, Kunark and Velious expansions.  These zones already have flavor.... not like the GoD zones that are brown, bland, filled with tumbleweeds and lag.  Give us interesting NPCs that don't just stand around and spam you with text, give us NPCs that interact with each other like in Thurgadin.  A lot of the NPCs lately are just NPs...  they have zero &quot;character.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also give us quests to personalize our characters, perhaps one to change our title to 'General' or whatever.  Let us personalize our horses by allowing us to turn them in for different colors.  Give us frills and give us revamps.  Give us goals.  The SoE carrot I'm looking at right now is old, crusty and moldy and I have no interest in eating it, much less chasing it....</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Insure that Knight have a raid add tanking role that they can excell at so profoundly that add tanking is a viable option to mezzing. Insure Paladin heals and SK mob debuffs are sacaled to raid content and provide them with the versatility a spellbook is supposed to give them.<br />
<br />
on to other issues:<br />
<br />
2. A combination of cornering problems, mobs buried in the floor or walls, etc. and content difficulty is frustrating many mid-high level guilds. There is a feeling that IF SoE played fair, progress would be greater. There is a difference between having to play intellegently and requiring 10 Clerics, 5 Warriors, and absolutely perfect play difficult to achieve in a laggy graphically broken environment. Coming out of PoP into GoD content is almost universally frustrating and relatively unrewarding at all guild progress levels. Guilds are not quiting enmasse because they are having fun.<br />

Actually, you DO have some choices here (I couldnt resist posting)...<br />
<br />
a. Form some raid alliances with larger guilds on your server, to do the bigger zones and become good friends with the leaders and officers. Several guilds do that with our guild (I am not the main tank, obviously) and there are a few we really like and have given gear to.<br />
<br />
b. Since I havent seen your gear, I cant say for certain, but some LDON gear in the right slots has to work for you, especially the hard ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Needed to add - improve itemization from LDoN onward. There are two basic problems. Firstly, those players like Kailyn (4909HP's unbuffed), and many of the PoN posters see themselves as uber and since they are unable to compete (they have more in common with level 60's than 65's) they ask for innane things like Defensive/Evasive (something that has been in the game for four years and has been always perfect in achieving the desired result) to have less effect in the game either by giving it to Knights or removing it from Warriors. With improved itemization, they would perhaps understand that gear=progress.<br />
<br />
Secondly, small loot tables result in decreasing the replay value far too quickly for guild raids. Darkglint Blade #13 encourages guilds to move forward and not linger in content, yet content with escalating difficultly means guilds can hit brick walls where they can not aquire items which might allow them to progress.<br />
<br />
If the game is not made &quot;easier&quot; as suggested above, then progress tiers need to be strengthened. Perhaps 8 person raids being required to complete quests to allow players to reach level 70 and 75 and level requirements of level 70 and/or 75 to enter progression zones. As it is now, anyone can reach level 65 and truly believe they ought to be able to compete. Failing to be able to compete, some want to change long-established game mechanics.<br />

<br />
I would say they need to do this from PoP onward.  For someone not raiding there is one upgrade path in PoP, ornate.  That is exactly one set of drops from one zone, period.  Not acceptable, insufficient, lame as hell.  Secondly, as much as I know people are going to howl about it, they really need to look at the point values required for some of, perhaps not all, but some of the gear available for points in LDoN.  Five to ten missions should be allowing you some kind of reasonable upgrade, not 30 missions or more per piece.  LDoN is repeative as hell as it is, most of the zones barring some superficial texture differences are pretty much like most of the others. <br />

While I realize you were probably trying to be helpful and supportive, if you really consider these  viable and reasonable options for the majority of casual players, then you're really not in touch.  Raid alliances are a serious PITA to pull off, not something you do on a spur of the moment.  They tend to be fraught with drama and loot greed where someone somewhere is trying to stack the deck in such a was as they get the pick of the gear.  Can it be done?  Sure, but you're almost better off for the commitment involved just going ahead and joining an already established raiding guild. <br />
<br />
FFA LDON raids?  Every single FFA raid I've ever been at or heard about has been a magnet for all the server losers, loot whores, incompetents, griefers, and just plain idiots.  I imagine that from time to time they work, if you have iron fisted leadership that mircro manages every aspect, but I bet they're far from common.  And again, you're almost better off for the commitment involved just going ahead and joining an already established raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Why exactly do you think raiding guilds have enjoyed the popularity they have over guild alliances and FFA raids anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Glatius,<br />
<br />
As an aside - I have been quite struck to note Kael has been empty on my server for the last several days. I've been soloing the arena area to gear up my twinks and nobody is there - no one else in the zone. I've gotten about a dozen drops in 6 hours.<br />
<br />
This makes me wonder if things like the Ornate drops and opening up PoP zones have made places like Kael, PoN (I'm foraging bow staves there, and it's always empty), and ToV no longer desireable places to farm. Or if players have gotten so spoiled they don't farm ANYTHING anymore and expect SoE to give them a cheat code.<br />
<br />
I'm frankly shocked to see level 65 players with 4909 HP's (heck, sub-7200 HP's is not good at all) and can only suppose this is achievable by not doing content that exists and provides upgrades. If this is the case, SoE might as well give up now - the instant gratifiaction crowd wants too much.<br />
<br />
With a level limit of 65, players in all states of preparedness to do advanced content have piled up at 65 and a bunch of them think that having reached 65, they should be able to do that advanced content. A level cap of 75 is coming about 2 expansions to late IMO.<br />
<br />
Either SoE nerfs content so unready level 65's can do advanced content, enriches loot tables and doubles LDoN Adventure Points awarded for success so they can gear up more easily and do it, or stratifies the game even more so that they understand they will likely never do it. I think that's the major tension in the game right now.<br />
<br />
Things that must be fixed ---<br />
1. Graphic bugs. These have scuttled inummerous raids and made sucessful raids a LOT harder.<br />
<br />
2. Progress for many is so glacially slow that they see no reason to log into the game. Four hours of gameplay with next to 0 reward is by definition unrewarding.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">1. Fix the collision issues.<br />
<br />
2. If they really are making some LDoN armor that can be purchased from all camps with combined points this is a step in the right direction. Make armor upgrades that are obtainable by non top 1% of the players. I do not mind putting in the time for the gear but becuase of a real life work schedule cannot play 5 nights a week so no uber guild for me. <br />
<br />
3. You want people to stop buying plat stop nerfing the money camps. Sebillis bugs is first example I can think of.<br />
<br />
4. To get old world content to be used make all mobs of same level give the same experinece. No modifiers for new zones. This will spead out the options to level in different places.<br />
<br />
5. Make an LDoN raid that is on par for normal (family) guilds to try. Too many times the upper guilds have the  numbers and timing to get to the rare spawn mobs before anyone else. Hats off to them they have the time to do this but give all players a chance to instance a mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why I suggested revamping some of these older zones and adding new loot tables.  It would be nice to have somewhere to gear up other than PoP.<br />
<br />
As an aside, SoE should consider revamping the flag system.  Allowing players to loot nodrop &quot;tokens&quot; off a (30-minute) corpse to turn into the lady in PoK might help prevent the terrible poofing of the PP as 3 of your late-coming guildies are running to try and hail it.

<br />
Cultural armor or some of the drops coming out of places like veksar (sp) are equal to or superior to most Velious armor short of NToV drops, and even those are only slightly better.  No one spends much time in Kael or HoT anymore because the RVR just isn't there.  By the time you can take the giants on in the kael arena these days, you've outgrown what they drop.<br />

I think that's the major tension in the game right now.<br />
<br />
Yes, I mostly agree with that summation.  SoE needs to either narrow the gap between the casual and the uber player, or make it clear that this isn't going to happen so an informed casual player can decide if the game as it stands to day is worth it to them.  They can't keep making content targetted at the uber player and claiming it's for everyone.  It isn't, and we know it.  And while the uber player really doesn't want their efforts devalued, the bottom line is the game is becoming way over stratified.  The difference between a casual player and an uber one is like night and day.  For example, an uber Warrior will have something in the neighborhood of 4-5k more HP than me, and probably close to double my AC.  That's far greater than the difference between an uber Ranger and an uber Warrior, isn't it?  Hell, it's probably greater than the difference between an uber Enchanter and an uber Warrior.</div></div><hr />

I would like to keep that around the same level.  All this talk about knight wanting defensive or a fast refresh weaponshield will eliminate that 1 percent.  It will only make it where warriors are never an asset to a group.<br />
<br />
The other thing that worries me (and should worry Sk's) is with OOW they are making 3 new stuns that stun up to level 70 and one that stuns to level 75 mobs.  I think 70 is a bit too high.  I think 68 is more reasonable and level 75 will make them the best single group tank period.  At least that is how I see it.  I have better AC/HP than a lot of Paladins I know, but they take far less damage on average in zones that have all or most of the mobs stunable (if they bother to chain stun while tanking.)</div></div><hr />

From Grumbuk (SoE dev):<br />
The walled/cornered NPC bug was the direct result of the client and server having two different values for the radius that is used for the collision sphere. This collision sphere is what is used as the basis for where an NPC and player can move. One of the things that changed with the DX9 engine was the introduction of data structures specifically designed to track collision states. The old engine didn't have this. These data structures will (and have) allowed us to make optimizations that the old engine simply couldn't support because it didn't have any concept of persistent collision data; everything was based on the scale of the model and that's it. Anyways, in these data structures the new engine had the collision size set at one point, then the model was scaled, and the bug is that the collision sphere was not also scaled on the server because the server doesn't actually load the model data so it has nothing to scale.. This caused NPCs to have a collision radius of 1.2 on the server for instance where cazic thule in potime on the client was using 4.7 or so. The server would think the NPC is properly cornered but the clients would all think it was on the opposite side of the wall causing a bunch of bugs you all know about by now. Once the collision sizes were synchronized these problems went away. This was also part of the problem with pathing for very small NPCs (the spiders in podisease for instance) because they were constantly getting stuck in the ground due to having a collision sphere on the server *larger* than what the client was using.<br />
<br />
On a related note, in the old engine NPCs were actually prevented from going through walls by something unrelated to collision checks of spheres and triangles. It was just doing a point check in legal space, which caused NPCs to be pushable exactly halfway in the wall which made the target point for archery subject to numerical precision errors. And the old collision code had numerous precision errors (one of the many things we just couldn't bring ourselve to port to DX9). In the new engine, it does a proper collision check of the sphere for the NPC against the zone geometry and being halfway in the wall shouldn't occur any more from a mathematical standpoint and this should permanently solve a lot of not-fun archery and other line of sight problems. Animation wise, NPCs will continue to have parts of their body penetrating whatever is nearby, but the collision sphere which is used for all visibility checks and whatnot is definitely kept outside the wall. <br />
<br />
Changing the system from something with many inaccuracies that worked only due to CPU intensive redundant safety checks (ie point check in legal space) to something mathematically accurate that doesn't need additional methods to validate behavior is one of the reasons why the new system is better than the old one. It has also made the behavior much more strict which is a large part of why there have been so many &quot;getting stuck&quot; bugs. The system depends on everything always being in a legal state. This isn't always possible however, and I've had to find and correct each possible condition that could put a player &quot;legally&quot; in the position of overlapping geometry. Such as when a door closes on a player; this now has special code to allow the door to be partially disregarded when this happens.. Anyways, it's all very complicated, much more complicated than I think anyone here expected it to become, but I do feel we are nearly done. The remaining bugs - while frustrating to the players for sure - are at least approachable with known solutions (unlike the hard to reproduce stuff we've been dealing with lately) and it's just a matter of getting to them as fast as possible. Once those are taken care of the system will be ready for some very interesting new features that only a properly engineered collision system can support. How exactly we plan to extend it is not something I want to get into yet, right now we need to stay focused on making what we have now work correctly. We're pretty close, I think.<br />
<br />
At any rate, we'll be patching the live servers as soon as we are confident these fixes are in fact fixes so for a few more days you can expect the behavior on live servers to remain the same.</div></div><hr />

Content that exists and provides upgrades comes in three flavors for the casual player - LDoN, single group permacamped targets, and raid targets that require more force than most casuals have access to. Yes, us casuals are painfully aware that we're second class citizens in EQ, but the current design of EQ points towards either us changing our entire lifestyle to 'beat' EQ or for us to accept that as it stands, we won't be doing large raid content. Or, well, for us to not bother logging on.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Raaj, here's my list, in no particular order:<br />
<br />
1) Allow sellback of LDoN armor/augs. Give us half credit so we don't have to eat points every time we want to upgrade at the least.<br />
<br />
2) I'd ask for more content for casual 65's, but that's a non-starter.<br />
<br />
3) Fix DX9. If you can't fix it quickly, yank it.<br />
<br />
4) An open statement to Sony: YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY. Gutting everything to maximize profit has led to EQ becoming a snake filled cesspit, you greedy so and so's. Invest some of your profit you make off me and everyone else and give us GM's on all the servers again. Give us CS people that understand how the game works so they can resolve our problems. DON'T give us a two week waiting period for someone to contact us in broken English about something they don't intend to fix.<br />
<br />
5) NO new expansions. Revamp Antonica/Erudin/Kunark/Velious instead. It's well overdue.<br />
<br />
6) Enforce your damned policies. Or, if you're not going to, scrap the entire damned EULA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Actually, you DO have some choices here (I couldnt resist posting)...<br />
<br />
a. Form some raid alliances with larger guilds on your server, to do the bigger zones and become good friends with the leaders and officers. Several guilds do that with our guild (I am not the main tank, obviously) and there are a few we really like and have given gear to.<br />
<br />
b. Since I havent seen your gear, I cant say for certain, but some LDON gear in the right slots has to work for you, especially the hard ones.<br />
<br />
c. Organize FFA LDON raids. Hella hard, but nice gear and everyone gets points so its a win-win.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Well, you've got some good ideas, in theory.  Here's the problem.<br />
<br />
A) Most people that play this game are fucking idiots and I can't stand them.  You don't have to like my assessment of the situation, but it is my assessment and I stand by it.  Just because you're in full time gear doesn't mean you know what you're doing, other than typing in /assist Warrior01 and turning on autoattack for phat loots.<br />
<br />
B) LDoN would be an upgrade for me, you are right about that.  However, it's fucking pointless.  I spend the next 3 years farming points to buy gear, and then farm points to augment it to be better than my current gear?  No fucking thanks, that's VERY retarded.  Some people enjoy LDoN.  More power to them.  I for one, don't consider it &quot;Progression&quot; since you aren't doing anything.  You're not accomplishing shit, you're just farming points.  After you get your anger 3 augments, you can't do anything else, except the same shitty missions to farm the same shitty points.  At least when I was doing Velious I knew I was doing Kael for a reason...because once we got Thurg armor, we could go do Skyshrine.  Once we got some SS armor we could go kill the nameds.  There is nothing like that in LDoN, and I refuse to consider it anything more than a timesink.<br />
<br />
C) See A for my explanation of why I'll never organize large scale activities.  <br />
<br />
I really enjoyed my group of 10-12 people that I had going.  Of course most of them have since found greener pastures since I stopped playing, so I doubt things could ever go back to the way they were...but the last thing I wanna be in this game is just a number.  Raid slot 45 or something is retarded.  I wanna feel like i'm important, and I feel that when I'm single grouping things that are difficult, but not impossible.  There is nowhere else for me to go, even if i did farm up 13 million LDoN points, because I still couldn't take down the Warlord in tactics and I'd still be stuck in the same shitty zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I'm frankly shocked to see level 65 players with 4909 HP's (heck, sub-7200 HP's is not good at all) and can only suppose this is achievable by not doing content that exists and provides upgrades. If this is the case, SoE might as well give up now - the instant gratifiaction crowd wants too much <br />
<br />
Yup, and I agree with Partha on this, you're a fucking tool of your guild Battleblade.<br />
<br />
Do you have any fucking idea how difficult it is to gear up a character to 7200hp, WITHOUT farming 13 trillion points in LDoN, and without a nightly raiding schedule?  I'll bet you fucking don't, because I'm at 5600hp, 1300ac all defensive AA's, and in my circle of friends, I'm a goddamned Balrog incarnate compared to the warriors they have to group with when I'm not playing. <br />
<br />
I state it again..some of you people have seriously forgotten what it means to go from Tactics to the Elemental planes.  I'm using a 34ac 60hp helm.  WHAT THE FUCK IS THE RAEX HELM AGAIN?  Exactly.  Go over the list, piece by piece and you'll see exactly where your advantage comes from, and it has exactly jack and shit to do with you &quot;Working harder&quot; in this game.  You're a drone on a raid 4 nites a week and you think that makes you better than everyone else because they're just &quot;Not putting in the effort&quot; right?<br />
<br />
Bullshit.  I've worked overnites since I got out of highschool.  I played EQ in the mornings and usually during the day (my late nites) on my days off.  Lets just say that's not the schedule that any guild who's chat consists of more than &quot;Kekeke&quot; wants.  Think real hard about the schedule you keep and the role you play in your guild before you make such assinine statements again.</div></div><hr />

 I agree that people who've been at the endgame awhile have no idea what the rest of the game is like anymore. Thats half of posting this, I realize how much different the game is for you guys.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, how do you fix it? How can you help the casual player with their issues without encroaching upon the endgame players? If you increase casual player power - all that happens is casual guilds become endgame guilds. I don't buy the &quot;we just want to exp there!&quot;.<br />
<br />
It will never be equal, because it's the nature of it. People who put more in get more out - i think you guys understand that. What I want to know though is what is it that casual players want? Be specific because I can't read minds :). Upped ornate armor drops is a good example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, you have till Friday morning to post in this thread before it's too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">More ornate sorta stuff. Make a full set, including jewelry and non-visible pieces of similar difficulty to get. Then make a rarer/more difficult to get set with slightly upgraded stats and so on. The casual person isn't just looking to get into raid guild content; they just want to progress in both equipment and zones as well. How much can you kill in BoT before you get bored witless? How about LDoN? Simply making a 3-4 zone exp group progression of zones/difficulty/loot would be pretty neat. You could have quested access, similar to the alternate flagging quests for the earlier PoP zones.<br />
<br />
  I'm still all for revamping old EQ with new loot and quests, same mobs and zones. Too much wasted space. I stand by my previous post 100%!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The thing is though, how do you fix it?

I don't buy the &quot;we just want to exp there!&quot;. <br />
<br />
All we want is the same things you do Raaj...we want progression.  I don't give a fuck if I'm 2 years behind the ubers, that never bothered me.  I was stoked as hell when I finally got my Dozekar kill.  We never collected all the pieces for one of the quests, but I was still happy that I was able to take a step towards the end.<br />
<br />
But I'll never own a Raex set.  Even everything but BP/greaves would be acceptable for me, and I think I could do it...assuming I had access to the zones.  It's just completely wrong to cockblock my progression with an artificial ceiling ala 72 man raids.  And I don't believe that LDoN is a viable alternative.  I'm all for spending my time and working for my upgrades, because I don't want anything handed to me and I never did...but LDoN is just not the way to go about it.<br />
<br />
The only issue that the casual player has is the fact that our options are terribly limited at the moment.  We can only use this upgrade path and we can only spend time in these zones if we want to accomplish anything.  Alot of it is due to just completely rampant mudflation making a lot of other gear TOO obsolete (IE : Halls of Testing is a complete waste of time now because the armor is ass.  This is where people cut their teeth and learn the skills, and now there's no incentive to do that when you can just walk into BoT and go &quot;65 XXXX LFG!&quot; and get better gear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Alright so that's the problem - what's the solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">For myself, the biggest deal was that we couldn't (my guild, that is) turn out 50-60 people on a whim who were adequately geared for any kind of progression event that wasn't bugged/already taken/jumped by bored uberguilders. Hell, even if you go as low as Kunark dragons, that shit is gone and done within minutes of respawn, usually for twinks or Ebay accounts. That's probably why my guildies enjoyed places like PoM and Veksar so much - you could go and get decent gear for your level without needing to make a big production out of it, or having to do it again and again and again and AGAIN like LDoN.<br />
<br />
Anyways, like I said, content for casual 65's is a non-starter as long as you've got bored ubers in game. Unless they instance it, and then you'll have the ubers complaining that we'd get gear within a light parsec of theirs, never mind the fact that we wouldn't be playing in the same zones as them anyways. I mean, fuck, just because I get a Sword of L33tness doesn't mean I'm headed to Time the next day, or even that I WANTED to go to Time as anything other than an abstracted 'Wish I could do that'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Alright so that's the problem - what's the solution?<br />
<br />
Make LDoN a viable alternate progression gearwise. Let people be able to spend their points on intermediate gear that they can sell back for original points. Gear should be adequate to progress into EP with a degree of error. Casuals don't like to do extremely hard encounters because a failed attempt is a complete waste of their already precious playtime. Let them work for gear that will allow a certain degree of succcess without 72 man raids. Flagging is cockblock, remove it, the chalenge should be the progression to the encounter and the encounter itself.<br />
<br />
Instance bottleneck zones, remove flagging, make LDoN more than just a timesink...30+ adventures at ~2 hours a pop for one piece of gear is insane. LDoN was great for providing a means for gear progression with limited playtime, however the progression is way too slow atm. Casuals see very little gain right now from 1 adventure. IMO characters should be able to buy level appropriate gear/spells after 2-3 adventures, not 30.<br />
<br />
Side note: At lower levels, theirs no way a character can earn enough points for their LDoN spells until waaay after they have passed that level. Point cost/reward should be adjusted to allow one to buy appropriate gear/spells at the level at which they are intended to be used assuming all xping is done in LDoN from level 20-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Non-ubers (and I say this in a friendly manner),<br />
<br />
To some extent you're right. I've totally forgotten that it is difficult to break 5K HP's. Part of the reason is that I think I may have broken it around 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
I am a guild tool. For as long as I can remember my raid attendance has been 100%. BB has 450 days played.<br />
<br />
The problem I think is that an ever increasing part of the old content dies and an ever increasing portion of the new content is out of reach for casual players.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can suggest is enriching loot drops in LDoN and in every expansion's threshold content. I wish they would put the Fabled mobs back in the game. I think LDoN AP's for a sucessful mission should be doubled. Casual players do need some kind of progression path.<br />
<br />
But beyond things like that, it's hard to suggest anything that really benefits casual players. Want to see PoTime? There's only one path to that door. Want to MT RZ and pickup a BoC? It takes a raid and an MT with more than 5k HP's.<br />
<br />
There is a raid progression path. For the most part, there is not a progression path for single-players/groups that allows them reasonable progress. Guild members can't really be allowed to progress in groups too much, or it destroys the DKP system and erodes the motivation for raiding in a guild.<br />
<br />
Perhaps older expansions can be made more group and small raid (3 groups?) friendly. For example, when OoW comes out, remove the Seru, ST, VT, VP, or even the EP flag requirements. The problem is most of that content is raid only and beyond the ability of casuals.<br />
<br />
Don't think &quot;uber&quot; guild tools don't sympathize, most of us do - unconditionally. But as you've observed, a lot of us are out of touch.<br />

<br />
<br />
Btw, you have till Friday morning to post in this thread before it's too late.<br />
<br />
for starters, redo gear drops, this game is based on spells and items, you would use kael armor to get to skyshrine, and skyshrine to go back and do vindi, AoW and statue, then you would hit yelnik and his ilk<br />
<br />
Up ornate drop rates, make it drop off krigers on a rare chance, and make it a sure thing on named, if there are 4 damn parchments on a tower boss, why not a GSoFW, an ornate BP and a pally blade? why the hell is an ornate leather/cloth helm 5k and plate 300k on my server?<br />
<br />
if you up the drop of ornate you do 3 things<br />
<br />
1) increase the power of the general casual player base, and by doing that you make it so the PUraiders can move on or smaller guilds with their subsequent allys may move thru the content with less people<br />
2) kick yantis in the nuts, ruin the worth of his staple cash crop<br />
3) removes some of the stagnation in the game<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, like i have said before, make the challenge in winning, not in waiting so<br />
<br />
1) make all flagging mobs and gear up zones respawn quicker(4 hours at the most) triggerable or instanced, any one of the three actions would make alot of people happy<br />
2) remove the ability to cockblock, this is the biggest bitch in the entire game, getting your force there only to have another guild parked toon do half a turn in or trigger the event early in order to make you wait another day~week<br />
<br />
this game needs to be people centric, and in that remember people have to go to work, sleep, eat, go out, have a family, not just wait 6 hours to a weeks time to hit a monster<br />
<br />
the solution is to remove the time sinks, if you can beat the monster when it is there, or the named the drops the armor, then you shouldnt have to wait a week to do it, time sinks are stagnating the game since they have been growing since luclin<br />
<br />
you all know i am not articulate, so i supersized my solution, and that is make it so a dad or mom doesnt have to ignore their children to enjoy the game, so people dont have to have a life where as they just go to work and play EQ, with no time to go out to a movie or have a social life, and the time sinks that cause you to think spawn spawn spawn spawn spawn spawn SPAWN DAMNIT! are what cause all these problems, and if you reduced the spawn times the amount of cockblocks would drop, whats the point if your twisted efforts only set a guild back 3 hours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I'd also like to see NPCs in cities added to the game that can &quot;travel buff&quot; a player. They could cast a long lasting bard-speed movement buff for those long runs to the middle of nowhere. Make is so that if the character attacks or cast a detrimental spell the speed buff will drop, so a little bit different than invis rules in that it doesn't drop when that level 1 skelly attacks you or you decide to buff some noobies.<br />
<br />
I'd also love to see the old zones revamped. There's a lot of content that just isn't being used anymore. There is no need to add new zone when so many are being unused already. Hell, I'd even pay for some quality revamps to these old zones (not sure how that would work though).<br />
<br />
NPC bards in taverns that heal you would also be cool, like in abysmal. Things like that really bring out the roleplay aspect of the game even if just on the surface. I'm not even a roleplayer and I thought that was really cool. NPCs that can cure disease and curses, some that can buff players. get those buff bots out of PoK and actually playing the game. It's so annoying to have all the clerics online buffing players and not avaiable for groups. Remove regent cost for all spell especially cleric's, maybe that will encourage more people to play the class.<br />
<br />
In general, just things that are fun, not more challenging. the game is challenging enough without adding to it. Hard != Fun in every case. Make this game come alive again with unique mob ai and behavior. Give mobs unique sounds and models. Bring back the quirky mobs that make EQ so memorable.<br />

Re-institute some form of the RP rules on Firiona Vie, maybe curtailing grouping based on comparative factions or something... that way if someone wants to play the &quot;good&quot; Tier Dal who groups with Koada Dal and worls on his Felwithe faction enough, no problem, but he can't also group with his Necromancer buddies as well...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Alright so that's the problem - what's the solution?<br />
<br />
The solution is a relatively simple one, and it's in the loot tables.  There is so much room for growth between a &quot;casual&quot; player and an &quot;uber&quot; player these days that it has become absurd.  SoE simply can not design content that is a challenge for both.  Either it's a walk in the park for the uber geared or the casual player gets slaughtered.  So, if they're going to release expansions designed to challenge the uber geared, or the almost uber geared, they're either going to have to be willing to allow casual players to significantly narrow the gab between casuals and ubers or accept that casuals aren't going to be buying the expansion.  This doesn't and shouldn't mean that casuals are &quot;handed&quot; gear that is equal to or near equal to uber gear.  This does mean that there has to be more paths of progression with more upgrades available.  Where does a casual player go once they've acquired ornate?  How do they acquire ornate to begin with, given that you almost have to be geared in ornate to tank the mini-boss mobs in BoT that drop it?  How many mindless hours spent in LDoN is really reasonable?  Did they actually expect people to live in LDoN for a couple of years, investing the majority of their limited play time on gaining points?<br />
<br />
Increase ornate dropps, step in the right direction.  Make ornate or something similar available in other teir 1 or 2 zones in PoP, so people can actually play where they want and have a realistic opportunity for improvement.  Look into whether or not an ornateplus option is needed in mid teir levels of PoP or in early teirs of GoD.  Expect that yes, there will be a bit more competition between casuals and ubers, but that's always been in the game.  If ubers expect to be completely without competition, then don't expect the casuals to continue providing expansion &quot;welfare&quot; for them to have it.  Either the expansions are made reasonably useable by the majority of people playing the game without an endless time investedment being required in AAs and LDoN loot, or the minority can expect to be picking up the tab for it on their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Yoarik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">The solution to Casual vs. Raid Uber player already exists- instanced zones.<br />

If there were a VT instanced zone that could be taken by a group or by a raid, that would be cool... there could be lesser bosses in the group version and uber bosses in the raid version. You could use that model for a greater portion of content, it would seriously mitigate the &quot;jumped by Pharmers&quot; factor and could open up up the content for the casual players, the same or slightly lesser equipment could drop but on a much lower frequency so that a 6 person group would have to take the instance 12 times to have a reasonable chance of garnering the same loot a 72 person raid gets in a once through.</div></div><hr />

Our guild, which is on the small end of the spectrum, can field 1-2 groups on our own or up to 3-4 groups if all our friends in the other casual guilds we hang out with show up. They wouldn't all be 65 though. :)</div></div><hr />

And please don't refer me back to the NPC, her cryptic babble on confused me more on the issue. Another concept I liked was in SWG, the ingame email. I loved being able to leave my friends a message about something in game, although it was just a luxury. Setting Waypoints is another very nice feature they could add since the maps are already on a grid. Would be nice to type in the grid coordinates or your location and make a WP appear. Could be nice for finding a corpse, an item that's rotting, and specific mob you spent a month combing the area for and need to rally your friends around. Way points are very nice IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I'm frankly shocked to see level 65 players with 4909 HP's (heck, sub-7200 HP's is not good at all) and can only suppose this is achievable by not doing content that exists and provides upgrades. If this is the case, SoE might as well give up now - the instant gratifiaction crowd wants too much.<br />
<br />
First of that is my profile you are looking at. And half of me wants to get down with some EQ-dick sizing with you and beat you about the head and shoulders. The other half of me just has to laugh. Because you are 100%, no bones about it RIGHT. I am not going the content that is there. Any of it. SOE has succesfully pushed away a customer that has been playing since 3/20/99 and Kailyn's birthday is 3/21/99. I have not logged in and played in 4 months. When ever my last subscription ran out is the last time I payed.<br />
<br />
And you know what I miss the game, the people and my character. Becuase I remember when I was maxed at 50, and 60 and 65. The level of power I have now is unafuckingmanable compaired to say a 50th at release. Kailyn, howere non-uber she is to you and your jaded view, is a MONSTER compaired to what she started out as. And, with her current gimpy gear, can tank anything I friggin access to. I remember (clearly) when being hit for double 139 HURT. <br />
<br />
Now why did I give up this massive feeling of power, that I enjoy because I have the perspective of 5 years of play? Because there is no point. I can not gear myself or my guild up well enough to really break into EP. Or the emporer, or VT, or anything else that may give me a chance in GoD. Because hardcore raiding is not my style and for anyone who is &quot;time impaired serious player&quot; not their's either.<br />
<br />
I think SOV did it best with ToV. Every player who could get 60/65 could see themselves doing/in NToV. The only differance between the ubers and the non uber was time. I did not expect to get my guild into NToV while Triton, Forces Unknown, Rising Insandity and the like were there. But I could see myself following in their footsteps a year or more later, when I had gear up to the levels they were at. <br />
<br />
Fast forward to PoP. But for a few of the lower end zones, even to get access you have to participated in a succeful LARGE (larger than any others in EQ) raid or series of raids to get anywhere. Now GoD (and presumably OoW) are geared for the portion of the population that has gotten into and farmed the elementals. But for at least 2/3s the 65 in the game there is no way to get to element class gear, or anything else that can come close to bridging the gap (VT). <br />
<br />
I can see no future path where I can get the class of gear I need to enjoy (or at least see) GoD and presumably OoW. Nor will grinding points and AA in LDoN get me access to anything else. Gearing up for the next level of content died in PoP (if not before). I can't gear up and see these zones. I can't raid, there for I can not see the zones. <br />
<br />
You want me back in EQ...give me some hope that I can see (and participate) in the content SoE is releasing. So that i can see some logical progression and point to all this time I am spending. And the current structure will just not work for casual guilds. If I want to raid, it has to be more or less planable--not racing for whatever spawn. <br />
<br />
Think about what needs to be done for raids to unlock content for players now. Primal/prismatic requires between 24 and 50ish first brood kills that no causual guild would ever be able to put together an anything short of 5 years of playing. The emporer will rarely (if ever) be killed by the causal player because the time sink of getting the key is not rewarded by the gaurentee that you will ever have reason to use it. Why play (play??) 40 hours to get asomething that you probably will never use. This of course locks out VT. <br />
<br />
PoP in this way is little easier as smaller (somewhat) groups can actually have a chance of flagging raids as the encounters become reletively easier. But 24 people can be a lot for a causal guild to put together for a raid--and 72 is just about impossible. And these zones don't need keys. <br />
<br />
There was no key requirement for WToV or NToV. But those who &quot;did not belong&quot; stayed away. The penelties for fighting (faction) or dying there are way to high. We are just as sensative with risk/reward as the ubers. Say that the elementals were open to anyone who was 65/100. Well first off I would be hugely motivated to get 100 AAs. And the 2nd or 3rd time my group (which for arguments sake is under equipped0 gets owned by a quad 900 hitter, we will decide, no matter how rich the rewards are, they aren't worth it as we can't get them--and leave. Try again after I have another 100 AC/500 HP and 30 AAs. And looks, suddenly I have a reason to grind LDoN and BoT. Of course the reason I want the elemental gear is so that I can get into GoD and do something there. <br />
<br />
But with out some sort of viable, visable, and accessable to the causal player path--grinding is pointless. FOr a long time the vision for the causal player was the though of some day, maybe on a multi-guild raid, seeing and doing some NToV. There is no equivilant goal now.<br />
<br />
EDIT to add. BB, you have posted since I started writing this up. I am glad I did no flame you and sorry if you take offence at what I said. <br />
<br />
And the sumamtion is--casuals should have access do about 95% of the content that ubers do and the differance in gear/HP/AC/what have you should be no more than 20% of the ubers (Uber * 0.8 = casual). We casuals have the same right to content (the important kind of experiance), loot and XP as you do, it just should take us longer.<br />
<br />
When I was playing, I ran a couple of Xana tries--and with 2 weeks notice I could get 4-8 groups there. If I can say on X day at Y time we will try Z mob, be there, people can and will make changes in their schedules to be there. I suspect if were successfully doing content and regularly raiding 4 groups would not be unreasonable.  Before EQ started bleeding subscriptions and players.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Alright so that's the problem - what's the solution?<br />
<br />
LDoN:  Partial point refunds (obviously).  Change the adventure selection system to something like the following....rate the difficutly of the mission types, have the recruiter present a list of three choices that the group *has* to pick from (why have numerous mission types when nearly everyone declines all but for slaughters and collects?), with more difficult missions worth more points.<br />
<br />
Add secondary objectives to each mission, that are worth bonus points.<br />
<br />
Add a third raid level that is easier than the current two.  VT/EP and Time level LDoN raids are beyond the reach of most, so why not add a NToV level?  Imagine a raid that smaller/casual guilds could do on a convenient day and time where the target is guaranteed to be up?  Contrast that to FFA targets that same guild might be hoping to have enough players on for, assuming the mob isn't getting 1 grouped or less for bazaar or twink loot.<br />
<br />
Add a third mission difficulty level.  Going from 300 hitters to 1k hitters is too big a jump, add some middle ground.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to place bought items (like the ~1100 armor or even the 1492 armor) as raid drop loot.  Or even point tokens as raid loot, worth anywhere from 100-1000 points in the theme it dropped in.  All of the above with proper RvR of course, so no Tak BPs dropping off normal nameds.<br />
<br />
Ornate and 65 spells:  Move the drops to more zones.  Increase the drop rate.  Right now, the players most in need of ornate really can't afford to buy it, and when they do, they empty their bank accounts and hand over their 50k or 100k to someone who really didn't need the ornate or the money in the first place.  Keep in mind that spells fall into this category too, casuals probably buy *all* of their 65 rune spells in the bazaar because they don't have access to the drops.  This is, in part, the &quot;Great Divide&quot; - those most in need have the least ability to get, while those who don't need have too much ability to get (items, spells, money, flags, whatever).<br />
<br />
Consider upping the group size to eight.  Obvioulsy, this is a big decision, and content in a lot of areas would need to be increased in diffuclty to compensate, but simply put, the more challenging the content, the greater the need to stack the group with the best, leaving the &quot;less than optimals&quot; behind.  Think about GoD trials, would there have been even 10% of the War vs Knight issues if the group size was 8 and knights were competing for 1 of 4 DPS/Utility slots instead of 2?  And since these are trials, artificial restrictions could be put in place like only one duplicate class allowed per trial group (so no war/ench/clrx2,wizx4 groups or whatever).<br />
<br />
Classes have been added since release.  Class abilities have been spread out, meaning more classes don't stack as well.  Don't need a cleric when a druid can heal well enough.  Don't need a shaman when a BL can slow well enough.  Don't need a warrior when a knight can tank well enough.  Sorry, we can't add your LFG bard friend because we already have a shaman and enchanter.  Sorry, we need a rogue or wizard for the last dps slot.<br />
<br />
The best analogy I can give is this:  Once Knight tanking became good enough, their advantages (utility, aggro) offset their reduced tanking effectiveness to the point where they were preferred.  With a lot of other abilities, the same thing is happening.  Or possibly for you ubers, here's another one.  I've often heard ubers say that for normal LDoN, they just grab basically any 6 classes and go to town.  Casuals still need to worry about things like tanking, mana regen, slow, and crowd control in their LDoN groups.  An 8 man group gives casuals a little more leeway in forming groups, once the big 4 are covered, they can grab basically any other 4 classes and go to town too.  A larger group size means less focus on min/maxing and more focus on just playing.<br />
<br />
Added via Edit:<br />
<br />
Increase the level of SoE to player communications.  Increase the level of honesty.  Sometimes a simple &quot;We fuxored, we know we fuxored, we don't have time to work on it now but we will in three weeks&quot; can go a long way.<br />
<br />
Any chance of getting Luclin models and animations and recent spell effect updates redone for speed and efficiency?  For free?  This would generate some considerable good will in the process.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">When DA posts a fairly large event (CT ring, Xanamech tries), we generally would get 3-6 groups of 55+. We're not the average small guild tho, we have generally lower levels than small guilds and more members. Our gear ratio is also all over the map - our main MT broke 7k last I heard and was on the way to 8k, and I was our #3, if that gives you any idea. So I try NOT to speak for casual 65's.  :D <br />
<br />
As far as fixes....I honestly don't think there IS one now. I remember the fights in guild over who was going to buy Velious - half of us were dead sure we'd never hit 35 and be able to do anything there. But all the content was available except for one zone. Current expansions give you a handful of zones and expect you to unlock the rest. Unfortunately, a good tank for a raid guild has about double my HP and at least another 500 AC. Luclin was the last expansion where only one zone was locked to casual players - unfortunately, the next expansion was tuned to those people who were in VT rather than for everyone.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the locking/flagging route was the garden path Sony led us down. Rather than being able to make one expansion that everyone could use, they basically have tried to make two in one - one for raid guilds and one for casuals, and usually at the expense of casuals. Somewhere along the line, also, cockblocking and spawn blowing became the rule rather than the exception. Those two forces combined have killed my enjoyment of the game, because progression became a superhuman effort, especially for casual sorts. Sorry if it sounds heretical, but I put in a large effort 5 out of 7 - I'm not particularly enchanted with the idea of having to put in MORE effort the other two just to kinda half assed advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">This does mean that there has to be more paths of progression with more upgrades available.  Where does a casual player go once they've acquired ornate?  How do they acquire ornate to begin with, given that you almost have to be geared in ornate to tank the mini-boss mobs in BoT that drop it?  How many mindless hours spent in LDoN is really reasonable?  Did they actually expect people to live in LDoN for a couple of years, investing the majority of their limited play time on gaining points?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Glat makes a lot of good points.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd love to see a sort of &quot;ornate&quot; armor progression, with the lowest tier dropping in BoT.  Create a new zone (and make it free, quit milking us for cash), put the entrance say, in that unused stone near the PoV etc stones.  Populate it with BoT-stye giants, but make it a raid-style zone, with random nameds and random trash able to drop &quot;type 2 ornate armor&quot; (NODROP) armor in between ornate and elemental.  Make this zone hard (i.e. requiring 2 groups at minimum), also keep it unrestricted by key/flag but with a level 64+ requirement.<br />
<br />
Revamp LDoN raids and put in instanced mini-raids that small guilds can do.  Make them similar to GoD with a forced re-do time of 24 hours.  Design these instanced raids for levels 40-46, 46-55, 55-60, 60-65, and 65-only (with normal or hard options).  Put in a decently varied loot table (5-10 items) for each level of raid, with level-appropriate itemization. (No, augs don't count ias loot)  Make these raids doable for 2 groups (12 ppl).  Make them a tougher version of certain ldon adventures if necessary (collect, rescue, etc) but with twists. I want to suddenly encounter a dragon at the end of the adventure who I have to kill in order to rescue John A. Helplessgnome.  I don't want to see some stupid, same-sized, same drab colored, sandy-colored goblin with ill-deformed features as the boss, with its only distinguishing feature being that it doesnt have 'a' at the beginning of its name....<br />
<br />
I still think zones like 'kaelb' are good ideas.  For me, working to gear up to do Vindi was a &quot;big thing.&quot;  Then, working to get to Statue, and finally an AoW kill!  Putting in a zone off kael with an AoW version 2.0 or something would really make me look forward to going and exploring and working up to kill &quot;High King Tormaxius&quot; or whatever.<br />
<br />
on a slightly unrelated note:  When you leave Graveyards out of an entire expansion, don't fucking put mobs that see SoS all over the goddamn place.</div></div><hr />

Again, I think 5K HP's is achievable primarily because I'm sitting at nearly twice that. Let me take you at your word.<br />
<br />
As Raaj has asked, what are the fixes.<br />
<br />
You have LDoN armor which is not bad and LDoN augs - double the LDoN AP's for completing missions. Create a solvent that destroys the augmented item but returns the augment. Better LDoN loot tables with more loot variety. At least one named guaranteed every adventure. This would make the LDoN grind more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Make 3-group normal and hard LDoN raids.<br />
<br />
Ornate and Class/Diety armor is the casual players other source of armor - have Ornate molds and pattens drop in additional pre-EP zones from random mobs. It's less likely to be farmed by ubers and pp-resellers if it's done this way and it could be more accessable.<br />
<br />
In 60 days drop the key requirements for VT, VP, and ST. In 120 days drop the key requirements for the EP's. High level casual groups ought to be able to acquire things like Steel Ring of Earthen Resistance, planar bows, etc.<br />
<br />
Review tradeskills and insure quality gear can be made for every slot and does not require doing highly advanced content to acquire the needed items. Insure lower level forager/tradeskillers have a very good source of income making staples like arrows, padding, stat food/drink, potions, sub-combines (like vegetable oil) that are highly and constantly desired by high level players. Make the needed drops and foraged items common as dirt. It's shouldn't take a half-hour to forage a Misty Thicket Acorn.<br />
<br />
Improved itemization of the sewer trials. Put the fabled mobs back in the game permanently and add more fabled mobs.<br />
<br />
On E'ci, a quasi-public raiding consortium has killed Quarm. Things like the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest and the Phylactery quest can yield up some decent equipment although such quests are too rare. Progress even without changes IS possible.<br />
<br />
However, I believe most casual players do not want to participate in large raids reqularly. They want group activities. In this case, doubling LDoN AP's, enriching it's loot table, making Onate molds and patterns more widely available and putting fabeled mobs back in the game would accomplish a great deal.<br />
<br />
SoE needs to know how much people feel is reasonable to play a week and perhaps conduct a survey.<br />

<br />
I don't think 5k is too far off myself, since I'm sitting at 5200HP unbuffed.  I don't have all of my HP increasing AAs yet, although I do have most of them and some NToV loot.  So I could see a casual player in cultural and a healthy chunk of AAs surpassing the 5k unbuffed mark.  But it would have been a pretty serious time investment to get there.  Unreasonable?  Perhaps not.  But they're not going to be in gear where they can waltz into most of PoP beyond teir 1 or into GoD and expect to perform flawlessly.  They're going to be taking a serious thumping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Posted already on our guild board for our rep to bring up, but basically:<br />
<br />
1: Anger shouldn't be resistable<br />
<br />
2: Shrink beastlord pets<br />
<br />
3: Make augs removeable, especially raid augs. Maybe for 50% of the LDoN point price for bought augs, and a fixed price for raid augs, though another alternative could be disolving the item completely to reclaim the aug (the reverse of the current solvents). ESPECIALLY for our 'bread and butter' anger3 augs, which basically requires we do LDoNs for a week every time we upgrade a weapon. Introduce more weapon augs as drops<br />
<br />
4: Confirm/deny as a fact whether taunt is hardcapped at 230 (ie: does 10% taunt mod have any effect for warriors)<br />
<br />
5: For OoW, a single target version of AETaunt, and an upgrade to both adding fixed amount of hate, possibly also adding a hate value to taunt <br />
<br />
6: Greater tanking differentiation for ALL plate tank classes. Make the armor types actually mean something. Increase SK dps, leave pallies, but give war/pal/sk enough of a tanking increase that they can all AT raid trash, whilst leaving warriors superior.<br />
<br />
7: Ikkinz and Uqua were fucked when GoD came out. Don't repeat that in OoW. Now they've been 'fixed' aside from a few minor bugs (plus Uqua being made a little to easy except for Barxt), Qvic and Inktu'ta seem fine currently. Ignoring bugs and the specifics of fights GoD is fundamentally the best expansion yet in terms of intent for progression. No weekly respawn contested progression spawns, and only very limited freeloading of gimps through content. Almost ever last person who reaches the endzone will have fought their way there, rather than being logged on for a flag afte the fight.<br />
<br />
8: Minor point, but let us look like warriors again. I'm wearing pink gloves and waving a sparkling wand. Other options include an elf show and something that looks like a dove head (demerix). Whatever happened to SWORDS and AXES? Give us Rallos' flaming axe, or Seru's sword<br />
<br />
9: Personal point, but WTF were you thinking when you designed the new ogre model plate look? I didn't sign up to looking like I'm wearing fishnets and Raex Chaps of Distraction. I want my buttocks reclad in steel please (and not pink steel)<br />
<br />
10: TWELVE SLOT BAGS!!!<br />
<br />
11: A lore soulbound bag, or lore soulbound augment for bags. So we can keep some invis, lev, etc. gear on us for running back through those KoS GoD zones<br />
<br />
12: Qimini has a 'Gravedigger'. Put more in, especially for instanced zones. It's bad enough wiping, without having to sit there and wait for corpses at the end of the night.<br />
<br />
13: High end tradeskill items - there's been zero items worthwhile to make (for either profit or use) since PoP. LoY, LDoN and GoD have nothing worth making for a 250 TSer.<br />
<br />
As far as the uber/casual debate, you can't expect somenoe playing a couple of hours a week with a couple of friends to have comparable gear to someone who's played 30 hours a week and been equipped by the efforts of 70 other people for 5 years. There are two distint games going on in EQ - casual and raiding - it's like comparing apples and oranges. <br />
<br />
Have you ever taken a group to Hate's Fury for example? I farmed that zone for a while, the loot was pretty good, and the mobs easily killable by a semi-viable group of low 60s. Noone ever bothered zoning in. I though it'd be permacamped by these 'small family guilds' who could muster a couple of friends to go to the further afield zones with good exp and great drops - they never bothered. Cazic Thule still has some great drops to be camped. Take a couple of groups and 'raid' the arena in Riwwi.<br />
<br />
For a REAL casual guild of friends who can't muster a raid force, but have enough to do single group content without sitting alone LFG, there IS plenty of content. The problem is, no-one bothers to organise this kinda stuff, instead equating 'casual' with 'lazy' prefering to sit LFG in the 'Karnors de jour' lamenting about how they can't get Qvic armor. <br />
<br />
Make some friends, organise some camps that might involve some danger, risk, and travel more than 3 zones from PoK and you'll see a massive jump in the gear you can obtain with a little effort. If you aren't prepared to get out there, explore, organise, and work for your loots you can't expect to get above the curve.<br />
<br />
I challenge all these people claiming ' I'm a casual/family guild player, can't get any decent upgrades' to post their magelo, and I'm sure we could find multiple upgrades achievable in a couple of nights with a group of simlarly equipped friends. '/gu hey guys, wanna camp this spawn in CT on Saturday for a few hours?'. You never know, you might actually enjoy the challenge and change from grinding the same LDoNs or 'safe' camps over and over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">You make an important point, but I think what's happening lies somewhere between there's plenty to do that will allow a casual player to progess and there is nothing worthwhile to induce a casual player to log on.<br />
<br />
If a level 65 tank were to post their Magelo as you've suggested, I'm pretty sure the major recommendation would be to farm Ornate and to grind LDoN endlessly to augment it. I'm guessing the vast majority of casual players are bunched up between level 60 and 65 and what they should be doing to progress is confined to very little content.<br />
<br />
And once our hypothetical tank is Ornate clad and LDoN auged, then what? What's next? What did he/she gear up to do? Sewer trials?<br />
<br />
One problem is a lack of player involvement by casual players. Some website should start a Casual Player's Guide to EQ. One thing that it would do is show what is available, doable, and worthwhile. What really is the progression path?<br />
<br />
I mentioned E'ci public raiding. We both know, I think, that guilds dislike public raids competing for their spawns. But EQ is so raid oriented, it's hard for me to concieve of a seperate world where group targets only make the game worthwhile. Afaik, only E'ci has a well organized Kunark to PoTime public raiding btw. Most casual players give up raiding almost entirely.<br />
<br />
My feeling is the amount of content that is not dead stale available to casual players is limited. With the relatively low numbers of level 50 players, what really is there for a casual level 50 player to do? At the other extreme, what is there for a level 65 EP or PoTime equipped retired from raiding player to do?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">BB, I think I could get 5k HP without any gear upgrades--just a bunch of AAs. 7200, OTOH, is so far from a reasonable achivement for me with the current set up as to be laughable. And the stats I have is enough for the BoT mini's and anything else my guild wanted to throw me at. <br />
<br />
That said, I want the path for the causals to largely follow the same path that the Ubers do. Because, tha does allow, theoretically at least, causals to throw togehter raids for most of the raid targets in PoP and maybe even, with enough work and time, Time access. <br />

Not to mention the tradeskillers who take it in the shorts needing EP drops that effectively block them from trade skilling (without going into the EP trade skill quest which turns everyone into GM everythings).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">As far as the uber/casual debate, you can't expect somenoe playing a couple of hours a week with a couple of friends to have comparable gear to someone who's played 30 hours a week and been equipped by the efforts of 70 other people for 5 years. There are two distint games going on in EQ - casual and raiding - it's like comparing apples and oranges. <br />
<br />
I've double boxed in hatesfury.  The gear wasn't anything to write home about, particularly once you start factoring in the grief involved with getting there and getting back out.  LoY is stupidly annoying to travel in and unless the rewards are remarkably good most people won't do it more than a couple of times.  Kind of like the whole, if you're doing a CR in GoD thing.  If you wipe in hatesfury it's a particularly annoying effort to get back there to loot/rezz.<br />
<br />
For a REAL casual guild of friends who can't muster a raid force, but have enough to do single group content without sitting alone LFG, there IS plenty of content. The problem is, no-one bothers to organise this kinda stuff, instead equating 'casual' with 'lazy' prefering to sit LFG in the 'Karnors de jour' lamenting about how they can't get Qvic armor. <br />
<br />
Make some friends, organise some camps that might involve some danger, risk, and travel more than 3 zones from PoK and you'll see a massive jump in the gear you can obtain with a little effort. If you aren't prepared to get out there, explore, organise, and work for your loots you can't expect to get above the curve.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I'm not going to change how I play the game to accommodate how you think I should be playing.  And I'm not going to change how I want to play the game to accommodate how SoE thinks I should be playing.  Either SoE makes some reasonable accommodations to how people like me want to play the game or they accept the loss of our business.  Now, regardless of where you think we could go play and gain loot, I seriously doubt that's in GoD.  Why exactly would we be purchasing OoW, the follow on to GoD, if we're getting zero utilization from GoD?<br />
<br />
The content isn't designed for us.  We're therefore not going to continue purchasing it.  And regardless of however many hyper-ambitious uber raiders chastise us for being lazy casual players unwilling to deal with the overhead they feel is reasonable for a game that is supposed to be fun and not work, we're not going to suddenly wake up and say, damn, you know they're right, all we have to do is invest all of our play time cultivating friends and coming up with master plans on how we're going to progess.  Effectively making us set up our own mini-guild.  Thanks, I think most of us will pass, but we apperciate the suggestion.<br />
<br />
Sebilis, Chardok, LGuk, SolB, Howling Stones, Veksar, what do all these zones have in common?  They, at the time they were introduced, dropped loot appropriate for the people playing there.  There was progress available for people just going out to have &quot;a good time&quot;.  For the most part in PoP and LDoN that concept is dead.  It may have been resurrected in GoD to a degree, if you can get geared up enough to succeed in GoD to begin with.  They had better give some serious consideration to reviving the concept or they're in for a big surprise on future expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I've been playing EQ since Kunarks release, on my original server my guild is in Time. I still love EQ but I just didnt have the time or the desire to be in a hard core raiding guild so I stripped all my twinks, sold all the gear in the bazaar, &amp; transfered all the pp I made over to the FV server ( only epics here are no-drop ). Check out my magelo, everyting in it was purchased in the bazaar. On FV even LDON gear is droppable at any given time there are numerous 1400point+ LDON armor pieces for sale in the bazaar ( around 100k+ per piece ) Elemental gear is rarely sold in the bazaar for about 500k per piece ( for plate pieces minus BP of course ) For me raiding with 72 other people just wasnt fun anymore, with all the burn out &amp; turn over in high end raiding guild its like you dont know half the people in your guild. The most fun for me in EQ is testing your limits with 1 or 2 groups of friends. The FV rule set allows me to ( with enough time &amp; effort ) to get the drops usually reserved for those people in just such guilds. If they made all servers like this it would allow casuals ( or hard core non uber raiders ) to be able to upgrade to gear almost as good as the ubers if they put in 10 times the effort. Right now I have a regular group of like minded people &amp; I'm having a blast playing EQ again. We hope we can form a 20 person or so guild &amp; with the increase in level cap we can progress in POP &amp; maybe GOD with low numbers &amp; great skill.  I cant think of any reason a person in my situation doesnt &quot;deserve&quot; to be able to equip high end loot if I can farm enough to be able to buy it.  Small group of friends killing challenging content &gt;&gt;&gt; any 72 man raid imo. <br />

Different people will have different expectations. I understand that many casual players aggree with you:<br />
I want the path for the causals to largely follow the same path that the Ubers do.<br />
They don't want to play a different game where they never see much of the content they have purchased.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that's what we have. There is to my mind only so much that can be done.<br />
<br />
1. Maintain a nearly totaly separate casual player progression path focused on group activities. This would be LDoN, single group camps, etc.<br />
<br />
2. Make that path rewarding enough so that at any time a casual player could decide to join a raiding guild and be sufficiently equipped to participate.<br />
<br />
3. Encourage small raids (3 groups?).<br />
<br />
4. Casual players to organize public raiding as is done on E'ci.<br />
<br />
It's possible that a 3-group raid could do some of the PoTime phase 1 trials. It's possible for casual players to see part of GoD, particularly Ferubi, Kod'Taz, and the trials.<br />
<br />
But I honestly can't conceive of a casual player seeing most advanced content. It takes a raiding guild and a huge investment of time.<br />

<br />
I don't really disagree with this.  But that means that SoE has come to a crossroads of sorts.  They can either continue to design expansions that cater primarily to those already at the cutting edge of the previous content, or they can make it more of a mix where the ubers are actually bored to tears in the first half dozen to a dozen zones and don't start getting a real challenge until towards the end except for strategically placed boss mobs here and there.  The content would be the reverse of what it is now, the lions share being for casual/low teir raid players while the smaller portion is cutting edge content.  Now, this would piss off cutting edge players no end.  But doing what they're currently doing is pissing off casual players no end.  Which is going to do less damage to the game overall?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Unfortunately that's what we have. There is to my mind only so much that can be done.<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree, and I use velious as an example.<br />
<br />
From the beginning, hardcore guilds geared up with either Thurgadin armor or Plane of Growth armor.  Now, if you couldn't handle the arena at 50 like those guys could, there was still a way to get geared up....the blue leiutenants near the bank dropped quest armor rarely.  You didn't have to be hardcore to do it, and yes, you had to put in more of a time investment than the ubers with a 30 man raid force did in the Arena, but you got your armor eventually.<br />
<br />
I geared up my toons duoing the bank in the morning.  It was slow as fuck..took me forever to finally upgrade all of Haass's cobalt.  But I did it...and I could see myself progressing, and I could see the results of my work.  I definitely was not at the cutting edge, but I was able to put in the time to accomplish the same thing the ubers were.<br />
<br />
Same thing with ToV.  When my group first started doing it, we had zero chance of doing what the higher end people did..which was walking around in HoT like they owned the place.  We were basically content with getting the 2 wurms in the pit, and then the wanderers before respawn.  Since wurms are really the only thing that drops armor in there, we only got maybe 1-2 pieces a nite, but we progressed, we could see our accomplishments, and we were getting more capable of handling the content.  The last time I did HoT was with 3 of my toons...Warrior, Enchanter, Druid.  No fucking problem.<br />
<br />
Then PoP hit and it all broke down. Everyone with a huge guild things that the flagging system is so awesome, but in actuality, it's total shit.  Requiring me to get flags that require me to be above the level of content they unlock is bullshit. Could I do Sol Ro and get Ornate, or the elemental planes and get tradeskill shit so I could make bows for my guild?  Absolutely I think I could.  I wouldn't do it near as fast as the elemental tanks with 10khp and their FT15 clerics, but I could do it.  I could see progression, and maybe I could get my hands on some Raex eventually, which would make me a better tank able to handle slighty tougher content, so on, and so forth.<br />
<br />
SO WHY THE FUCK AM I REQUIRED TO KILL RALLOS ZEK TO PROCEED?<br />
<br />
That is a HUGE stumbling block in the progression.  It's why itemization is killing warriors, because Elemental gear is so far beyond non elemental gear it's crazy.<br />
<br />
And don't try using the argument that flags block me out of content I'm not ready for.  That's bullshit.  If I die 50 times in one nite trying new content, I'll figure it out that I'm not ready for it.  You don't need to make that decision for me.  If, for some reason I am capable of doing it, then I should be rewarded for my ingenuity, not penalized because I&quot;m not in a 70 man guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">I have an idea, why not just up the gear dropping rates, kill time sinks and allow anyone with the brains and man power to move on?<br />
<br />
I bet that if half the shit in this game didnt respawn between 6 hours to 3 days(hell isnt there a week long monster as well?) then alot of casual players would turn into uber players.<br />
<br />
if you can kill it, and you have the man power, then why do they try to put the challenge in making you disregard your real life by waiting at the computer for days on end? casual players are not dumber to where they cant make up a plan to kill something, hell some of them can get up 60 people on a good day.... the problem is it is never up when they would like thanks to the euroguilds causing them to spawn at night more often instead of the day time, or the cockblockers setting us back 6 hours to a weeks time.<br />
<br />
<br />
No more timesinks! that would go so far in fixing this game.<br />
<br />
and haass is right, why make it so Fing hard to get into Sol ro tower... i could understand if RZ was as hard to kill as the monsters around the lava lake, but he is 10 times that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">arf arf<br />
<br />
I agree with Partha ... I don't believe that a fix is possible that opens the game for the casual and uber players equally.  But a huge step forward would be to take away the insanely long spawn timers on some critters, and de-nerf the stupidly rare drop rates on some items.  There are advancements to be made, but when someone with limited time needs to camp a mob that may or may not appear every 12 - 18 hours, that's not helping anyone.  Just make the quests doable for the shmuck with two jobs who can only play a few hours at a stretch.  (Heh, just noticed Gerick's post while previewing this one ... submitting anywho ...)<br />
<br />
The game effectively ends for my toons at about tier 2 PoP/LDoN.  There are alternatives, but without getting into it too deeply (leaving for work), it's just too much dam* work and not enough fun to farm for quest drops, try to find people to help me with items, etc.  The P. I. T. A. factor of hoping the MOB is up and that no-one beats me too it takes the wind outta my sails, too, but it wouldn't be a big deal if he was gonna respawn in an hour or two.  For my part, it's not that I don't wanna raid - but I don't always have time, it's very difficult to find the people, and every single open raid I have joined has been an unmitigated and incredibly long disaster.<br />
<br />
I think, honestly, that the game mechanic is showing it's age - more is understood now about how gaming works (and can work), and more elegant solutions are being applied to games today than were 5 years ago.  So, maybe the solution is to release EQ-II with the casual player in mind, and continue to press EQ on for the uber/high end raider - which I think is something I read somewhere ...<br />
<br />
BB is right- the high end game is a large investment.  Hell, it's taken a huge investement of time just to get my toon to where it is (I was near 30 hours a week most weeks I played) and lately, I've been wondering if I wanna feel like I'm *investing* in a game, or if I wanna be *enjoying* it.  EQ is a raider's game, now, and I can accept that and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Haas,<br />
<br />
I'm not certain the very best equipment has ever been generally available to non-raiders.<br />
<br />
I went from a Warlord's BP to Great Shadow Platemail to a Raex BP.<br />
<br />
A casual player might go from Champion to Vindi (?) to LDoN, Kizrak, Farwater, Livestone, Windessence, or Inferno.<br />
<br />
The problem, as you note is that with the exception of the LDoN BP, casual players are largely dependent on buying upgrades from zones they can't enter now and are precluded from obtaining the best in the game or it's equivilent.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily agree casual player should be able to acquire the current best. But I do think they should be able to get a step down that is sufficient for them to join a guild, be effective, and raid for that current best.<br />
<br />
Removing flag requirements to the EP's would help.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I've always been torn between annoyance and amusement at the Bazaar millionaires that literally try to buy themselves an uber Warrior piece by piece.<br />
<br />
In the end, they fall well short and I can't help thinking mostly that this is a good thing. (I'm going to seem mean here, but take it in the spirit I intend) Anytime I see a Warrior clad mostly in Ornate and weilding a Split-blade of Destruction, my first instinct is to wonder how much he had to pay Yantis to get his naked ebayed character equipped.<br />
<br />
Another level up in equipment quality needs to be made available from LDoN merchants.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">I think one of the major problems with how the game has turned out lays within the necessary time that guilds are forced to sink into strenuous flagging systems, in order to progress through content that is released by Sony. <br />
<br />
This in itself isn't the entire problem though. The problem lies within the dilemma created by the timesink itself - in other words, nobody, even in high end guilds, would put themselves through eight hours of raiding every night or every other night, unless the rewards were insane. That's the nature of the beast.<br />
<br />
But Everquest wasn't supposed to just be a constant push towards the end. Everquest was supposed to be about enjoying the road there - that was the original reason why there was no one single &quot;end&quot; to Everquest, that there were supposed to be more than 1 way to enjoy the game. <br />
<br />
Casuals can't enjoy the game if the end they achieve isn't as satisfying to them as the end that a hardcore raider will achieve. Now I don't mean that casuals gaming should yield the exact same rewards that hardcore gaming yields; but the end of both paths should be equally satisfying towards the play style of the choice of gaming that brought people to those ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, and to that end, after looking at the game's current state and thinking some things through, I have come to believe that LDoN was a step in the right direction to balance the game's playability and enjoyment level. However, I believe it was rushed at the end, and should be reworked; as well as future content to be mindful of this trend. Thus:<br />
<br />
- There are numerous different maps for each LDoN type. Don't change these maps based on mission type; let there be a progression of missions. The more missions you have succeeded in one camp, then you can move on to these newer &quot;zones.&quot; Make them more of a challenge as the zones scale upwards, but keep in mind the difficulty setting as well as the player levels that go there. Scale up the rewards in the zones that take longer to get to, but make them more tricky to come by. <br />
<br />
- Along that same though, stop centering the game around the idea that &quot;killing x to yield y&quot; is the only way of adventure in this game. That's part of what yields to ideals such as the Holy Trinity. Find some innovative new ways to add challenges to encounters in general, without basing them around the kill and loot scheme.<br />
<br />
- Nodrop items are very similar to buyable LDoN gear, in that once replaced you've never really been able to do anything with the older gear. That much is true. However, I think it would be a far more interesting idea, if instead of selling augments or loot back to the vendors in exchange for a reduced number of points, players could transform the bought LDoN gear into a new stronger form of armor, with new augment slots. This could perhaps be done by adding droppable augments of an entirely new type (maybe type 9) in the last zones of any camp's missions (see my first point) that could be combined in the fountains to scale up the armor (making both the old armor and that special augment disappear, but yielding a totally new piece of armor with new unused augment spots.)<br />
<br />
- Fix the minor details of the game that are making it dull and unplayable. Add new models, and redo old enemy models. Who remembers when the new wolf models came out, and suddenly all the old world wolves were changed. Wasn't that neat? Just something that caused people to pause and say &quot;oh, hey that's cool.&quot; At the same time, don't make the game too computer intensive. Yes, some people are power gamers and have the resources to fund that hobby, but should that necessarily exclude other gamers from having the same gaming experience?<br />
<br />
- Stop releasing content that's buggy. I would accept later launch times if it meant more playable zones. Stop favoring customers that buy from stores instead of ordering online - what's the point of that? Stop making promises that lure certain types of players into buying an expansion, which later turn out to be untrue.<br />
<br />
- Design future content with the simple fact in mind that Everquest is a unique game filled with people that have different preferences. If you want to make money with such a potential-filled game, make it cater to the different types of customers. We are paying your bill, but we expect to be treated as loyal customers for it. Stop trying to fit circle-shaped players into square-shaped molds.<br />
<br />
- Go back through the game and look into a way of scaling up mob encounters with the levels and aa that the players attemting the encounter have. If this requires instancing certain zones, why not go for it? Tormax is permapharmed because he has some of the better droppable gear in the game that can sell for large amounts of money. But from a roleplay perspective, why wouldn't he be getting stronger as the time goes on? From a gaming perspective, why should he be trivialized as an encounter simply because players have become stronger than the Velious era had anticipated? A little something for all levels of gameplay isn't a bad idea. Make harder forms of encounters drop better quality, nodrop loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So much could be done with Everquest to make it so much better than it is. Mind you, not all of my ideas are perfect, I would never think they are. But they are ideas nontheless, and I'm sure that some of them are at least pointing in the right direction. Take them for what they're worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">And addition to the secondary LDoN goals... Make optional continuations in the 30 minutes after you've won. If the mission was a slaughter mission, give additional points for each mob killed after winning. Perhaps 1 point for every 3 mobs in a normal, 1:1 for hard. Additional points per extra item in a collect would be easy too. Rescue or assassinate missions would be a little tougher to do the same for, unless you just carbon copied X points for Y kills after winning... I'd just like to see more reward for a kick ass group in LDoN, other than getting to run and get another mission faster.</div></div><hr />

Let's all be honest and admit that VT keys, PoP flagging and GoD trials are speed bumps placed in the game to control the speed that hardcore raiders consume new content. They weren't put in the game for any other reason. And they weren't successful either because the very top guilds would plow right through the speedbumps and still reach end game content before Sony had finished it. My impression is that hardcore raiders consider these things a personal challenge<br />
<br />
So now that the speedbumps aren't required, or failed miserably, what purpose do they serve but to completely deny access to these zones to everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Raaj,<br />
<br />
On class balance. I've certainly made my views known. But I think what may not be clear is that some of them are widely shared by Warriors. So a brief recap.<br />
<br />
Our class description describes our class. Word for word it is most player's definition of what a tank is. We are and should remain the archetype - the Primary Tank.<br />
<br />
Other classes tank. It is their primary role in groups. While they are primarily tanks, in raids they are primarily secondary raid tanks. They addtank when adds are tanked, produce DPS, and otherwise, since they have spellbooks, cast spells to support the raid effort.<br />
<br />
When I created my character, I had a choice between leveling up an already much higher level Paladin or rerolling as a Warrior. I rerolled. I turned my back on being a second or third best tank with the most powerful spells in the game for a melee class and unrivaled versatility. I did not roll a Rogue or Monk - DPS was not a concideration.<br />
<br />
Warriors chose being the best tank. We live where others die. We have &quot;unmatched&quot; survivability.<br />
<br />
I agree Knights need to perform an addtank role superbly. I am not at all opposed to Knights receiving a burst mitigation ability if it is needed to perform that role and is not applicable to MTing raid boss mobs. Nor am I opposed to a Knight being put at the end of a MT rotation - after all available Warriors. Nor to SoE designing some raid boss mobs to be Knight preferred MT mobs. I point out however the four tank classes are and ought to be:<br />
<br />
Warrior - the hands down no question about it best able to survive the most brutal battles 100% Tank.<br />
<br />
Paladin - tank/priest. Raid addtank/spot healer/CC/stunner/buffer/curse remover. Ocassional MT when mobs are designed for that purpose.<br />
<br />
SK - tank/necro. Raid addtank/mob debuffer/DD/pet owner/aggro manipulater/DoTer. Ocassional MT when mobs are designed for that purpose.<br />
<br />
Ranger - melee damage/damage at a distance/limited add tank/limited CC (Rangers IMO get a bum deal).<br />
<br />
There is nothing (speaking as a guild's #4ish MT) that could compensate me for not having a nearly insurmountable advantage MTing Raid boss, red named, red splits, the ocassional exceptional yellow splits and adds, and MTing single-group exceptional hard hitting named mobs. Deny me or significantly share my MTing/Offtanking with other classes and my refusing a spellbook in order to be the best tank does not seem fairly compensated.<br />
<br />
Offer me DPS, Tendon Slice, etc. in place of the existing Warrior class defining ability or share that ability and you have eliminated the reason I chose my class and not another (or since playing a Paladin or Rogue wasn't interesting to me - leaving the game).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">First, we need to acknowledge the Planes of Power broke EverQuest.  Two years after it was released, only 378 guilds have entered the Elemental Planes. (http://www.critical.ne.jp/~d7/progress2004.htm ) That sounds like a lot, but if you assume that each guild has 100 players, that 37,800 subscribers or 37.8K/450K = 8.4% of their customers.  If only 8% of your customers are Elemental, why in the world would you design an expansion like Discord that is even harder?  What's even more ironic is the high-end guilds that PoP and Discord were designed for are the first ones that are going to jump ship when WoW is released leaving all that uber content for no one.<br />
<br />
Here's how PoP broke EverQuest:<br />
<br />
1) Ridiculous numbers requirement.  To beat these encounters with the proper gear and no LDoN args or Discord AA's, you needed 80+ people.  Today, guilds have mudflation to help them, but any encounter that needs more than 50 people with the gear available to them BEFORE doing the encounter is too big.  Period.  Discord dropped encounters down to 54 people.  I agree with that number, but it's a broken progression path.  Consider tuning PoP encounters.<br />
<br />
2) Bottleneck content.  Every encounter from PoJ Trials to Quarm should be fully instanced.  Bottlenecks suck.  Instead of developing a new expansion, go back and instance PoP.<br />
<br />
3) Ridiculous AA requirements. 60 AA's for 500 hps?  Please.  With 92% of the players not even in the EP's, do you realize how much REPETITIVE content is required to get those AA's?  &lt;Insert uber argument about the 92% of casual players just want hand-out's.&gt; (&lt;&lt;Insert counter argument that 92% of the subscribers are paying for content that they will never see and it's a broken business model that WoW will exploit.&gt;&gt;)<br />
<br />
4) Enormous time sink.  EQ is tuned for 5-6 hours per night to clear an expansion before the next one is released.  The problem is if you don't put in a base amount of time, your progression just doesn't slow down (as you would expect), it comes to a crawl.  Certain events take 4-8 hours just to complete (VT clearing, PoTime, Trials, etc.).  If these events have huge minimum times, the gap between the casual and power gamer is disproportionally huge.  It's not like you can do half of VT in one night and finish it the next -- unless it was instanced!  Instancing cuts the time sink way down.<br />
<br />
I'm not bitter against power gamers.  They have the time to play so more power to them.  Actually, I'm not bitter at all, but I do think that SoE has been overly catering to the power gamers because their website (FoH, LoS, AL, etc) entice the rest of us; however, power gamers have been advertising for WoW lately heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I remember fondly wandering into the Kunark zones with my level 16 gnecromagncer on Terris Thule...  and getting stomped hard... it's cool to push the envelope beyond the envelope's safety limits... we learn that way...  later I returned and made the Overthere my home, I'm much more popular in the Outpost than I am in Ak anon...   <br />
<br />
My froglok Warrior on Firiona Vie is well-equipped to handle content that he can't get to because he does not yet have the key and is a level shy, and if I'm wrong, if he can't handle it... let me find out the hard way, like I did with the Crag Beast Queen on day one of GoD...  &quot;Hey everybody! If we all gang up on it we can probably take the BIG turtle too!&quot;   ...ouch...  but fun....<br />
<br />
Class Balance is on the table? That's not comforting, I hear a lot of people talking about improving Knight's spellbooks, I respectfully submit that this is as unnecessary as giving them Defensive. Yes the straight casters are way ahead of them in spells, and we are way ahead of them in Tanking, that is the price of being a hybrid, they are way ahead of us on versatility and way ahead of the casters on survivability, that's what they do and what they are...  leave it alone. The best thing they can do for class balance is pat themselves on the back and eat a really good doughnut. Maybe something with chocolate...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Ok there has been alot of discussion about being able to progress thru the game. In Velious we all agree that this was available but in POP it disapeared. Flagging is one reason. I agree with Haass here. Let me try Sol Tower. If I get stomped so be it. Also a large reason Ornate is so rare is that alot of the higher guilds kill the named mobs for the ornate drops to sell in bazaar for alts etc..Lets be honest the so called uber guilds can one grp most of the names in BoT towers where as the lower guilds it takes a full raid. The uber guilds can get the kills much faster especially if they already know the spawn times. Same is true for names in Tactics that are on 24 timers. This did not happen in Velious. The larger guilds went thru the content and then moved to higher areas, the smaller guilds were able to do the content just took them longer.Why, because the armor pieces were no drop. The uber guilds geared up and left the zone.This makes it alot harder to sell (via MQ) than just putting the mold/pattern on your trader. So now instead of moving to higher mobs and leaving the old content they do the old content and new for the drops that are trivial to them but very hard for the rest. But since they have killed the spawn it is not available for the mid range guilds to try and get it. <br />
<br />
I would like to see a set of armor perhaps between SS and Ornate. My guilld did Kael and then moved to ToV as most did. Why not add a third option after this. I heard they might redo Veeshans Peak. Alter the loot table an that creates another raid type zone for the mid range guilds.<br />
<br />
I do not know what the solution is. I am not sure than any answer is absolute. These are just some of the things I have seen from my little side of the EQ coin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">I've double boxed in hatesfury. <br />
<br />
I wasn't talking about double boxing. I was talking about actually WORKING for the gear that drops. A bit of risk. A bit of danger. The loot that drops there is pretty good for the level it's aimed at, the zone design is interesting and unique, there are plenty of named/ph cycles within reach of a single camp. Getting a reward equivalent to the effort you put in - a strange concept it seems.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I'm not going to change how I play the game to accommodate how you think I should be playing.  And I'm not going to change how I want to play the game to accommodate how SoE thinks I should be playing.  Either SoE makes some reasonable accommodations to how people like me want to play the game or they accept the loss of our business. <br />
<br />
What *DO* you want? All I'm hearing is about how you can't get the best armor in the game, and can't be bothered to go out and improve your armor because it involves some effort. What accomodations do you actually want? Qvic armor dropping from easy to dual box, easy to access, easy to CR from, easy to find up, fast respawn mobs? Say you get all these items you want without putting in the effort to get them, say you logged on tommorrow, killed a giant rat outside freeport, and looted everything I have in my magelo, what would you do then? You say what you DON'T want, how about saying what you DO want, and how it'll stop you from wanting something completely different once you've got it?<br />
<br />
<br />
 Now, regardless of where you think we could go play and gain loot, I seriously doubt that's in GoD.  Why exactly would we be purchasing OoW, the follow on to GoD, if we're getting zero utilization from GoD?<br />
<br />
I agree completely. There's very little for the casual gamer in GoD. Don't buy it if you don't want to, or just buy it for whatever small part you do want from it. Kinda like us 'ubers' had to buy LoY for the charm slot and added vault space, and LDoN for the ability to buy augs like anger3. There was very little else in those two expansions for us because, guess what - they weren't tailored towards us.<br />
<br />
We've just passed 1 year (12 months, 52 weeks) of farming PoTime. An entire YEAR when the way WE like to play the game consisted of one single solitary zone. We've started Phase1 of PoTime 82 seperate times. How can you honestly bitch about us getting a new bone to play with after AN ENTIRE YEAR OF THE SAME CONTENT?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sebilis, Chardok, LGuk, SolB, Howling Stones, Veksar, what do all these zones have in common? <br />
<br />
Let's see...<br />
<br />
They're all still there?<br />
They're all still dropping the same loot?<br />
They're all still giving the same exp?<br />
They're all completely empty of players?<br />
They're all zones many of the people of the appropriate level to hunt in them have never even entered?<br />
<br />
So many similarities, hard to pick which one you're asking for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you have very selective hearing that doesn't actually hear what I'm saying at all.  And way to pick apart a post to try and discredit the content, here's what I actually said, in context:<br />
<br />
Sebilis, Chardok, LGuk, SolB, Howling Stones, Veksar, what do all these zones have in common? They, at the time they were introduced, dropped loot appropriate for the people playing there. There was progress available for people just going out to have &quot;a good time&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, lemme zone in and get stomped.  Poking into some of the early GoD zones (and getting stomped) was actually fun.  Lemme tag along under someone's protection to see some of the stuff, even if it's gonna be a horrible CR if I get spotted.  *Lockable* content could be handled on an encounter basis, such as the PoI dragon ... collect a few pieces, or do a faction quest, and get stomped after you open the door, if you dunno what you're doing.  Many of the key quest are a drag, but that was still a better solution than the bottleneck/logjam that are the PoP type of flags.<br />
<br />
LDoN :: Gimme two hours in the dungeon.  Every.  Single. Time.  If my team finishes quickly, and we have a named on track a long ways through the dungeon, let part of our reward for efficiency be as much time left of the two hours to get to it, or try.  Or even, just to keel a bunch of stuff that's still lingering in there.  Secondary objectives would be terriffic too (Collect 32 Glimmering Nickels ... and kill Bobby the Coinmaster for bonus pts ...).  <br />
<br />
While they're about it, tweak the risk/reward for various missions - I think rescues are the most fun, but the huge annoyance of extra time spent to clear the route, and walk (arg!) the rescuee back to the front door makes those a *no can do* compared to the doable points of slaughter/collect.  Clean up rescue pathing too - the last one I ever attempted, the rescuee refused to pass an empty room, giving the *I see monsters!* message.  Collect missions shouldn't give the same payout as rescues, and/or rescues should get more time for completion.  My groups don't do anything but collections, and it's dull.<br />
<br />
Partial refunds for gear would be nice ... the timesink for a full suit is just enormous.  Heck, the timesink for finding a group to go in with you is pretty sick some nights ...<br />
<br />
Demorgoth, you may not know how the non-uber gamer plays, but you're coming across needlessly snotty about it.  Just a heads up, in case you don't mean to.  But FWIW *a reward equivalent to the effort you put in* is a strange concept in EQ - usually the effort trebles or quadruples the reward, at the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely Raaj.  Lets say for arguments sake that in 5 more expansions, I'm able to hit 2kac, 10khp. I still can't get into the elemental planes.  Why is that?  I'm not powerful enough to do the content there just because I can't get 65 friends to kill Rallos?<br />
<br />
It's also good from a logistical standpoint.  By opening up elemental planes, they've also created what...6 more zones that people like me can be working on?  These are zones that they don't have to design, all they have to do is open the fucking door and people like me who are chomping at the bit of the content we have....people who can literally 2 box in BoT and HoH...we'll take care of ourselves for a LONG time to come.<br />
<br />
I know first thing I'd do if I got elemental access.  I'd spend a fuckload of plat, get 250 fletching, and make myself, and everyone in my guild, each elemental bow.  That's a tall order right there, probably take me a good 6 months to a year to do, but I'd do it dammit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">how about we scale encounters by total group worth? anyone that has played fallout tactics knows what i mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
The effect on the armor and the amount of it(vengance, FT etc) is worth so many points, the stats on a certain slot are worth so many points, focus effects are worth so many points and AA's are worth so many points<br />
<br />
have the game total up the person's gear/level/aa worth and add it to the party total, do this for each party member, then pick a zone instance that was made for their level of achivement.<br />
<br />
this way, casual people could hit AoW and get a BoC, and elemental and time people could go hit AoW and get a DBoW equililant.<br />
<br />
anyone else think this would be neat?<br />
<br />
i mean, if you have to make a gimp rollos because you still want to force people thru choke point at least you wont be giving the casual players the same loot, and those same casual players can come back and do the normal version after gearing up.<br />
<br />
personally i think that by combining a need for a large number of players and massive time sinks they fucked up PoP, PoP could be so much more if they would make the elementals a little easyer to reach, time sinks were ok back when you only needed 2 groups because you had a few friends with no lives, but now you have to find 60+ people who are level 65 with 100 AAs and ornate with no lives to move on in this game.<br />
<br />

My favorite EQ memory (and my one source of fleeting fame on Brell) was the day I somehow ended up in a VS raid at 40. And, no, this was back when VS was still a wiper for second tier guilds. Did I get my ass stomped? Yep. Was it fun? Absolutely. Had VS been in a keyed zone, I'd have never even seen him, let alone gone toe to toe with him for all of 3 seconds. Keys, flags, progression blocks all keep people from stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I've been playing since later Kunark. I've got well over 100 days /played on Partha. And in that time logged on, I've seen more and more of EQ closed to the players who don't have large guilds or the players who don't/can't/are unable to change their lifestyle to accomodate a game. Screw all that. EQ didn't become #1 because it had the most cockblocking timesinks of any game in history.<br />
<br />
And for the folks who seem to have the idea that we want it all on a platter, you're wrong. Dead wrong. But if it takes you 200 hours to acquire something, I should have the expectation of being able to get something similiar in 300-400 hours of my 'lesser play'. Maybe not as good, but not something so bad that I'm half the Warrior AC/HP wise that some /assist bitz with a shiny guildtag is.</div></div><hr />

If xyz class isn't there, perhaps.. don't drop something only they can use. Especially annoying on instanced content, and disheartening on raid content.<br />

<br />
Absolutely, and, with graveyards alleviating all risk in PoP zones, why not? I for one would stop doing Tak adventures. It takes me roughly 30-35 hours per piece of royal attendant armor. I'm not sure first hand what the ornate drop rate is in Sol Ro Tower, but from what I've heard it's pretty good. <br />
<br />
I play a cleric who's EP flagged. Many even/blue con mobs in Plane of Water hit in the 600s. My warrior, who's not EP flagged, has taken out Laef and other BoT wing bosses in groups of 5, unslowed. I think I'd do alright against the average Triloun.<br />
<br />
I just won't get a chance to find out. <br />
<br />
The flags are an unnecessary roadblock. Heroism in the current EQ is defined as being warrior #5 in a raid of 60. I'd like to see heroism be up to the player. If I want to solo General Reparm at level 60, I should be able to. I'm not saying I should (or could) win, but I ought to be able to try, without having to be a small component in a mostly mindless collective.<br />
<br />
Ferubi, Barindu, and certain other zones in GoD are not keyed. They are also exceedingly difficult. As a result, few people go there to exp, even though they could (and I suspect more would if there were PoP-style graveyards, or a GY for all these zones at the wayfarer camp in Natimbi). I think that if the elemental planes were opened, there would be a bunch of people trying out the zones early on, but after a couple weeks those that can't handle it won't return. People are, by and large, looking to advance their characters. Repeatedly dieing doesn't do that, and that kind of negative reinforcement will shunt those not able to kill EP trash mobs to those zones they can exp in.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, I'd like to see a medium difficulty level added to 65 LDoNs, with mobs hitting in the 600-700 range. The 990 hitters in the current high risk adventures really make it tough on those tanks and slowers not in raiding guilds, who find the 300 hitters trivial. Award 75 or 80 points for such a mission. I'd also like to see the pacify resistance removed, or reduced.</div></div><hr />

Quote from Lochr<br />
<br />
I agree totally. When PoP first came out I was playing my shaman. We kept getting dusted in PoN by the Hobgoblins and the trains in POI. Well I quit playing there until we could handle it. Even with a 96% rez and PoP experience dieing several times is not very productive. By the time we went back to PoP zones to exp alot had moved on to tier 2. This same thing happens as long as there is a progression to move to. Thats why BoT is the nuthouse it is. Most of these are lvl 65 chars hopinng for a drop that are not in the EP guilds. Granted some of the people in BoT are buttheads noobs losers whatever you want to call them. Most however are decent players with restrcited  schedules. They are not dumb just not able to play 7 days a week.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">A possible approach that occurs to me with regards to the availability of gear is the blacksmithing components that drop in the elemental planes.  If they actually increased the drop rate so the components for livestone armor, farwater plate, and so forth were actually fairly common drops, that might mean that the blacksmiths quickly filled the needs for better gear.  It seems kind of a shame not to actually see significant amounts of a droppable player made armor that has been in the game since the beginning of PoP being made since the components are so freaking rare.

Some of the stuff we're talking about here is true almost from the beginning of the game. <br />
Consider crafted armor quests. How can you possibly convince a group of friends to do one of these quests, if this would be an upgrade for you? Kill 10 spiders in EK and buy the stuff, which will have either been farmed by one player who outgrew it long ago, or is simply being ditched in the bazaar. Almost every single quest in the game is like this. A few quests are still being done, and SOE should take a hard look at what those quests do, and try to make more of 'em. Many of them are either progressive, or the reward is no drop; in most cases you do not have to convince 5-30 other friends to sit for hours killing the same mob over and over for a drop that benefits one player, and which results in a dropable item that sells in the bazaar for an amount of plat that you can buy online for cash that you can earn in 15 minutes of work at Burger King (where at least you get to stand up while flipping the same burger over and over again, and where everyone, not just one guy, gets a paycheck, even if it's not a living wage).<br />
<br />
Consider the cobalt drop rates in Karnor's. Why would a group go to that zone so that a warrior who needed the upgrade could get it? And you're not going to get a pick up group there, lol. What's in it for the other players, except the certain knowledge that exp is better elsewhere, and they're not getting any reward?<br />
Dropable items that are nice are farmed by individual players who are too advanced to use the item, but can sell the item and use the cash to buy gear that they are not advanced enough to get themselves--gear someone else is farming.<br />
<br />
These are just examples: I don't mean the game would be fixed if crafted armor were easier to quest. But this is the state of things throughout old world zones, and why a large number of zones in this game (not just old world) have no one in them; it's the state of things for tradeskillers, where stuff you make is simply not useable by the time you can make it.<br />
<br />
I think instanced zones are helpful, though LDoN is pretty boring after a while. One of the reasons that you can get an LDoN group is that everyone in the group might get a reward. This is not true for many non-instanced zones. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of zones in this game that are locked to many players who are not sufficiently flagged or whatever. Like Haass, I'd like to go places I might not have any business being. That's how it was when I first stumbled upon ogre camps in West K, and it was pretty damn fun. Besides, there have been times recently when the zone I feared most was PoK, because of computer crashes.<br />
<br />
But why not more mobs like Vox/Naggy? If you too high a level, poof, you're gone. This would make more sense if they're going to increase the top level to 70, but you could layer such things in lots of zones (Why not? these zones are empty now--go to Runnyeye and see for yourself). You could make it tough and accessible only by level-appropriate toons, you could spread the reward among classes (so, if the group needs a bard, teh bard has reason to come; if the croup needs a cleric, the cleric has reason to come, etc). <br />
I'm using low level examples, but I think some mix of instanced zones (like LDoN, but perhaps with a bit more variety, and perhaps a greater gradiant of difficulty), and some serious work on making Everquest more like Everquest and less like EverFarm, would be a big help to casual players.<br />
<br />
Do I care if there are warriors out there with multiples of my AC? Heck no-- I think it's cool, given the time it takes them to get there, and all I have to say is grats! But it does annoy me that the exponentially fastest way for me to get an upgrade is to buy it from these guys (who, eventually, can't even use the plat themselves if the casino isn't open). It annoys me that I can't get adventure points fast enough to upgrade myself to keep up with my level. <br />
<br />
I've mentioned in other posts that I'm just not going to buy plat, because I don't like to have one hand paying money to play a game and the other hand paying money not to play the same game. But it's very, very annoying to feel like an idiot for not buying online plat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And casuals who are able to get farther means that they are going to be a lot closer to being upto speed when they are recruited into the top end guilds. <br />
<br />
And, thinking on it, I can't beleive that SoE has make the same mistake TWICE. There is no differance between defenisve tanking/kniht tanking and the differance between uber challenging content/casual challening content. <br />
<br />
Either give knights defeinsive/evasive, so that what challenges a warriorr does not blick a knight or take the damned abilities away from us.  And then give us a real tanking differance.<br />
<br />
Non-defeinsive/evasive warrior tanking is too close to knight tanking. Defensive/eavsive is just way to dominant.  With the current set up there is no way to make content that is knight/warrior tankable only. <br />

Go away (don't post about Defensive) or I shall taunt thee a second time.<br />
For a long time I had a Sebilite Croaking Dirk for agro.<br />
Sebilite Croaking Dirk is not an aggro weapon. This comment perhaps puts the remainder of your post in perspective.<br />
<br />
Defensive has been cited by SoE as a Warrior class defining ability. SoE has acknowleged it will not be shared. A pure class's class defining ability should neither be shared nor removed.<br />
<br />
Knights and Warriors are different classes with different raid roles. The Warrior/Knight tanking &quot;gap&quot; is no wider than the Warrior/Paladin healing/buffing gap. The Warrior/Knight tanking &quot;gap&quot; should not be narrowed, rather Knights should excell at add tanking and their spells should have impact on raid success.<br />
<br />
Just like the Warrior/Knight tanking &quot;gap&quot;, I'm not at all convinced that the uber/casual &quot;gap&quot; should be closed. I aggree casual players should have group and tiny raid activities that make the game fun and that progress should be possible.<br />
<br />
But, just like chosing to play a Warrior and not having a spellbook, chosing to (or being able to make that choice) put in 400+ days played with 100% attendance in guild raids vs. the hardest content you can handle for four years should pay dividends. One of those benefits is killing Quarm.<br />

There was a time when SCD was as good as anything but epics, which very few had.  There was a time when my dual jade maces were considered the best warrior weapons in the game.  Seb dirk isn't an aggro weapon now, but it was in kunark and early velious, and that's what Kailyn is talking about.<br />
<br />
I would be willing to bet Kailyn was writing guides on playing a warrior before you knew how to equip your newbie sword. 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">BB, my friend, you are wrong about the SCD back in the day. As I recall (and remember this is going back 2+ years probably)--one of the dominant theories about agro was that the frequency of attack was king. I do remeber testing several setups, and that worked the best for from the feed back I got back in group. <br />
<br />
The SCD had the advantages of being hard hitting and fast for its era. Sure I would have raithered a WS, but one has never made its way to me. The SDC, otoh, dropped for me on a trak raid. Piared, with as I recall, as Frostbrigner (birnger? 12/22, some proc ax) was about the best I could do.  I do remember trying it with a BP and that was less reliable. (And I rather depend on straight agro then procs...)<br />
<br />
And I to agree that doing the hardest content should mean there is a differance between us. I haven't even mentioned time access for cauals. Heck I did not even think it as it is something I would like to be able to earn. However I can tell you that if the gap between the causals and the ubers is not closed, I will stay quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">well the thing is there needs to be balance, just like with warriors and knights.<br />
<br />
Right now I think of the Uber Vs. Casual is about as bad as warriors vs. knights back in kunark.<br />
<br />
We need to strengthen PoP progression to allow more players the chance to move up to elementals, it is my solid belief that the stagnation in the game is caused from BoT being the last new zone most casual 65 players spend their days in before cancling their accounts.<br />
<br />
The gap has gotten too wide, i think hardcore players should have a 1/3 advantage over us, not be twice the stats as we see now, opening up easyer to attain ornate (sol ro tower)and the ability to get the parts to craft the elemental crafted armor would do much in making it a 1/3 instead of a 1 whole advantage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">Brutul,<br />
<br />
Oh, I absolutely agree that among weapons that were not aggro weapons, SCD and Jade Mace were once hard to beat for DPS and that people were not very sophisticated about the mechanics of aggro back then. Heck, as you may recall the &quot;best&quot; Warrior weapon was briefly the Moss Covered Twig. People actually thought high Warrior DPS meant good aggro. However, most of us now know that the Red Blade of Strategy and SSoY were aggro weapons. SCD was not. I was aware of this from about level 25 on up when I discovered 2 Gnollhide Lariats interferred with mobs that cast spells and kept my partner safe from being hit (I partnered with an Enchanter). Until I left Mistmoore those were my weapons of choice vs. casters.<br />
<br />
Frankly the whole aggro issue was terrible ill-treatment of Warriors. Had the taunt button been intellegently designed in the first place, Warriors would have had a much wider weapon selection. As things were, the Epic, Frostbringer, and Willsapper (and much later BoC) were THE major goal for Warriors with in some cases a maximum drop rate of 52 a year (I was shocked when that stooopid dragon did NOT drop a Green Scale). Talk about cockblocking an entire class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">Well, not sure how this thread got off track but another idea I would like see put in place is the implementation of level limits on ALL items. I wish they had set it up like this from the beginning. Minimum levels for every item, and nothing no drop except special things (maybe various quest rewards, GM event items, special promos, etc. Too many items to revisit at this point, so I doubt we will see this happen. Would fix twinking and make hard to get items available to the casual player at the cost of platinum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">Yea, we know that now, but in early velious most people considered fast weapons the best for aggro, and were you to ask on the boards what weapon to use for aggro, the consensus would have been to use a SCD over a SSoY for aggro, mabye even over a frostbringer.  Based on advice from the steel warrior I mainhanded a jade mace with a frostbringer offhand for a while, but eventually switched them because it was pretty easy to see the mob turn around when the frostbringer procced.  The point is that having used an SCD as an aggro weapon was by no means a sign of poor game knowledge in those days, and Kailyn was one of the most knowledgeable members of the warrior community during that era.<br />

Anyway, no need to further derail the thread, I just didn't want to see you ragging on someone who has contributed as much to this community over the years as Kailyn.</div></div><hr />

Let me give you a little dose of what I like to call reality.  EverQuest is a game of progression.<br />
<br />
Haass, you mention that you were a-ok! with VP, ST and VT being keyed.  Those were considered top-end zones during their time, and even beyond.  Yet every single one of those zones required at least 1 raid to gain access in their day -- Trakanon, first brood dragons, and Emperor.  Mass entry to these places didn't turn into a 1-2 group affair until long after, as the average power scale shifted upward via mudflation, level increases, aa, etc, and the mobs required to gain entry were not as heavily contested, or nerfed down.<br />
<br />
In time, the power curve will increase to a point that the EP and beyond will be much easier to gain access to, just as content has in the past, so I'm not sure I understand your argument.  It sounds like you're saying that it's ok for older content (that once required raiding to gain entry to) to have entry requirements, but newer content (that currently require raiding to gain entry to) should somehow be opened up to you with far less effort than SOE intends at this time.<br />
<br />
To me, it sounds like now that you're past that content, and it's old and only requires a group or two max to gain entry to, you're fine with it being keyed.  By that same rationale, I predict that a year or two from now, you'll be in the Tower of YouMustKillTheseBigBadGuysToProgressBeyondThisPoint, whining that you can't get upgrades from the next zone b/c it requires raiding, but that you're perfectly fine with the EP requiring god kills b/c you can knock out EP and Time access with just a few groups.  For the same reasons you couldn't walk in and kill Emp with a few groups back then, you can't walk in and kill RZtW with a few groups now.  Does all this make sense?  This is the nature of progression in EQ, and has been since the beginning.  There are plenty of gear options in PoP and LDoN without EP gear, just as there were plenty of gear options in Velious without being able to do NToV.  I suppose about the time you're all flagged up for the EP, you'll be whining about GoD and how you can't get Vadd's because it requires raiding to get to.<br />
<br />
And Gerick, since when does a poster's post-count dictate the amount of wisdom that can be gleaned from their posts?  If post-counts are the measure of someone's wisdom, I guess we should all just start calling you Jesus from here on out, right?</div></div><hr />

Please elaborate on these plenty of gear options in PoP, setting aside ornate for a moment, what other options are you thinking of that don't require a raid force and a nightly commitment?

<br />
As far as LDoN is concerned, I think Romidar in one of his posts over on MB really hit the nail on the head.  The fact that LDoN has mid level rewards isn't attractive because once you spend the points you still have to go back through and re-earn those same points while continuing on to the next upgrade.  Having to earn the same number of points two, three, four or more times as you progress from one upgrade to the next doesn't make sense so people hold out for the biggest possible reward to minimize that factor.  Which means they really don't see mid level rewards unless they're, pardon the phrase, stupid.</div></div><hr />

To me, it sounds like now that you're past that content, and it's old and only requires a group or two max to gain entry to, you're fine with it being keyed.  By that same rationale, I predict that a year or two from now, you'll be in the Tower of YouMustKillTheseBigBadGuysToProgressBeyondThisPoint, whining that you can't get upgrades from the next zone b/c it requires raiding, but that you're perfectly fine with the EP requiring god kills b/c you can knock out EP and Time access with just a few groups.  For the same reasons you couldn't walk in and kill Emp with a few groups back then, you can't walk in and kill RZtW with a few groups now.  Does all this make sense?  This is the nature of progression in EQ, and has been since the beginning.  There are plenty of gear options in PoP and LDoN without EP gear, just as there were plenty of gear options in Velious without being able to do NToV.  I suppose about the time you're all flagged up for the EP, you'll be whining about GoD and how you can't get Vadd's because it requires raiding to get to.<br />

And Gerick, since when does a poster's post-count dictate the amount of wisdom that can be gleaned from their posts?  If post-counts are the measure of someone's wisdom, I guess we should all just start calling you Jesus from here on out, right?<br />
<br />
I am well aware of &quot;curve of power and progression&quot; and the reason older content doesnt need to be touched is it wasnt borked.<br />
<br />
You hit the planes(for berserker*now called bladesmen) or You hit the coldain armor quests, then you would try vindi, after a few wins you would do skyshrine armor, then you would go back and do the statue and AoW, get some upgrades and then try tranix, frostweaver and yelnik etc and get into ST, you would be killing things that are giving you decent xp and decent armor, and it dropped from everything there, but it was rare, no 6 hour spawns, no training another group to beat eachother to the sand named.... <br />
<br />
The problems with ornate drops are the drop rate, the respawn timer, and their locations.<br />
<br />
1) a CHANCE at ornate once every 6 hours? come on, it should be denfinate at that long a wait, the caster toilet paper sure is<br />
2) there are more XY type ornate then more XX type, for example why is an ornate helm 250k to 300k when a ornate turban is 5k? it is up to the dev team to make it a bit more equal, personaly i think it has to do with there are more plate classes than silk classes<br />
3) ornate drops at a higher rate in a zone where players outgrow it, and farm it, and some parts only drop in the EP planes, there is no reason for this<br />
<br />
<br />
If you up the ornate drop rates and spread around the tables to drop in a pattern more like the kael arena then you will allow a dramatic increase of all casual 65 players, and that will increase the power of PUraiders all around, people might even make it to the elemental planes with pick up raids, hell we just dropped MM with PUraids on the emar server for the first time.<br />
<br />
like i said, the gap is getting way to big, have you ever looked out over a long rotten bridge, and thought &quot;there is no way in hell i can make it over that&quot;(its rotten now, it was new and working when you crossed, plus you didnt have to contend with cockblocks and farmers when you first crossed) progression zones and paths get harder to do over time as people quit the game and people loose interesting in doing them, i havent seen carpin done for weeks and ive been looking, i even tried to start my own PU, zero interest.<br />
<br />
you need to share EP a bit more, sorry i had to tell you but you have GoD and soon, OoW to move into and take up space, your letting the zones go tragicly underused.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">I'm still interested in understanding why the challenge to an encounter involves getting a full raid together and not the skill vs difficulty of the encounter. Make raid type encounters drop more loot (there are more people invoved) compared to single group encounters, but do provide single group all the way up to full raid encounters. We've seen with LDoN that mob difficultly can be scaled to make this work. A &quot;raid type&quot; encounter should just require a more forethought and planning than general xp encounters. The trade of being that they drop more loot for the higher difficulty/preparation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u161"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p161">Haass, you mention that you were a-ok! with VP, ST and VT being keyed. Those were considered top-end zones during their time, and even beyond. Yet every single one of those zones required at least 1 raid to gain access in their day -- Trakanon, first brood dragons, and Emperor. Mass entry to these places didn't turn into a 1-2 group affair until long after, as the average power scale shifted upward via mudflation, level increases, aa, etc, and the mobs required to gain entry were not as heavily contested, or nerfed down. <br />
<br />
  Unless I'm completely missing Haass's point, he doesn't WANT access to the uber zone of the era. He DOESN'T want Time. He DOESN'T want VT. He wants the EPs, where he could actually go and get experience and tradeskill drops. He wants Tower of Sol Ro, where he can get ornate drops. He doesn't want raid targets blocking him from single groupable zones.<br />
<br />
  Personally, I don't think those zones should be opened for everyone. The influx of stupid newbies would ruin it for anyone with half a brain. Getting trained in PoWater, for example, would just blow. And it would happen... ALOT. I was in BoT when it was still keyed, and then when it wasn't. When it was keyed, there were rarely trains and there were much fewer people that couldn't handle the zone. Now, it's train and noob central. <br />
<br />
  What I would love to see is alternate flagging quests for all PoP zones other than Time, for starters. Every zone below Sol Ro had a quest you could do with a single group, or at most a couple groups. If they just implemented more of these quests, that actually tested skill and equipment, you could filter out the people that really SHOULDN'T be in those zones, while allowing general access. If you ever did the BoT key, you'd know that the normal giants in PoStorms hit harder than experience mobs in BoT, and frankly take some effort and tactics to kill. <br />
<br />
  Let the general population have a shot at the EPs, but make them work for it. Don't give it away for free. That's what progression is all about.</div></div><hr />

Fuckwit ubers are no different than fuckwit noobs.  At least fuckwit noobs get out of zones after they die a few times.

Really.  You can single group trakanon now, without very high end gear at all.  I did it, I had a blast.<br />
<br />
I could probably take 2 groups and drop a first brood dragon and get access to ST.  Vex thal would be a bit of a bitch, but I don't think you could do the Emp without emp gear with under about 40 people.  <br />
<br />
Do you honestly see Rallos Zek being done by people who don't have elemental gear with a single group?  EVER?  If it was a reasonable target, I wouldn't be worrying about it, and eventually I'd be able to get past him.  But what kind of fucking stats would I need to take down Rallos with my group of 10-12?  <br />
<br />
And why is that?  Could I not do things in the EP's with 10-12?  I think I could.  Nay, I know I could, because I've seen magelos of people who obviously have a RZ kill, and I could hold my ground with a lot of them.  Either they don't have the AA's I do or they don't have the overall gear quality I do (IE, they have 1 or 2 good items and the rest is shit).  So I could do the content that's being blocked off....so why am I blocked off from it?  So you guys can corner the market on the Stonewood bows?

  The fact is, the more time you've played the better you tend to be. Are there idiots at all levels? Yeah, there are. Are there bad players at all levels? Yep. Do casual players tend to be worse players than &quot;ubers&quot;? Yes. It's a simple fact. THE MORE YOU DO SOMETHING, THE BETTER YOU ARE AT IT. <br />
<br />
  Sure, noobs will give up after dying after a few tries... But how many noobs are there? I'll give you a hint... A WHOLE FUCKING LOT. Each noob wants a shot at it, and there are a lot more noobs than ubers. And guess what? The more people there are in a zone, uber or not, the more trains there will be.<br />
<br />
  Regardless, my point has nothing to do with uber vs noob. This idea is based entirely off of quests already in the game, designed specifically for allowing single/small groups to progress. You'd think that access like this would make you happy... Instead of giving something to you for free, it gives you a reasonable way to progress with your core group. That's what you want, right? Single group, non-raid progression?<br />
<br />
  Have you done your BoT key Haass? I can't personally comment on the Tactics key quest at all, because I haven't done it or read up on it. The BoT key, the PoJ trials... Those are the quest types I'd like to see for the upper PoP zones. Difficult, requiring some tactics, but possible without a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry. Did not rag, but did make a pointed comment. I'll accept that someone back then could (as did apparantly the majority of Warriors) mistake a Sebilite Croaking Dirk for an aggro weapon and hope that my greater point is made:<br />
<br />
Seeing an ~386HP Warrior advantage plus Defensive mean that yes indeed anyone could ultimately perform the MTing role.<br />
<br />
Seeing what appeared to be a minor aggro deficiency result in Warriors being fairly commonly /lfg during much of LDoN.<br />
<br />
Seeing acknowldged poor encounter design evolve into a Knight crusade to either have a nice big bite of Defensive or have it removed from the game even after content was adjusted.<br />
<br />
Considering that in many ways only the ability to absorb that initial contact shock for three minutes when MTing a raid boss mob gives Warriors a raid MTing role until the encounter becomes trivial (see PoTime, Arch Overseers, etc.), my hair stands up whenever I see a sub-6500HP Knight or Warrior post 'I know, lets fix everything and either give Knights Defensive or remove it from Warriors!'.<br />
<br />
My impresion is that they aren't usually in touch with high level raid boss mob tanking or how tenuous the Warrior role really is unless Knights can not easily co-opt it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for calmly pointing out that some of these players do have game knowledge even if its not specificly in difficult GoD content, which is the only content in which a tanking imbalance has been alledged.<br />
<br />
I agree that in friends and family type guilds Tank Parity is much more important than complete and utter Warrior spellbook inferiority and loss of a role Warriors have had for four years.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">BB--I for one strongly belevie that defensive/evasive is bad for warriors and probably bad for EQ. Its one of many things that does not scale well (slow comes to mind as another big example). <br />
<br />
The problem comes in when you want to make and encounter that is actaully tankabel by knihgts but not trival for warriors. With EQ currently you can't. Of course if you take away our unique roll of defensive/evasive you have to give warriors a fairly big bone. One which can be tough to define...due to limitations of the engins you can easily (as a casual) have enough AC/HP for any given encounter and deminishing returns come on real hard after certain points. And the tanks well enough syndrom hit us non-uber warrior even harder than those lucky enough to have taunt blow/enraging blow weapons. <br />
<br />
And the ability to use our weaponshield disc (who's name of course escapes me because I NEVER used it becaue it ate defensive) for the firrst 15 seconds fo getting a CH chain settleed down is probably even bigger than the next 3 minutes of reduced damange.<br />
<br />
From what Ihave seen posted in other forums, the tuning of GoD did not work as intended. Now most chain classes can tank there and since perception is everything, all knights in all zones are seen as poor tankers because of their former weakness in GoD.  And that kind of damage to a class can be as damaging to the player base as anything else. <br />
<br />
And something else to think about--defensive was never, ever thought of a tanking disapline until the playerbase got their hands on it. It was seen as a tool to allow warriors to get the hell out of Dodge while everyone else gated, FDed, LoHed when the pull went bad and the warrior was left holding the bag. Franky I think EQ would be better off without defensive and warriors getting a perminant mini-defensive. This allows designers to get encounters that don't either bore warriors or blick knights (or should that be bore ubers or blick serious?).</div></div><hr />

I guess we will have to disagree. When Kunnark came out I made a choice between being a one-dimentional absolute best Tank (Warrior) and being a lesser Tank with an unrivaled (for a melee) spellbook and versatility. I retired a level 50 Paladin.<br />
<br />
While most players used Furious (that the auto-reposte disc you were refering to) vs. VS early on, using Defensive as a tanking discipline against the Drolvarg Captain followed in hot pursuit. Defensive was the reason I knew Warriors would finally be the Primary Tank they were always meant to be and why I knew my Paladin would never be a raid MT ever again (MTing Vox once was big time fun though - thanks to my abilty to heal and LoH, I lived. Thanks to my ability to Res, I put a couple of Clerics back in action after Vox died).<br />
<br />
There is only one area where I ever expected to have major tanking advantages - hard hitting mobs. Defensive insures that such a major advantage does not spill over into normal experiance groups and give Warirors an unfair advantage. Giving Warriors more AC or HP's would not accomplish this.<br />
<br />
I frankly expect nearly all mobs that are tankable by Knights to be fairly trivial to the 100% pure absolute best tank - Warirors. But SoE CAN insure that's not the case. At the appropriate progress level I could not (and I tried) tank Grieg Venificus. To this day I think Knights should MT CT and Inny in PoTime. I've done CT often and it's a real ordeal for a Wariror.<br />
<br />
It's difficult to understand chain classes can effectively tank in GoD and get groups while always superior tanking Knights can not, unless you are refering to Weapon Shield, which I've steadily contended IS entirely appropriate to give to the other hybrid melees with a taunt button - Knights. But which, like Defensive, is not needed for experiance grouping and shouldn't be needed for addtanking.<br />
<br />
I understand being /lfg. When Warriors had difficulty finding experiance groups because of aggro problems I re-equipped my Paladin and leveled him to 53 (and soloed a Druid to 56) and logged in my main mostly on raid days. Yes, the possibility of MTing on raid day despite being otherwise /lfg was sufficient to keep me playing.<br />
<br />
The converse is also true - the possibility of not MTing on raid day (I'm currently a #4ish tank), not offtanking red mobs, etc. probably would be sufficient to prevent me from logging in despite not being /lfg on non-raid days.<br />
<br />
We can, I suppose, agree it's a mess. To be honest, I'm expecting SoE to drop the ball and motivate me to give the game up. Removing Defensive or sharing it with Knights would probably do the job - soloing a Druid was not that much fun for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">1st:  This is a good thread, and thanks for soliciting input Raaj.<br />
<br />
2nd:  I think the term &quot;casual player&quot; is being misused.  Casuals really have never had it better:  Affordable cultural/bazaar gear that puts them about where ubers were in SoV era, LDoN items and augs, higher EXP zones for more exp/min than ever before, many decent zones go unused so no camp contention (although many static drops are still farmed), easy travel, and the benefit of new levels and AA to try older content.<br />
<br />
Not that I know what to call them, but it's the next step up, those who want to progress and can put together one or two planned raids a week, or maybe 3-4 play sessions 3 to 4 days a week.  The problems here tend to be lack of numbers/proper class makeups, contested/ffa mobs, and bottom feeding.  What is needed is a bridge of sorts, and again I'll use the LDoN example.  Mission difficulty leaves you with a choice of 300 hitters or 1k hitters.  For many, normal difficulty doesn't present a real challenge, but hards are, well, too hard.  To gear up for hards through normals with 1492 armor is very time consuming - 30 wins at 1 hour each if they are very lucky (40 minute wins, 10 minutes lfg/replacements, 10 minutes declining, running, buffing, medding).   And my gut feeling says that the number is a lot closer to 40 hours than it is to 30 hours.  I guess the 40 hour number could be compared to the average number of hours spent raiding to get one upgrade, and maybe it is faster to grind LDoN for upgrades, or maybe it's not, but it's certainly boring.<br />
<br />
Now, there should be a division between &quot;casuals&quot; and ubers, and there is.  Better gear, better exp for faster AAs, bigger money drops, groupable &quot;soft targets&quot; that casuals have to raid, and I'm sure more. I also think there is a certain satisfaction in betting an encounter that isn't gimped or scaled down, so I really don't want the EPs just opened up either.  Fix Tier1/2/3 itemization so that those who are there can [reasonably, gear and time wise] upgrade there.  Give partial point refunds for LDoN armor turn-ins, so that players can actually buy some of the lower point tier pieces to upgrade on the way to the 1492 pieces.  Allow bought augs to be removed and reused.  Add secondary LDoN objectives for bonus points.  Add a middle difficulty level with 600ish hitters.  Vary the point cost based on mission type, or just be done with it and add a &quot;request slaughter&quot; button to the recruiters.  Add an easier level of LDoN raids, so that those who have to plan their raids weeks in advance (i.e. be sure of proper attendance) can at least have their target up.<br />
<br />
And add some of the other great suggestions in this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Encounters like that exist all over the game as it is now. A cleric, since they are focused completely on healing, greatly increase a group chance of success in any give enounter. Same with a warrior in defensive, or even, to some extent, rogues and wizzards when they are allowed to let to go all out. Any one of these &quot;pure classes&quot; if properly geared/played can greatly increase a group effectiveness. the problem comes into play when you start requiring one or more of these classes to be even remotely successful. There was a time when you could put any of these hrbrid tank/DPS/healer counter parts together a go out an xp even con content. Luclin and then PoP has changed peoples perception on classes so much that they think that they've always had to consider forming a &quot;perfect&quot; group to be even remotely effective. Look at PoP, where if you dan't have a cleric, there's nowhere for you to xp even remotely challenging content. The &quot;perfect group&quot; should always make even con content mostly trival. That makes up for the fact that msot of the time you won't be able to put together one of these groups and give those that chose a hybrid class a chance to compete for a group position instead of punishing them for choosing an alternate playstyle.</div></div><hr />

But Knights aren't Warriors, they don't share our raid role and haven't for four years, and this be the Warrior issues thread.<br />
-----------<br />
Has anyone noticed that in any progress level where a Warrior gets an aggro weapon that procs, the proc is fairly often resisted? I can understand mobs being resistant or entirely immune to stuns (stuns can &quot;stun mitigate&quot; a huge amount of damage), but why is it that Divine Stun might interupt a gater yet a Warrior using EoE and a DBoW with a Force of YKesha aug is hosed?<br />
<br />
While Force of Will is semi-useful I suppose, our magic items (Warlord's BP, etc.) still heal 100HP's. The most effective healing charged item is Prayers of Life and not available really to level 65 Warriors. We need Improved item healing for Warriors.<br />
<br />
While poisons and curses have got more powerful, potions and right click cure items have not kept pace.<br />
<br />
Knights can legimately roll on HP, HP/mana/End, Mana, Focus, Shielding, and Endurance augs. Casters and semi-casters don't hesitate to roll on AC and HP augs. There should be some pure melee and pure caster only augs with those classes specified on the augment.<br />
<br />
The best 2H out of PoTime for Warriors can be used by pretty much any melee. Other classes get a wide variety of 1Hdrs and 2Hdrs.<br />

Warriors get insufficient class specialization abilities<br />
Boot to the Head - a critical kick that stuns for 3 seconds to level 75<br />
Bodyblow - a critical slam that stuns for 3 seconds to level 75<br />

There are old guildmates of mine on this board who will vouch for this -- when I'm not online, my guild didn't do shit.  They had a hard time forming an XP group in somewhere other than Velks.  My characters were needed, my skills were needed.  I know where I fit in.  You guys are just another raid slot and act like you do a whole lot of work while you're watching UPN clearing trash before &quot;teh uber mob.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, if you've had just about enough of this pissfest, I have too Fitemore, lets get back to reasonable discussion.<br />
<br />
Regardless, my point has nothing to do with uber vs noob. This idea is based entirely off of quests already in the game, designed specifically for allowing single/small groups to progress. You'd think that access like this would make you happy... Instead of giving something to you for free, it gives you a reasonable way to progress with your core group. That's what you want, right? Single group, non-raid progression?<br />
<br />
Have you done your BoT key Haass? I can't personally comment on the Tactics key quest at all, because I haven't done it or read up on it. The BoT key, the PoJ trials... Those are the quest types I'd like to see for the upper PoP zones. Difficult, requiring some tactics, but possible without a raid. <br />
<br />
This solution is acceptable, as long as it's implemented appropriately.  I haven't finished my BoT key, I had 3 out of the 4 pieces if I remember correctly.  The nameds were giving us some DPS issues, but I think we could have eventually overcome them when we got the right people online.  Unfortunately, about the time I was set to go on working on them, I got my new job and had to start working all weekend every weekend, so that kinda shitcanned it.  I've got half the tactics key too, just fell victim to another thing that didn't get done when my playtime went down the crapper.  <br />
<br />
Small group access to the zones they have blocked off is acceptable.  I still think Time and VT and Sleepers (the zones at the end of expansions) should be raid only.  What the fuck am I gonna do?  Single group Quarm?  Exactly.  I'm reasonable about it, I understand that there is content in the game that is designed for the 50-70 man guild, and I definitely don't want to see that removed.  All I want is a way to access the content that I'm able to do, and if key quests are the answer, then you'll be seeing me in Earth real soon.<br />
<br />
Well, that is if I ever feel like buying 2 new comps and reactivating my accounts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">How about repricing some of the LDoN gear?  What I'm trying to say is if the best piece for a slot costs 1400 points, rather than having the second best piece for a slot cost 1100 points, why not have it cost 400?  Perhaps have several alternatives that aren't quite near the top of the chart, but have the attraction of being far cheaper?  So the &quot;absolute best&quot; LDoN gear is still expensive as hell, but there are other alternatives that are significantly cheap enough that you're not completely disgusted with having to spend the points on them you could have used for the &quot;absolute best&quot;?  That way there is a viable progression within LDoN for casuals that isn't an absurd time sink, while continuing the serious time investment currently required for the &quot;absolute best&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Rakaul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">Personally, I don't like where the game has moved to.  I suppose more things for the non-raider would make me happier but they don't need more expansions.  There are tons of zones that are not used.  Most people don't hit them cause there is no decent loot to be had. <br />
<br />
The game has gotten too easy to level up.  I am on Stromm now, so we have alot of newbies and we have a ton of newbies in their 50s....they have no idea how to play their own class nor do they have the slightest idea of what other classes can do.<br />
<br />
Ok I might get flamed for this but I would love to see the power of soothe/pacify etc.. limited.  It has made people weak and timid and basiclly means that people can pull singles with no real skill...its a shame.<br />
<br />
As far as specific class things I am not honestly sure.  The provoke line has worked wonders for me so I am happy with what they did there and I am not in the end game so not sure of any issues there.<br />
<br />
Limit the bard.  Damn they are arrogant asses.  And yes them being arrogant asses is my reason for limiting them.   :D <br />
<br />
Oh and yes it would be very benefical if we could return LDoN items and USED bought augs for points.  Even if its just for a percentage of points..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">I agree with Fitemore about the single-group progression. Top warriors in top guilds should have a raid path that gets good gear faster and the best gear exclusively, but there should also be soem interesting and challenging paths that smaller groups can take to advance their characters.<br />
<br />
As a casual player, I don't need to advance as fast as hardcore raiders, but it would be nice if I didn't keep bumping into situations where I either have to find 70 other people to do a series of raids or I have to farm the same trivial mobs over and over and over to get better gear.<br />
<br />
And I agree with Haass that this would have to be implemented carefully, because when poorly implemented elements are introduced to this game, they cause much gnashing of teeth.<br />
<br />
Basically, I don't care if it takes me a year to get an upgrade that a hardcore raiding warrior can get in two or three months, as long as my path toward that gear is interesting. I much prefer being able to kill a mob that drops an upgrade for me over farming things, selling them in the bazaar, then buying a upgrade that will allow me to tank the mob that drops the piece of gear I just bought.<br />
<br />
I would also advise against the sort of thing that SOE implemented to get casual and lower level players to buy GoD: the deal where for a few weeks you could make thousands of plat a night by fishing, then once new sales of the expansion dropped off, the vendor buying price on the fish was nerfed, and many of the players who bought the expansion have little reason to go to the expansion again. That's not especially good long-term game design.<br />
<br />
As for the quality of casual players, hmmm. Some are good, some are decidedly (even spectacularly) bad. A few I've met are so good I was shocked--it was a pleasure to see them work, and a pleasure to group with them. <br />
<br />
But, you know, if I were a stockholder in SOE, the central issue for me would be that my business remain attractive to a variety of customers. Provide for both the hardcore raiders and the casual players, because if you cut either group out revenue falls and that makes it more difficult to muster the resources to improve the game for the customers who are left. In this case, as a customer, I want the same thing as I would if I were an owner.<br />

 It doesn't to me. I want zones to be blocked from bad players via a challenge, not by a contrived limitation based on your play time/dedication to experience grinding. I want a difficult quest that actually tests your ability. I hate artificial limitations like level requirements. Why should progression be based off of a number like that?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">It's interesting how much the casual vs. uber thing is coming up.  There's 2 long threads on EQCleric on the topic as well.  I guess I'm not sure why people are quitting these days either.  The ubers quitting because they couldn't get past Uqua made sense to me, but I never have really got why elemental level players would be quitting at this stage. They definitely are though.  <br />
<br />
I kind of agree that exp group content should not take a raid to access.  I do think there should be some sort of filter though, that keeps people who are not ready for the content in a zone out.  Level limits are good, but they're not enough, and I agree with Fitemore that grinding out 200 AA isn't the right way to do it..  There should be some kind of challenge to overcome to get into a place like the elemental planes.  Maybe LDoN style trials...say you complete the equivalent of a level 65 LDoN hard in each zone...say something like beating all of the PoJ trials but more difficult.  This would require you to have good enough gear to survive in the elemental planes, and enough skill to beat an encounter that is challenging with that level of gear.<br />
<br />
The problem with that is that single-group encounters really amplify class-balance differences.  You can see that in the millions of bitter tears being shed daily over at Paladins of Norrath since the GoD single-group trials came out.  Maybe 2 group trials would be more appropriate, say with each group clearing from different zone-in points to meet in the middle where a boss will spawn for both groups to fight, something like that.  A 2-group trial allows for some more diverse groups without requiring a large number of people.</div></div><hr />

so just because I cant get 70 people togeather because I have a job I am a bad player? Or someone that likes being in a family guild, they are a bad player?<br />
<br />
Your an ass if you think being a drone out of 72 makes you good, EVERY motherfugging group has their shitwits and fucktards, quit trying to stick us with them, and who the hell says you should be the judge? any retard can make it to elementals if they have the playing time, some really good players cant get anywhere in the game because they have lives, or familys or college to take care of, i dont know what your station in life is and i dont care, everyone should have the chance to move up in this game, not just those that still live with mom and pop.<br />
<br />
getting 72 people togeather is the ONLY challenge, it is NOT a messure of skill it is a messure of who gets to sit on their ass the longest, RAIDS SHOULD NEVER UNLOCK GROUP CONTENT, put all the uber items on uber monsters, farm that monster enough and then try the next uber monster, i dont see the point of having to flag 72 people just to get a 6 man group in a decent zone.<br />
<br />
like i said, it is YOU being selffish &quot;i dont want to have to deal with people, i always want my camp open, and i dont want to have to deal with ANYONE in MY zone, even tho everyone pays the same god damned thing&quot;<br />
<br />
You come up with a REAL way to decide who is skilled, and i will back you up, right now you are spinning &quot;what ifs&quot;<br />
<br />
PoJ trials that require tight teamwork would be good BUT there will be classes left out, which is unfair, keying quests that make you fight monsters that are a tad bit harder for parts IS fair because you can flag 6 at a time, and it doesnt require the holy trinity, and it requires some brains to not die.<br />
<br />
I like your idea about LDoN hards as an acess method, but please no time limits, and no lock out periods.<br />
<br />
No time limits because if your killing in elementals there is no pocket watch ticking away, you should be free to set your pace since you would be in the zone you are trying to unlock.<br />

no lock out periods because if someone wants to try an instanced zone, why not let them?</div></div><hr />

  Ok, fucktard. Read my last, oh, I don't know, 3-4 posts? I AM ADVOCATING SINGLE GROUP ADVANCEMENT INTO THE EPS. I AM PROPOSING ALTERNATE FLAGGING QUESTS TO GET INTO THESE UPPER TIER ZONES. Re-read everything I just posted, and realize you're a dumb ass. Admit it, edit out your post and I'll do the same with mine.<br />
<br />
  Here's some samples for you: What I would love to see is alternate flagging quests for all PoP zones other than Time, for starters. Every zone below Sol Ro had a quest you could do with a single group, or at most a couple groups. If they just implemented more of these quests, that actually tested skill and equipment, you could filter out the people that really SHOULDN'T be in those zones, while allowing general access. If you ever did the BoT key, you'd know that the normal giants in PoStorms hit harder than experience mobs in BoT, and frankly take some effort and tactics to kill. <br />
 <br />
Regardless, my point has nothing to do with uber vs noob. This idea is based entirely off of quests already in the game, designed specifically for allowing single/small groups to progress.

<br />
I quit because I realized that raiding with 72+ people was ZERO fun.  I literally watched people FD through the entire raid and nobody could tell.  in a 18-30 person raid everyone makes a difference.  If someone dies, you notice it.  The huge raids in PoP just are not fun.  They take the whole &quot;Hero Factor&quot; out of the game.  You just don't feel like you matter anymore.  Particularly if you are the 5th or 6th tank in line.  Add to that AAs.  AAs were great when they came out.  They were fun to do but not really necessary.  Now I can't tank much of anything at the level we were raiding without 100+ AAs (all mitigation, HP and taunt, basically).  I was happy when I hit 65 because I thought I wouldn't have to spend alot of time grinding anymore (I didn't hit 60 before PoP, so I was still grinding hard).  I've spent the past 6 months or so just raiding and never had to worry about AAs (all Vellious and Luclin raids, though).  We hit Elementals and now I have to grind incessantly and be in a guild that raids non-stop if I want to progress anywhere and that is just too much work for me.  Also, when you are raiding with 72+ (actually we averaged 100+ the last week I played) and walk away with a total of 4 or 5 pieces of loot after 4 hours you start getting irritated and bored.  And almost every damn thing that dropped was caster/hybrid.  Out of around 50 drops in Elementals I think I saw maybe 2 pure-melee drops (and even those were ALL/ALL).  PoP just took the term &quot;Uber&quot; to the far extreme and really took away the fun aspect of raiding, IMO.</div></div><hr />

  This is the last time I answer you. I'm tired of quoting my own threads no more than 2 pages back to refute the rediculous claims you're making. I've, honest to god, never had someone this dense try and argue with me. <br />
<br />
The BoT key, the PoJ trials... Those are the quest types I'd like to see for the upper PoP zones. Difficult, requiring some tactics, but possible without a raid. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Okay that is a start fitemore, but we have to stop and think for a min.<br />
<br />
The problem with the PoJ method is that there is pull thru classes, we will have paladins and SKs crying rivers if we take this method, just look at the GoD trials and the problems caused by that.<br />
<br />
As for the BoT key from storms, the problem with that is time sinks, waiting on respawns.<br />
<br />
I like brutals idea about a two group encounter, most small guilds can pull 12 to 24 65's up for a raid, i also think a tweeked BoT key quest could work, just change it so it is instanced so you dont have to fight over space, this was the main problem, people would fight over the camps to do it when it was fresh, with the entire game moving up this would make it perma camped, maybe even a rebirth of rotations would result.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest and best way to do it would be to give people options, 3 or 4 differnt ways to go about it, 2 group raid for when you have alot of people interested, single group key partys for people with a little time to blow, a one trial one plain access for people that dont have more then 2 hours to spend online method etc.<br />
<br />
And forgive me if i dont remember everything said in a 13 page thread, i would have remembered it if you had been more detailed then say... clone the BoT key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u193"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p193">A reasonable compromise might be to have a single group PoJ trial started with a different key phase. If you succeed, you get a one use (??) ticket into any Elemental Plane and can add up to 30% (is that the number?) unticketed/unflagged other group members/raiders. (The 32 raid member to use the 30% rule would have to be dropped).<br />
<br />
A raid force should be able to muster at least one capable group to do the trial. A single group would just have to be able to pass the trial (using a ringer for a player that couldn't get through it and would later be in the group using the 30% rule).<br />
<br />
It would be a pain to have to do it every time you wanted to enter PoEarth and maybe for that reason a one-use ticket is too restrictive.<br />

Add a key quest and you have four way to get in - normal flag, ticket, key quest, or 30% rule.<br />

<br />
  Right.<br />
<br />
As for the BoT key from storms, the problem with that is time sinks, waiting on respawns. <br />
<br />
  I don't know... Do you remember the BoT key very well, if you've done it? 3 different camps of giants, 1 item from each camp and a general item from any of them. Then items from named from 2 different camps of the 3. The best part about the key was that you could simply go to a different camp of giants if one was taken. Also, the items were common enough that they started rotting fairly quickly, other than the named items. Respawn of the giants was something like 2 hours, and the named was 8(?). The named dropped 3 of the required piece every time.<br />
<br />
  The difficulty wasn't too bad either, though the named mobs were pretty mean. You could also bring a raid along if you needed to. The normal mobs hit around BoT level, but mitigated slow more than BoT giants. The named hit as hard as kriegers or slightly higher, but with a pretty crazy proc. They were somewhat hard to pull and somewhat hard to CC. The experience for killing them was BoT quality.<br />
<br />
  All in all, it was one of the best designed, simple quests in EQ. It didn't have to be retuned, it was single groupable to small raid at hardest. If you couldn't kill the giants, BoT would be too hard for you. The fairly fast respawn and the variety of different items required made it so it WASN'T a huge time sink. As much as people would be itching to get into the EPs, just taking this very quest and scaling it up to EP level difficulty would stop people that would just go there and repeatedly die and kill others in the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">The fact that so many people want what's available in GoD without doing wanting to actually get off their asses and do GoD simply amazes me.   <br />
<br />
To get to EP's, it takes raiding, it always has and it always will.   <br />
<br />
In GoD on the other hand it takes 1-2 groups maximum to get many EP/time equivalent pieces of gear, although visible armor pieces would still be lacking.   Raiding Yxxta would solve that issue quite nicely since Mindrider armor is as good as or better than EP armor.   <br />

Why will it always require raiding to get to EP's?  Just because something currently has a particular restriction, why does that mean the restriction can't be removed or modified?  <br />

Originally, aside from druid/wiz ports, the only way to get from Antonica to Fay was via the boats, but you can now travel via PoK books.  Things can change if SoE wants them to.<br />

<br />
Yes, that's true, if you're geared for GoD.  Now the question is, how do I get geared for it?  I do think you can eventually get geared for GoD (at least the first few trials and zones up to Ferubi/Barindu) without raiding - but it would be much faster if you raided.  That's the problem I have with the current design approach - it greatly favors the play style of the minority (uber-raiders) over the majority (non-uber raiders and non-raiders.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
simple thing would be to allow more access to the elementals, as the general pick up raiders strength would increase with ornate being more common, from this point we might even see casual players get time flagged (but not beat time) and uber guilds could then easyly get new recruits for the trials and tribulations of GoD, and soon to be OoW.<br />
<br />
The way i see it is that a blockage has formed in the pipe that controls the flow of the game, several infact and i beleave they are lime deposites of timesinks and calcium buildups of 72 man required raids, the flow wouldnt be effected it it was just one or the other, you can work around em, but when they stick togeather it creates a hell of a problem.<br />
<br />
Why is it a good idea to have a raid be required to reach a grouping zone?<br />
<br />
The problem with following the proggression you recommend is that when you first went thru it you didnt have to contend with farmers(or as many of them) and we do, you didnt have people 4 boxing camps that drop armor we need, we do.<br />
<br />
the proggression path decayed a little, the thing is with GoD and OoW why must you maintain a strangle hold on a group zone? you already have quarm loots and the new crap to keep ya busy, why let the zones go un-used aside from a few pricks that like to sell armor that they dont even use for 300k in the bazaar? heck, why do the plate boots(or was it the helm) only drop in elementals but the silk turban and boots drop in BoT</div></div><hr />

I spend far far far more time per piece of gear raiding easily than I do while exping.    Out of my last 5 upgrades, 1 is from a raid, all the others are from exp groups.   If I didn't raid at all, I'd simply go where the upgrades are and get them.  I'd probably have maxed AA's as well.   It's not &quot;fast&quot; to upgrade via raiding.   It's actually painstakingly slow.</div></div><hr />

It's called Gates of Discord.   Both types of people are supported in this expansion, and people are simply not taking advantage of what there is to offer.    It's one of the most well balanced between small content and raid content expansions I've ever seen, even better than Velious in that regard.    I'm convinced that a guild could completely bypass the Elemental planes via GoD, with the only exception being weapons, and even then...Ferubi raid mobs have some nice weapons of their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at it on a per piece comparison that may be true for some people (not for me, but I may just be lucky with my small guild  ;) ), but looking at it from an overall character ability perspective I think raiding is definitely a better upgrade route.  <br />
<br />
For example, I can spend around 90 hours to get a good ldon armor piece with one good aug, one average aug, and one crap aug (3000 pts/50 per adv = 60 missions x 1.5 hrs/mission to allow for setup/split time = 90 hours per piece of gear via LDoN.)  When I'm done I still don't have something that's even as good as EP gear.  Yes, I can spend 45 hours and get an unaugmented piece of ldon gear (which is probably faster then individual gear upgrades via raids), but it won't even come close to the EP equivalent.  Now if you consider Time or GoD raid drops, the difference is even more pronounced.<br />
<br />
In fact, it's hard to compare raid vs non-raid gear because the raid route produces gear that the non-raid route can't even come close to no matter how much time they spend.</div></div><hr />

However our main guild tank has tried the forst set of trials a couple times. He is approx 8k hp buffed not sure on AC but somewhere 1400 and he has over 150 AA's all the defensive ones are done. He got absolutly crushed. We are a casual guild. We can probably field 12 to 15 65's if all are on. We have dome the Tactics key quest and are working on the BoT one.

Maybe the information is all out there. But despite your statements that GoD has a lot to offer to casual players and people who like to group between raids there is a lot of reluctance to go to GoD and explore a new and sometimes dangerous zone. There is no Having Fun in GoD manual.<br />
<br />
One thing that has occurred is a decrease in player tolerance for pain. DX9 bugs, long travel to Ferubi with at one time numerous see invis mobs eager to eat you, 5k HP unbuffed tanks getting eaten in even the Sewer trials was too much pain for many players. This is irrespective of the difficulty of past expansions.<br />
<br />
In the long distant past when a new expansion came out my guild spent several days just exploring. See invis mobs, getting stuck in the terrain, and sometimes nasty CR's sure discouraged that.<br />
<br />
Oh, I well remember when crosing Misty Thicket was rife with danger, but back then the game was new and us newbies liked Bixies scaring the heck out of us. But when you are level 65 and have fought your way to PoTime, you expect yard trash to die if it trifles with you. Solo.<br />
<br />
Given a choice of farming Ornate in BoT or taking on Pixxt's for augments, many players opt for the familiar - especially if they've got 2-3 hours to play 2 nights a week. Especially if they've been to GoD and squandered that play time by getting splatted.<br />

<br />
Nah, I'm just done blindly buying expansions for this game just because they shovel them out the door.<br />
<br />
I don't agree that LDoN is any kind of plus to me at all.  I'd have to replace all my gear with 1492 point gear, and then augment said gear, and then I'd finally have a set that would be halfway worth my time.  Problem is that it would only be halfway worth my time.  It would take honestly years of doing nothing but farming LDoN points to upgrade, and that's just not my idea of fun.<br />
<br />
I take Frodlin's word that I could do GoD, but man, perception needs to change if that's the answer.  There is a thread in the battlefield right now telling a tank with better gear than me (albeit less AA's and probably minus my core group of players) that he's not good enough for GoD.  That's what's hindering people.  If we're told that this expansion is so hard core that even the best knights can't get thru it with one cleric, what effect do you suppose that has on players with half their HP/AC?<br />

I would definitely not agree with that, just as a matter of personal preference.  The moment something hits &quot;farm mode&quot; it's boring IMO.  I am always disappointed when we own a boss mob on the first try.  The fun part of raiding for me is getting owned, refining tactics, trying different things, and eventually winning.  As soon as the boss is trivial, then it's just loot farming, which I don't consider fun.  I know a lot of people are all about loot though, and if they're getting loot then they're having fun, and those types like the repetitive &quot;easy loot&quot; zones like VT or Time where you get tons of loot in one night and rarely if ever wipe.<br />
<br />
I never considered VT fun, even the first time we cleared it we were in no danger of losing any of the fights, and that just doesn't do anything for me.</div></div><hr />

No, in order for a warrior to succeed in GoD, he has to go to GoD.   A warrior with basically ornate level gear can beat Vxed/Tipt with a group who can communicate.      Hell, Elemental tradeskilled armor is even better in a number of slots and that stuff is getting cheaper all the time.<br />

I'm sorry, but this sounds really crazy.   What the hell have you been doing since LDoN came out if you're not a raider?  Sitting on your ass?   If you haven't been improving yourself, why the hell do you want to go to GoD?  This isn't &quot;How do we make the game easier so that I only need to put in 1/4 the effort because I was too fucking lazy to do it for the last 8 motnhs&quot;, it's about what you can do RIGHT NOW if you grow some testicles and go try the content.  <br />
<br />
The only LDoN change I strongly support is that it's fucking insane to lose your augs with no return on investment when you unaugment something.   Getting 10 different A3 augs is really not fun.   <br />
<br />
Dropped augments should be downgraded slightly when you unaug and returned to you,    Bought augs should be given a 50% return on investment or downgraded.</div></div><hr />

A good reply. And if you examine the difference in what we have said is fun you'll note that in a guild it sets up tensions.<br />
<br />
The people that want to refine the heck out of their gear so long as upgrades exist in PoTime and really are thrilled every time someone upgrades a slot loves farming - wheeeeeee!!!!! Fail in Uqua three times and they think - well, if we farmed PoTime 40 times we'd succeed. We know what to do, we just aren't powerful enough to pull it off.<br />
<br />
The players impatient to move on as soon PoTime has been farmed 10 times gnash their teeth in boredom and can't wait to try Uqua effort #7. They are convinced going to PoTime for the 11th ocassion is a complete waste of time and effort - the good upgrades are just beyond the horizon.<br />
<br />
GoD exacerbated the tension caused by these different and quite real attitudes. The possibility of Failure #10 in Uqua sucks so much that I'm not logging in. Farming PoTime yet again sucks, I'm not logging in. Toss in DX9 bugs, long CR's, death while traveling, and low loot rates featuring Darkglint #16 and you've got a good recipie for guild fricasee.<br />
<br />
A highly sucessful guild has resolve in the face of repeated failure, learns what will succeed, and farms exhaustively yet efficiently. With SoE getting trickier and more brutal in it's encounters at times you do wonder if there is only one obscure path to success and if your guild is staffed exactly as needed to perform that one right way flawlessly despite lag, link deaths, bugs, and human error. We're gameplayers looking for fun, not perfect cogs in a perfect machine.<br />
<br />
New content should be challanging for guild #1, but ultimately doable by guild #2, 3, 4, .... If the failure rate of those that trail the top guilds in the game is too high for too long they sometimes buckle and the high end raid game unravels.<br />
<br />
It's very simular to the uber/casual issue. Make little or no progress (however you may define progress) and have too little fun (whatever that means to you) on the way long enough and eventually you ask yourself &quot;Why am I logging in?&quot;<br />
<br />
It appears to me that lately for some players EQ is not satisfactorally meeting these needs.<br />

My biggest complaint about my EQ experience currently  is that I don't have time to do the GoD content because my guild raids regularly, so there's often little time to do GoD stuff.<br />
<br />
With high end ldon/ornate gear, i'm certain it's possible to do named with a single group in qimini, riwwi, the sewers, barindu, ferubi, vxed, tipt.  You might not be able to finish tipt easily, but you can still get augs from the maternal cragbeast.  Vxed is loaded with great drops, as are the sewers.<br />
<br />
People from my guild (which is high end vt/beginning elemental) regularly get upgrades every time we group in those zones.  The plate pants from the trickster, very near the entrance in vxed are excellent, for instance.<br />
<br />
If you're a dedicated casual player, give GoD a try.  I think you'll be pleasantly suprised about what you can achieve.</div></div><hr />

and its more then 1000 points for the good armor, so basically i have to invest a work week(48 hours) for EACH fucking slot? doesnt sound so crazy when you work out the time, the cost, or the amount you earn, is fucking insain.... a damned work week PER SLOT? what the hell man?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point Frodlin, I think you've gone right to the heart of the matter.  Why do we want to go to GoD?  Why do we want to buy an expansion to GoD?  Seriously?  Obviously if we haven't been spending all our time since LDoN came out grinding away at AAs and acquiring LDoN gear, we're going to be under equipped to deal with GoD, so why pay for it and OoW?  And does SoE want to continue offering expansions that people don't want to buy because they didn't jump on the grind grind grind band wagon of the previous expansion?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that since there doesn't seem to be any credibility given to the thought that maybe SoE is neglecting a segment of their player base, that those of us in that segment of their player base should just stop buying the expansions and either accept that from now on the new game just isn't going to be targetted in the least to us or leave the game.  Is that a pretty reasonable summation?</div></div><hr />

What I want to know is what's most important to you guys. So, give me some notes to take with me.<br />
<br />
The poll about buying ingame stuff from SoE for $ really irked me in a bad way. Please express that we don't want this clearly. <br />
<br />
I find it insulting, after this long, to have them actually pull a move like this. My hobby is dying right in front of my eyes and I can't do anything about it. Obviously management is trying to cut bait. :(<br />

Totally reasonable to think that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't mind at all if Sony made a safe, reasonable alternative to Yantis.<br />
<br />
Plat/character sales are going to happen whether we like it or not. Since they're not shutting the activity down, the only reasonable alterative is to at least make it safer and more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Yay for putting Yantis/IGE out of business!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">It's my opinion. I was asked for it by the thread starter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u230"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p230">Didn't think Daemon was speaking for anyone else. <br />
<br />
I for one rather see SOE securing the sales than not. The beyond the pale/I quit level is when you can by gear directly from SOE.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with SOE dipping into the well, and even taking a cut. I think, done right, both buyer and seller could get better prices with SOE in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u231"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p231">Its like abortion, it will happen(plat selling and character selling) we might as well make it safe and clinical so people cant use paypal and CD keys to cheat eachother.<br />
<br />
The day they start selling toons, armor and PP directly from them, or they start making it, i will quit.(and i bet it wont even be 6 months after they start the secure system before they start making toons to sell)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">Actrually I have changed my mind. Not because I mind people buying stuff for cash, but the huge and detrimental effect it could have on grouping. <br />
<br />
How many more loot arguments are there likely to be when the item that dropped could be sold for REAL cash. I mean it would be the death of NBG loot in groups. Imagine you are XPing in upper sands and the 8 hour mini spawns and drops ornate plate greaves pattern. As that is over 100k in plat--that would not have an insignificant cash value. <br />
<br />
With SOE giving its offical blessing to P2P sales, just imagin the fights over loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u233"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p233">The whole idea of paying rl money for characters and items sucks.It detracts from the idea of actually playing the game and would be a pretty low move on the part of a game developer imo.I'd like to see Sony begin to fix existing problems with people conducting rl buisness in their gameworld not make it worse by supporting the concept.</div></div><hr />

Gather a specific list of those opposed to this, and append it to your post, because I can guarantee you this is where most of these games are headed, eventually, and there are plenty of people who are not necessarily opposed to it.  If there wasn't all that much interest in it, IGE and Yantis wouldn't even be in business, raking in the kind of revenue they do.<br />
<br />
There are actually games available that you can play RIGHT NOW, where you spend RL cash on things sold to you by the dev/publisher to &quot;enhance your gaming experience&quot;.  Just like the slow increase in MMORPG fees toward the $20/mo mark (I know this will horrify some of you, but *gasp* Stormhammer was nothing more than a test market to see how much people are really willing to pay to play a game like EQ), it will take awhile for it to become the norm, but once companies realize the number of casual players (and hardcore) who have more money than time, it's just a matter of time before they capitalize on it.<br />
<br />
Don't you just hate it when you buy a DVD, then 6 months later, they release a Special Edition DVD of the same movie, but with all kinds of cool features you wished you'd waited for?  They can actually make double their money on one movie with a lot of customers who have the cash to spend and feel it is worth the added features to buy the DVD again.  There is a very lucrative market in people who can afford to buy the same movie 2 or even 3 times to get an extra 20 minutes of cut footage, extra features, etc.<br />
<br />
The gaming industry now brings in more money a year than the film industry, and you expect companies to NOT capitalize on things like this?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I agree or disagree with it, I'm only saying you're naive if you don't believe there is a profitable market for this type of thing, and that businesses as large as Sony aren't interested in investigating it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u238"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p238">yea defintly up the adv points at lower lvls lvl 20 = 1 point heck at 57 i only get 21 i think been a while but i was like wtf. serious by the time you get the 10 points needed to get the rec lvl 20 stuff your lvl 30+ not only that 2-10pp bazar junk is 3 times better. seriously at lvl 32 i can take my bard on one adv get the pp split and go buy a better peice of gear in the baz then i can get farming 10 adv at that lvl. if i save for 10 adv i can buy something that might last me to mid 50. and i'm even doing hards at 32.<br />
<br />
10 successes should net you a peice = to ornate. thats about the ratio i see in bot 10 hours and see a ornate drop ( i can't win a random for anything but someone wins it out of the 6 people)<br />
<br />
change all the peices to have different values. why am i paying as much for gloves as i am a bp.<br />
<br />
add more pop caster effects id 4 and anger of eci realy dont cut it.<br />
<br />
enough stupid 1 shot illusion potions in the chest.<br />
<br />
make god attractive so i can get a freeking group there super xp bonus or something.<br />
<br />
free aa with every adv stone upgrade.<br />
<br />
make a rescue a rescue, not a slaughter 60 and then a rescue, same with assinate(realy the point of assination is a surgical strike to take out a leader not wade through the army and then kill the leader) yea yea i know why targets don't have loot but put some on them so people wanna do it.<br />
<br />
if it's old unlock it we sometimes have someone who happens to complete the vp or st key pleading for others who have to key to go on a nostaliga hunt.<br />
<br />
VT is still kinda hotly contested though.<br />
<br />
open everything pre elemental what we gonna do get more ornate or maybe random on a windblade instead of buying it in the baz.<br />
<br />
wth do i need 10k+ to make my dang boots seriously does that much plat drop in god that temper needs to be a plat sink.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u240"><b>Modaou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p240">As far as opening PoP zones goes, would people be open to the idea of doing single-group trials to gain EP exp-only access, similar to a couple of the other PoP zones?  I'm thinking something along the lines of the PoJ trials, but with a difficulty at level 65 relative to the difficulty of getting PoV/PoS flagged via PoJ trials at level 60-62 with something like 4 trials, total, each granting &quot;exp-only&quot; access to a different EP?<br />
<br />
It seems something like this might satiate those players who are bored with PoV/BoT and looking for EP-ish exp, without blatantly diminishing the significance of people who take pride in the effort they put forth obtaining EP raid access the traditional way, and still allow tradeskillers access to items they 'feel entitled to'~ :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
As long as the new trials had a single-group difficulty at level 65 that was proportional to the effort required to complete a PoJ trial at level 60-62-ish, maybe some folks wouldn't mind as much.  Of course, there would still be those who have recently worked hard to get into the EP who might feel slighted after putting forth the effort to get raid-flagged for these 'special zones', but overall, it seems like a reasonable trade-off. These trials would only grant exp-only access, ala the previously &quot;exp keyed&quot; zones in PoP.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just an idea to take forward, as if SOE intended to listen to 'summit' feedback at all.<br />
<br />
EDIT: whiskey + posting = redundancy and typos... make a note of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">Xp key'd is a great idea as long as the loot stays the same, i would say absolutly no progression past elementals with out going back and doing the raids that were required before.<br />

I hope dev's are listening.<br />
<br />
Regarding raiders vs casual players.<br />
I'm in a casual raiding guild on Stromm.The guild started from scratch soon after server opening and is now in the EP's.We're mostly working adults with limited playtime(no mandatory raid attendance) and we raid 4 nights a week.The majority of my online playtime now is spent raiding.I usually grind one long night a week or a couple short stints.I'm averaging an upgrade every 2 weeks or so with of course almost no xp while raiding hehe.Sure in large raids some people can occaisonally slack a little.However,I find raiding a lot more demanding  of skill, time and effort than a regular xp group.There is a  challenge to getting 60 plus people online and working togeather week after week.For casual raiders we make a deliberate choice to invest the majority of our online hours in making the team work so we can see new content and face new challenges has a group.<br />
<br />
Now, I got lucky;I've never actually gone looking for a guild.I hated the idea of being forced into socializing on that scale(imagine in a MMOG hehe) for advancement so i just explored stuff with my wife and friends I met along the way.Really,It's neat to look at uber bp of stardom#40012,but,what does it have to do with adventuring in your own group at any given moment.Anyways,after two brief guilded interludes(both guilds collapsed pretty early in the server)we were happy doing our own thing exploring LOY at the time when a good friend asked me to come along on a POG raid.I had never been to POG and went along to a very pleasant surprise:meeting the folks of Final Door who I play with today.The guild has great leadership,mature fun loving members and luckily to this point a fair bit of uncontested content.Although, things like the AOW,cursed and a few others were hard to come by.<br />
<br />
I think there's alot more room for casual raiding guild's in eq.Yeah you'll get beaten to spawns by full time raiders,but, there's always something to kill and most would get a chance at progression stuff.I'll venture to say that most of the warriors on this board are interested in raid-tanking.There's alot of talented,knowledgable warriors here who could with friends make it work.Personally,I think the best part of raiding is seeing new places and surmounting new challenges with friends.If you can find people who are just as concerned with that as getting uber-x item then you have the makings for a fun successful guild.It'll take patience and hardcore competitive number crunchers will pass you by,but, you'll have more fun long term imo.<br />
<br />
I agree there seems to be content gaps for non raiders.However, eq has allowed people to band togeather in huge groups to take down mobs and single group content drops should never come close to equaling what 72 people can achieve at the same level of play.LDON gear introduction for the casual player is a step in the right direction(wish i had more time for augs hehe),although,I think that ldon itself lacks taste and reinforces the negative aspects of persuing rewards/gear in eq.I would like to see more development towards 1-3 group content with ornate+ rewards more along the lines of old eq dungeon exploration and the like.All this dumbing down to allow for ease of corpse retrieval,spending points and such detracts from the adventuring aspect of eq that addicted me in the first place.<br />
<br />
I would like Sony to slow down and get things right before they rush out new expansions and i'm not for raising level caps(have to see how that go's eesh) ,or ,people spending rl dollars to purchase upgrades or whole characters.<br />
<br />
I agree that 70 person raid groups are a bit impersonal at times and would like to see more 20-40 person content in the future with eq 2.One of the problems I think is EQ has succumbed somewhat to the ease of play and upgrade mentality and forgotten it's adventurous roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">Man, just get organized, have the person getting your adventures be the ML and do splits on return, it's best if they're a caster who can gate.<br />
<br />
Every pull can be 4-5 mobs easy, get a bunch of melee, everyone on their own mob and you win in like 20 mins.  Hell the most annoying thing of all is the &quot;resting&quot; while waiting on your adventure timer to expire.<br />
<br />
If someone has to leave, get a replacement before the current adventure is done and have them meet you at the zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">In 2 hours I get 200 points just doing normals. An LDoN normal doesn't take 2 hours, hell there's a time limit of 90 mins.<br />
<br />
Obviously you and I live in different worlds.  While you're grouped with a well oiled machine that finishes LDoN's one after another well within the time limits, I on the other hand have the misfortune to many times end up grouped with the Three Stooges.  Hell, at least a couple of times I've spent more time on the corspe runs from these cluster fucks than I've spent actually killing things.  Granted, not every adventure or every group has turned out that way, some have done quite well and been very much on the ball.  But certainly not all of them, by any stretch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">Hehe, LDoN looks a lot different if you're not in time geaar :p  These guys have half your hps.  No way a cleric can keep up with tanking 5-pulls on casual players.  <br />
<br />
Here's how LDoN goes if you're not in an uber guild group.  You sit around LFG for 20  minutes and get an invite or find a couple people to start your own group.  You get 5 people but no puller, healer, slower, whatever, and spend another 20 minutes looking for that class.  Then you go and do your adventue, which takes 40-60 minutes.  90% chance somebody has to leave after this.  Maybe you can replace them quickly, maybe you can't.  If you  can't there's a pretty good chance other members of your group will decide they can't commit to another adventure if you have to sit around for half an hour looking for a new cleric so the group breaks up and you either start from scratch or log off yourself.  2 hours per adventure isn't that far off in a casual pickup group.</div></div><hr />
