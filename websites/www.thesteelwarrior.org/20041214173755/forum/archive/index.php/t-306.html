A good example is Natural Durability which is nearly twice as cheap as Planar Durability.<br />
<br />
Reading the boards i concluded that the gain of Lightning Reflexes (LR5) is about 5 %. Compared to the gain of 10 % that CA3 generates. People often are very exited when they talk about LR5. It is soooo good. But I think the reason LR5 is good has more to do with the fact that you first have to get CA3. Don't understand me wrong i think LR5 is decent, but it isn't mythically good.<br />
<br />
Often when a defensive AA path is described people have the following string down the order:<br />
CA3 followed by LR5 and after that CS3 and ID5.<br />
<br />
This is not the optimal order when you want value for money. Probably CA3 CS3 LR5 ID5 is.<br />
<br />
The reason for this thread is of course to find out if my conclusions are correct.<br />
<br />
BTW there are of course reasonable cheap AA abilities in PoP. It seems that Punishing Blade is good value for money.<br />

<br />
Combat Agility 3 increase your avoidance by 10%.  It is not the same thing as getting missed 10% more.<br />
<br />
One would expect the gains of LR5 to be less than CA3 though, sine avoidance gets better the more you have (for example, going from avoid 99% to 100% is A LOT better than 50% to 51%).</div></div><hr />
