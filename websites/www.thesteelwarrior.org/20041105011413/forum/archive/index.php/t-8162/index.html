<br />
What are some of the better ele drops? I won't be waiting til time for gear, so I'll pick up the best stuff I can now in EP's.<br />
<br />
I figure magma necklace and solro mask are probably my best bet, but I could be wrong. We don't really do GoD...</div></div><hr />

Not many good neck items from ele planes for tanks. Your best bet for there is actually other places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a mask/necklace set which drops in Hard LDoN which would be upgrades.<br />
<br />
The best stuff in EP for warriors is Raex gear.  Honestly i would get these 2 items to tide you over till 1 of 2 things happens.<br />
<br />
1. you break into time and get upgrades there<br />
2. your guild farms EP to the point where these face/neck items are extremely common and therefore cheap.<br />
<br />
Concentrated on raex now as it will upgrade you the best.  By being patient in the off-slots, you'll end up making much better use of your DKP.  <br />
<br />
Lance Armstrong doesnt win the Tour de France by trying his damndest to get first place in all of the flat beginning races ... he's patient and waits and saves his strength and goes for the throat where/when he has the advantage in the mountains.<br />
<br />
If you jump high for all the nonsensical loot, then you will be left behind on the Visible plate which really matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are pretty good neck and mask slot items from the new VP quests if you feel like getting faction and want elemental level items without spending DKP/merit on them.<br />
<br />
See the &quot;new vp loot&quot; thread in this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Magmaton Neck<br />
<br />
Solro, Fennin, or even TZ (or vxed trash) mask</div></div><hr />

I don't really have the time to do more keyquests as is... so it's pretty much confined to Ele's or GoD mobs you can do with &gt;36 (as I don't think over 60% of our guild actualy owns the GoD expansion.)</div></div><hr />

VP sounds right for you guys. It's not a major terrible thing to get keyed for it.</div></div><hr />
