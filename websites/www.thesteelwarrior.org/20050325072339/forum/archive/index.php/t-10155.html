<br />
But theres a few questions I have (couldn't find it anywhere)<br />
<br />
1) Whats does each point of stamina equal to health at 60 - and is there a cap on stamina?<br />
<br />
2) How does defense work (not AC, the + to defense skill stuff) and does this have diminishing effects or a cap?  (What I'm trying to ask is how good is this stuff, is it worth sacrificing stamina/AC for it and going all out defense gear or is it not that great..?<br />
<br />
3) How does enchanting work?  I can see that you can add certain enchantments to items but do all items have an enchantment slot?  Also it says that some items already have enchantments and you can apply a new enchancement by overwriting the old one.  How can you tell if an item already has an enhancement and what it is?<br />
<br />
Sorry if the answers to these questions are blatantly obvious, but not being able to play the game yet I can't tell :( Just trying to prep myself on gear choices before I can play...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) No clue<br />
2) There's a formula on your character's AC number.<br />
3) You can have 1 type of enchantment on an item, and you can always tell by the listing on the item if it's enchanted or not. Enchanters (dur) can enchant your items, leatherworkers can reinforced your armor with armor kits, and blacksmiths can attach chains to weapons to prevent disarmament plus attach spikes to shields, which causes damage every time you......block maybe? Not 100% on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-01-2005, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 stamina is always 10 HP for anyone at any level I think, which is why you see some random posts like 'this rogue has more HP than my warrior nerf them' since anyone who piles up enough sta gear can have a ton of HP (of course a War gets more HP per level for being a War, but the advantage isn't that big).  I have not heard of a cap that exists but I'd think it'd be very easy to verify if it did.<br />
<br />
Defense is supposed to affect how often you get missed.  It appears to have very insignificant effect since stuff 20 levels lower than you still don't have problem hitting you.  Some claim higher defense leads to higher parry/dodge and lessens chance of getting hit by a critical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok .. this thread is leading me to wondering about questions of balance.  If Defense, AC, lead's to the same avoidance/mitigation for every class .... and since all classes get the same HP per Stamina .. then just why are we playing warrior's?  I mean we have NOTICIBLY less DPS that other classes, and we can't heal ourselves or other's while tanking as paladin's can ....  <br />
<br />
I am only at lvl 25 right now, so this might not apply to me as of yet, but I can't help but wondering about the advantage of a warrior over other classes, especially, from what I am reading, when all of the raid content start's being SERIUSLY explored ... and especially in a group situation.<br />
<br />
I think, given the above, these are valid concern's.  If I'm missing something please tell me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of folks are concerned about how bad WoW warriors &quot;suck&quot;  Go over to the blizz forums if you want to see a true whine and cheese fest.  While we could stand to get some love from Blizz, it aint nearly as bad as folks make it out to be.  Perhaps the class is a tad more challenging than some folks would like, but I'm pretty happy coming from EQ.<br />
<br />
for +defense items, I think it only adds to your dodges.  If you go up against a warrior in PvP then you do NOT want to dodge alot.  You'll get eaten up by overpower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok firstly let me just say I am not actually playing the game atm due to it not being released in Europe yet, am in the final beta which opens up (hopefully) in next few days....  been following threads on messageboards (particularly here).<br />
<br />
But theres a few questions I have (couldn't find it anywhere)<br />
<br />
1) Whats does each point of stamina equal to health at 60 - and is there a cap on stamina?<br />
<br />
Each point of stamina from worn items is worth 10hp. Each point of stamina from your base stats is worth a lot less, but the exact formula is not obvious.<br />
<br />
2) How does defense work (not AC, the + to defense skill stuff) and does this have diminishing effects or a cap?  (What I'm trying to ask is how good is this stuff, is it worth sacrificing stamina/AC for it and going all out defense gear or is it not that great..?<br />
<br />
Each point of defense adds 0.04 to dodge, block and parry and decreases the chance for a mob/player to crit you by an unknown amount, which is presumed to be the same as the normal level difference. ( I.e. a level 20 mob will crit you as if you are level 20 yourself if you are level 19 with +5 to defense ). What that is worth in terms of STA/AF is a personal decision, much the same as deciding if 12STA is better than 1% dodge. <br />
<br />
3) How does enchanting work?  I can see that you can add certain enchantments to items but do all items have an enchantment slot?  Also it says that some items already have enchantments and you can apply a new enchancement by overwriting the old one.  How can you tell if an item already has an enhancement and what it is?<br />
<br />
Enchanters use components created by destroying green (good) quality items to add enchantment effects to items. All items can be enchanted, however most items only have one enhancement slot, so enchanting an item will mean that you can't use other enhancement items, such as armor kits or shield spikes, on it.  The enchantments are fixed by the type of item, so for example enchanters will get a spell that enchants a bracer by +5 stamina.  The better enchantments require items that are difficult to get, usually only obtained by destroying blue (rare) or purple (epic) quality items. Enchanters can enchant soulbound items through a special trade interface.<br />
<br />
Enchantments on items will show up under the item description as a line of green text and if you attempt to enchant an item that already has an enchant, it will popup a dialog box asking the enchanter if they wish to replace the existing enchantment with their new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defense is believed to affect damage from all special melee attacks that obviously ignore level restrictions.  I saw an example of mob using MS in a FoH thread that'd hit a tank with 8K ac for 2700 and a cloth user for 2700, but only 2K on a tank with a ton of +defense gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can attest to special melee moves not playing by the same rules as normal melee hits.  Just go attack a mob that is 6+ levels to you and hit it with HS, Slam, Cleave, etc., and watch how hard you hit it compared to the craptacular damage you do with normal melee swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sorta balances out at the end game:<br />
<br />
1) Warriors have defensive stance which give us 10% mitigation and more aggro in that stance.  With sword/board you will be the end game tank for many instances.  A paladin can sorta do the same job, but its a bit harder for them to hold aggro and they do jack for dps.  AC soft-caps at a pretty low lvl, so that 10% is huge for us warriors.  Paladins don't have that.<br />
<br />
2) Warriors CAN be dps monsters if speced that way, somewhat closer to rogue dps.  We can switch between defensive and offensive very easily.  <br />
<br />
3) We hold aggro like kings, with so many different shouts and abilities.  You can hold aggro with a shield (gonna have to 50+) and shields provide 1/4-1/3 of our total ac later on.  (some shields have 2-3k ac).  You can block with the shield, thus mitigating a portion of that damage away.  We have abilities that let us block 80% of the time 2 attacks every 6 secs.  That coupled with revenge that lets us stun the mob 40% of the time makes for good damage mitigation<br />
<br />
4) Our area effects (yeah we get those) allow us to hold aggro pretty successfully with mages area effect nuking.  Instances are 5-6 mobs at a time!<br />
<br />
5) Non plate classes will die in very short time if they are beat on for any extended amount of time.  Paladin aggro is ok, but its not aggro lock like in EQ.  That and they can't really heal and tank at the same time.  30% reduction in aggro from heals.<br />
<br />
Theres a bunch of different reasons why warriors are good.  The problem is that for the alliance side, warriors only really overcome paladins in the lvl 50-60 range.  1-40, the paladin is god and can do 99% of everything warriors can do better.  Later on for some reason, they wimper out. <br />
<br />
So ask yourself this, are you going to be playing in the lvl 1-40 range?  Roll a paladin.<br />
<br />
If you are going for high end, 60 instance raids all the time, go with a warr.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Er no. Demoralise, piercing howl and thunderclap combined do not even come close to holding aggro on a mage who is AE nuking. This is really obvious when you are pushing your limits instance wise and a mage can't kill AE mobs in two nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) from the limited looking I have done: the base 20 stm and every point of stm gotten from leveling up are worth 0 hit points. Your race's stm above 20 at level 1 get your 10 HP/stm--just like every point of stm from items.<br />
<br />
2) AC seems to have a very steep slope. At 44th while DWing I have 3100ish AC and 43% mitigation. Tossing on my shield, I have a 4600 AC and either 49% of 50% mitigation rate. Particularly once we are into plate, I think the incremental value of AC is very small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason why AC is on a diminishing return is because going from 50% to 51% mitigation is worth twice as much effective HPs as going from 0% to 1% mitigation.  It's probably not an issue as long as you're below 50% (everyone who can't wear plate) but once you get over 50% additional mitigation really starts to have a lot more value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) from the limited looking I have done: the base 20 stm and every point of stm gotten from leveling up are worth 0 hit points.

<br />
<br />
Actually that's not quite right.  From dev comments in beta we know that hps are calculated as:<br />
<br />
hps from stamina + hps from a table lookup based on class/level + a base<br />
<br />
From calculating in beta:<br />
(sta-race/class base sta) * 10 <br />
+ table lookup<br />
+ min (sta, 20)<br />
<br />
So when you level and gain 20 hps and 2 sta your table lookup value did not change and you did gain 20hps from the 2 sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's like, you gain a level and it'll say:<br />
<br />
You gained 15 HPs<br />
You gained 2 sta<br />
<br />
So people say how can I get 2 sta (20 HPs) but only gain 15HPs?  Obviously sta doesn't work!  The Blizzard response would imply you really gained 15 HP + 2X10 = 35 HPs.  I'll see if I can verify this next time i level, should be pretty triival to check really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a post a while back (but after release) about the sta you get from leveling giving you very little, if any, hps.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that my hit points gained each level goes up while i still get only 1 or 2 sta points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My impression was that you always gained some HP for just being higher level.<br />
<br />
In addition, you may get more HPs from the sta you gained from being leveled.<br />
<br />
So if this level you gained 15 HP and 1 sta you gained 25 HPs.  If next level you gained 15 HP and 2 sta you gained 35 HPs.<br />
<br />
At least, that's how it should be to make sense.  The other way it'd work is that the sta you gained at level up has absolutely no effect, which doesn't make any sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want the fastest proof I know of that level up stm doesn't effect HP? <br />
<br />
Level a rogue.<br />
<br />
Ding level 2, you get  1 stm, 17 HP.<br />
Ding level 3, you get  0 stm, 17 HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To paraphrase the Blizzard response, you're expecting something like:<br />
<br />
You gained a level<br />
You gained 17 HP<br />
You gained 1 sta, which means you gained 10 more HPs!<br />
<br />
Except, the part after 1 sta isn't shown in the game, so you assume it doesn't work.  Blizzard's claim is that the 17 HP is what you get for just leveling, in addition to the 10 HP you gained for having 1 more sta which they figure you can figure this out on your own.<br />
<br />
I do not know who is right but like I said it should be trivial to verify this by looking at max HP before and after leveling up.<br />
<br />
Besides, suppose in that case it does say you get 27 HPs, then it'd look like:<br />
<br />
You gained a level<br />
you gained 27 HP<br />
you gained 1 sta<br />
<br />
And then you'd think you ought to have gained 37 HPs.  We're back to exactly where we started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason why AC is on a diminishing return is because going from 50% to 51% mitigation is worth twice as much effective HPs as going from 0% to 1% mitigation.  It's probably not an issue as long as you're below 50% (everyone who can't wear plate) but once you get over 50% additional mitigation really starts to have a lot more value.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that I understand what you are saying here? How can gain 1% mitigation above 50% be worth 2x the effective hipoints as below 50%. I don't think I'm reading you correctly. Could you explain this more clearly?<br />
<br />
Here's an example of how I understand what you are saying.<br />
<br />
If a hit was worth 100 damage:<br />
<br />
@ a mitigation value of 1% (a value below 50%), that is effective as 1 hit point.<br />
<br />
@ a mitigation value of 99% (a value above 50%), that is effective as 99 hit points.<br />
<br />
If damage is some number &quot;D&quot;, mitigation a number &quot;M&quot; and hit points a number &quot;H&quot;, then<br />
<br />
DM = H<br />
<br />
in the previous cases,<br />
<br />
(100)(.01) = 1<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
(100)(.99) = 99<br />
<br />
If my simple math is correct, How can adding 1% mitigation ever be more effective than adding hitpoints equal to 1% more of you current hitpoints?<br />
<br />
If I have a piece of gear that will give me AC equal to 1% more mitigation, or gear that will give me 1% more of my total hitpoints, I have basicly 2 items of equal value. Personally, I'd choose hitpoints because they always work unlike mitigation, which doesn't work against specials or spells.<br />
<br />
I assume I didn't read you correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just leveled and verified, I had 1821, gained 47 HP and 1 sta on level up, and now have 1868 HP.<br />
<br />
So I guess sta really doesn't do anything, though I still maintain people were approaching it wrong by looking at just the level up screen instead of comparing HP before and after.<br />
<br />
As for mitigation, suppose you can mitigate 99%, and you can mitigate 1% more.  There is no amount of HP you can add that will achieve the same thing because you now don't take any melee damage.<br />
<br />
For example if you move from 50% to 51%, that's 2% damage reduced (0.50X to 0.49X), which is roughly the same as having 2% more HP (it's actually more).  If you go from say 50% to 75%, you added 25% mitigation but now you take half the damage, which is like doubling the HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, Phantron compared going from 0% to 1% with going from 50% to 51%. This is completely different than comparing 1% mitigation before and after 50%, because then you imply than there is a cut off at 50% (ie you don't have the same progression from 49%-&gt;50% to 50%-&gt;51%).<br />
What Phantron explains is that your mitigation progress is equivalent to the inverse of the hit reduction. thus going from 0% to 1% worth 1% of the mob's dps on a 0% mitigating tank, going from 50% to 51% worth 2% of the mob's dps on a 0% mitigation tank, and going from 99% to 100% is infinit worthy compared to a 0% mitigating tank.<br />
Thus , yes, 1% mittigation gain doesn't worth as much depending on your current mitigation because this 1% is counted from a 0% mitigation basis, not your current mitigation basis (otherwise it would be the oposite result).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok fine, go level a rogue, say human, because that is what I have the data recorded for:<br />
<br />
level 1: 55 HP, 21 stm <br />
level 2: 72 HP, 22 stm 17 HP, 1 stm level up message<br />
level 3: 89 HP, 22 stm 17 HP message<br />
<br />
The stat up messages, near as I can tell, are Blizzard lying though their teeth, with malicious intent.<br />
<br />
On Mitigation: I think the slope is steeper than time survived:<br />
<br />
45 warrior 3152 AC  42.7 mitigation rate (no shield)<br />
45 warrior 4686 AC  52.6 mitigation rate with shield<br />
<br />
Taking  the 1 - values, and diviting the differance  by the starting rate,  that is a 23% increase in time survived for a 49% increase in AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
deciding if 12STA is better than 1% dodge<br />
<br />
Can someone please explain how that decision came about, would like to know why 1% dodge is compared to 12 STA...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">01-16-2005, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got  a newbie question.  What is the functional difference between Heroic Strike and Slam?  Both are usable in any stance, both are weapon damage plus a set amount.  I understand how Heroic Strike works, +100dmg on my next swing, pretty simple.  What I don't get is Slam, it has a cast bar, what does this mean?  Does this mean its not tied with your melee hits?  When would it be best to use this over Heroic Strike?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-16-2005, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've had lots of time to look things over and research other people's findings, as well as compare them with my own, and here's the diference.<br />
<br />
Heroic strike = Sucks.  Period.  Sunder armor is better in every way, shape, and form.  HS is a waste of rage.<br />
<br />
Slam is semi okay..as long as you have a slow 2h.  The reasoning is because it doesn't require a melee hit to go off, so you can swing, cast the 1.5 sec slam, and then swing again.  Mobs normally get 2 hits in between my swings, they get 3 when I slam, so clearly some extra delay there, but not too overbearing.   Slam basically ends up being a slow casting mortal strike, for half the rage.  I'm gonna do some more fooling around with it this week, but I think it definitely does have a place somewhere, contrary to my previous belief.<br />
<br />
Once you realize how shitty HS really is, then you start to see how slam is superior.  But you've really gotta take the time to sit down and examine the waste of rage that is currently called &quot;Heroic Strike.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-16-2005, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, hadn't hit 30 yet so I haven't had the opportunity to use Slam.  Interesting analysis, Slam is weaker, but doesn't take up a melee.  I might consider using slam more often than HS when I get it when I have a 2hander...although I tend to use sword/shield more often right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">01-16-2005, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heroic strike = Sucks.  Period.  Sunder armor is better in every way, shape, and form.  HS is a waste of rage.<br />
<br />
Thats great, I never use Heroic Strike in groups anyway because I can always find something to do with my rage and mobs don't last long enough for me to have excess rage to dump.  However as a defensive build warrior(no MS), when soloing I often find myself with excess rage even after <br />
<br />
a) sundering 5 times and keeping sunder up with occational refreshes <br />
b) using disarm once on humanoids <br />
c) stunning the mob to immunity with imp revenge/conc blow <br />
d) keeping battle and demo shout up.  <br />
<br />
This basically leaves me with the option of either spaming Heroic Strike or switching to Battle Stance and building rage for an execute when the mob starts to run(assuming it runs), I tend to do the former while keeping 10 rage free to hamstring since the faster you get the mob to the running point the more hp you have left at the end.  I suppose I could use the same 15 rage to do a shield block/revenge combo until the mob runs, haven't really bothered to check which would be more effective but I suppose I should.  Obviously theres issues with Slam when using 1handers since the 1.5 casting time coupled with the minor resets that mob melee will cause makes it basically take the time a normal melee swing would.<br />

Slam is semi okay..as long as you have a slow 2h.  The reasoning is because it doesn't require a melee hit to go off, so you can swing, cast the 1.5 sec slam, and then swing again.  Mobs normally get 2 hits in between my swings, they get 3 when I slam, so clearly some extra delay there, but not too overbearing.   Slam basically ends up being a slow casting mortal strike, for half the rage.  I'm gonna do some more fooling around with it this week, but I think it definitely does have a place somewhere, contrary to my previous belief.<br />
<br />
Given my build the only time I pull out a 2hander is when I'm in zerker in groups using it to mow down trash swarms with Whirlwind(assuming I have threat under control on the significant mobs in the bunch) or when I get the very rare add when soloing and need to using Cleave to try to survive.  In both these situations saving my rage for the AE/secondtarget skills is a better use of my rage than Slam thus making it a moot point.<br />
<br />
Not trying to argue with you, just failing to see where it has any place in my playstyle, whereas HC might have a limited use as a rage dump in the case of excess.</div></div><hr />

c) stunning the mob to immunity with imp revenge/conc blow <br />
d) keeping battle and demo shout up.  <br />

Obviously theres issues with Slam when using 1handers since the 1.5 casting time coupled with the minor resets that mob melee will cause makes it basically take the time a normal melee swing would.<br />

I think you misread - Haas suggested that sunder armor was a better use of rage than heroic strike, not that slam was a better use of rage than heroic strike.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, if you are a defensive warrior, a useful trick you can do while soloing is the following :<br />
<br />
Concussion Blow<br />
Swap to high damage two hander (Stoneslayer or dreadforge retaliator are ideal)<br />
Slam<br />
Slam<br />
Switch back to sword/shield<br />
<br />
You need ~50 rage before doing it, but if the concussion blow lands it's basically a free major damage source with no downside ( they can't interrupt slam because they are stunned, losing the shield AC doesn't matter as they aren't hitting you. )<br />
<br />
Note : use slam immediately after the first one lands, don't wait for the slam bar to vanish, it lags behind when the reuse is available.</div></div><hr />

Can someone please explain how that decision came about, would like to know why 1% dodge is compared to 12 STA...<br />
<br />
This ratio shows up in a number of places. The place most people are likely to see it is with heavy mithril vs ornate mithril armor. On the one side you have the choice of heavy mithril with 12ish stamina, on the other side you have ornate mithril with 1% dodge. <br />
<br />
Another good example is archaedic stone of stamina vs archaedic stone of eluding - 12 sta vs 1% dodge.<br />
<br />
It's a tough choice...</div></div><hr />

This somewhat boggles me, because i'm defensive specced, and when I solo, I bust out the whirlwind axe and I can't generate rage that fast.  In fact, I can't usually get a mob completely sundered and have it wear off before it dies.  I'd say you need to do more DPS, but I can't understand where you're getting all this rage from.<br />

HS doesn't cost 15 rage, get that out of your head right now, because that's the first lie.  HS costs 15 rage, plus whatever you would make on the swing but you're not because you're using HS...so in essence, 23-25.  You're dumping rage in an inefficient manner, because you can slam, AND do your normal DPS, for nearly half the rage cost of just an extra few damage with HS.</div></div><hr />
