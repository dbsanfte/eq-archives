Still, its a two hander, which I like.  But for it to be a preferred, will-do-the-crazy-longass-quest-for weapon, the aggro properties are going to be have to be amazing, as will the stats in general.</div></div><hr />

On the warrior one it appears to gleam or shine.  Is the sword going to have a golden tint to it that blinds people, or what?  If its going to be a 1hander, its going to be a big ass one hander.  If its a 2hander, it needs to have outrageous stats for once that are better than the 2 best 1handers.  If it is a one hander, god I hope you can offhand it too.</div></div><hr />

We're the class that should be the least interested in ornamentation on our weapon and we get the weapon that's the most ostentatious. WTF? A bat with a nail in it looks more functional than that thing. It's like a statue with a spike sticking out of the top. Set it beside the Paladin or SK weapon and there's no comparison, it looks horrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As we all know, weapons based on ratio alone gets outdated very fast, the only type of items that really keeps their value is those with special features(like good procs, high procrate, or nice clickies).<br />
<br />
I am also secretly hoping that all of the epics suck bigtime, so we dont have to go through the whole threadmill of epic raids for the entire guild :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally like the idea of a nice clean sword.  Would you all rather it looked like a SBoD?  It should look functional.  It shouldn't look like a Jedi light saber.  It should look like a sword.  It should look better than it does though.  It should have more jewels, it should look more ornate, it should look like it has magical properties emanating from it.</div></div><hr />

It does seem to stack, which is something, and it's group, which is something too. However unless it generates a buttload of agro, which single-target Vie spells *do not*, it'll be damn hard to justify this as anything other than a weapon you use when you *don't* want to tank.<br />
<br />
Which is gonna be really amusing for the Warrior epic.<br />
<br />
I imagine agro on this thing will be somewhat below that of a SEWS. Which is to say, once you put Anger 3 on it, it won't utterly suck, but no one in the top 10-20 guilds on any server is going to be all that interested.</div></div><hr />

The other day, i grouped with a cleric who had the sparkley mace from PoTime.  (I forget it's name)  That mace would proc a group heal, once every 5 seconds.  Through the entire LDoN, she would just melee, proc'ing group heals 12 times a min, and only had to cast a &quot;real&quot; heal spell like 4 or 5 times.  I would say that weapon is WAAAAAAAY more desireable than the proposed cleric epic 1.5 or 2.0.<br />

The same way that a BoC may be more useful than the proposed war epics.</div></div><hr />

Correct!  Although I have a lvl 52 bot cleric, I've only played him to 2 box a Beastlord alt. I feel that the cleric is the most mindnumbing class.  Only bareable, when 90% attention is devoted to the BL.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charsi MacBlizzard</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok my first post here but I had to pipe in on this since it seems almost everyone is missing the obvious here.  <br />
<br />
First off, as way of introduction, I am the MT/War CL for Sol Invictus, the top guild on Tribunal.  Yeah Trib isnt as far along as some servers but we are currently doing Txevu, not bad for a guild that only raids 3 times a week.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I have been pretty disgusted at SoE for not giving us, as a class, any agro weapon upgrade in GoD.  The Tacvi weapon procs less than a DB, so its less agro, or at best, a toss up if the increased dps makes up for the lower proc rate (I have yet to see anyone prove that).  So the best we get from the entire GoD expansion is an agro downgrade, and we dont get it until the endzone.  PoP gave us two upgrades, BoW and DB+EoE, which were incredible agro at the time.  They dont cut it late in GoD though.  Agro with Time weapons has become increasingly bouncy as other classes have recieved major upgrades.  Other melee classes, including other tank classes, have recieved some insane dps upgrades in GoD.  Yes we can use some of those dps weapons, but since they have no agro proc, you cant use them to tank a raid effectively vs using Time weapons.  <br />
<br />
So after SoE having basically bent us over and nailed us in the rear without benefit of lube or even a kiss first in GoD, they are seriously considering an epic 2.0 with no agro proc? You gotta be friggin kidding me.  My understanding is that all epics are 2 handers, so you couldnt even offhand this PoS.  Basically, if this stands, our epic will be pretty useless for anything other than dps or offtanking at best.  Can I assume from this that we will go another entire expansion without any agro upgrade?  Do the developers at SoE hate this class or what? <br />
<br />
Anyone else as pissed at this as I am? I dont care what it looks like, heck it could look like a rubber chicken if it was a real agro upgrade.  But a warrior epic that isnt a serious agro generator is an insult from SoE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charsi MacBlizzard</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we had a huge edge in GoD aggro weapons or not, Charsi.  Have you seen many paladins tank there.<br />
<br />
Are you serious?  Our knights can tank anything  in Qvic, anything in Inktu'Ta.  They cant do the named in Txevu for long, but I'd say thats pretty good.  And oh yeah, they actually have an agro spell that pulls off debuffs (incite will not, even Ancient Chaos) and thiers can be cast every 4  secs (1.5 cast, 2.5 refresh knights correct me if I'm wrong, it may be faster).  They also got MAJOR dps upgrades in GoD.  <br />
<br />
We got... what?  Upgrades to a line of agro generator spells that cannot pull off a debuff and have a refresh time way too high for fast pulls while clearing anyway.  No weapon upgrade.<br />
<br />
But this is not a post bitching about knights.  Wizards got dps upgrades that make agro an issue, other melee classes got big dps upgrades.  <br />
<br />
BOTTOM LINE:  The agro we had in Time, which was sufficient for Time but not excessive, has not been upgraded to match the demands on that agro that other classes' upgrades have created<br />
.  <br />
What advantage are you referring to exactly?  I'm confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradin</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The edge is very real just read the paladin boards.   A huge disparity in ability to tank in tanking ability.  It was not a personal attack on you.  Though my response here is somewhat inflamed towards you.<br />
<br />
You know damn well what I am talking about if you read your own boards.   So do us a favor quite being snide cause you know that 95% of pallies had problems in GoD.   I am one of the few warriors who will admit this without gloating.  Iam sympathetic to this plight much to the chagrin of my fellow warriors.  I think its pretty petty of you to turn your back on your pallies brothers just to use it as a platform to  plead your uberness to us all.  That is called grandstanding where I am from in real life.  Are you acting as a spokesperson to yourself or your class?<br />
<br />
Magelos anyone can fake  and if you don't know about this problem so I question how much you even play.    Talk is cheap especially when its obvious your not in touch with the facts or follow the game's ebb and flow.   The facts reflect that you either you do not read your own boards or are egotistical beyond belief.  I leave that to the jury of people who read these boards</div></div><hr />

Because Paladins can't tank as well as Warriors? No offense, but WTF does this have to do with the Warrior Epic 2.0.<br />
<br />
At this point my hope is that the Epic 2.0 proc is like the original Raex clicky. Yes it was insulting, and thank god they realized that and fixed it. However, as it stands now, it is definitely absurd if they don't put an agro proc on our epic upgrade... Considering that the original epic has an agro proc and all, and our job is keeping agro, you'd basically have to call that a downgrade, irregardless of the stats. I'd tank with a *negative* stats weapon if it had agro that was good enough, stats are not the issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not think I was flaming him.  To me flaming is personal attacks and if someone made me that mad I would be looking for where they live to talk it over face to face not flaming.   I was debating the merits of his arguement.   I was also trying to point out  the general of how out of touch nature of his comments were with 95% of the paladin community and game.  Too many here use the I am uber begone method of arguement and it does not fly with me.  Anyone can make a fake magelo, buy en ebayed toon or read Allah's and pretend they been there.   But I think real experience and being in touch with the game in general shines through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I think SOE misses the boat on regarding these weapons is questing and the ability for players to modify/customize their cherished belongings.<br />
How about implementing a quest that allows you to change your weapon to be more what YOU the player wants?<br />
Imagine doing a quest that allows you to modify your blades damage? Or change it from 1hs to 2hs? Dont like how it looks? Change it via a quest to look different and allow the players a choice of graphics. Or a quest that would allow you to add an augment slot. The key would be to allow only ONE change so that the players have to make the choice and maintain balance. Or heck, allow more than one via another quest for the higher end ( maybe their is a Blacksmith with new ideas in a later zone reached in the OoW expansion who could do this so it is available to higher end warriors). The key here is to keep the players playing your game, and keep them interested. I find it appalling that warriors in this post are already displeased with their epic 2.0 and they dont even own the game yet!<br />
Another thing they could do is put a Gem in the Pommel that upgrades the weapon's stats and damage/delay ratio as you advance your character in the game, much like the adventure stone via LDoN. The Epic would NEVER go out of style and ALL warriors would be after it if it continually upgraded. It gives the weapon the characteristic of being a part of you, the warrior. Every warrior would feel proud to weild such a weapon IMHO.<br />
I get the feeling that SOE developers dont play their games.<br />

The Epic would NEVER go out of style and ALL warriors would be after it if it continually upgraded. It gives the weapon the characteristic of being a part of you, the warrior. Every warrior would feel proud to weild such a weapon IMHO.<br />
I get the feeling that SOE developers dont play their games.<br />

There's the vie effect, then a recourse bestowing spell resistance.  I know we can get 5 more buff slots through  AA's , but I can't get all the buffs I want on most fights as it is, add to that the fact that oow &quot;stat&quot; buffs give direct mods instead, so they're actually *useful*....   <br />
As I said when I first saw the effects...<br />
&quot;Finally, a weapon I can use in xp groups when I'm not tanking&quot; <br />
Anyone who's ever grouped with an epic wielding bard (everyone) knows how much fun it is on a raid, pushing the buff limit, to have to click off someone's proc....<br />

Am I really the only one that noticed that the 2h Weapon is identical all the way up to the end of the blade and looks like it's meant to split apart?   :)</div></div><hr />

A huge disparity in ability to tank in tanking ability.  It was not a personal attack on you.  Though my response here is somewhat inflamed towards you.<br />
<br />
You know damn well what I am talking about if you read your own boards.   So do us a favor quite being snide cause you know that 95% of pallies had problems in GoD.   I am one of the few warriors who will admit this without gloating.  Iam sympathetic to this plight much to the chagrin of my fellow warriors.  I think its pretty petty of you to turn your back on your pallies brothers just to use it as a platform to  plead your uberness to us all.  That is called grandstanding where I am from in real life.  Are you acting as a spokesperson to yourself or your class?<br />
<br />
Magelos anyone can fake  and if you don't know about this problem so I question how much you even play.    Talk is cheap especially when its obvious your not in touch with the facts or follow the game's ebb and flow.   The facts reflect that you either you do not read your own boards or are egotistical beyond belief.  I leave that to the jury of people who read these boards<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well let me educate you Goradin since you are so wrong on so many points.  First off, if you read my first post, I'm am the MT for the top guild on my server.  Don't play alot? Think about that.  <br />
<br />
My views are not based on the Paladin boards, as yours obviously are, but rather than your truly not paying attention to the facts and the ebb and flow of the game, and not basing your opinions on actual game play but in fact on something you read on some board that may or may not be true, what I'm saying is the direct experience of someone that MTs/MAs raids for the #1 guild on their server all the time. <br />
<br />
I'll expound.  First off, I'm not just the warrior CL/MT, I run all the tank strats.  And I know damn well what my knights are capable of, because I USE THEM EXTENSIVELY TO TANK unlike a lot of guilds. They are a very integral part of our tanking strategy.  I have no reservations about calling them in to tank, putting them in the MT list, etc.  They are very capable.  Thats not based, as your opinions are, off of some crap someone posted on a board or some magelo, its based off direct game experience and things I see every day.  Not only do I see them, I rely on them for our success. <br />
<br />
Again, BASED ON DIRECT EXPERIENCE of the MT for the top guild on our server, our agro has not kept up with the demands on that agro created by dps upgrades to other classes.  A non-agro proc epic 2 is therefore a joke and an insult to our class. <br />
<br />
Please get some in game experience dealing with this instead of forming your opinions based on boards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with our new aa's, it makes sense that it would be... <br />
<br />
Warrior vie (that stacks with cleric vie)+20% increased spell resists would be great for the proc as an offhander, and since it's a group buff, it adds some minimal AE aggro. <br />
<br />
3 aggro procs + that would be more than sufficient, especially if it has some solid dps aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
The focus seems to be really dissappointing though... what would be great is if they also had it lower the endurance cost... then I'd have no complaints.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah sorry my post is about the epic and the necessity of an agro proc has crap to do with Paladins.  Only reason for that diversion was an assertion that the war epic shouldnt have an agro proc because we have some huge advantage over paladins??  <br />
<br />
The reason we need the agro proc is due to our agro not having been upgraded in a way to keep up with other classes' dps.  That happened due to no agro weapon upgrade in GoD.  Another expansion without an agro upgrade is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />
