<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Done in today's patch:<br />
7) We have increased the maximum amount of mana that can be gained through the use of items by an additional 50%. This should provide a noticeable increase in the mana available to many spell casters.<br />
<br />
<br />
LIsted in today's patch as in the works:<br />
We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Some options being considered are: <br />
<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
<br />
Do they not realize how absurd this is?  &quot;We know that casters are overpowered and we're planning to address that....oh and we just beefed up the casters again...obviously they needed it, quadding in PoD was more difficult than intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I just had to laugh at the irony there.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what it was, was mana was hardcoded at a maxium of 5000 (I think) and what they did was up that cap because lot of people in high end guilds had reached that limit. This in no real way effected those casters that quad kited in pod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Screw em all thats what I say:0 Or was that drink it all cant remember sometimes /beer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great, so some casters had hit the ceiling on mana.  Were they not getting a group as a result?  Were they at best the third choice in most situations as a result?  Were they forced to log on an alt as a result?  What really was the game detracting result of this and why did it need to be fixed pronto when Warriors have been broken for longer than most of us care to admit and we still see NOTHING coming down the pike for us?<br />
