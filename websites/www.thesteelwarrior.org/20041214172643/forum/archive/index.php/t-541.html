<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manifest</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Guys,<br />
I just started out on Stromm and I had a few questions about armor class and warriors. Right now the highest char I have seen is level 40 and there are not to many people with him. <br />
I picked an ogre warrior and put most points in stam and the rest in dex to get it to 75. So I get to level 10 and realize that my ac is way behind my friends ac ( he just made a frog warrior) and we where wearing the same armor, all leather. This does not seem like a little difference to me I mean its like 100 point difference. Take into consideration that we are on a new server where many people are poor the best item I can get at bazaar is banded for an unheard of 15p. Should I reroll a frog because they get cool newbe armor and great stats or will things be looking up for the ogre who has no newbe quests, hated everywhere and a 100 point differential in ac? What did the Ogre warriors do when the game first started?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His AGI will be way higher, it influences defense gains frequency. Given time you will even out, don't worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup in the end it all evens out, but if ya want to start over, then as a Ogre I wouldnt put any points in Stamina or strength. They both start high enough and enough warrior gear has them that by 60 you can easily max them both with Shammy Buffs. Dex and Agil on the other hand are the hardest stats to get and would prolly be better to raise those at the start.<br />
<br />
Of course back when I started my Ogre, Faction was my biggest concern. I think I actually put points into Charisma and Intel :)  And Its never slowed me down any. I always enjoyed doing things the hard way anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your goal should be to gain 20 AC every level, all the way to 60.  That gives you an ac of 1k at level 50, 1200 at level 60.  After that the curve ramps up, you're looking for 1800-2k for the high end pop mobs.</div></div><hr />
