<br />
Evasive and Defensive are on the same timer, 10 min 30 sec refresh<br />
<br />
Charge and Mightystrike and Agressive are on the same timer, 30 min refresh<br />
<br />
Fellstrike and Fortitude are on the same timer 45 min refresh for fortitude, 30 for Fellstrike.<br />
<br />
I couldn't get furious or precise to work, npc ate the tomes but I didn't get the skill.  /bugged it<br />
<br />
Any of the disciplines that are not on the same timer can be used independently, so theoretically you could hit resistant on inc (this is actually worth clicking now, +20 to all saves for 5 minutes), use fortitude to nullify all melee damage for 12 seconds when the mob gets to camp, go defensive when fortitude wears, and then use mightystrike or charge once defensive is off.  <br />
<br />
30 minutes later, you can do it all again.  Very nice, major improvement over the old system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, disciplines not on the same timer overwrite each other.  So for example if you are down a ways on the MT list and want to use agressive you could, but then if you need to tank you can hit defensive and it will cancel out agressive.  You can also turn disciplines off by hitting the hotbutton again.  Something I have wished I could do many times, but you have to be careful not to hit the button twice by accident, since once you turn it off it's off until the timer resets.</div></div><hr />

I am really excited to see that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and is Fearless still crappy?<br />
<br />
Putting offensive type and defensive /discs, er... there not really &quot;/discs&quot; anymore are they :p, on separate timers means people will actually use them.<br />
<br />
Seems odd that Fellstrike, Fortitude, and Aggressive are on the same timer though. <br />
<br />
<br />
You would think that Fortitude and Furious would be on the same timer, Fellstrike with Charge and Mightystrike, and Precise/Aggressive would share a timer similar to Defensive/Evasive.<br />
<br />
Unless they were trying to get a short defensive type, a long offensive type, and short offensive type on the different timers so you could chain them. But that would be silly.</div></div><hr />

On test they are 2 cp.  I imagine they will be something similar live, since it would be pretty lame to have to put any effort into getting back the stuff you already had hehe.<br />
<br />
Fearless is still just 2 ticks, can't see clicking this often, but maybe for Cazic in time (think that's the one that causes problems with fear).  Don't know how well it works, but you don't lose anything but resistant by clicking it so why not?</div></div><hr />

I am going to need to adjust how I know when defensive/evasive is going to wear off.  I have been hitting the key again to see when it will reset to know how much time is left.  It soiunds like I am going to shut it off if i do that now.   Did i understand correctly how it works?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems I out-think myself sometimes.<br />
<br />
I thought that the only reason they put disc TOMES on the test server was so that warriors could TEST the discs, without messing with their actual discs. For like compare and contrast situations.<br />
<br />
And thus, as a result, I thought when this finally went LIVE, they'd just recode the discs on the live end it'd be free.<br />
<br />
Guess I give them too much credit, as buying a tome would be the EASY way out.<br />
<br />
Ah well ... sucks for me for thinking about it at all really. 2cp isn't much to gripe about.<br />
<br />
Just mind boggling that you'd have to pay even 2cp to reacquire a set of skills that you already had and were free the first time around.<br />
<br />
If you don't buy the tomes, can you still use your OLD style discs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from my understanding, there will no longer be the current disc system.<br />
<br />
and you need to buy the tomes, because these are entirely new skills for you to aquire and use. 40cp for a bunch of new skills is not bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the disciplines, and the way that they have them linked. I think this would be a better system...<br />
<br />
1.) Evasive and Defensive  and Stonewall == increase tanking, dur 3 min<br />
<br />
2.) Aggressive and Precise == increase DPS, dur 3 min<br />
<br />
3.) Mighty Strike and Fellstrike and Charge == Burst DPS, dur 12 sec<br />
<br />
4.) Fortitude and Furious == Immunity to Melee, dur 12 sec<br />
<br />
This leaves 3 disciplines I am not sure how to link, <br />
Fearless, Resistant, Rage<br />
<br />
Fearless and Resistant could easilly link. except the durations vary widely. 12 sec and 5 min <br />
<br />
This leaves Rage which is a positive  Aggro modifier, I would leave this unlinked as it is completely different from all other disciplines. It may also be usefull to suggest a NEGATIVE aggro discipline to our arsenal, and if so, link these two.<br />
<br />
I also think we should suggest have standard reuse timers and durations on all linked disciplines. ie both have same reuse timer, and same duration...<br />
<br />
Since no two disciplines can be in use at once, i dont see how this would be overpowering, as they did not remove the detrimental part of any discipline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe this sounds abit pessimistic to me.<br />
<br />
If the cost will be something that is horrendously out of whack like 50k per tome you might have a point but if a tome is what it takes to get this new system off the ground a total price of something like 500 pp is a drop in the sea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WTF is Fell Strike doing on the same timer as Fortitude????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possibly because they both seem to be an &quot;Oh shit&quot; use?  I'm willing to bet Furious will be on that same timer.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike can deal out an impressive amount of damage (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2027) to kill something fast, while Furious and Fortitude make you flat out invulnerable to melee (Fortitude more than Furious tho)...all three seem to be &quot;oh shit&quot; situational use.<br />
<br />
I'm curious about Aggressive (and most likely Precision) being on same timer as Mightystrike and Charge...but I guess they only want one line for offensive increase, and it'd be at the same refresh anyways (30min).  Unless you were near the end of Aggressive, I doubt you'd sacrifice the long duration increase in damage for a short duration and possibly lesser damage increase of Mightystrike or Charge.  If you needed a short and quick damage increase you could always hit Fellstrike.<br />
<br />
Good to know the current possible setup for disciplines, Brutul.  The disciplines are pretty strong IMO, and I think just unhooking many of the disciplines is a very good step in upgrading warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing you need to buy the tomes because they're making a new combat system and the old discs simply won't work?  The old disciplines were pretty inflexible after all... at least that's why I assumed they haven't been changed in so long.<br />
<br />
Uncoupling the defensive disc (evasive/defensive) with the rest of the discs is huge.  There's a lot of time I want to use another disc but can't because you know you need to save the disc for evasive/defensive.  Now you can actually use Aggressive which is a nice DPS increase without having a sign on your head that says, &quot;5th string warrior that won't be tanking&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree that it's a pain that you can't check the timer now until the disc has worn off. They don't provide a way to see how far along you are?  I am used to giving folks a little warning when disc is about to fall, now I'll need to use yet another separate timer for that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thyll</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you think these are going to be 2CP when they go live, I think you're fooling yourself.  The higher skills will most likely be DROPS from the POP zones, much like the Ethereal and Spectral Parchments. I would also not be surprized if they use the parchments that are already in place to do the same thing as the casters. Turn in a parchment and get a random spell (skill). Why? because programmers are lazy, (yes I am a programmer and a former game developer) why create a new set of parchments when you can use the same ones that already exist. This way they only have to make new NPCs to hand out the skills when you pass in a parchment. I REALLY HATE THIS IDEA, but I can see it happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok I won't, but for the love of god find something else to cry about.   Seriously.<br />
<br />
And if you're coming to test to try out the new disciplines, don't spend 10 min begging in ooc for the 8cp you need to buy your abilities.  Go kill an orc for christ's sake, 1 sp will buy your skills at 25 with money left over.<br />

for hybrid classes, how are the disciplines ? they have 2 different timer 1 for fearless/resist and 1 for class ?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Pretty sure they do.  Main thing I've heard the SKs talking about is that their discs aren't working at all hehe (some warrior discs are broke atm also), but I'm pretty sure fearless/resistant are on a separate timer for everyone now.  Not sure about the other two.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, fortitude is pure ownage now that you can actually use it.  I have saved my own life with it on a late heal 3 times so far this weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One caution, if you click on a greyed-out discipline while another disc is up, it kills your disc.  This weekend on a raid I had just turned on aggressive and clicked defensive to check the timer...goodbye agressive.  /feedbacked this and I hope they change it.</div></div><hr />

 You have got to be kidding me. You really pointed at the once-in-a-blue-moon fell strike crippling hits as a reason to limit Fell Strike's use? Get off the board. 1 week. Come back after you have thought about what horrible things you have done.</div></div><hr />
