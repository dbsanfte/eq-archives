<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zukobim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The problem with warriors vs knights as I see it, is the warriors lack of a good fast agro lock.<br />
This new skill might provide just that without making the game trivial.<br />
<br />
The new skill could be called &quot;Charge!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Charge! would work as a two component spell.<br />
<br />
Component 1: root, that is unbreakable by melee damage.<br />
Component 2: spellshield.<br />
Duration: 1 tick (6 secs)<br />
Resists: very low, but not entirely unresistable<br />
Reuse: 30 secs<br />
<br />
The effect would make debuffing of a mob possible on the way in possible, because the warrior would be able to &quot;root&quot; the mob for 1 tick with Charge!<br />
Once the mob is rooted with Charge! it is not possible to use spells on it, because the spells would be absorbed by the spellshield and thereby using it.<br />
Once the spellshield component is used up it will cause the effect to wear off.<br />
A proc would function like a spell.<br />
<br />
This will mean a warrior can lock a target for 6 secs and build agro with the side effect that all casters would be &quot;disabled&quot; for the same period of time.<br />
The risk is the effect being cancelled out by a weapon proc or a trigger-happy caster. The other classes would actually have to get skills in order to function in groups and not just blast away.<br />
<br />
The skill would be pretty much useles once the fight is over the initial period, because nuke, procs, taps, dots would all break it.<br />
<br />
The code is already there, so it should not be hard to implement it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thunndarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i dont think many warriors want the ability to lock down agro, i know i dont.  but i would like the gap between pally/sk agro and warrior agro lessened.  the root as you mention would in most cases be overpowering.<br />
<br />
also, i think STA should scale up to 6.5 STA = 1 HP at level 65 even with a max STA of 305.  bare minimum, keep it at 6 STA = 1 HP with max STA of 305.  as it is now, we get diminishing returns on STA over 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zukobim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First of all, you might not lock down agro with this new skill.<br />
You get a chance to do it, but that is all.<br />
<br />
The skill is not foool-proof!<br />
Any spell or proc landed on the target would break the root and the skill should not be entirely unresistable, just very low resists.<br />
If you think the skill is overpowered due to the duration, then this can be tuned, so it fit into the tank balance.<br />
<br />
The skill does not put you to the top of the agro list, in fact it could be near 0 agro.<br />
You need to create the agro during the duration of the effect and if its too easy, maybe because of the 3 possible taunt attempts during the effect period, then the duration can be lowered to balance it.<br />
<br />
4 secs would give you some damage and maybe 2 taunt attempts.<br />
During those 4 secs debuffing would be hard, so debuffs have to land before the skill is used.<br />
If it lands after the skill is used, then the effect is cancelled and the mob would probably go for the caster instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunndarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you sir should have made a pally if you want to root a mob at will.  warriors do not need a skill that allows them to root a mob, there are plenty of classes out there that can root if needed.  and it isnt the duration that makes your root skill overpowering, its the skill itself.  <br />
<br />
what would be the &quot;cast&quot; time of this skill?  what would be the reuse time of the skill?  can it &quot;fizzle&quot;?  what about mobs that are immune to root?  you need to fully think through an idea before stating it so everyone is clear on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zukobim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can already stun with bash, slam and kick, that does not make me a pally, cleric or chanter.<br />
<br />
This skill is not just another root.<br />
It got some limitations.<br />
<br />
This is a skill and I know of no skill with cast time, its not a spell.<br />
I used spell effects to describe how it should function so people had something to relate to.<br />
The reuse time could be tuned quite easily and the 30secs mentioned above was just a suggestion.<br />
The resists are already suggested somewhat and the special situations with immune mobs and such is something SOE can balance out.<br />
<br />
Its stupid to think we can only accept completly thoughtout and balanced suggestions here.<br />
We will have to make suggestions with the basic effects lined out and leave room for SOE to balance it in the game.<br />
<br />
If you refuse to accept fixes that use effects that look alittle like effects already in the game, then you are probably aiming way too high.<br />
If it was an all new feature, then SOE would have to code it, test it and most of all balance it.<br />
Reuse some of the possibilities already in the game and the fix could be made years ahead of the new code suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunndarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">a root skill with no &quot;cast&quot; time, that cant be interrupted, and that can be used almost at will would simply be overpowering and would totally change the way the way the game is played.<br />
<br />
its not stupid to completely think through an idea that you propose.  and its ok to be all gungho and supportive of your own idea, but this idea is, well frankly retarded.<br />
<br />
while i applaud you for suggesting an idea to help warriors out, this is not the fix we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zukobim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A 4 secs stun is also overpowering then, because here the mob would act as rooted, but also be prevented from meleeing.<br />
Our own bash, slam and kick, that can also not be interrupted and has no cast time, can stun. Bash, stun and kick even do damage and generate agro.<br />
<br />
This &quot;root&quot;-skill does not prevent the mob from fighting.<br />
It can not be interrupted, but its very short duration and it punish some type of attacks against the mob. If one of the &quot;punished&quot; attacks are used, then the effect will be cancel out.<br />
<br />
A very low resist fast casting root is already in the game, so a &quot;root&quot;-skill would not change the way the game is played in anyway.<br />
What would change the way we play the game would be the gambling on the warriors ability to built enough agro during the &quot;root&quot;-period for the slows and tashes that land on &quot;INC&quot; and before the skill is used.<br />
This is already the way knights work today. Warriors just get a little of the same ability, although only with one chance where the knights can pretty much keep building agro.<br />
This skill would not make knights obsolete.<br />
<br />
The skill would be good on mobs with low AC, because the agro generation from the weapons would be high then, while on high AC mobs the agro generation would be low.<br />
If SOE made resists somewhat opposite of AC, then knights would be best for some mobs and warriors best for others.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the possible of 2 taunts while rooted would make it too easy to get agro lock, so maybe this skill should be on the same timer as taunt, and the reuse time on the timer could then be tuned to allow none or more taunts while rooted.</div></div><hr />
