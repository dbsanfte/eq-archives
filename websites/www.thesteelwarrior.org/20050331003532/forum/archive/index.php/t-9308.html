I was duped - got home all fast from work hoping to sign up - much to my dismay - for some reason I can read these forums but not any others...lol<br />
<br />
So I know a lot about war's now that I didnt...just wish I had access to some other sites at work - i think i have read almost every post available.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sooooooo....... are they gonna do open BETA still with the &quot;official&quot; release date a little more than 3 weeks away?  Or is it not going to be released that soon, or has open BETA already started and I'm out of the loop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is Blizzard, they didn't even announce the release date themselves yet (and yet the guy who owns them did).  But I'd think beta needs at least 2 weeks so if it's actaully going to meet the 22nd release date, then beta needs to happen by the end of next week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard will make the call on the release date, not Vivindi. The develpoment house usually releases the dates, not the publisher or whatever they are. The date has been debunked from Blizzard. They haven't released a date yet. Of course this makes sense if they are just starting open beta. Blizzard is in no rush, they will release the game after proper testing. I'm expecting holiday season release.<br />

I can't wait to play this game retail. I've already done the stress test and came back very impressed. I won't apply for the open beta so that I can experience the final release fresh and new. The open beta has been describe as nothing more than another stress test, if I'm reading the posts on the WoW site correctly. if you haven't played it yet, beta is a good time to get a feel for it if you don't know someone that is buying it.<br />

I have a friend buying EQ2 so I'll be able to fully judge which one i want to commit to. SOE would have to do something pretty amazing though I'll admit. Ofcourse, I'll be buying WoW when it comes out unless EQ2 can convince me otherwise, so my friend gets a review of WoW too so he doesn't have to buy it himself. i am excited about the EQ2 release. Its been a while since I last followed a game up until launch, it should be interesting if anything.</div></div><hr />
