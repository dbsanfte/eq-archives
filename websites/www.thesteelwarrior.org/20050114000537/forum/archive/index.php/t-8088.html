<br />
But yeah... JoS is the best... and cause you don't NEED the BF aggro.. i'd go with that. However, if you're in a DKP guild (or just an impatient fucker like me) you probably should just go for the first one to drop.<br />

Oh yeah, and  All 3 are decent weapons  says the dude with Demerix  ,/,, ,,/,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would personally go for the EoE, then JoS, then whatever. Alot of people seem to love the dps on JoS, to be honest DPS has never been a primary concern of mine, and EoE is superior aggro with minimal losses in hp. Up to the player really. I would sooner let our dps classes take jos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't say EoE is superior aggro over JoS.  Prolly a bit better but not much IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pets should be nada aggro otherwise mag and beasties would not be able to throw their pet on the mob's ass and still input large DPS. thus the hammer should be a DPS only weapon, and on this race it should win easily above the two other.<br />
<br />
I think that BF is monstrous aggro compared to the EoE and JoS but if we should forget the BF for this rating I would say that EoE should be just one short head above JoS on the aggro race. but the difference is so small that JoS, with its better DPS better stat and larger DL (less ripost per minutes :) ) should be a better choice. <br />
<br />
But once again the difference isn't huge enougth to make the EoE rots so go for the first/cheapest one.<br />
<br />

Have fun,<br />

<br />
I'd personaly go with JoS but we farmed Raid 2 enough that everyone who wanted one, got one. <br />
Swap in a shield when you see it fits, but shield is not the default offhand, at least for anyone i know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To a certain extent: [potential] DPS = HATE (Excluding the HoTT pet)<br />
<br />
Cause w ehad no luck at all with dbotw drops i used JoS + EoE for quiete some time so i own both. I usually offhand JoS cause of the better ratio and swap in EoE when fighting casting mobs. Imho the EoE proc generates a bit more aggro but  the superior JoS ratio negates the generated aggro effect. <br />
<br />
Imho: EoE: Better look, much better (more useful) proc<br />
           JoS: Better ratio (more potential dps, hate), usually much higher droprate (-&gt; cheaper?)<br />
<br />
HoTT is agtually no aggro weapon but with dbotw in main and anger3 on the hott, aggro shouldnt be a problem. I see it as a major dps, low aggro weapon and i never would bid against a monk, bst or other melee ddler on it. Now that we can remove augs, it would make an excellent low aggro mainhand weapon if you get a better offhander and are not MT on bossmob encounters. <br />
<br />
If you can't wait, just pick up the first to drop and / or the cheapest</div></div><hr />

While not an optimal weapon, paired with a Darkblade, agro is currently not a concern at all. I really asked because I was not sure if I should wait to farm Ikkinz before going for an offhander. We are in get people through Tipt phase so a JoS is a little ways off. I was more interested to find out if people would have held off spending DKP on a HotT or EoE now that they know JoS is just around the corner. Seems like its not THAT much better to warrant waiting for one, I'll just get which ever I can first.</div></div><hr />

Your darkblade with anger3 and any offhand really is enough to hold aggro when needed, save up your points, Chaotic Black Scimitar or Demetrix the Painsipper are where your goals should be ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chaotic Black Scimitar sucks because it leaves a buff on you.  Demerix is a better choice by far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you use defensive your dps is cut in half but you still retain aggro from the base damage of the weapon. This is why so many people originally chose defensive over evasive in every situation, it's easier to hold aggro with defensive.<br />
<br />
So, to make it short... Defensive has absolutely no effect on aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor, get the EOE, put Anger 3 on it...simple enough ;)  And then when you get to kelekdrex in GOD try to replace the EOE with the demerix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Triangle</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">phantron, do you have a chaotic black scimitar? because i do and yes it sometimes leaves a buff on you, but as soon as a mob hits you its gone.  before i got it i thought it would be a big deal and would suck, but now that i've had it for like a month i really find it to be just like any other weapon pretty much.  the chances of Runic procing and leaving you max buffs on a raid is very VERY unlikely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have a Chaotic Black Scimitar but I already have to click off a ton of buffs just to make sure some AE wouldn't accidentally overwrite something more important so I can't imagine why I'd want to have even less buffs, even if Runic goes away after one hit.<br />
<br />
Also Demerix is probably actually easier to get, at least we have a lot more Demerixs than Chaotic Black Scimitars, and better stats overall too.  The proc on Demerix is pretty worthless for aggro but if you want aggro you should stick with EoE or JoS in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're wrong except for your final statement.  A miss is the same as a hit in terms of aggro. So evasive = defensive = no disc aggro wise.</div></div><hr />
