I have a 51 Barb Tank, no AA's, and a 45 Sk warrior.  Now presently Im deployed to Okinawa Japan for the next six months and want to dedicate my time to one of the two.  My sk is an ogre and fully tweaked, and my Barb has mostly been a mule for the past year or so.   I have the funds to outfit him, but Im not really sure what to give him.  Ive never really gotten into the whole stats game, mostly just played for fun.  I know that tanks should be able to hold aggro, but to be honest my sk seems to get better agro for my tank.  Ive also seen both arguments for 2hs and for duel wield.  My sk usually goes with 2h slash, Ive go a sword of the blood sworn somewhere but will need another weapon to complete my duel wield..Which do you reccomend?..Bascially hammer me with logic, weaps, gear, the usual..I have a lvl 63 shaman I can bot with him..</div></div><hr />

Nevertheless, I have understood that you have a lvl 63 Shaman, a lvl 52 Barb Warrior (primary mule) and a lvl 45 ogre SK (primary twink). Am I wrong ?<br />
<br />
So, lesson number 1 : Warrior are the weakest solo class, don't plan to play him without boting your shaman.<br />
lesson number 2 : you can solo pretty well a SK.<br />
lesson number 3 : Knights are better at olding aggro (even if it gets harder a top end, espcially for SK).<br />
lesson number 4 : Warrior are better at getting beat hard because at same game progression, warrior usually have better AC/HP.<br />
<br />
If you want to play around with ease go for your SK or the combo War/Sham (after you leveled your war, you will have a better basis to get a group with this combo than with a sk). or try the good old LFG method.<br />

Should never ask which class is recommended, unless you want to do a specific task.  Play what you enjoy, that'll keep you in-game far longer than anything else. All the classes are &quot;best&quot; if thats the class you enjoy most.</div></div><hr />
