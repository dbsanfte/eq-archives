<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking over the many things that annoy me in Everquest, I've decided to finally put them all together on one document to better detail what exactly I would like to see. The list here includes the main ideas as well a specific implementations that I think could work well. The list in not all inclusive, but rather a work in progress as I brainstorm other ideas or implementations that I think of or discuss with others.<br />
<br />
1. Offline Bazaar Trader<br />
<br />
	This one is so obvious I have a hard time understanding why the current system wasn't implemented this way in the first place. There's no reason to restrict players to stay logged into the game when a game mechanic can be added to replace the current system. Currently, the system favors those player with “always on” internet broadband accounts or a dedicated dail-up account for those in rural areas. Not everyone has access or inclination to stay logged into the game 24/7 simply to sell gear and items they pick up while adventuring. A game mechanism to handle player vendors and/or auctions for player while they play the game or while they are away doing things in the real word would be very healthly for the in-game economy. Not only would rare items or tradeskill components be more readily available, it also allows market stabilization. Ofcourse not everyone would want such a thing, but mainly it would be those currently taking advantage of other player limited play time or, rather, trader time. Just as the Bazaar when introduced greatly improved the in-game market for goods, further improving this system to be more available to all players would make for an ideal system.<br />
<br />
Key features:<br />
<br />
1a) Ability to put items up for sale in a central market.<br />
1b) Setup instant sale or auction with instant pricing.<br />
1c) Sale your wares while offline or playing the game.<br />
<br />
2. Persistant messaging (email).<br />
<br />
	Think bard-mail if you like. Lets put those bards to work delivering mail between players. This has the potential for nothing but good. Better communitaction in a social game is a good thing(tm). Many newer, and even a few older, games have already inacted this sort of system. Expanding Everquest to include this feature too only further serves to maintain the game as the leader in the MMO market. Persistant messaging will allow players to coordinate events, chat, or barter goods and services from people while they are off-line. This should be a full function email type client in-game. You should be able to send a full message instantly between players, with options such as mailing to your friend list, guild, other guilds and setup your own mailing lists. Implementation should include hooks for mailing via stardard messaging clients should that feature be desired. Email your guild about a change to the raid time while you are off-line away from EQ at work.<br />
<br />
Key features:<br />
<br />
2a) Totally persistant messaging – ingame email client type functionality<br />
2b) Mailing lists for guilds, friendlists, or make your own.<br />
2c) Out of game functionality to send/recieve mail while away from the game. Great for workplace compatibility. Could use a form or POP3 type hooks for standardized messaging clients.<br />
<br />
3. Event planning/notification system or community bulletin board.<br />
<br />
	Guilds ofter rely on website to plan coming raids or other guild events. Many player do not do EQ things except while in EQ. Guilds shouldn't have to rely on a short MOTD to make announcements ot coming events. Having an tool to make posting a coming event, with time, location, and other applicable details would make this process much easier. Members could post an event so that they could count on other members of their guild to be there when they need help doing a quest encounters. Permissions could be included so that an officer could deny an event or post them to the guild itenerary.<br />
<br />
	This is not just limited to guilds either. A serverwide system could be put in  place to help plan open-raid organizations or single un-guilded players to solicit help with quests or plan a dungeon crawl in advance of logging on the next play session in a remote, underused dungeon. This could help those players who want to do more that using the /lfg tool to create experience groups or LdoN groups. Player coud plan their group one week ahead of time instead of logging on hoping to gather enough people of the appropriate level and flags/keys to explore an out of the way zone. Guilds could also use this post recruitment information or public events.<br />
<br />
Key features:<br />
<br />
3a) In-game persistant bulitin board system on a centralized system.<br />
3b) Fields for common information such as contact, date/time, event type, short discription, requirements, purpose, and detailed descriptions.<br />
3c) Guild, aliance, and open permissions.<br />
3d) Options for guild recruitment.<br />
3e) integration with other tools included here.<br />
<br />
4. Progressive dungeons.<br />
<br />
	This is not a new concept. Sola/b/c are of similar concept. The idea is to have a dungeon progress to harder and higher level content the further you go in, more so that it is now. Take my favorite dungeon, Clan Crushbone, for instance. You could have the standard CB for levels 5-15. However, instead of having to leave that dungeon, you could instead zone further into the dungeon, past the slavers perhaps, to another zone fill with more crushbone orc. This time they are levels 15-25, its a different zone, different maps and foes. Maybe after fighting Emperor Crush, you realize that he is not the real threat to Faydark that he seems. Maybe he is just a puppet for more mysterious enemies deeper within. Only adventuring furth within will you find out. As you zone further into to higher level zone as you level up, you discover more and more of what truly threatens The Faydark. Imagine growing your character in your favorite dungeon, all the way from level 5 or 20 all the way up to 65 or 70. Why leave CB if all you like to do in EQ is kill blue orcs. Why should you have to move on for no other reason than you've out leveled the zone. Imagine all your favorite dungeons now viable experience camp or dungeon crawls for level appropriate experience and loot. Imagine the quest usually associated with these zones, being just as progressive as your characters levels. Your favorite theme dungeon has now just become your favorite experience zone.<br />
<br />
Key features:<br />
<br />
4a) Progressively higher level dungeons based on similar themes as existing dungeons.<br />
4b) Common/low level area for player gathering/socializing.<br />
4c) Common “theme-wide” chat for /ooc, /shout, and /auctions.<br />
4d) Progressive items/lore quests based around leveling in these dungeons.<br />
4e) Completely separate zones for different level ranges. These aren't instances in other words, they are standard zones. Simiar to the way Sol A is to B and C.<br />
4f) Level requirements for entrance to the progression zones. This could be based off of average group level if needed.<br />
4g) Consistant lore throughout the theme as you go further in. ie. You won't be fighting orcs of you are in a gnoll theme unless the lore supports why. Like why D'vinn is in CB...<br />
<br />
5. Epic armor quests.<br />
<br />
	When you were new to EQ, chances are that you at least did part of your noobie armor quests. You had fun in your new found world while exploring and leveling and making new friend, while questing your armor. I held on to my first set for a very long time. Well, with our new progressive dungeons, we now have the option to expand those noobie armor quests. Expanding them to something you can use at level 65 or 70. Many people love progressive quests, this is just screaming to be “progressed”.<br />
<br />
Key features:<br />
<br />
5a) Progressively better and better armor all the way from noobie armor to max level armor.<br />
5b) These could be based around supporting you starting city or favorite town if you have the faction.<br />
5c) Quest based, lore and all, on classic themes for each city.<br />
5d) CLASS SPECIFIC and level appropriate, preferably with unique graphics. The different cities should all have very similar amor, ie there should be no preference except for roleplay unlike Fierce Heraldic is far and away a much better choice for warriors...this should not happen.<br />
	<br />
6. Expanded old world progressive quests.<br />
<br />
	Some of my favorite quest were done back when I was young. Quests like the queynos badges and warden symbols were all progressive. They however got left behind with the addition of new expansins and new loot tables. Many of these items are no long worth the time for the time it takes to do them. Many players long to come back to their hometowns and help out again. Adding new steps and rewards to the quest could breath new life into these old zones. No one is asking for a hand out here, make them challenging, but make the worthwhile. Make the revamp part of a complete revamp of that zones quests, making sure that each are working properly, and in some cases, have even been solved...<br />
<br />
Key features:<br />
<br />
6a) These old world quests should be able to take you to 65 and 70.<br />
6b) Risk/reward should follow current standards, no handouts here...<br />
6c) Insure that old quests are indeed working and they have been completed and adjust accordingly. An unused quest is a waste of dev time, yoou already have a leg up on the start to a bunch of addition higher level quest simply by expanding current ones.<br />
<br />
In closing,<br />
<br />
The revamps don't have to be free either, make them a part of the progressive dungeons idea, the additional zones could be added in an expansions. An expansion that I and I'm sure many many others would gladly pay a premium for. The player love these old zones, thay hold so many memories and adventures even for the new players. We've already been to the moon and back, dicsovered a new threat across the seas, and hiden dungeons under Norrath. The time has come to bring our knowledge and experience back to help our hometowns fight off old evils, solve old problems, and aid familiar allies. Bring us back home SOE. You know you want to...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yep, this would be great.<br />
especially if there is truly link between the different dungeon (which could be in different zone, aka BB and then Splitpaw). I mean making truly mob run from one to other calling for help and such.<br />
ex : if you don't catch the otc runner in GF, he reach a second dungeon (in LF for ex) and then a squad (between 8 and 20) of greater lvl (between 20 and 35) orc cross GF back to CB to assist Emp Crush in protecting the info on where is the location of the home of orc (which can become a flag system) to allow players to find the new dungeon and clear the orc threat even futher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">id be happy just to see them roll back dx9 and bring back gms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suppose that you prefer that they roll back to the classic EQ graphics too...<br />
I see GMs messing around all the time on Vaz, ever since the CS tool updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great ideas Vikken on the dungeons. <br />
<br />
One I would like on a wish list is new LDoN camps. Perhaps add one near Erudin and another near crushbone(yea I did like killing those orcs too) or something. A different theme to look at for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and a nejena one for de smushin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Particle effect epic armor.  Don't say you haven't thought about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">playin devils advocate  :D <br />
<br />
the part about the dungeons is interesting the bad part is if they added a back part to those then what is the use of the the rest of continents since would you really want to sit in Gfay, CB, CB2 from lvl 1 to 40? it is interesting but if that is done really no use for traveling and seeing the other content in the game, yes if your not lazy and like to explore then you will get bored and check other spots out but it would be just another griding place just like going from CB to PC to Neth to Gunktha to Dulak to Planes. really that is alot of content you miss out on and yes it allows you to get through those lvls but what is the use of the other 40+ zones that people dont use. i am accually for revamping zones to get interest in them again but revamps dont work really if there is not much interest in say running to kaesora if you can get the same exp by clicking clicking a stone and going to gunktha.<br />
<br />
part about the armor is not bad too but with armor if its armor that you work on from being a newb and gets better as you go along then what is the use of the rest of the armor if it gets periodically better with just that armor, no drops and reg drops would be rots, class specific armor i like alot since if its war olny and if i am the only war then i get it or have a better chance of getting it but pain when you have to roll for it against say a druid because they want to put it on an alt that they play maybe once in a blue moon but its all choices really, you can choose to use the same armor everyone untill endgame or you can choose whatcha like.<br />
<br />
<br />
nice ideas but got to look at what is the use of having other stuff if you only use 20% out of it?</div></div><hr />
