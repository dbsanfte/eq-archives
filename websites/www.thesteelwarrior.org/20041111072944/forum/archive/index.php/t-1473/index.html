<br />
Not really sure of what forum is appropriate for this question but here goes.<br />
<br />
I currently wear a Mind Worm Hide Mantle for my shoulder piece.  It comes from a named in Akehva that is no slouch.  I like the stats and resists it gives but it isn't tagged as magic.  Therefore, I cannot slam any mob requiring &quot;magic&quot; armor and must use kick.  My kick is maxed but IMHO, a piece requiring what used to be a raid to get should be magical.<br />
<br />
Now, any suggestions on requesting that (VI/SONY/Whoever is appropriate) look into getting an item changed with a magic tag?  It isn't a huge deal but just annoying that I cannot use my racial ability on many of the mobs I fight today.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Don't hold your breath though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember not being able to slam as a new warrior and upon finding out I needed Magical shoulders,Going out of my way to seek a pair out....<br />
<br />
It occurs to me that since that timeI have never  bothered to look to see if new shoulder upgrades I have gotten over time were Magical...<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda funny,Never thought I might loot something that would not allow me to slam certain mobs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye Surlok, it never dawned on me to check before I spent points on these as well.  I love the stats and will stick with kick until its magic flagged or I upgrade.</div></div><hr />
