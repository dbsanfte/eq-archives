<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bammab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
Attached is my magelo profile, I'm trying to upgrade.  A friend said I should sell the fungi for 55k and the helm for 10k.  If that's the case what should I upgrade first?  My shoulders will be replaced with the draconic pauld. item when I can get faction up other than that I don't have any other plans. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions<br />
<br />
:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally me as a Warrior I would not wear a Fungii, Might keep one in Bags for Putting on if I need to Regen<br />
<br />
But I would find something with more AC and Some HP<br />
<br />
Depending on your Price Range you can get<br />
<br />
Acrylia Plate BP 30 AC (I See you have in Inventory, I would wear that)<br />
<br />
Royal Velium BP 32 AC<br />
<br />
or one of the Cultural ones that are 51+ ac<br />
<br />
<br />
On the Helm, for the 10k I would also look for along the lines of AC and HP and go for a Helm of Raldukan I know on Emarr they sell for about 10K<br />
<br />
those are my Suggestions for something now, would need to know what you got to spend for other Gear Upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bammab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What ever i can get for the fungi in sale I'll use that for upgrades, i'm hoping about 55k.  I'll use the acrylia bp so the question is do i upgrade weapons or armor? and if so what.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
Bammab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Will look at your Gear again, not that I see budget.<br />
<br />
55k Should get you some really nice Upgrades.<br />
<br />
Another question would be What position do you hold in your Guild, are you a MA, or do you MA on Occasions, reason for this is Weapons Choices alot of times go back if you want Agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok on Gear here are some Suggestions, that were Suggested to me when I asked this question not too long ago<br />
<br />
Neck = Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
<br />
Fingers = Valorium Ring of Galantry<br />
<br />
Boots = Cobalt or something with More ac or HP<br />
<br />
Waste = I would look for a Haste item with some Stats (Silvery Belt of Contention, Same Haste, with Stats.)<br />
<br />
Weapons = Frostbringers are nice and can give Nice agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bammab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Currently I'm not in a guild, so for grouping i'd probably trying to get aggro so i'll go with the frosty.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions i'll look them up :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anytime, hope they help you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) Helm, get rid of it, Raldukan will serve ya well<br />
2) Gobby Earring - Bag it, buy a Solstice Earring<br />
3) Grab some friends and quest some BoBs, or buy 2x SS/Thurg Bracer, or 2x Silver Chitin Wristbands.. somethin with hps<br />
4) Frostbringer/BBoT combo would be good for ya.<br />
5) Decent Haste Item, Rgb, SBoC, RBB etc etc. dont skimp on haste<br />
6) Quest some Draconic Pauldrons<br />
7) Eyepatch of Plunder, Death Mask of the Elysians, Gantru Warmask, Rotten Eye Mask.. just get a better mask<br />
8) Darkwood Bow of Suffering, more hps/sta than Goranga, has 5 ac, and ya dont have to switch out every time you need to pull!<br />
9) Darkwater Pearl Ring is not worth the -45 hps.. get 2 Valorium Rings of Gallantry<br />
10) Booties with Hps.. SS MQ or something. <br />
11) Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
12) 1 35hp earring to replace your orc fang. <br />
13) SS Gaunts MQ<br />
14) Heiro/Maelstorm/Pernic Cloak<br />
15) Work on your AC, dont give up AC all the time for more hps. Thurg Greaves MQ would be good for ya, and with the 7sta it should be close to the same amount of hps, with 12 more ac. <br />
<br />
so pretty much by sellin off your fungi you can upgrade in every slot and still have some cash left over :p good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not sure what server your on and all , but I'd lose the helm and snag as much cash as you can and buy MQ's of as much thrug as you can afford, maybe some SS if your lucky, the gems are cheap thanx to Druids quadding CS all day, and the smaller items ie gloves boots bracers even arms sometimes are only a 1k - 1.5, legs and BP may be steep but all else should be fetched for under 10k inc gems.<br />
<br />
just my 2¢</div></div><hr />
