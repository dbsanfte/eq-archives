It involves drinking some drink that effects you for 10 mins or so. What does the drink do? Where is the cave? does it really take the full hour to complete the quest? Can it be done solo? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">08-05-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont remember the drink doing anything to my warrior, and the cave is just north of the human buildings, but you have to got east to get up the hill, then head west to the west zonewall.   I did it solo at lvl 32ish, when its a level 20ish quest, so it took me no time at all, and you didnt have to go very far into the cave. I would guess, but not garuntee it would be challengeing, but doable at level 25+ solo. snare the gnolls, err hamstring them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hammerbeard</div><div class="date">08-05-2005, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember correctly the drink just makes you drunk.  Normal intoxication effects like hard to run in a straight line and some stat effects.  Fun, Fun, Fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiffe</div><div class="date">08-05-2005, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this quest not too long ago.  I suggest going down to the west end of the lake, and then just going north up into the hills from there; easier that way.  Keep bearing to the left/west, and you'll run right into it.  Clearly marked on this map: http://www.worldofwar.net/cartography/worldmap/redridge.php<br />
<br />
As for the difficulty, it's ridiculously easy.  The drunkeness is negligible, the mobs are easy, and you finish the cave objective as soon as you enter.  Shouldn't be difficult for anyone to solo as soon as they're high enough to get the quest, and probably within ten minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabryn</div><div class="date">08-07-2005, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help everybody!<br />
I'll give it a shot tonight... I tried the quest once before and died...<br />
couldn't find the cave and got jumped by a few mobs while i was wondering around looking... I thought it was over for me but I was able to abandon the quest and I can try it again! :)</div></div><hr />
