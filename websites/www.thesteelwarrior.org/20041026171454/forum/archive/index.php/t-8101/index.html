<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok great.  <br />
<br />
There's a big guild summit, brought on primarily by Woody's Boycott Post.  Everyone goes out to California, has a big love in, gets promised that everyone will work together to make Everquest a better game.  Wonderful.  Some of us actually buy into the fact that there is a change of attitude from SoE. <br />
<br />
We see other indications of it.  Grumbuk posts some detailed information about stuff he's working on.  Some kind of class feedback person posts on TSW.  (Not really sure what that's all about, but sure... sounds like someone is asking for feedback. Can't be bad...) <br />
<br />
The planned patch for July 7 is pushed back a week because its too buggy.  Well, never heard that one before.  That's impressive.  Except for the fact that the patch comes out it has some totally retarded bugs still in it!!!<br />
<br />
If you're going to update the AA system for some reason, (and oh, btw, not mention you're doing it in the patch message) then why didn't someone actually USE A DAMN AA EFFECT BEFORE ACTUALLY PUTTING IT LIVE?  Like use AE taunt while Defensive?  Count the hp's from PE?  Open a door while SoS is in effect?  Are we really supposed to believe that there's a QA department at SoE?  How do you miss the fact that AA abilities are buggered up when its the most fundamental part (code-wise) of what you're doing in a patch?  <br />
<br />
Here's an idea... Stop wasting time and effort with window dressing bullshit about how important feedback is and just get the damn patches right the first time.  This is just friggen amateur hour. <br />
<br />
Sorry.  Just had to vent there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe that the AA refund was meant to go live on the next patch, and some dude at SoE foegot the 7th july patch was retarded and so puted their unfinished code in the wrong patch file... :rolleyes: ... but I don't think so.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, could you imagine how buggy the patch must have been the 7th to be still so weirdly buggy one week after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SoE needs a standard set of use cases for all possible class functionality (with branches).  This should then use these to develop test scripts to be run through as a regression test after each alteration of core functionality in this area.  This is testing 101.  Its glaringly obvious that this is not done. <br />
<br />
That being said this patch was a good step forward...they just have alot more work to do (some of it structural on how they do release management).</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, that's so true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">iirc everything worked fine on test.<br />
<br />
maybe they should take a look and see whats different between test and live. their might be some part of code that never got removed or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">iirc everything worked fine on test.<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
and leave it to them to have a test server thats so different from the live server that they cant even competently test patches.<br />
<br />
on the one hand the bugs from this patch were nowhere near the crippling bugs that we still have from dx9 patch early this year. yes we are still crippled but since they fixed about half the issues by now people are forgetting how bad it actually still is. they shouldnt even be working on aa changes augment refunds and reuse or any of this glitter. i like these features but i think they like them more. because a lot of programmers excecutives and marketing people like new features better than they like fixing old ones. so they fix enough to get rid of most of the complaints and then start brand new features (and brand new bugs) and pat themselves on the back for delaying the new features by a week. they still need to fix the old bugs. for example...<br />
<br />
i cannot fathom code so bad that i can right click on a corpse and it fails to target. this bug has been around since release.<br />
<br />
f8 targets nearest mob only if it feels like it. many times it doesnt. this bug has been around since release.<br />
<br />
mouse targetting works when it feels like it. bug been around since release.<br />
<br />
many people with advanced machines are laggy as can be in many zones. six month old problem and counting. admittedly this is a hard one to fix but its also one of the top two reasons i believe people have quit.<br />
<br />
server failing to drop a person who goes ld. bug is at least 2 years old.<br />
<br />
mobs still getting stuck under the world in huge numbers. bug at least 2 years old probably since release.<br />
<br />
boats broken at least 4 years.<br />
<br />
and this is just a small small sampling.<br />
<br />
<br />
and yet people post here to rant about &quot;im missing 20 hp&quot;. you value your 20 hp more than you value being able to target a mob thats beating on your cleric .. but being unable.<br />
<br />
leave a bug long enough and people just get used to it and consider it normal. its not only not normal but i cant figure out how code could be written with such glaring problems that are so resistant to fixing.</div></div><hr />
