<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh SBoZ is a relic chief. i wouldn't bother augmenting it because you can't sell it when you upgrade. it's about 3 expansions old and not up to par with what is available these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.  And here I thought it was still a nice weapon :eek:   I guess I go with another of my posts and sell it while its still worth something.  It was a gift from a friend (Gnerb where the hell are you), so I was looking for alternatives.  I dumped my Windblade yesterday and bought 2 Valorium rings with a lot of change left over.  Maybe this = more upgrades!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ain't knocking it; just that there's so much better out there for ya that's worth investing augments into ( copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn readily come to mind ).<br />
<br />
If it's a gift; than hang onto it. Stuff like that; the sentimental value &gt; *; but when it comes down to the meat and potatoes of it..the SBoZ is dated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That = cheapest IMO and should last you fine until then :)<br />
<br />
The best DW setup campable by one group would Probably be Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
If you put two Ykesha augs on that  (or double Anger III if you live in LDON)<br />
<br />
You will have ridiculous agro. Enough to tank anything probably up to RZtW :)<br />
<br />
That is around 6 procs a minute, 1200 hate from two Anger Procs in Main hand, another 600 from offhand, plus three stuns, two of them as planar (SotBS on main).<br />
<br />
Dats a Lot o Hate!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got the GSoT will drop a hate Aug on it when I get the points.  As for DW I have the bloodsworn, and will camp the hammer soon.  Then back to LDoN....  <br />
Im buying a WMBS with the proceeds from my other weapons sales so I should be good to go until I get that magical invite to get flagged etc.<br />

Dont Hate me cuz Im a sexy Barbarian, Hate me because I'm kicking your ASS Baby!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't really need it but figured i'd give it to a guildie's alt or some random warrior noob I see around sometime.<br />
<br />
Kinda pisses me off I paid 20k for one back when they were actually rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">devlok</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I paid 75k (</div></div><hr />

<br />
75k!  Gah! :eek:<br />
<br />
I agree with the above.  Sell your SBoZ pronto and buy/camp the CHoS.  Throw practically any proc aug on it and you are set!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know, I paid 20k for my GSoT (when no one on my server knew what it was).  Then it had a big price spike (up to 45k at one point).  Then the next week it was 500 plat.  I just gave mine away to a guildie who needed a agro weapon.  I just couldn't stand to sell it for 500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i camped the bazaar for 2 days trying to find a GSoT and finally picked one up for 31k, now im sad to see them the same price as a Weighty Polearm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sboz is one of the finest twink weapons available - notice no min. or req. level on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of weapons with no minimum required or recommended levels ...<br />
<br />
The Blackened Acrylia Blade is also a damn fine twink weapon.<br />
<br />
Pairing up an SBoZ and a Blackened Acrylia Blade would do any dual wielding twink just fine for a long time. Be it a warrior, a bard or a ranger.<br />
