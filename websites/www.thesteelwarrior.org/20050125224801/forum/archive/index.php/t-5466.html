Whats the deal with this, and is it worth the hassle? Is the aggro sufficient? More importantly, would it be considered an exploit??? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When they released LDoN, they added an NPC in Freeport who will give you augmentable versions of your epic if you turn in your 2hander and the scabbard.<br />
<br />
So if you already have the summoned versions (i.e. you're walking around with the 2hander AND the two 1handers), you'll have an extra set of 1handers.<br />
<br />
Is it better aggro? Not in my experience, no. <br />
<br />
EDIT: THIS may require some qualification ... so here goes ... in my experience, the red and blue blade or the 2handed epic hold aggro just fine. And the other red blade in the offhand doesn't proc much (see various threads on proc rates). So that I have yet to notice much of a difference. They've been about the same for me. BELLOW has been a noticable difference for me, and has improved my tanking experience quite a bit. The second red blade gave me no noticable improvement. I hold aggro great right now, but not because I can dual wield the red blades ... but because I can point at mob and BELLOW it. <br />
<br />
Is it an exploit? No.<br />
<br />
Is it worth the hassle? Well, if a 14/24 is good enough DPS for you, then yes.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, I already carry around 10 damn weapons, so my 5 epics stay in the bank.</div></div><hr />

I carry the 5 just for fun and looks though.  Confuses people when you hold two of the same color.  As for if it is worth it, remember that you have one shot, if you make the augmentable ones without doing the summoned sword thing first, you won't have a chance to get 5 down the road.  Do it and pop em in the bank if you don't want to carry them around =p  Or you can be like me and carry around enough weapons that you only have 4 slots in one bag empty heh</div></div><hr />

I've heard that it was removed at the release of GoD since the recipe is now &quot;unneeded&quot; because you can no longer poof your epics on an DNC (since this is supposedly the reason it was put in)<br />
<br />
Then again, its been around for ages, even after the DNC no longer ate items, and you can still get 2 epics by getting all the parts (except scabbard) twice, so it won't stop people from DW the same color.  So why remove it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silsun</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this still works as of 02/21/2004 I finished my epic today, and got two Swords of Runes, dropped them into the scabbard, hit combine, and got squat. So I figured it was removed. Took one of the swords out, hit combine and BAM, there they were. So yes, it still works, but you only need 1 sword to get both the 1hs back. I misread the above posts and thought you needed two, but you only need one. Good luck!!!</div></div><hr />
