<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bad Mojo</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took a 2 year break from EQ, and just getting back into it.  My Warrior is only 31st level, and I'm trying to get him up to speed.  I did a search but couldn't find a post listing the Disciples available on a level by level bases, along with a location to purchase at.  I found the three for sale in the PoK library, but according to Lucy/Alakhazam there should be a few more available for my level.  Any pointers for a Warrior seriously out of the loop?</div></div><hr />

You can use only one disc at a time.  If you use a disc, discs on the same timer can not be used until the timer of the one you did use is up.  However, you can use another disc immediately after as long as it is on a different timer, and you have enough endurance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To use these discs, you have to buy the &quot;tomes&quot; from an NPC in the PoK library. The NPC's name is Heldin Swordbreaker; he's a Barbarian on the same balcony level as the clerics and his loc is n100, +1110, n28.<br />
Take the tomes to your (warrior) trainer npc and he'll train you so that you have the discs, which you can use via a hotkey box that should pop up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaspar</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple questions:<br />
<br />
a) what does the &quot;make fragile&quot; variable do in the healing will abilities?<br />
b) what is the practical difference between defensive and stonewall? ie, same mitigation, just less melee dmg on the former and no crits + snare on the latter -- when would you use one over the other?<br />
c) i hear people talking about whether they use fellstrike or mighty strike -- is this to imply that the other offensive disciplines just typically aren't used in favor of these two?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make Fragile means the discipline will end if you attack or cast a spell in any way.  You can be hit, just can't hit back.<br />
<br />
Defensive and Stonewall do have the exact same mitigation.  Both make it so you can't crit.  The only difference is the decreased dps vs snare.  Defensive is best used when you will be moving a lot (knockback mobs, cornering, your guild pushes a lot, etc).  Also when you are raiding, and your dps doesn't matter, defensive is usually best.  Stonewall is best used when you won't be moving much, or if you are doing stuff with low numbers when your dps will matter (especially GoD single group trials).<br />
<br />
Regarding offensive disciplines.  I believe fellstrike simply is more damage than aggressive, even if it's not, most people like the speed of the dps with fellstrike (30 seconds) vs aggressive (1min).  Also, fellstrike increases your hit by a good bit, so fellstrike basically is the disc to use to get the huge damage crit / crip hits for your screen shots =p.  Precision is less damage than fellstrike.  Charge is also less dps.  Fellstrike is overall better dps than mighty strike too.  But, if you are berserk, you can use mighty strike to stun the mob a lot.  Which can help save your life if you are solo, or if the heal is going to be late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the agressive disc makes you hit more, but your avoidance goes down as well.  The Fellstrike and Mighty Strike are better for when your tanking and want some DPS because Agressive you increase the amount the mob hits you.  But one thing I would like to know is, is Spirit Rage worth even using.  The only thing I can think of is turn it on for pull and incite then click off to get ready to use furious, but I would like to know more about Spirit Rage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggressive only makes you hit for more now.  When they changed the discipline system, they removed the negative effect from it, as well as decreased it's duration from 3 mins to 1 min.<br />
<br />
As for Spirit of Rage, there is a thread going about it here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6714)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Btuuk</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just a little note worth of my 2cp's<br />
<br />
I am only 62nd level, but I have been MA on many of our raids (xanamech/PoFear) and I have been using a little trick with my defensive discs..<br />
<br />
When I engage a named mob, I immediatly hit my berate and my furious discipline...this gives the clerics a full 8 seconds to get thier rotation going and it has not failed yet...then once that disc falls, I hit my defensive and its all over but the crying....<br />
<br />
aint it great to be a warrior?</div></div><hr />
