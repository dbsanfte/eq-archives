Take a look at my magelo and tell me what I should buy to get the best bang for the buck.  I can get a Blood Metal Earring and another Steel Ring of Earth and still have money left over.  Also, Boots of the Storm can be had for just at 50k.  That's some of the things I've been looking at.  Any weapons suggestions would be ok too, I haven't looked at the buyable OoW stuff yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I was going to hold off for a Helm of RZ for that slot.  They can be had for around 110k or so.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I was lucky but I got Somv for 80k and MoM for 30k, may want to look into them. (magelo for stats)</div></div><hr />

Wait a month. Prices on everything will drop by 10-30 % guaranteed.</div></div><hr />

I've been looking at those.  Until I get a good indication to how much hate they produce compared to my current combo I'm not going to spend the PP on them.  The DPS on the sword would be a major upgrade and the stats are sweet, but I don't want to lose the agro.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebast</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picked up a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement and a Jagged Antiquity.  I'm actually going to save up and hold off any bazaar upgrades for now unless I find another Steel Ring of ER cheap.  With Virtue and Self buffs I'm 5900 HPs/1388 AC.  That should do me for a while :).</div></div><hr />
