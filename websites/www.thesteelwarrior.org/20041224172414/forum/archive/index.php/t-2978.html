Succeeded with 30 minutes to spare and none of us were Time geared. <br />
<br />
The way I see it, unless the straight up suck at EQ, if you have 6 65's and do a normal mission, you're going to win. At least, that was the trend I was hearing last night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At one point the Druid was busy looting and linking loot etc... so he didn't heal me... for like 30 seconds+... I died, we wiped... no resses for us...<br />
<br />
We had to wait freaking 45 more minutes to get our corpses and I had a raid to get to... it was very damn annoying.<br />
<br />
I won't be doing an adventure EVER again without a cleric.<br />
<br />
We also wiped again with another group, War, War, Clr, Wiz, Nec... because the cleric set off a trapped chest and died... and aggro'd the 10 mobs from trap on us... and wiz didn't have Exodus and didn't have Evac memmed... <br />
<br />
That 2nd group was my 1st group and the first on the server to fail an Adventure..... such a great Server First! I'm certainly doing well on the leader boards.... course you can't sort by most losses or worst loss%, heh.</div></div><hr />

On another note, there was also a 65 war that was in there earlier in the day.  He apparently died, twice and had no resses.  He had to log off for a couple hours and got back... his corpse timer had expired when he wasn't even online... and his corpses didn't 'pop out' until he logged back in... just a FYI.</div></div><hr />

Hard was very cool -- mobs were very difficult to split, hard to control, and hit like Tier 4 mobs.  My group was Cleric, Warrior, Monk, Druid, Wizard, Enchanter (all Tier 4 geared).  We were behind on the goal looting 20 statuettes when my cleric died to a bad pull by me of 4 mobs that hit for +1000.<br />
<br />
Hard is at least 5 times harder than normal IMO.  Normal was wayyyy easy.  Normal was not even a challenge.  I think that normal feels like Kunark dungeons at level 60, while hard feels like being in the elemental planes with level 60s with no AAs and Velious gear.<br />
<br />
Trying Hard as your first adventure is not a good idea either!  I recommend doing a normal mission first.</div></div><hr />

you can go in there and get them (at least you could on beta) .. not like they repop.<br />
<br />
On beta we actually won even with a wipe. But the cleric was bound outside.<br />

As far as the corpse timer expiring.. wonder if they forgot to sync up the servers =p<br />

Think you mean that with no rezer you have to wait.. correct. But with a pally/cleric/necro they can go in and rez the dead.</div></div><hr />

No tank, no crowd control.  With level 65s mostly in VT level gear normal is pretty easy.  I'm sure it's trivial in elemental/time gear.  Later I talked to some people in family guilds that said they tried multiple times and couldn't come close to finishing within the time limit, so probably normal is a challenge for people in casual guilds, meaning the difficulty is probably about right.  Plane of Time people should not complain about normal being too easy unless they are trying to screw over non-uber types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that there needs to be more then two difficulty settings.  Normal is too easy, and Hard was more stressful then anything else.  Just give the options to be challenged but still succeed at all levels of play.  Right now it seems that someone in a mid tier guild will either have it easy or find it undoable, throw in someone in Time and it's either fall asleep or be fairly well challenged.  2-3 more gradiants between the two would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard needs to give about twice the points as it currently does, and fix the gathering thing so it is actually possible to finish.  I have heard of guildies failing the gathering mission without any significant slowdown in a DPS loaded group just because the items did not drop.<br />
<br />
I don't see any point to not do normal over and over again.  I haven't done one on Hard but I'd assume it takes longer to finish a Hard mission too.  You can crank out a normal one in 40-50 minutes with a good group, not to mention right now if you draw a gather mission in Hard you might as well just quit and get a new one to save you the time unless you're feeling lucky with the RNG.</div></div><hr />

Shaman used his AE slow for the first time in a while.. was very cool, I could also see non-standard groups having fun in there as well.

We wiped in the first 5 minutes because the druid didn't snare, mob ran off and we got like half the dungeon on us.  Half the group copped out immediatly, even though I was the only one to die, hit AE taunt so the rest could run.  No rezzer in grooup, so I couldn't get a rez.  Someone in the group went afk and didn't leave the adventure, so the zone stayed up and my corpse wouldn't pop out.  By the time it did pop out I had 20 minutes to convince a passer by cleric to stop and click me.<br />

I see the potential for people to cause some grief with that, even though this time I don't think it was intentional</div></div><hr />

Finished a rescue mission tonight ... Beat the clock with ONE minute on it ... that was pretty wild.  I could almost hear the &quot;DAH-DA DUH DAH-DA DUH!!&quot; action music in my head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit you stupid NPC - - RUN, don't walk!!&quot; all the way back to the dungeon entrance to close the mission ;).<br />
<br />
57 WAR (Me),  58 CLR,  55 SHM,  2 55 DRU, and a 52 ROG.<br />
<br />
Cleric off-tanked, Shaman off-tanked to park.  It's an old routine for us, we know it well.  (The rogue, tho a guildie, hasn't grouped with us often, and seemed to be a little surprised by it, at first :D.)  One druid was on DoTs and nukes, and the other was on buffs (group regens and group DS), snares, and any damage she could muster the mana for.  <br />
<br />
We all had a blast, though we were probably watching the clock too much ... some hasty foolishness here and there could have cost us dearly, and would have, if we were not used to each other.<br />
<br />
No aggro problems for me, held it or grabbed it when I needed too, and the group was smart about it.  Generally, folx were pretty good about when to med and such.  Nice thing about no re-spawns was the looong hall behind us they could back up into if they needed to sit a &quot;spell&quot; ;).<br />
<br />
We've tried a couple variants so far, and I've been pleased by how each line-up seemed to work well.  If everyone knew what they were doing ;).<br />

<br />
that was the best adventure i had been on. my heart was racing when we finally killed her cause she kept CH'ing on us. <br />

Doing a pickup group at normal difficulty in the 50s is very challenging.  A family group that's had experience together and communicates well would do much better.<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be a real 'Supergroup' but you do need a really balanced group with decent DPS to succeed on most missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its based on level, time left, and if you asked for hard or easy<br />
<br />
Almost.  The points are based on level and difficulty.  The time remaining when you succeed does not effect the points you get.  At level 65 in a normal mission, you'll get 51 points regardless of whether it took you 79 minutes or 7. <br />
<br />
The level 65 hard missions give you 76 points.  In my opinion it should probably be a bit more.  There is no fucking around with the difficulty of those missions. <br />
<br />
I would think you could almost always go back for your corpse since mobs do not repop on you.  You should also be able to get a new rezzer into the dungeon to rez the corpses (you can disband and invite new people - which is just a cheat waiting to happen). <br />
<br />
The dungeons are great fun.  Although racing against the clock for an hour (average time to complete a mission for my group) might get tiring eventually, its refreshing that the dungeons are always a little different.  I'm lovin' it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior (me)<br />
Paladin<br />
Rogue<br />
Beastlord<br />
Enchanter<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
I did the pulling, think the biggest pull of the night was 4 mobs, usually it was 1-2, which was NP for the enchanter to handle. We had plenty of DPS, and finished 2 hard level mistmoore missions, both with around 25 mins to spare. One was a &quot;kill 57&quot; mobs, the other was a kill the Boss type mission.<br />
<br />
I know we arent supposed to say good things about paladins in this forum, but it was really nice having one as backup healer/rooter/stunner/offtanker. Before each mez break we just had pally root or stun, that meant zero agro problems usually, I was doing the primary tanking.<br />
<br />
This was my first 2 missions on hard, so was pleasantly surprised. Better exp than normal, and some nice drops along the way(100hp ring, 90hp/90 mana leather sleeves, some 90 hp chain coif etc).<br />
<br />
And best of all, it wasnt as mind-numbingly boring as the normal missions. So can definately recommend it if you can get a good guild-group together. I would not dare try it with a pickup group though ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
its based on level, time left, and if you asked for hard or easy <br />
<br />
At 65 I get 51 per normal, 13 for a finish after time up. <br />
<br />
To further clarify the point - it is based on time left, with a specific cutoff at 90 minutes.  Finish in 8 or 89, get one level of points, finish in 91 or 119, get a lower level of points.  Gerick and Vigdis are both 100% correct, but addressing different aspects of &quot;time left&quot;.<br />
<br />
And then modified by individual level (not group average level), and difficulty setting.<br />
<br />
Supergroup, imo, is one that communicates well.  Tonight, I did a p/w with two from my guild, and 3 from two other guilds, and I became convinced of it.  Lineup was Monk, 2 Warrior, Shaman,  2 Druids.  Last night, the same class lineup (but different players), minus the Monk, had few problems.  Tonight, we had nothing but disaster, and it was entirely due to failure in group dynamics.<br />
<br />
Had a druid today who was playing with a hand over his eyes (that's what I assume).  Didn't follow when we moved, didn't heal, snare, DoT ... didn't do much of anything, really.  I had the feeling that he was trying out grouping for the first time, due to the nature of LDoN.  So did everyone else in my group, judging by the /tells :P.  (When he ninja'd a +5 wis augment, I exploded, apologized, quit, then sat outside and camped the hole in the ground for my corpse *hehe*.)<br />
<br />
Doubtless, some class selection can &quot;dumb down&quot; the mission.  And other lineups could tear thru one type and gank another.<br />
<br />
Still getting the knack of it, but without a doubt it emphasizes the group dynamic more than the usual hunt ... failure in the dynamic is failure of the mission, and there is little or no time to &quot;learn&quot; your groupmates.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  This is still a garble.  I surrender.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone tell me the significance of indoor zones?  That's a class limitation for wizards I'm not familiar with, and knowing more about that could only help me :D.<br />
<br />
I don't have the impression that mana conversion is the issue it used to be, with KEI, FT, mounts, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things.<br />
<br />
First, I'm not at all convinced that you get points for finishing up the mission post-90.  I've heard that the points you earn are set at the 90-minute mark...but some folks will get partial points on a fail at that point depending on how close to the goal they are.  I haven't failed, so I don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
Second, I don't believe you can pacify or lull or anything your way to a boss mob.  The simple reason for this is that the assassination mobs do not SPAWN until you have cleared approximately 60-70% of the dungeon (similarly, the rescue mobs will not leave until you have cleared that much of the dungeon; and the collection and slaughter missions require that you kill about that percentage of the dungeon - so it all boils down to just killin' shit in a dungeon).  I can't honestly test this out, because I don't group with bards as I think they're are all wack jobs.  But I do know that neither a ranger nor a druid has ever been successful in tracking a boss mob in the start of our mission, or even half way through our mission.  The only time the trackers can pick up the mob is after the directional messages begin.  These messages do not begin until you have slaughtered a ton of mobs.  Yes, I know that it could be that they begin once you are close enough and the trackers can only track once you are close enough.  I don't buy it.  In a few of the assassinate missions we were damn close to the boss mob before the messages and tracking started.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is one of the reasons why I believe melee in general is in trouble.  In the face of Rangers with Bows and Wizards, melee DPS is lackluster.  Monks have a legit beef.  Rogues are wondering if they really do make a difference.<br />
<br />
Of course that doesn't stop Wizards from thinking Paladins do too much damage to Undead. ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you actually are curious Darkoan (I do not believe you are), I'll break it down a little for you:<br />
... then two sentences later mention &quot;mounts&quot; ... <br />
The more significant part of when I mentioned &quot;mounts&quot; was that I did so one paragraph later.<br />
<br />
One was a question, the other a commentary.  They were connected but distinct thoughts, and a paragraph is intended to show exactly that sort of seperation.  I assumed that that would be clear.<br />
<br />
Mounts were one item of a partial list of mana utilities in the game.  KEI, FT, mana regen spells, mod rods etc etc still apply.  Losing the mount isn't significant, it's merely inconvenient.  Nor is losing the mount a class limitation specific to wizards, but that specificity was fairly subtle. <br />
<br />
From here on in, you can piss alone, this isn't a contest.<br />
<br />
I've noticed the same thing with tracking and &quot;objective&quot; mobs Vigdis, although I don't  know if the spawn is triggered by kills or proximity.  I haven't been part of a pacify / lull tactic yet, except for pull control.  Generally, we kill through, anyway.  On a rescue mission, we emptied out one room by pulling from the door.  Once we had killed the MOBs and entered the room, we got the &quot;cry for help&quot; message.  That is also exactly when the &quot;prisoner&quot; showed up on track. <br />
<br />
Until I see new information, I am convinced that an objective type of MOB spawned by a trigger, whether that is proximity, kill count, or a combination of both, I dunno.  I've been killin' through on my attempts anyway, so I have no way of knowing.<br />
<br />
As far as the time thing goes, my conclusions are based almost entirely on hearsay, except that on one failure, when we hit 90 minutes, the message said that we had 30 minutes to continue for a &quot;lesser reward&quot;.   We received no reward at 90 or 91 minutes.  We did, however, lose two of our group and quit the mission, and so I don't know if we would have gotten a payoff if we had finished in 120 minutes.  I'm pretty confident that we would have, based on the posts I've seen to date.<br />
<br />
Had an experience with pacify pulling on a rescue mission which I took notice of.  All the way through, it went without a hitch, until we got to the last room.  A pet was sent in while the pulled MOB was casting, and wouldn't return; we enter the room and engaged the MOB at it's spawn point.  As soon as we got close to the &quot;prisoner&quot;, the pacified mobs &quot;de-pacified&quot;.  All 3 in the same instant, and within seconds of it being cast.   My edjumicated guess from this is that some events &quot;break&quot; pacification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the 60% clearing requirement is ingrained in every mission to avoid 'sploiting.  I can't imagine how many different ways one could otherwise exploit these missions, but there are probably a ton.  Others might call the exploits &quot;strategy&quot; (lulling, FD pulling away, etc), but whatever you call them they negate the whole point of a good dungeon crawl - killing stuff.  I would be interested to know whether SoS rogues have been able to search out and find the rescue/assassination mobs at the beginning of a mission.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds right to me ... it's close to what I assumed when our cleric's pacification dropped simultaneously on the &quot;guards&quot; - that there was no way to sneak our &quot;prisoner&quot; out of there without a fight.<br />
<br />
I had assumed that when we entered that room, we triggered the &quot;cry for help&quot;, and then it checked for kill count, or it may have just been client/server lag.  We were about 15 seconds, maybe 30 before we moved into the room (after clearing the last MOB in it), and &quot;trigger then check&quot; mechanism seems reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
What seems more likely to me now, having read this, is that we triggered the spawn the momen we kille &quot;MOB X&quot;, but the &quot;cry for help&quot; / tracking only works from a certain proximity, as /yell does.  We were a two druid group, without any other tracker to compare to.<br />
<br />
Would you like half of a fresh hare?  I just recently split it :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the poster who said there should be more settings, i have 200 friends who would agree. Normal is too easy for VT+ geared people and Hard is well very HARD. Aside from wanting to challenge a hard setting, the return on time invested looks like this. In the time it takes to do a hard setting you can do 2 soft adventures and guarantee yourself 104 points. Of course, there is no guarantee you will beat a hard adventures. 104 &gt; 72 &gt; 0. The whole return on investment is out of balance.<br />
<br />
I think there should be a medium setting thats worth 72 points and the hard setting should be bumped up in value.</div></div><hr />

Comparing runs just by points isn't accurate.  You have to take the event on the whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you are both missing another element of the hard missions.  Its about points, its about drops, but mostly it should be about having a kick ass time. :p</div></div><hr />

We finish slaughter missions in about 55-60 minutes, assassinate take closer to 75. <br />

One nice thing about LDoN, even if you fail it doesn't feel like you've been slapped down or you wasted 1.5 hours of your life.  You got some items.  You got experience.  You got to roll with having a little fun.  If you don't care about your ranking its all good.</div></div><hr />

The slower and crowd controller were not &quot;specialized&quot; to the task but they added more DPS then a typical shaman/chanter.  And bards rule in LDON.</div></div><hr />

Do I read this right that the only reason you get a rog over a wiz because you cant HOLD agro vs a dps class? <br />
LDoN stuff hits so pathetically weak, wizzies tank it as well as rogues do. LR5 and ID5 is also avialable to int casters, you know?</div></div><hr />
