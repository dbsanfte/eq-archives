<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tavaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know I am semi well dressed. I 2 box a 65 Shaman or a 62 Cleric pretty much at all times. I am looking for advice on stuff that I can upgrade with just me/sham or occasionaly I have a 65 druid join me. I am working on LDoN stuff. Mainly I am just looking for ideas on something I may have overlooked. At the moment, the ornate stuff overall is not worth the PP being asked for it on Rodcet Nife. I have seen a few prices starting to drop, but by very slow degrees. Thanks in advance.  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like your pretty well set until you get some levels and some AA later in the game. When i used my CHS and SBS I had CHS in main, I got better Dps and what seemed to be better aggro. Get your self some anger2 or 3's and maybe some Htp 40 from EC and I think your set.</div></div><hr />
