<br />
I heard the scimitar of war is good aggro since the effect is an AC and SV decrease.<br />
<br />

<br />
On the Stone Mallet , people say the effect is good aggro.. could someone please explain how?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not sure if theres anything special to the proc of the storm blade. personally i've never understood how rune would effect aggro but i guess it does. personally i think you test them out and run parses. if ya don't want to do that then the mallet. prob best dps behind storm blade and has good aggro and stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">is the obsidian scimitar of war good aggro?  <br />
<br />
like, is the proc as good for aggro as the force strike on GBoS or CHoS?  or how about compared to the CHSD off xana by comparison?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wrath of wind: 150 dd same proc as summoned pet sword.<br />
<br />
obsidian shater: -6 ac 30dd 1min duration no counters or dot.<br />
<br />
rune 2: 118point shield aoe agro.<br />
<br />
none are super on agro, but the rune kinda counts like a 118 point heal and tends to tick mobs off more then dd and non counter debuffs. has anyone encountered stacking issue with druids on obs shater?<br />
<br />
as for off hand the hammer looks good best ratio, hp, and ac, but the des shouldn't be passed up if it drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I mainly picked up my stormblade because I got it unexpectedly for low raid points and it was a nice high dps offhand to pair with my BF.  I'd go for the stone etched mallet, but if you can get that you may as well just wait for a SEWs or a BoW.</div></div><hr />
