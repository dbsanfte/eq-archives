<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone ever done that endurance thing ? how many people ? worth it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Marduka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tried that in my 60's with a few other 60~65 people (1 grp) - got terrible wiped and never tried again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done this with an AE group.   It's actually good xp because you plow through so very many low blues.  Each round we got a decent drop considering the effort.  After a few rounds we were removed from the event for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
The npc said something like 'you did great, you up for continuing?' and we said yes and he booted us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">These were designed to let people enter the plane of war...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did the thing with all the spiders dropping from the roof a good while back. Mostly AE. Was pretty easy, after awhile the stupid robot thanked us and told us we were done. No reward. My group ported out(you tell him like a PoJ trial) and I attacked him, only got him to like 96%. Bastard.</div></div><hr />
