<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuadine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got mine, used them and really noticed a difference with agro control when using incite.  Especially like the fact that the re-use time is so short.<br />
<br />
Was wondering what other opinions were and if maybe I just got lucky with the agro tonight.<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 65 Wood Elf (yes a wood elf :P ) warrior playing on the Quellious Server.<br />
<br />
While this is my first post to this forum, I've used you guys as a resource for a long time...thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing wrong with being a wood elf.  Im the MT of my guild and im a wood elf.  As for aggro control, i box a wizard and i can easily say that i can nuke much earlier with my wizard than before hte patch.  It may not be aggro lock but with Incite (and to a certain extant taunt now that it shows the failure message) i can play my class with a lot less aggro managment induced stress.  <br />
On a bright note, i helped out a pickup raid doing the caprin cycle and I was really surprised how i didnt lose aggro at all on caprin.  I used incite and stonewall (plus the anger 3 augmented ssra sword) and not once did the raid pull aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't been able to log in because of all the patches falling on my normal playing time, so I am wondering this:  is Taunt still allowed?  And how do you get the Incite ability?<br />
<br />
I can't wait to try this stuff out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Equirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shouldn't this be in the Arena? :P In any case there are multiple post there concerning our new abilities there.</div></div><hr />
