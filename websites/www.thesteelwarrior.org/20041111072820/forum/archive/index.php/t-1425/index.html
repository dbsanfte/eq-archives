I know some of the choices look a little odd, but given what you see, what do you think?  I have all of the defensive AA's including SE 3.  I have some of the best offensive AA's given that I use a BoW, often am MT on Tier 4 mobs...<br />
<br />
I do have crummy poison resists, but I figure that the Archetype or Class skills, or some of the PoP Advanced skills would give me more bang for my AA point.  What would you spend on next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Believe it or not, the enhanced metabolism AA is probably worth getting; makes the high stat and resists foods/drinks last a LOT longer.<br />
<br />
I'm in about the same place, with a similar dilemma about which way to go on the offensive AAs...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know it sucks but; <br />
CF3 ---&gt; Flurry 3 ---&gt; Ranging Flurry3 ---&gt; Fury of the ages 3<br />
<br />
I also might get metabolism 3 first, easy to get and saves a lot of hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">55 points for all of that, Daddio!  I guess if I am still getting points, why not?  For those 55 points will I be doing even 10% more damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pendari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would agree to go back and get the &quot;Improved Natural Metabolism&quot;... as it will really help with the stat foods/drinks..<br />
<br />
I would also probably work on lessening your healing time by getting: &quot;Improved Natural Regen&quot; and &quot;Natural Healing&quot;<br />
<br />
Since you seem to want to keep up bind wound ability, you may also want to get: &quot; Mithaniel's Binding&quot; <br />
<br />
After that, I would probably go with uping resists and then upping &quot;offense&quot; type abilities...<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;I know it sucks but; <br />
CF3 ---&gt; Flurry 3 ---&gt; Ranging Flurry3 ---&gt; Fury of the ages 3&quot;<br />
<br />
Completely agree with Daddio.<br />
<br />
The DPS increasing AAs are a pretty good path to start on. And CF 3 opens up both Flurry and Fury of the Ages, which do have a measurable increase in your DPS.<br />
<br />
And at your stage of the game it's pretty much your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Daddio, go with the cf, flurry, raging flurry. <br />
<br />
I was going to say ambidex but if your using the BoW the majority of the time, that would be wasted skill. Although there are some very good 1 handed weapons from corinav and rathe.<br />
<br />
Living shield is a good ability, I've lost count of the number of times I've saved an overnuking caster or a cleric with it having it last an additional 36 seconds is enough time for them to get healed.<br />
<br />
but dont forget the all important warcry, you must get warcry!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just in case...<br />
<br />
That Warcry comment was sarcastic (I am 99.999999999999% sure it was!)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to make sure some Ebayed warrior didn't think it was a good idea based on your post, Arative :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah warcry comment was sarcastic, I liken that alt ability up there with the pallies act of valor, complete waste of points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">warcry ownz<br />
<br />
-kriegar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get metabolism first. Best  3 AA i ever spent.<br />
Then finish Crits 2 and 3, Move to Flurry , Planar Flurry, and Planar Crits.<br />
It does add up on the DPS bigtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm surprised flurry isnt much liked :/<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?<br />
Flurry allows you to do a quad, thats 4 hits in one swing where you can get an aggro proc.<br />
<br />
Or does maximised flurry aa allows you to flurry only once every blue moon? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i flurry a good bit with just luclin flurry, havent noticed huge improvement with pop flurry. thinking im gonna do two lvls of TM before finishing raging flurry. i need to stalwart endurance too.<br />
<br />
if you got all the defensive stuff, might as well get all the offensive aa you can to lock down agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A lot of people shyed away from the flurry stuff because it gives you more opportunities for ripostes, but once you have 150 points about all there is to go for is offense and I think increased DPS and the resulting aggro is probably a decent tradeoff for a few extra ripostes.<br />
<br />
/sigh I have 2 AA points now.  I am extremely happy with my server switch but I can't help thinking about how many aa points I would have now if I had done all of the grinding I have done on test with my original warrior, who had 50 points when I started out on test.  He would probably have 250 points and have nothing to spend them on anymore by now, instead of looking forward to run 3 and still needing *everything* hehe.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm not sorry I switched servers, but I can't help thinking about that now and then :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
AoV can be used to reset Earth B.  Well, it could.  Supposedly it's fixed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think the only reason some people shy away from Flurry is the massive point investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Flurry owns :)<br />
<br />
For the message, and that flurry+proc makes you drool</div></div><hr />
