<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are some warriors spending thier AA pts on combat fury before they get AA's which are obviously far more important to warriors? Such as ND and PD.  Not to mention CA, CS, and the related LR and ID????<br />
<br />
I can understand maybe getting ND3 THEN CF3 just to get Flurry cause it does help with a little aggro, but i see TONS of warriors who go on to get fury of the ages before getting the first level of CA or CS etc....and the occasional completely lost soul who has fury of ages and no ND....<br />
<br />
Is thier something I missed or are these people so far out of touch with what our job as a warrior is they don't know?<br />
<br />
I know for me when i thought 40 AA's was a lot I sure as hell wouldn't spend a single AA pt without knowing exactly what i was getting and the other options available to me....<br />
<br />
Granted you will eventually get them all, but I know for a fact that when i am on my shaman and I am main healer I can tell who has CA / LR5 etc... and who doesn't without asking or looking at a title...<br />
<br />
*IMO* A warrior who is getting the right AA's in the right order should not even be Marshall until around 120 to 130 AA's. Yet I see warriors all the time who are marshall with 50 AA's......<br />
<br />
So as to not make this a complete rant I will list out *my opinion* of the best path to take<br />
<br />
RS3<br />
Regen3<br />
ND3<br />
AET<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
PE<br />
PD3<br />
LR5<br />
ID5<br />
PP5<br />
Ambidex<br />
Stalwart Endurance (A very underrated AA imo, unless of course your an ogre cause if you are skip this for a while)<br />
CF3<br />
Flurry<br />
Raging Flurry<br />
Fury of the Ages<br />
<br />
Obviously this isn't a stiff rigid guideline since certain AA's are situational like ingenuity if you have a weapon that procs a nice big DD, like Dukatlos =) Or if you have an earthshaker getting Rampage....<br />
<br />
You could really move any AA on that list up or down 1 or 2 spaces to fit your needs since each warr does somethin diff, but as a general rule the pure DPS boost like fury of the ages should be after you have LR5 and ID5.....<br />
<br />
I am sure I missed an AA, since i typed this up off the top of my head and pretty quick at that but i think thats a pretty good list. Feel free to let me know which AA or AA's i forgot.   Maybe this will help one of those poor lost souls..<br />
<br />
PS if you have less then 200 AA's and you have coup de grace....shoot yourself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my perspective, that's the end result of a couple of expansions of Knights being first choice as tanks for XP groups. Warriors are split between MT and DPS - I can't speak for others, but for a while, I was SOLELY 6th man DPS in my groups. If that's a common phenomenon, I can see why some people would grab for offense before defense.<br />
<br />
 Conversely, you see a LOT of Paladins getting max defensive first in the XP-group level and going to AC/HP extremes before even looking for things like Focus Effects or FT. Hell, I know Paladins in my own guild who'd NEVER offtanked or 6th slotted for groups - it boggles my mind.<br />
<br />
 Plus, titles are c00l and get you BoT invites faster. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some warriors who are basically dps, and rarely tank at all.  They may be low on the tank list due to many possible reasons, and thus are more of a help if they get dps aas.  Or possibly they primarily tank mobs of older expansions who simply don't do much damage even without the aas.  If your healer is always fm and has absolutely no problems, then dps will help bring in the exp faster.  Everyones situation is different.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with most of your list.  I'd list LR5 and ID5 before PD myself.  And personally I would rate punishing blade right after ND if you primarily use a 2hander, since it is very good imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people also might be wanting to get offensive AAs if they have trouble with agro.  Having all the defensive AA skills and not being able to get the mob to hit you kind of sucks.  <br />
<br />
If you are in a guild where you are not the main tank very often, then you can perhaps feel like you are helping more by doing more damage too.  I imagine some warriors mix and match for this reason.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
I can tell you this... Ive been fortunate enough to usually group with the same cleric the majority of  the time (15+ levels and over 300aa) and I can tell you right now she didnt give a damn about the offensive AA's... But I nearly got clobbered upside the head once I started getting the nice defensive ones for not getting them sooner...<br />
<br />
The amount of difference to YOU tanking might not seem a whole lot... but when your cleric suddenly doesnt NEED to patch you as much or can start a CH that much later... Well it makes healer-types mucho happy and you better believe they notice it :)<br />
<br />
All those defensive AA's add up...</div></div><hr />

You may get a hardon because you got your AA in the same order that ubertankx did but please keep it to yourself. Instead of posting Why the Hell perhaps it would be more productive for the warrior community to actually ask a question that deserves a valid response.  Hey other warriors! Who didn't finish ALL of the defensive AA before getting some offensive? Can you tell me why and what roles it helps you play in group and raid situations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since LDoN I have been going a mix of Defensive and Offensive. Since my guild is in a rebuilding phase (and not raiding) there is certanly a spot of good enouhg AC/HP and getting some of the fun AAs. <br />
<br />
But I did go Run 3, STm 3, ND3, AET, CA1, CS1, PE, CA3, CS3 and then worked my offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
How do I know its good enough...well bubble head (that would be me) somehow put together an LDoN with no CC, slow, haste, etc. And tank heavy (62 pal, 62 ranger and me) in a 63 (ie 51 point) adv. And we won.<br />
<br />
That said I am not going for Crits or Flurry until I have PB and Ferocity maxed. (Seems silly to get the Flurry AAs until you max your chances of of gettign 3 swings with your main hand.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a while, I went with an offensive and defensive mix of AAs, which worked fine.  I was the #3 raid MT and it is mostly older content, so the defensive AAs weren't huge.  Now because of defections to FFXI and scheduling constraints, I am suddenly my guild's de facto MT so yeah, I'm going all defensive.  That has made a difference, my healers are loving me these days.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in hindsight, I'd recommend, at least for a purely defensive AA standpoint -<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Innate Metabolism 3 (Regen is nearly useless in PoP/LDoN)<br />
ND3<br />
AE Taunt<br />
CA1<br />
CS1<br />
PE<br />
PD3<br />
CA2 and 3<br />
LR5<br />
CS 2 and 3<br />
ID5<br />
mixing PP1-5 in there.  It's only about 100 extra hit points, but any hit points are good hit points.<br />
<br />
-edit- Forgot AE Taunt, dunno how, but I did.</div></div><hr />

Looking at it from a shaman perspective, I can understand your confusion.  Now, look at it from a class perspective where the last upgrade in your abilities whatsoever was at lvl 35.  There be nothing new to the way you fight since ya got riposte.  Combat Fury promises more crits....doesn't really deliver, but it sounds good....crits are part of what USED to make a warrior fun....back when only we had em.  Also consider that by the time you have AAs to throw at CF, you've been grouping w/ knights and rangers that are consistantly out-critting you.  If you are just a bot to xp fast for MTing for a guild, aye...take your route.  If you are in the game to have fun and a warrior is your main, spend them how it makes you happy.  Tis after all, but a game.<br />

some people get bored with the pure defensive path and MAY see themselves in the 6th slot so want a little dps boost. i have been choosen as MT in a Mir group by a tank heavey group because of my dps:=) (may sould sad but checkout my maglo and compare it to a 58 pally or 56 war lol)<br />

I have 4 levels of regen, and I don't regret them at all.  My stamina has been capped for a long time now, 3 points there wouldn't have done me a lick of shit of good, so it turns out that regen was the best choice of those shitty aa's after all.</div></div><hr />

Some warrior AA's are also fun to play with :)<br />
<br />
I got my marshall title somewhere around AA 180, and I wish I could have pushed it back even more as I think it's one of the more stupid titles in this game.<br />
<br />
As far as regen is concerned, I am not always raiding or always in PoP. I farm stuff for smithing, goof around old zones, or check out ( and solo ) shard dropping mobs. 25 pt regen per tick standing in full battle gear comes in pretty nice, never regretted those AA's at all.

Sometimes it's nice to get one that's more fun.  I have all offensive and all defensive AAs at the moment but I did NOT get all of the defensive ones first.  I focused mostly on those but I spent a point here or there on fun stuff too.  I got ND3 and AE taunt first, then I sorta mixed and matched getting CA, CS, Fero, PE, Ambi, PB, Ingenuity, LR, ID, etc.  I got Marshall around 180 or so too when I finally got Flurry.</div></div><hr />

Do what makes you happy. For me, I believe it is dependant on the role you typically play in your raid/exp group. I for one believe that the defensive path is the way to go and the offensive path is something to look forward to further down the road. The Primary role of the warrior (IMO) is the tank. Therefore I will focus on honing my defensive abilites first. I might add this site is an awesome source of info. I was not sure what path to take until i started reading here. Now I am convinced and have set my goals accordingly : -) ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're low in the tanking order for your guild, working on offensive AAs will not help you move up the order.  The top two warriors in my guild have max defensive AAs and the other warriors are all working on them.<br />
<br />
As the warrior class lead in my guild I'm usually the one who chooses the tanking assignments, and when our max defensive AA warriors are not around, the guys who have made the most progress on defensive AAs will get the nod to tank for us over the guys who've been doing offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
Most people play warriors because they want to be tanks, so unless you really prefer not tanking and don't mind being pigeon-holed as a non-tank, you should be working on defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
If your agro is so horrible that you feel you must get some offensive AAs to help, the ones I would suggest are Tactical Mastery and Ferocity.  These offer the biggest DPS increase for only 9 AA each.  Working on CF, Flurry, double riposte, ambidex, punishing blade, all have lower damage increases for the AA spent or have limited use (ambidex and pb being specific to weapon type).  Get Tactical mastery and/or ferocity and go no further until you finish ALL defensive AAs</div></div><hr />

SO very very VERY true... If your using stat food and drink I would highly recommend getting this... 3 aa and youll save a TONNE on food (eg Moze has had 10 halas 10lb meat pies... they lasted for about three or four weeks *played every day*)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said Metabolism 3 is certainly a nice AA to get, especially for drinks.  Buy a few stack of Fuzzlecutters and they last forever.  Stat food is relatively easy to get (Halas pie, misty picnics) in huge quantity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After that tho, I did get SE; before I had it I would get stunned so much that most likely a cleric or two would die whenever I had to tank. Seeing as the returns from PD3, LR5 and ID5 are comparitively lower, I got some offensive AA s after PD3 to break the monotomy. TM is another good dps increase which doesn t cause more ripostes; I also got Fero after LR 5 and am now working on ID 5 and PP. Next will probably be Punishing blade. <br />
<br />
I agree being a Marshall before around 130 AA s is not a great idea, despite it looking nice. CF is one of the worst AA s we get I feel and the bang for your buck on flurry is not that good compared to most other offensive AAs.</div></div><hr />

So far I have almost doubled that now working on other AAs and I must say I enjoyed doing the defensive ones much mroe than the offesnsive Im doing now because I could see more of a difference with the defensive.Now I feel like Im not really getting my times worth.

Gotta agree though. Never understood it. As a warrior, your primary job is to absorb damage, not deal it. Improve that first. People play their characters how they like I guess though rather then letting logic get in the way.</div></div><hr />

Not as true as it used to be. Yes it is importnat, yes I have all of the original defensvie AAs (ND, CS, CA, PE (if we can call that an original AA)) but particularly with LDoN, our job is to keep agro and do damage.

<br />
With 1280 AC, 4800ish HP, unbuffed, I have tanked normal with no slow or haste. Therefor that is enough defense and from there it is reasonable to spread out the AAs, and help kill faster (and lock down agro better). <br />

I would tend to argue tho that since LDoN is not the only place to exp, and since most other exp mobs have much higher DPS, that it is still better to complete defensive first.  Even with offensive AA's, we are still not DPS powerhouses, and are not going to be the main source of damage in LDoN(tho I have done 3 tank groups in LDoN and had zero trouble finishing with time left over...it is noticably slower tho).<br />
<br />
My suggested route:  Run3, Metabo3(or regen3), ND3, AE taunt, SA1, CS1, PE, PD3, CA3, CS3, LR3, ID3, Fero, CF3, Flurry3(cf and flurry cuz flurry is fun!), RF3...<br />

i dont remember the exact path i took for AAs, but i do remember working on CF3 and flurry1 first. at the time i was almost literally at the bottom of the tank rotation. i didnt really get serious about my defensives until i joined my present guild and there was a need for a dependable MT. i think i did something like all the arch-type AAs first, then class types, then ID5 and LR5 with SE and ferocity and ambidex and ingineuty(i cant spell). it was was pretty much a full defensive line, then something stupid/fun as a small *reward* for not spending the 5 or 8 saved AAs i had been holding all week. <br />

That still doesn't change the fact that a warrior's primary job is to absorb damage and not to deal it. That's a fact, and there's a reason why we do it the best. What you said does not change that fact. It's true we can put out some impressive damage these days, but that doesn't make our job of being a tank any less important. Did you forget that experience mobs in Planes of Power hit for 400-900 damage? I fail to see how it's silly to reduce the insane damage you take these days first and foremost.</div></div><hr />

Solusek Ro tower has ornate, as does BoT (among other things to be found here worth quite a bit of plat). Plane of Earth has stonewood bow drops, as well as elemental stones. Plane of Fire has some nice drops from the named mobs as well. You won't find anything comparable in LDoN except on a hard mission, and there again you'll be with mobs hitting for 900 damage. Adventure points cannot be found in PoP. You are correct there however.</div></div><hr />

I have no doubt that PB add more agro than any defensive AA. If you aren't raiding pounding out the regular defensive aas is more than enough. <br />

Red, you and I are taking almost the exact same AA progression, but I slipped PB in before Furious (as I don't even have a 1h set up atm). <br />

BoT is a fucking cesspool of idiots and not everyone has elemental access.  I only go to BoT when there's less than 15 people in the zone (IE 3am).  If there's any more, Droga here I come, where mobs hit for 200 instead of 900.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It kind of does change the facts, if you think a bit more about what Kailyn was saying.<br />
<br />
The dynamic is different in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Many of my most successful LDoN groups have used multiple tanks. Like 2 warriors. Or a Warrior and an SK or a Warrior and a Paladin. Or, my favorite, a tank and a beastlord. On normal mode, monks as gimpy as me can tank that stuff. So the damage absorption part of the job starts to take a backseat to the how fast can you kill this stuff part of the job.<br />
<br />
And oddly enough one of the best AAs to get if you're going to be STRICTLY LDoN is Coup De Grace 3. Heh. That speeds you up right quick when it fires. But isn't an AA I'd reccommend to a &quot;raid&quot; tank until long after the standard AAs are obtained.<br />
<br />
In any event, I really wouldn't stress about people doing AAs not on the &quot;standard&quot; path. People sometimes get bored with their AAs and feel locked in. So they take a break and do an oddball one here or there. It's their time, after all. Let them spend it however they wish.<br />
<br />
Heck, I've taken a very unusual AA path for a monk. <br />
<br />
And it really hasn't affected my in-game performance much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can quite happily agree to disagree with people. Different strokes for different folks. I'm not trying to tell anybody how to spend their AAs. I'm simply saying that you shouldn't neglect the defensive AAs we can get, as it aids us in our primary job. I realize that our defensive AAs will not make or break us in a group, but efficiency isn't something to neglect. And nobody is trying to be a know it all here. Everybody is just sharing their personal views, so why don't you keep those comments to yourself and realize these forums can be very opinionated?<br />
<br />
Personally, I rarely do LDoN adventures. Most of my time is spent in the elemental planes doing experience groups or raiding (where I do a fair amount of main tanking), so having full defensive AAs makes a much more noticeable difference. I have all of the offensive ones too now (except double riposte which I could care less about), so I'm not saying those aren't good, they're great. Right now I'm just saving all of my AAs for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Like 90%+ of the playerbase, I'm not flagged for elementals, don't have my VT key, and got no burning desire to get either the flag or the key in the forseeable future. And yes, Haass is right - the zone that is BoT is a hellhole, KC for the 65's. It's not worth the hassle of trying to win the Ornate lotto to have to deal with that zone, when I can go the slow, steady route of LDoN, take a bit more time getting there, and dealing with a lot fewer idiots along the way. <br />
<br />
Outside of a few camps, most XP points in tiers 1 and 2 drop jack and shit for money, for loot, or for upgrade, and on top of that, the margin for error is a lot smaller. Risk != Reward in those places for most people unless they're there SOLELY for XP. Since that's not my game, I avoid it like the plague. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I grind exclusively in LDoN.  I have very limited playing time, and cannot raid; therefore, Adventure Points are my only path to truly excellent gear.  When I started getting serious AA points, I spent them on offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because for normal LDoN missions, defensive AAs add literally nothing.  Our standing LDoN group is an enchanter, a warrior (me), a beastlord (also me), some healer, and two DPS.  Even with just beastlord slows (the chanter being busy maintaining a charmed mob), things don't kill me particularly effectively.  And on the rare occasions that I did raid with my guild, I was already more than sufficiently equipped for any targets the rest of the guild was able to tackle.<br />
<br />
The only thing I needed (remember, this was before Provoke) was a bit more aggro.  And, of course, a lot more DPS.  So I spent points on Ingenuity (consciously wasted, purely for fun and the nominal DPS increase) and Tactical Mastery (slightly better aggro while tanking).<br />
<br />
I wasn't going to be fighting raid mobs (no time to join a raiding guild), and we weren't going to be able to tackle hard LDoN adventures (enchanter too fragile, no uber-guild guildies to help), so there was no reason for me to get even ND3, much less CA/CS/etc.<br />
<br />
Then our enchanter joined an uberguild, and suddenly hard LDoN began to look possible.  And Provoke came out, answering the aggro problem quite adequately.  And suddenly, I found myself wishing I'd put those points into ND/CA/CS/PE rather than offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
Do I think that offensive AAs are a reasonable starting choice?  Hell, yeah; if my chanter hadn't gone and gotten all oober on me, I'd still be buying levels of Combat Fury and Punishing Blade.  But I do believe that the defensive AAs are superior for anyone seriously trying to improve their utility as a warrior.<br />
<br />
It's just that not everyone needs to improve their utility as a warrior; and especially for those who focus on LDoN, their utility as a DPS source may be of greater importance.<br />
<br />
I'm not unhappy that I spent the points on Tactical Mastery; I still believe those to be well-spent simply to make aggro while tanking easier.  When I turned on full hit/miss reporting, I was shocked how large a percentage of my attacks were being blocked, parried, riposted, etc.<br />
<br />
But from now until I've maxed my defensive AAs, I don't expect to be spending any more points on offensive ones.<br />

The paladin I often group with is also 55, but has mediocre gear, and since she doesn't think of herself as a tank she's going with offensive AAs.  She was main tank this weekend, and I was the cleric.  I wanted to cry, and considered begging her to go with defensive AAs.  She went for the 'get critical hits' AA first, and didn't even know what Natural Durability is.  And it showed.  Not that it helped that my cleric has higher AC ;/</div></div><hr />

Run 3, Regen 3, ND3, AE Taunt, CA1, CS1, PE and then altrenated between CA and CS and then LR and ID until they were all maxed.  Threw one point of ingenuity in there some place just for fun as well.  One thing I see a lot of warriors do that I think is a mistake is to max LR before doing CS.  CS3 (10% mitigation) &gt; LR5 (5% avoidance).<br />
<br />
Now that I have LR/ID done (50 straight points on mitigation/aviodance is so damn boring) I think I will do PD and then at least a level or two of stalwart endurance before going to offensive stuff.  I just haven't seen an offensive AA that I can get that excited about.</div></div><hr />

As for me, I've been SA or TA for my past two guilds and one of the things I strive for is to become MA as much as possible, so I went with AA's that made me an all around better tank defensively.<br />
I didn't start pumping out a lot of AA's until my guild started going up the tier chart.  Once elementals became a realistic goal I went purely defensive, and have just recently started offensive.  For people who don't raid as much defensives just aren't nearly as important, though I think you should at least get any and all hp AA's, minus innate stamina unless you really need it, that you can get.  If you're dead all the offensive AA's in the world won't save ya.<br />

<br />
Usually when I see a post that says &quot;Follow my way or yer an idjut&quot;, I do the opposite just out of principle! =)<br />
<br />
However I agree with Wulfran on the importance of getting AETaunt early despite how indelicately he stated his view, though perhaps not at 19-23.<br />
<br />
One thing I advocate is being patient and taking the time early on to improve Innate Stamina, Agility, and the Magical Resistances.<br />
<br />
I generally do Innate Metabolism right after Run 3, as it saves me a fortune in the long run on Stat foods.<br />
<br />
Basically, I spend 44 or more AA in the General abilities creating a foundation for future skills.  I do this by cranking AA to 90% as soon as dinging 51, and end up getting close to 55 by the time that's all complete just on the 10% to regular.<br />
<br />
Then I crank back to 50% AA and proceed to work on defensive disciplines to the exclusion of offensive, as most have outlined here, and for obvious reasons.  Naturally, that means I'm well past AA 19-23 when I get AETaunt.....<br />
<br />
I might say that anyone who doesn't have the patience to set the stage properly before power-exp'ing straight to 55+ is an idiot!<br />
<br />
But rather, I'd say that though it's hard work and delays your advancement, you thank yourself later when you have the enhanced base stats and the flexibility that gives you in armor/item selection.<br />
