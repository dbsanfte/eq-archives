<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsuris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
<br />
I'm a play as much as I can 52 bazaar / tradeskill tank (sorry no magelo organised yet) but my question really applies to weapons not my other gear.<br />
<br />
I have my aggro sorted so far with the usual bazaar CHos and Bloodsworn combo. The problem I have is that my DPS sux atm. From reading the posts on this site it is apparent that 2h slash is the way to go for DPS at my end of the game. I have a WMBS is this my best dps option atm (factoring in the better delay = more chance for crits and double attacks)? Or should i go for the harder hitters like the Granite halberd of chance , Stonebladed axe of dismay or after a lot of saving the Windblade? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WMBS is very good for so cheap. It has a delay of 28, which is the point where the 2 handed damage bonuses start increasing. If it had 27 delay, it would have a much lower damage bonus. Its DPS is very close to a Windblade, as I recall, and is generally much cheaper. Honestly, the droga combo won't be that bad of DPS at 65. The WMBS will beat it out, but not by much. Regardless, the WMBS will be a very decent DPS weapon for quite cheap.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. I didn't know that the bigger the delay the bigger the damage bonus thanks very much. 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I'd recommend sticking to the Droga for aggro and WMBS for DPS, but there really isn't any great dps aggro weapons, Greatstaff of Thunder is okay weapon, but your main job is aggro, so i'd stick to the Drogas when tanking, at your stage of game you won't need to worry about riposte set back since mobs don't 1 - 2 round you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FYI, here's the damage bonus for delay list: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/dmgbonus.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From everything I have seen (but my own parces, as I don't have a windy) the WMBS is the best (er now 2nd best I guess withi the GOD tradeskill 2h) dropable 2h weapon around. And your DPS sucks because you are a warrior. Get used to it. Though you do have something like 3 damage table improvements coming to you between 52 and 65.<br />
<br />
While you could spend a huge amount for some better 1h weapons, I am quite happy with the droga pair. Especailly when you can afford to buff them with an anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">@ lvl 52 i would think the droga weapons would outdmg the WMBS. 2hs for dps doesn't realy kick in for warriors till 60ish IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree<br />
<br />
55 here and everytime I test my weapon combos, my DPS DW setup comes out the best. Hell, 40dps is still teh suck though.<br />
<br />
note: I recently sold my reaver (40/40) for better armor upgrades. It was the 2Her I was using for dps before.</div></div><hr />

Nice to know that you vets take an interest in new blood. I've been reading the posts on this site for a while now and it has made a huge difference to my playing and enjoyment of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I pretty much agree with these posters.<br />
On those occasions when you are not MT, then especially after your droga weapons start procing, it can be handy to have the WMBS around. Questions of exact dps aside, it generates a bunch of dps relative to its aggro generation (assuming MT is getting some procs). So you should be able to use it when you don't want to gank aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hilamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">65 warrior here, I think for now your present set up would work to maintain agro barring the finger wiggler's in your grp don't over nuke and dot. Thing is I've found at the higher end game and on LDoN grps or even pick up grps in BoT is they always do over nuke and dot , lol. They like showing they can take a few hit's and out agro the next guy, well til they die and then they behave for a while, but just a while. I think ultimately the 2 hder is the way to go and no less than a 28 delay since that seems to be the big drop off on dmg bonuses on anything below that. Thing is there isn't many tradeable good agro 2 hder's out there. Great Staff of Thunder is about the cheapest I've seen that will hold agro with taunt and provoke/incite line we now have. Could even throw an anger 3 aug from EF adv on it for even better agro, What I'm presently looking at, preparing for the mobs that hit for 1k, the ones that eventually drop the weapons I really want hehe, is Buying a Velium Gemmed  2 hder , player made, and they are in 2 hd slash and 2 hd blunt, both 28 delay and 34 dmg and decent stats to boot and they have 2 aug slots so you can throw an anger 3 and hp or dex aug in other, I think this would beat the Windblade by alot in stats and agro, 44 delay on the WB is to high to keep agro consistly and the stats aren't particulary good for a warrior. Thing is, there not cheap, and are in the same price range as the WB going somewhere between 50-75k, but still beats the heck out of paying 400k for a BoC and you won't get beat to death on riposte when you do finally get to tank a named in BoT which might drop the Great Staff of the Four Winds, the next upgrade you might consider which has better dmg and stats, again consider another anger aug 3 on it as well. Atm my present set up is a Long Sword of Yekesa 12/17 with an anger 3 on it and CHoS in my off hand with an anger 2 aug, holds agro pretty well for LDoN normal adv. and reg. BoT mobs but for anything past BoT or tanking Boss mobs I would say go with 2 hder's, good luck, you'll be 65 before ya now it, so start savin your pp. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">for when you dont want agro id stick with the war marshal for now. at level 60 you can start using the velium gemmed .. yes it has a required level ... and boost your dps somewhat. dont anger aug the velium gemmed though because not having an innate proc the only time you would really want to use it is when you are trying to avoid agro anyway. the windblade has poorer dps than a war marshal. study the previous link on damage bonuses and note the sudden large jump at delay 28 and the listless increase after that.  this says a lot about why windblades have disappointing dps.</div></div><hr />

Amen brother, my pally loves his Velium Gemmed Great Sword. Augged with Permafrost and FT2 (probably the only FT 2H wep on my server...), but he paid through the teeth for it so stick with the WMBS (which he used before that)<br />

At level 52, as you say you are, the damage bonus for 2handers isn't very good. Dual Wielding can and does still outdamage 2handers. Past level 55, 2handers become far more viable. At level 60 they become a good source of DPS due to how Triple Attack works.</div></div><hr />

Wondering what you mean by this statement, basically what makes triple attack better for 2hers than for DW?</div></div><hr />

28x3 &gt; 12x3 just looking at the damage bonus.</div></div><hr />

Alright, I'm not expert on this so I'll ask a couple of questions first.  Is triple attack % per swing based like crits and also can you triple attack with your off hand?  If both answers are yes then I believe the above statement is untrue, if either statement is no then the above statement is correct.  I can post some math to show you what I mean if necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wondering what you mean by this statement, basically what makes triple attack better for 2hers than for DW?<br />
You only triple attack with your main hand, so 2 handers benefit more from triple attack than DWing 1 handers.</div></div><hr />
