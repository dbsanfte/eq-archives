<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much of this info is posted elsewhere, and I have read it, but it would help me a lot to talk about what actually happened in relationship to what should have happened (more of a case study).<br />
<br />
Background - I'm a 62 warrior, been playing over 3 years but very casual and have limited playing time.  I have NEVER raided, other than a couple Vox and Naggy raids which don't really count since they were essentially a bum's rush.   I consider myself a good tank and others seem to also, but strictly in a six man group setting.  <br />
<br />
I've been hanging around Kael and WL working on my CoV faction.  A couple of nights ago I see that a guild is in Kael and I ask if I can tag along for faction and they agree.  They added me to the raid and eventually a group and things were going fine (they were in the arena).<br />
<br />
Vindi pops and they decide to take him down.   After gathering info, I am designated as the 3rd MT.   After a long time and many failed pull attempts, they finally grab Vindi with a Guard add.  Things went south rapidly after that. <br />
<br />
I know I didn't do anything useful in this situation and I'm feeling dumb about it, but I'd like to go over what actually happened. <br />
<br />
First, I didn't start formulating any kind of a plan until I saw the 'incoming' and 'add' messages, and being a newb to this situation I was pretty much playing it by ear.   Here's what actually happened from my perspective as the pull progressed: <br />
<br />
I asked in the tanks chat if the 2nd MT had the add - he replied yes.  <br />
<br />
Uhhh,  uhhhh - there's Vindi - there's the MT in the corner.  Whoops Vindi's not on him anymore.  Whoops MT is dead (and I mean dead fast - this is no more than 10 seconds elapsed). <br />
<br />
Ummm,  Ummm,  target Vindi, hit attack, hit taunt, hit berate,  a couple casters are already dead,  Vindi's on me - Whoa! hiptpoints dropping like a rock.  ummm, ummm Furious!  that's it.  Then Defensive when it wears off.  Ok, let's hit furious - 'loading please wait.'   <br />
<br />
If the above looks really lame, it doesn't compare to how lame I felt at that point. <br />
<br />
Ok, as I'm waiting to appear at my bind point (and subsequently) I had a little more time to think about what I should have done. <br />
<br />
Number one, I'm thinking target, THEN furious, then attack, then taunt, then berate - followed by counting to twelve, followed by defensive.  Somewhere in there a hot key message to tell the raid what was going on (but of course, I had none). <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if that's correct and I'm not sure what I should have been doing from the start as secondary or tertiary tank.   Where should I have been?  What should I have been watching for?  At what point do I engage?  What should the message have said?  And assuming I had managed to stay standing long enough, what should have happened after that?  A C-heal rotation I assume. but when does it start?.  How would I have judged when to call assist?<br />
<br />
One other thing  - from the initial incoming message to the wipe, the only line of text to appear in either of the channels that I was monitoring (raid and tank) was the exchange between myself and the 2nd tank that I mentioned above.  This surprised me.  Maybe they were talking in Guild chat - I don't know, but I had expected more communication to be going on during a boss mob encounter - what might I have expected to see?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to answer this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bowedup</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was it there first time on Vindi?<br />
<br />
The first MT should have lived through defensive.  Hell I lived through a CH or 2 at 52 pulling Vindi.<br />
<br />
So most likey a cleric missed a heal, the rampage tank wasn't set, and no assist was called. <br />
<br />
How many clerics you have?  how many total peeps?<br />
<br />
I have seen Vindi + his 2 guards come, and the MT was able to live through defensive while we took out the adds.  Then Second tank took aggro and we droped Vindi.  3 deaths total, in a very unorganized raid.  <br />
<br />
Vindi is rough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't blow furious before you have aggro or you will probably waste it.  Just have it hotkeyed and hit it as soon as you see one or two rounds of red on your screen or you see a successful taunt message.  AE taunt makes it a lot easier to time obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on your typing skills you usually have enough time between taunts to blurt out a few words like 'tanking vindi, heal me' or 'MT down, taking over' or something like that. If you have furious up AND have agro then you have 12 seconds to type without worrying about dying.<br />
<br />
It also sounds like that if a few casters were already dead that they cast on vindi too soon before the MT had sufficient agro and/or they were sitting when he was incoming. If you can get and hold agro, run vindi around in circles until things get a little more organized and everyone is ready to start healing you (which is sounds like they weren't). :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems there was a little bad planning, and a little lack of execution, and obviously bad luck starting the CHeal rotation.<br />
<br />
If I was leading the raid, and I had a knight class in addition to the MA/SA/TA warriors, they would have been designated as offtank for any adds on the pull.  The fact that the SA was taken out of the rotation to offtank shows lack of planning.  Essentially they pulled the SA out and stuck you, an inexperienced raider, as SA on what can be a tough fight.  <br />
<br />
Here's how it should have happened as I see it.<br />
<br />
Pull comes, Vindi + add.  Since a knight has already been assigned to tank adds, the Guardian is agroed and offtanked, and slowed (since what else are the slowers doing?).  Since the offtank has had a backup healer already assigned (someone not in the rotation, such as a druid or shaman), the add becomes a non-issue.<br />
<br />
As the pull comes in, and the knight hits the guardian, the MT goes Evasive (Vindi is an evasive fight, check the library for details on tanking boss mobs and why evasive is better for this fight) then hits Vindi with their Provoke line.  Here the CHeal rotation starts, with another non-cleric providing spam heals until the CHeal lands.  Vindi is engaged by MT.  Spam heals land, next cleric in the rotation casts, CHeal lands, and so on.<br />
<br />
The fight is now on.  The MT/ST/TT are all engaged now, and the CH rotation is stable.  DPS classes engage, yada yada.<br />
<br />
Now say there is a hiccup in the CH rot, or Vindi gets lucky with a max hit quad and goes down.  Vindi's gonna be making a Bee-Line to someone who's probably not the ST or TT.  Without AE Taunt to grab Vindi back, the ST has to be quick or risk losing folks.  Here's where it gets tricky.  The ST needs to taunt Vindi or get him back before anyone important dies, hit their evasive, and hope the CHeal rotation has switched fast enough to him.  In addition, the spam healer now has to quickly target him and get him spam healed with smaller heals until the rotation lands.  Tank switches on Vindi are a pain, but if everyone is ready for it, it's fairly painless.  <br />
<br />
Now lets say Mr. SA forgot to hit their disc - well they're dead now and the TA needs to step up.  Vindi will likely be eating DPS classes now, so again it's disc/taunt and pray the rotation switches.  <br />
<br />
It's pretty easy to compare what happened to you.  The SA became an offtank, meaning you were instantly added as SA for Vindi.  Either the MA didn't /disc early enough (if you're not /disc'ed before Vindi hits you, you're gonna be dead) or there were no support healers to keep him up until the rotation began. A good rotation begins very early with Vindi, since even with /evasive a tank can be dead in 10 seconds with bad luck. When Vindi came, he should have been targeted by you, so no need to worry about targeting when the MA went down.  I would want the SA to engage as quickly as it is safe to do so.  That means you be in position, ready to start whacking.  There was no assist called because the MT was dead before the rotation ever landed.  Once the first or second CHeal was in, I expect the MT would have called the assist.  Before then, the rotation just isn't stable enough and that's priority #1 in this encounter.<br />
<br />
What could you have done differently?  Probably nothing that would have saved the raid.  But there are a few mistakes I did notice.  First, Vindi should have been targeted before he was engaged.  Next, when the MT went down, you better be on your disc, and fast.  If Vindi gets on you without a disc up, as you learned, there is zero chance of the rotation getting set up on you before you die.  I'd go Disc--&gt;Taunt--&gt;Provoke--&gt;Tank Switch Message.  As SA on this fight, I'm fighting with my agro weapons in my hands.  Things happen fast, and you won't have time to switch weapons if the MA falls. <br />
<br />
Well, that's about it.  Tough when things go wrong on a raid, but sounds like you learned a lot about the fight, which is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of good advice above.  One more thing.<br />
<br />
There's a timer on your combat abilities screen, so you can see exactly when your disc is going to end.  If you watch that, you don't need to count to 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug<br />
<br />
That raid was poorly executed.  Casters dying right after the MT went down in seconds?<br />
<br />
The only suggestion I'd make is that I'd create a hot key that says &quot;STEPPING UP TO TANK %t, START HEALS ON ME NOW&quot;.  Put it in bank 3-4 wherever in the back.  When you get in a situation where you a free safety tank (not MA/SA/Ramp) make sure you move that key up for quick use.  Use the incite/berate; furious and spam that button.  A smart raid will start CH on you asap.  Usually I'll lead with AE taunt, incite, furious, spam the key.<br />
<br />
Kudos for you to have the guts to step up to the plate as a tag a long to that raid; there are a number of warrs that who don't take that kinda initiative when with their own guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a big hotkey fan.  I mapped my discs to the number pad and messages and assists to the hotkeys (effectively gives 16 hotkeys without switching hotkey sets.)  For the regular hotkeys I have messages for assisting the MA, SA, 3A (up to 5 on AD raids :)), when I take over (usually SA), calling for assists, AE taunt, firing and ending of discs, and a few others.  <br />
<br />
Now that I think about it a bit more (been a long day and still at the office :)) I use 2 hotkey banks when raiding...one when I'm SA and one if I MA (either planned or due to MA death.)<br />
<br />
Anyway...the reason I use hotkeys so much is I don't want to have to think about what message to send or if the text box on the chat window is active, etc.  I like to just hit a number and keep tanking.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the great advice and information.  It was everything I hoped for and more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in the day, we used to wipe on Vindi too; he is the first real raid-level mob a lot of people try and the tactics you develop on him are usefull for many later raids. It is amazing how much simple hotkeys and a raiding system will imporve raid successes.<br />
<br />
First off, the pull requires the monks/bards to know how to split him from his pets. This requires some practise, but even with a pet he isn't too bad. <br />
<br />
The MT should be positioned shrunk/illusioned in a corner either inside the arena, or near the ramp leading out. <br />
<br />
Pulling Vindi to this spot is a critical moment, and this is where many many guilds will get it wrong first time. Pets will often jump him so unless the users have the /pet hold AA, they should be killed. Bards need to stop singing at this point too. In fact noone should even move at this point and they should be well out of the line of sight of the MT and where Vindi is coming from. <br />
<br />
Clerics should positioned as far from the MT as possible and are  given an order to start the Cheal chain at the right time; aka start too early and Vindi will instantly kill the Cheal chain, start too late and the MT will die. Often a HoT (heal over Time) is used to keep the MT up untill the Cheal chain lands.<br />
<br />
On inc, the MT shoots several arrows at Vindi and if everyone is doing the right thing, this will bring him to the corner; Defensive should then be hit and these days Incite on incoming is a usefull tool. If Vindi does hit someone else, someone screwed up and the MT has little choice but to move out and tank him away from the corner after which the melee will need to push him back to the corner. Once aggro is secure, the order can be given to assist either the MT on the boss mob or the MA for clearing possible adds.<br />
<br />
If the MT should die, either a ranger goes in and uses Weaponshield to keep him busy for 20 seconds untill the SA can taunt and the Cheal changes to him or he uses Area taunt followed by Furious, followed by incite and defensive. <br />
<br />
This in a nutshell is basic raiding tactics and this needs to become second nature to a guild; especially in PoP where encounters require handling lots of adds at the same time while still MT ing the boss mob or dealing with dangerous AoE spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baashem</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note about Esvee's post - You don't want a cleric to HoT your MT before vindi's gotten into camp, or else the cleric will be on rampage. That's assuming the monk dies, or FD's rampage off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
We also are taking our first attempt at Vindi tonight.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify MT technique.<br />
<br />
I go halfling size, stay in the far corner, and shoot arrows at Vindi as he comes.  Once he heads towards me, what do I need to do besides grabbing and keeping aggro?<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm unsure of is the order of /disc to use.  I've read evasive, defensive... furious... can someone give me a tried and true order?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much --<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you get Vindi to you, and he has hit you, I would use disc fortitude(12 seconds no damage), incite, and when fortitude wears off, disc defensive.  Starting with Fortitude gives your healers 12 seconds to get the CH chain going, then defensive to carry you thru.<br />
<br />
My number one piece of advice tho is to relax and enjoy the encounter.  Tanking Vindi for the first time is a total rush, enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A properly timed HoT won't put the cleric on aggro: If niether the warrior nor the cleric has aggro at the time of the cast, the fact that the buff is there on engage won't mean anything either. <br />
<br />
Also, just as a note, depending on your DPS composition, cornering is not always the best strategy: ranger and mage DPS takes a severe hit when mobs are in the wall, and as our guild used to basically have the 8 ranger squad of doom, we never corner anything.</div></div><hr />
