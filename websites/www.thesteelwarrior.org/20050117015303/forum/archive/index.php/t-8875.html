<br />
First time trying sol ro, we won. Not surprising since he wasn't expected to be hard, but it was a first time and not a single person died. Tanking him wasn't tough, so was just a sense of guild accomplishment since we had no deaths.<br />
<br />
Did fire mini's for the first time yesterday. I tanked magmaton, spider bitch, pyro forggie and general raparm. I didn't have furious for the spider bitch. But all were guild firsts and I tanked all 4 without dieing. This seemed quite impressive. (I thanked the cleric channel after raparm!)  And 20% of reparm's life after stonewall went down.<br />
<br />
Was funny because guild leader said, raparm can and will one round tanks, beready to ae taunt-furious and then I never died. Before the pull, i told the clerics I had faith they wouldn;t allow me to die.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it just felt damn good.</div></div><hr />

I've seen it happen many times.  I just hoped and prayed that when it did, I hadn't used Duelist yet or was low enough on the aggro list that I could get out of the way while the next tank tried to take over.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait till you meat Ginto.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reparm&gt;Ginto spike dps wise especially if you're using selo's to block the 3k ae.  Another ele mob that plows due to a big dd proc is sigismond but not as bad as reparm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My belt is my only elemental loot, and it is named closely to the time belt but thats it.<br />
<br />
Is that what you meant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">reparm has never killed me on a successful raid. only time he has was once when a healer left without telling the main healer that they were leaving so there was a gap in the cheal rotation which killed me. that time we rezzed up and did it perfectly after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're lucky then.I don't remember how many times I tanked him,every week at least for a few months he got me a few times....especially when dps was low.<br />
<br />
We got p5 lewtz first time tonite  weee:) Inny stopped us -I died at about 8 pct then the sa and so on...raid crumbled at about 4 pct .Good first try tho.I swear the Zeks in time seem a lot worse than Reparm tho hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's pretty lucky to live on Reparm, I'd say.  <br />
<br />
He'll properly welcome you when he gets 3 procs off in 1 round and then his additional melee damage =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is rapeme killing me in 3 melee hits in the span of about about .5 seconds, from full health with the full rot and patchs running. Nothing can really stop those tripple procs, even di won't fire quick enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen that a few times and gone *OUCH* as I hit nimble hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parse Reparm to be in the 1100-1250dps area (including procs, as the latest version of Yalp calculates).  Breaking that down, he tends to do 750 to 850dps in melee and 300-400dps in procs.  <br />
<br />
With 500fr, you take roughly 15% less proc damage overall, and that includes the 1:10 full resist, and the rest being partials (but mostly full).<br />
<br />
Now, how does Reparm compare to Tallon Zek in Phase4 of Time?  In my peak of elemental loot (mixed in with a bit of Vex Thal), I was taking, as mentioned above, 1100 to 1250dps against Reparm.  On my first heavy dose of Tallon Zek, whom I tanked for a solid 4 minutes and 56 seconds (!!!), I received a brutal pounding of 1696dps, ~1400 of which was melee.  He's an assbeater.  =)<br />
<br />
Lastly, the ABSOLUTE best is when you get one-rounded during Reparm's enrage.  He instantly turns around and one-rounds about 25 people in your raid.  It's absolutely fucking hilarious, rofl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guntaag Gorefeast</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haw, he one-rounded me about an hour ago=P Its all luck though, i've tanked him several times without tipping over</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, you can brag about tanking reparm start to finish but if you do it enough times he will humble you hehe.  He 1-rounded me on the first round the first time I ever tanked him.  I lived a total of about 0.1 seconds from the time he got to camp hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You sure it was Reparm and not Flamesinger?  Seems pretty lucky that a guild new to plane of fire would be succesful in killing castle 2 minis from upstairs on its first or second time there.  Not saying it didn't happen but if it did you guys must really have your stuff together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe i tanked reparm today (single pulled him to fort1 too) without spellshield &gt;&lt; thank god for DI!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for record, that SS is with a bard around (so 500 svf) and in /evasive. We never have used SS (lazy wiz) or any of the mitigating spells as it was pre-gates, should be much easier now.<br />
<br />
His melee is nothing, it's the proc streaks that cause any sense of danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lived the first time I tanked him.Ran way past defensive too...like 50 pct of fight.I was mostly in fh/ornate at the time.Luck and DI factored greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was our first time there, as we had only done sol ro for the first time a few days earlier.  The order was...<br />
<br />
magmaton:  furi/sw<br />
spider be-atch just SW<br />
pyro froggy furi/sw (if i hadn't started with furi i would have died, couple clerics fell alseep)<br />
General Raparm  furi/sw SW dropped at 20%. clerics were very tight, was solid although some of a big dps guys weren't there.<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for the compliments. It just felt so damn good to still be alive when the general raparm name turned into general reparm's corpse. I have heard so much about fire mini's damage (came up in every riposte discusion) that i thought it was pretty cool. <br />
<br />
We didn't beat RZ our first time, took a few tries, but on our 2 successes with him, I tanked start to finish.<br />
<br />
But I attribute these succeses to  a few things, one being god/ldon allowing me to enter elementals as a 10k+ tank with 1900 ac and the knowledge I have gathered from reading everything I can from you guys. Although I am kinda dispointed I won;t have  shot at tanking the elemental gods before I am level 70.<br />
<br />
Thanks Again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's impressive, nontheless.  Your guild is on the right track by whorin' out those Luclin loots beforehand.  They really make those elemental mini fights a whole lot easier.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Omnus good show   :)   Thats a great accomplishment. <br />
<br />
My guild has started doin Fire and FR basically over the last month...I tanked Reparm for my first time a couple weeks back.  First pull it was that unlucky /splat combo that folks mentioned.  Second pull nice and clean from start to end (but what a fire hose of DPS that guy is).  The nice thing is with no elemental or VT gear I have now tanked almost all the Fire minis now and Fennin Ro himself...definately shows what a good heal team can accomplish.</div></div><hr />
