We went to PoTactics and killed in the area that we had info on from Allakhazams site for anout 2.5 hrs but nothing spawned and we werent even sure we had the right spot.  The info on the mob is very vague to say the least.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything about this guy?  Admittedly, Im not the most fluent person of this zone so if you could detail the instructions, it would be greatly appreciated.  The epic guide just says kill him, doesnt give mention of anything else like they did for the other encounters which left me to believe he was pretty common.  Maybe he is and Im just at the wrong place.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is in a room off the hallway between the 2 pit exits. He is also a 24 hour spawn. Also he hits pretty hard and fast, and has an AE rampage so be prepared when you do find him up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just check every day or so, he is bound to be up eventually. Don't bother camping this guy unless you know he was killed 23 hours ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cister Battle</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have a rogue character.  I do have a 65 mage and I can buy invis potions.  Do you think it is possible to get down there by myself to check his spawn or will I pretty much have to bring a group and kill down there then camp out?<br />
<br />
Now hes 24 hr spawn so that means once 24 hr passes hes up until someone kills him right?  He doesnt despawn correct?<br />
<br />
The guide says this guy is 1 groupable and not that tough.  However, the posts I have read said hes a 1600 hitter.  Now I know a mob wacking for 1600 a hit isnt front page news to some of you but thats not a fun day at the park for me.  Posts on different pages talk about using a charmed War Boar but honestly, I dont have any good friend enchanters that I can get on a moment notice.  I know some guild enchanters but nothing close.  I can access clerics, rangers, necros, bards and bsts on short notice.  Possibly 2 wizzys.  What are your thoughts? I buff up to 8200/1710 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get an invis/lev, jump down the pit, and run to him.  However, there are undead mobs in the zone that will spawn between you and him.  There may or may not be any in the way when you go check, thats a pure crapshoot.  <br />
<br />
As for how hard he hits, my general rule of thumb is to disregard anything Alla's says and go find out for myself.  Usually the people who post that stuff are dress wearers, not defensive warriors, and they almost always overstate it.  The last time I tanked him with defensive up max hit was in the low 700s or thereabouts.  I would say the majority of hits were in the 400 range.  You should be fine tanking him IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way to get to him is have your map up, have sow, levi and invis. run into the pit till you hit the opposite wall and go into the furthest left doorway. If you do that, chances are pretty good that you will avoid any of the see inviso mobs. Then go in that doorway, take your first left then first right, he is in that room on the south side of the room.<br />
<br />
he does hit fast and can take down a 12K warrior in no time. when I did him we had 2 warriors, 2 clerics, a druid and a chanter. We grabbed a charm pet, and went to town, having the druid heal the pet, the other warrior standing back using arrows just in case the first warrior went down. He does AE ramp so have your healers keep their distance too.</div></div><hr />

Having rangers and robes makes the fight much, much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">methojs</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look carefully at the picture on Allakhazam.  There are enough clues in that pic to show you exactly where he spawns.  Always look at the details of the area around a mob when you want to find its spawnpoint.  The border behind him on the wall is actually part of a large map which is on the wall of the Overseer's room.  His room also has a single bed, worktable and armor rack.  There is a chest at the end of his bed with a sword leaning on it.  He spawns between the bed and the table.<br />

Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

I was expecting alot harder a mob to be honest we used all melee and his ramp wasnt bad at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brya</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know for sure if he is trackable from zone in?   I have heard he isn't.  Just wanting to confirm.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is. Unless maybe you're using a bard to track or something.</div></div><hr />
