<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warriormaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been contemplating how EQ is on its death bed for many days now. Think for a second, back a few years ago, heading to Seb to level where skill mattered and mudflation wasn't outrageous. Think back to when the game wasnt desensitized and 90 people were bartering in the EC tunnel. Think back to going on an early Nagafen raid and winning, or when an uber person was a sight you saw every couple weeks. Back when 100k was an outrageous amount of money. During these times there were no flagging, AA points, or armor dyes. Anyone could pick up the game on a mediocre connection and a 56k modem. I remember logging into the game to find over 30-40 people in Oasis and the same number in LoIO. I remember being deathly afraid of spectres, the Sarnak Chancellor, and sand giants. The neverending class debates in LoIO and a warrior in crafted and an FBSS was a hardass. During these times, the game retained its fun. It felt like a world full of wonder, intrigue and mystery. Back in these times, the game was fun.<br />
     <br />
<br />
Now, however, the game is simply about ready to meet its end. The Bazaar is worthless, easier, but just not as cool as the tunnel or NFP. Now, thousands of people have over a million pp and kunark class armor sucks. Think for a second that you just bought the game, had installed it, and were ready to get to the high levels to go after the &quot;fun&quot; content. Well, these days, no &quot;noobs&quot; are running around anymore. You may see a few people in the low level zones, but chances are theyre being PLed in their twink gear. If you wanted to reach the upper levels of Everquest today, you would have to ding level 70, get all your planar progression flags, obtain millions of plat, or do thousands of LDoNs. Then, you must work on AA, then GoD flags, then head to Omens. It is impossible for someone to start from scratch and catch up in Everquest today unless they play 8+ hours a day, and VERY FEW people have the time to do that. The amount of timesinks before people can have access to high level content anymore are just absolutely ridiculous. Just having to level to 70 to get there wouldnt be THAT bad, but people would then have to get flags, tons of AA, and gear to get in a good high level guild. This is just one of the ways the low level playerbase will be alienated and the game will eventually fade away with no influx of low level players.<br />
       <br />
<br />
The next point I would like to being up is mudflation. With each passing expansion, the effectiveness of itmes increases drastically. I mean, christ, berserkers have a 100/40 axe now. SoE just cant keep pumping out the shoddily constructed expansions with new and more &quot;uber&quot; items...before long people are going to be soloing velious and luclin raid mobs. This is absurd.<br />
       <br />
<br />
The last point I am going to bring up is the lack of imagination, detail, or creativity in today's zones. Think back to Karnor's Castle or the multilevel dungeons such as Sebilis or Chardok, in which the creativity used in creating them is unreal. Zones such as guk with some fun tricks like traps (pits, etc.) and excellent use of textures and creativity concerning mobs and the wars amongst them. There are very little places in everquest today that could've rivaled heading down to assassin in a risky mission to obtain yourself the much fabled FBSS item. I'm convinced this is why Sony did the &quot;Fabled&quot; events during its 5th anniversary, to be well received by the public. I can guarantee you if they revamped seb to an elemental type zone, people would flock to it simply because it is fun to play there. It seems challenging and mysterious and the mob diversity, cool camps, and extreme attention to detail are what made the &quot;Verant-Era&quot; of Everquest unique. I view SoE as the multimillion-dollar conglomerate who is attemping to squeeze every last bit of the money out of the game as possible with little regard to its customers. Sorry If I don't want to go to GoD only to fight strange alien monster-things over an over again in the same old bland zones. It's just not the same.<br />
       <br />
<br />
I know this is a long rant, and I could go on. However, I believe I have brought my point across. Today's Everquest is not the same game I played a few years ago...a game that was based on companionship, challenge, mystery, and fun. Today's Everquest is personified by the driven desire to become &quot;uber&quot; at all costs, elitist pricks, and unfun timesinks amidst unimaginative, buggy, and repetitive content. I am just hoping the Everquest 2 or World of Warcraft can renew that original EQ feeling of wonder and excitement that has been lost with the current phase of the game.</div></div><hr />

I want the old zones not cheezy zones like Bloodwall. I want to see people selling their gear in Kelethin and Greater Faydark. Going to Mistmoore Castle used to be fun and exciting. Now it's considered a pain and simply a place to get quest components and get Fabled Mobs and their drops. I have decided to quit Everquest and I am proud to say that SOE is a pocket sucking band of jerks. I hope Matrix Online will be more interesting. Read the reviews, hope everyone else tries it too. Goodbye Steel Warriors!  As for my signature I hope to change it over the weekend to &quot;SOE screws you, so screw them too.&quot;  :cool: Edit- Also never read your profile before I wrote Paen, I'm in your server and I know Harmonium is the most advanced in progress on the server, so you should know what I mean.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im haveing more fun in eq then I have ever had. Exploring new zones solo, getting server first loot before anyone. Getting stronger and stronger almost daily. <br />
<br />
Beautiful graphics, tons and tons of PHAT LOOTZ, hard but not to hard encounters. New places to see. <br />
<br />
You quit, I'm having a total blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, seeing as how you recently edited your post, you could have added those paragraphs :)<br />
<br />
The reason that no one is taking you seriously is because you are just reiterating the same old whine that people have been giving for years. Nothing is going to put the shiney back on EQ. Sorry, it is impossible after 5 years to have that new ooo and ahh feel. But the fact is that the game has held up remarkably well, all things considered.<br />
<br />
If you aren't having fun, that's great, don't play. But don't expect a lot of sympathy when you come and tell other people that they shouldn't be having fun either. In the words of Billy Joel, &quot;The good old days weren't always good, and tomorrow aint' as bad as it seems.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Its funny how people, rather than substantiate a worthwhile argument to challenge my opinion...<br />
<br />
Maybe that's because, like you said, it's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but surely you aren't suggesting people  need to have a coherent argument against your opinion to state their own? Regardless, I'll bite.<br />
<br />
People can't catch up, yet theres no newbies running around? <br />
<br />
EQ is personified by the desire to be uber (which you regard as bad), yet you say you install the game and play to attain the high levels?<br />
<br />
EQ is too 'sensitive', yet it's too hard to get into the uber guilds you want to be in? (Also contradicts your obvious feelings that playing to be uber, or high-level, is  bad).<br />
<br />
Mudflation is bad, yet the zones you mention multiple times (LoIO, karnors..you only forgot FM and DL) were responsible for the largest insurgence of 'level-mudflation' and high level newbies the game has ever seen? <br />
<br />
Your entire post is contradictory to itself. Obviously, I don't feel EQ is dying. The amount of traffic this site has picked up in the past month (august avg hits/day: ~385,000  sept avg hits/day:~710,000) is enough to prove  to me that there are plenty of people still playing, not to mention that the latest expansion has breathed quite a bit of life into the game.  I understand if you're not having fun and quit or something, but being jaded and claiming eq is dead because you are no longer playing is naive at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, lets all remember back in the day when the unknown created mystery! EQ encounters have increased in depth 10 fold. This is only countered by the fact that the typical EQ player now understands a lot more about game mechanics.<br />
<br />
If we were to have the same style of play that was presented 5 years ago, how long do you think this would captivate the player base? Maybe a good 2 days.<br />
<br />
I remember going into Lower Guk, only to find there were 100+ people, with lists to get into every camp. Then running what seemed 30+ minutes to reach SolB to discover a much similar circumstance.<br />
<br />
I didn't enjoy having to sepnd hours in EC trying to sell my wares. It wasn't very exciting, and I embrace the bazaar with open arms. People can still attempt to auction their gear in open channels, you will normally se some pretty good deals going, but the typical person wants to get in, get out and when a vendor they just wish to sleep or get on with something not computer related. Go down to Ralphs or your local K-mart and start complaining about running the small guy out of business, for I am sure you frequent your local independant green grocer so you can barter the prices.<br />
<br />
What skill did sitting at a dock for 15minutes and then a 20 minute trip require? Where is the skill in waiting for 2 hours as the list for Lord/hand/magi to finally diminish? Aren't the current tools and other extras introduced increased playability, mostly, that wrent in the original release. LDoN instances and their offsprings, flags, Horses, xlocs, lfg tools etc?<br />
<br />
How can you complain about AA? Next you will complain about flags (oops, you did!). What were we meant to do once we achieved 50? Sit around for 5 years explaining to the diminishing playerbase how skilled we were at waiting at docks or sitting beside groups as they churn xp?<br />
<br />
No one is forcing you to AA or level beyond 60 (apparently you didn't have any concerns with Kurnak). You are right in one aspect, not everyone will reach the zenith of their class..... thats the funny things about zeniths. On one hand you complain about not being able to catch up, and on the other you complain about mudflation and how much older content is now soloable (yet again you neglected to mention how Kurnak allowed you to solo previous group encounter Norrath mobs, which in itself make me believe you weren't around pre-Kurnak). It is these mudflations and ever increasingly fast AA gain that allows newer players to catch up to the frontline. The way expansions are created allows the lower end more easily catch up to the higher end.<br />
<br />
A lot of the weapon and other mudflations are brought upon by whiney class sites that believe they are unbalanced because another classes have a larger piece of the pie (where logic points out that maybe the 15 other classes arent underpowered but one other class is overpowered! Yet we all want to be uber. Blame the player base for that one, not Sony.<br />
<br />
As for lack of imagination, if you ever left LoIO you may realise there are a plethora of interesting and captivating instances (hmmm, cant recall that feature being in the original release) and some pretty fun quests that have indepth storys and Lore associated with. I even enjoyed the fabled mobs. It encouraged people to reexplore zones long forgotten.<br />
<br />
How can you dare condescend about the nature of everyone wishing to be *uber* when by admittance your tag is &quot;Warriormaster&quot;!??? There are many forms or styles one can take when playing. from hard core raider (Triality on vazaelle got to top guild from no where in a matter of months, In Virtue cleared ToV 2nd, by a matter of hours on the newest server at the time) casual raiders (does it really worry you that you will always be 6-9 months behind the leaders when you only have to play half as much or less) or just casual grouper etc..<br />
<br />
I do not think EQ is perfect. I see a lot of faults and things I would do differently. But you just sound like a disgruntled sap who doesnt have the meagre abilitys to obtain any levels that your oversatuated ego has set for you. Or maybe with a sudden conflict of interest outside EQ has driven you away from your dreams. Either way your the incarnation of the sort of EQ player that annoys me so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Laiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If I quit a game that must mean the game is dying because everything in the world has to revolve around me.<br />
<br />
I have that same problem, so I can't quit. If I do my entire guild will quit also. And then all the other guilds will quit. Then EQ will die.<br />
<br />
So I am the sole source of EQ staying alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Woodelfwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">waiting for boats sucked.<br />
<br />
running around for hours sucked.<br />
<br />
epic 1 time sinks sucked.<br />
<br />
not having anything to achieve at the higher end sucked ( no aa's ) cant really coment but i belive i would have hated it.<br />
<br />
no lfg tool sucked.<br />
<br />
<br />
i seriously doubt i could even play eq like it was altho i am still young ( 2 months before luclin weee to me ). everquest got faster in witch i like it better, maybe you dont like the new features over the course of the game like aa's , pok books, bazaar and ldon's but i gurantee almost all of the playerbase does. who cares if you are uber or not maybe you didnt set goals for yourself or dont want to acomplish or see any encounter that takes a thought and strat behind it but i do and i think most of the playerbase does. the expansions let smaller guilds / groups catch up btw. <br />
<br />
and to finish off the post <br />

Warriormaster, if you dont like EQ stop playing it and try another mmorpg but dont complain to us about it, no one else who has been playing as long or longer than you seems to care anymore.<br />
<br />
I for one will be playing EQ and EQ2 just so that i can have some diversity in my gaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Heh enjoy your shitpile we now call EQ ... i weep for those dumb enough to buy EQ2.<br />
<br />
I quit last week for the reasons the poster brought forth ... that and it's just time to grow up for a little while and transition into &quot;life&quot; and the workforce (oh yes and my woman hates everquest with a passion).<br />
<br />
Everquest was ruined with the sony takeover ... it's been a slow, painful death since end-luclin.  It will only get worse as time goes on.  My server has lost about 50% of its playerbase within the last year, including the dissolution and mass exodus of the severwide best of the bests (Afterlife).<br />
<br />
More games will come and go but i doubt any of them will have the luster and excitement of the original EQ.  It was a first of its kind and therefore sparked something neato in everyone that gave it a try.  There's no real fantasy left in everquest.  It's duke-nukem meets diablo meets quake ... only people have uber flaming swords of death rather than BFG 9000's.   It's too much about the numbers these days.  <br />
<br />
It really sucks when a game becomes more like work than anything else .. and the only driving force is to catch an ever-elusive carrot so that you can wave your e-penis in the air showing off your own uberness.<br />
<br />
Anywho now the only thing standing btw me and freedom are those damn withdrawls ... man they're a bitch. <br />

I knew GoD had flopped and really expected him to say it was hurting bad. Well he said &quot;Revenues from  EQ have not dropped, they have actually increased.  Most people will quit playing but leave their accounts active, so we never see a decline.&quot;<br />
<br />
EQ  isn't gonna die anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

Unless you're a MMORPG PR person you'd realize by now that the pool of available customer is more or less limited and any new game that comes out is going to cut into your current base in some way.  A game like EQ doesn't really have much room for growth.  It's just the same as you wouldn't expect Diablo 2 or Starcraft active fanbase to ever increase just because people move on to newer stuff.  <br />
<br />
If you consider half of FF11's numbers to be in Japan (probably more), then EQ is still the #1 English-based MMORPG.  I still think Asian MMORPG #s stem from xenophobia (in Japan's case, 2nd most gaming active nation in the world that refuses to buy non Japan stuff) or just general lack of devleopment on the PC (i.e. Ragnarok Online has 7 millino or whatever they claim in Thailand).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I quit last week for the reasons the poster brought forth ... that and it's just time to grow up for a little while and transition into &quot;life&quot; and the workforce (oh yes and my woman hates everquest with a passion).So, EQ is dumb because you had the innability to juggle both a career and a computer game. And now the only avenue of any possible sexual gratification has demanded so you have started working at Burger King? Or is it mild coincidence that you have now decided to revolt against the brainless masses and to join ... well.. another brainless mass?<br />
<br />
If you now have to justify your innability to continue playing EQ by attempting to encourage others to also lay down the addiction you so desire, then thats ok. We all understand. Its not me who claims EQ is the debil yet still can't release my hold and post on an EQ fan site.<br />
<br />
OH WAIT, I am having an EPITHANY! Is it saying your right, I am indeed a retard and I should stop playing EQ for the total weak reasons previously mentioned?!<br />

<br />
Personally I think Oow is mediocre. I have lots of guildies who rave about it, so obviously a lot disagree with me, personally I have maybe played this game for too long now, and I barely log in anymore. EQ is a funny game. When you are into it, no one can tell you otherwise. When you are off it, you can't believe how into it you actually were.<br />
<br />
I think overall most of it has to do with the point of the game for me. The reason I initially played EQ like a lot of posters have said here is long gone, progression and friends being the only reason anymore I even play. Which is fine as long as the content is fun,  and I find neither to be true really in GoD and Oow. <br />
<br />
But the addiction does tend to come back, so wisely I will wait and see before saying this is the end of EQ for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phantron, you provide, of course, a reasonable response.  The problem as I see it is that it's irrelevant.  Of course people keep playing so they can get shiny new toys.  But when you flood the game with too many toys too quickly it starts to look an awful lot like SoE is trying desperately to keep its playerbase on the eve of a massive account cancellation for WoW.  300HP breastplate?  150HP augments?  <br />
<br />
I'd say that developers need to give people something new....but there probably comes a time when a game is just too old and the mudflation too high.  For me, EQ is starting to hit that time.  I keep playing because I don't want to leave my friends, but I'm really looking forward to WoW, a new game, and a new start.</div></div><hr />

Actually, no, Slassh pretty much nailed it, and nailed you, Apolyon.  If you no longer enjoy playing EQ, good for you.  Quit and go do something else.  However, your sanctimonious comments such as &quot;unlike you, I have a life&quot;, &quot;I pity anyone who buys EQ2&quot; etc. are full of shit and annoying as hell.  I very much enjoy playing EQ, even after 4 1/2 years, and don't see myself quitting anytime soon.  While EQ isn't as much fun as it was at the beginning, that's only to be expected.  EQ, or any game/past-time for that matter, loses its &quot;newness&quot;.  As well, I'm becoming more jaded as a gamer. I'm a very casual player, playing at most 10 hours a week.  I'm still progressing, hanging out with friends, seeing new zones now again, and having fun.  If EQ isn't working for you anymore, it's not working.  Fine, so be it, it happens to a lot of people.  However, don't for a second assume that you are special, or that everyone must see things the same way that you do.<br />

No Apolyon, he nailed you in his first response to your first post (ya know, the one where you said &quot;Heh enjoy your shitpile we now call EQ ... i weep for those dumb enough to buy EQ2.&quot; and other such gems as &quot;it's just time to grow up for a little while and transition into &quot;life&quot; and the workforce&quot; and &quot;the only driving force is to catch an ever-elusive carrot so that you can wave your e-penis in the air showing off your own uberness.&quot;.  Slassh correctly pointed out that your generalizations are assinine.  He also didn't insult you (and may I add, I thought it was quite witty :p )until after you called him a fuckwit, beginning the personal attacks yourself.  I'm quite sure his earlier comments about you getting a job at BK came directly from your own comments about &quot;transitioning into life and the workforce&quot; (as I'm sure your highly educated self knows, the vast majority of first/early jobs are in the fast-food industry), as well as your comment about &quot;your woman&quot; hating EQ (thus, the &quot;demanding&quot; comment).<br />

I really loved the feel of the game up thru Velious.Perhaps the newness factor was lodged in there too tho.They seem to be making stuff alot easier for folks(er when it isn't bugged) and I am suspicious that this is partly to placate EQ players with their new game coming out.I agree balance and the crazy scaling of upgrades doesn't positively affect the quality of EQ.Still, I've played the other betas a little and atm EQ is the best game Imo.It does demand a lot ,but, pays it back in kind.Lots of people are still playing and having fun.Of course,I do believe that WOW and EQ2 will have a significant impact on the game.Lots of the competitive folks will be into a new race.We'll have to see what the new games make of themselves.The game that I leave EQ for may not be in beta yet /shrug.<br />
<br />
There is already attrition making things tough on guilds.A lot of the more aggressive players are trying new things out.Very casual players don't replace them in raids regardless of how many you backflag.EQ is still a lot of fun for many people.Lot's of differant ways to play...you don't have to get caught up in the silly stuff.I guess for some though the race is the thing.</div></div><hr />

How does that hurt anyone that there are 150hp augs? Why does that ruin the game for you?  Just curious.<br />
<br />
I guess because to me the best parts of EQ were exploring new zones with people I liked and respected.  That eventually led to guilds and then guild attrition and rebuilding, etc. etc adnoseum.  Brutul, you mention that EQ subscriptions are steady, but I find that hard to believe from my own experiences in the game.  I don't see many new people, but I do see a lot of older folks leaving.  I also know that guilds across all servers are starting to scrape the bottom of the bucket to keep their numbers up...and they are not happy about it.  If the game really is doing as well as statistics claim why are higher-end guilds so often bleeding players?  Or is this, seriously, just happening on my server? <br />
<br />
When SoE hands us items with such outrageous stats that are so unbelievably easy to obtain (not necessarily the 150HP aug, but the many other items scattered throughout OoW and the new trials), I feel that they have forsaken a part of the game that actually got us interested and addicted to EQ and hope now to keep us happy purely by giving us candy.  Well, I for one didn't start playing this game because of the candy and I suspect that most others didn't either.  It slowly evolved into that however and now it has become almost entirely about it for some folks.  Hey, this is my opinion.  Yer welcome to yer own, and I'm sure many people will tell me that they don't play for the loot they play for any other number of reasons.  But, honestly, as warriors, we are sorta forced into playing for loot, at least in part.   I guess I like to think that I earned the loot I have, but with the ease of acquiring it in the new expansion I don't get that same hard-working-midwestern feeling from my loot anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Spaztic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I haven't seen anything crazy in OoW yet thats real easy to get.

<br />
I see your point, but I don't agree. I like the new OoW gear I'm seeing and that its 1 groupable.  I can finally get some decent gear without guilding.  There is a progression path thats now available that will make GoD a real option for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Progression is necessary as the game continues.  You are only as powerful relative to the environment you're in.  It's true we have a large influx of 100+ HP tradeable items with OoW now but the expected environment is also higher.  Actually if OoW is as difficult as GoD (and it's not) 100 HP items on all slots is only sufficient for even xping.  Of course OoW &lt; GoD in terms of difficulty so people are a bit ahead of the power curve but it's acceptable.<br />
<br />
As for the influx of new attunable items, everything eventually becomes abundant anyway due to lack of decay.  Flooding the market with a ton of items is the only way to get an online buy/sell economy like a MMORPG to achieve a price that's remotely fair.  The Centi weapons of Luclin, Solstice Earring, various elemental tradeskill armor (particularly Earth), ornate armor, and the Velium gemmed weapons in GoD are good examples and I think overall they helped the game more than they harm.  It's good to know that there's always some standard set of items you can eventually buy at a reasonable price rather than trying to haggle/search your way through the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

You know what? EQ never was 'different'. You just weren't fast enough to see it all going on, from day one. The drive for uberness has always been there... it is the backbone of this game, the reason people play with such determination. Change is inevitable, and even though you don't see it, this game has only ever changed in an aesthetic way. The game itself is still the same.. you have changed, levelled up, become uber, started caring about what camp gives more exp and what weapon to buy on a raid. When we were newbs none of it mattered, and it seemed like the game was different. The only reason it was different was because we didn't know wtf was waiting for us in the next zone. Obviously this didn't last forever, and I personally still enjoy the game.<br />

the game has changed though. it used to be multifaceted. it used to involve quests and factions. it used to involve zones with more roamers than static spawns. it used to allow many routes for progression. it used to involve trading. it used to allow noticeable progression in days not months. it used to allow noticeable advancement even for those who dont sacrifice 30-50 hours per week on it. it used to be something we could play as a game rather than as a lifestyle. we used to be able to kick back talking with our friends and STILL be able to advance our characters because we werent required to make full time careers out of killing 1000 identical spawns to noticeably improve ourselves. tradeskills used to be a significant part of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">People that think &quot;eq is dying&quot; all seem to come from the same narrow-minded perspectives. Oh no! Lots of people I have known from 5 years ago don't play anymore, so the game must be dying! Oh no! I don't know many newer players (which can't have anything to do with the fact that most established players do not group randomly with people or try and meet new people at all, instead playing with their friends, now can it?), so the game must be dying!<br />
<br />
Back during what many of these same people consider the &quot;height&quot; of eq, I could do a /who all paladin 60 &quot;race&quot; every few days and after a week get a list of tha vast majority of level 60 paladins. I knew every damn one of them just about too, either personally or in passing. It was like 50 people.<br />
<br />
I did the same before OoW went live, and I got a list of 100+ people, and considering every time I did it I ended up with &quot;too many people to list them all&quot; at the end of the 20 listed for the major races, I could still have missed some. I constantly see new people applying to various guilds that are 65+ that I have never heard of.<br />
<br />
There are more people at the high end than there ever has been before, and no indication to me that the number of people playing has decreased at all.<br />
<br />
Hell, how many zones are there now? And yet the &quot;hot&quot; zones still get bombarded by 70-100 people every night, just like solb and lguk did way back when. People are more spread out, older players stay close to their cliques of friends, and when they finally decide to quit they have to disparage the game and anyone that is still playing, just to convince themselves that the game sucks and they are happier not playing it.<br />

and do not say &quot;we do not care&quot; because some of us do.<br />

Its not an issue of not caring. Its an issue of every single thing you just said was gone, is still here. I'm not sure where you dug that crap up but every single thing you just stated was lost from the game is in the game, hell some of it never really existed originally. Just because the game isn't like it was when you were level 10 doesn't mean the game has changed.<br />
<br />
it used to be multifaceted<br />
<br />
This is pretty general. Clearly the game is still multifaceted... not sure what you're getting at here.<br />
<br />
it used to involve quests and factions.<br />
<br />
In case you missed it, the new epics are out. Oh, and there are just a small amount of other quests around too. just a couple.<br />
<br />
it used to involve zones with more roamers than static spawns.<br />
<br />
Ok, granted there aren't as many outdoor DL type zones with tons of wandering mobs. Wait, DL was always a cesspool, I don't care! Guess what WoS is? another cesspool of KSing, name stealing annoyance.<br />
There are a fair amount of roamers in say MPG, but enough structure to keep the zone fun.<br />
<br />
it used to allow many routes for progression<br />
<br />
Again, this is extremely general. Are you saying I can't level up in different places? tradeskill in different places? raid in different zones? I have over 3 expansions to choose from in any of those categories. Not sure where you're coming from yet again.<br />
<br />
it used to involve trading<br />
<br />
Ok, I will admit I miss the days of north freeport. But alot of people didnt enjoy it, nor did they enjoy the spam. Trading has taken a hit, but lots of people still trade in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
it used to allow noticeable progression in days not months. it used to allow noticeable advancement even for those who dont sacrifice 30-50 hours per week on it<br />
<br />
I am in a highend raiding guild, and I don't spend that much time on EQ. I am gaining a level and a few AA a week while simultaneously raiding. It's not hard..<br />
And I haven't, since the day I started playing (kunark release) EVER had any activity on EQ actively take me longer than a week to complete. That was Eyepatch of Plunder quest by the way. And if you must know, the timesinks were much worse then than they are now. Did you even grind 50-60 pre-hell level nerf?<br />
<br />
Trust me, 65-70 is cake.<br />

<br />
Haha, EQ has been that exact crap since DAY ONE. If you dont enjoy killing the same mobs over and over, dont even start playing. What zone did you exp in when you started the game? because apparently you have found a zone noone else knows about with infinite unique, dynamic mobs.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills are still huge. go check out eqtrader, there are tons of  new. interesting recipes out.<br />

To some EQ is a hobby, to others it is a mere video game.  Each of us has our own perceptions about EQ, and each us will invest more/less time than one another.  I think that it is truly amazing that EQ can provoke such strong opinions from people, and to me atleast, shows just how amazing this game is for one reason or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">The game itself is still the same.. you have changed, levelled up, become uber, started caring about what camp gives more exp and what weapon to buy on a raid.

The gap between uber raider and non uber raider has widened a great deal over the years, but yeah, for the most part other than eliminating SOME of the useless time sinks and making some encounters more complex (much needed), the game hasn't changed much.  Sure, long gone are the days when many people would hang out in the taverns in Freeport and not worry about how much exp per hour they were getting, the time when many spent as much time sitting around chit chatting and goofing off as they did pulling mobs.  <br />

If that's what you liked, sorry, it hardly exists now and hasn't much for years now.  The game started with a major &quot;ooo and aaahh&quot; factor that lent itself to the above despite some horrendously dull time sinks.  It also had a higher percentage of hardcore roleplaying gamers in it who enjoyed that kind of thing.  Hell, the whole online experience in general was 5 years newer for everyone.  Things change.  A lot of that is old hat now.  If you don't like it, you move on.</div></div><hr />

epic is one of the few quests of any significance.<br />

&lt;&lt;it used to involve zones with more roamers than static spawns.&gt;&gt;<br />

what im referring to here is from commons to qeynos hills to oasis we were never able to get up for a moment without dying. we could have a camp (orc camp?) camped and broken and get wiped by roamers. now i go to hoh and i can go afk for hours if i want and the only chance ill have of dying is someone training our camp. and its probably not going to happen. if it does ill get a rez so frankly im not worried about going afk. its really pretty safe in most places now. resists are to my knowledge never needed anywhere except against raid mobs. as a newbie i got killed by poison all the time.  it happened to me maybe once in the last year. if that. no charms. no mezzes. no heavy nukes (big whoop! i got nuked for 1/8 of my hitpoints .. *yawn* .. and the mobs just stand there and wait for me to pull them. almost all our wipes are caused by a bored puller pulling multiple mobs to make the dull a little more interesting. then everyone gets upset and we go back to safe singles for another 6 hours. where are the evil eyes that used to charm our group members and root and blind us? where are the snakes that put a dot on me equal to my entire buffed hitpoints? thats equivalent to a 4k dot for the average untwinked caster in a level 65 zone. but such dots do not exist except on raid targets. what happened to pbae groups? they were nerfed because soe wants us to fight warrior mobs now using melee and heal techniques. they saw that we were being clever and so they nerfed it to oblivion. the pbae nerf was probably the most indefensible acts of dumbing down the game soe has ever pulled. soloing was nerfed so many times i can hardly remember all the nerfs. it all comes down to one thing. soe has an idea of how we are to gain exp and there is only one way they approve of. a tank a healer a slower. everything else is glitter but totally unnecessary on ordinary exp mobs. smack smack hack smack and another mob down. now pull a single and lets do it all again. do it 2000 more times and maybe we will notice a little increase in our own power. its boring. its boring. its changed. it wasnt like this. why cant you see it?<br />
<br />
*sigh* .. we used to have kedge keep .. my favorite zone. that and the evil eye gorge. because they were different. they were challenging.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; but lots of people still trade in the bazaar.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
only lower level players. ONLY lower level players. high level players do not because there is nothing to buy. zero. zilch. it doesnt exist anymore. many tradeskillers ply their trade for no other reason than to boast of their wealth. the PoP expansion has single groupable loot better than anything that exists in the bazaar for some slots.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; I am gaining a level and a few AA a week while simultaneously raiding...<br />
<br />
Trust me, 65-70 is cake.&gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
levels 65-70 are a joke. of course they are cake. but then you will spend another TWO YEARS without gaining a single level. it will be all aa until 2 years from now when the level is increased again. then you will zoom up to 75 in a couple weeks and be back to aa. and any gain of 50 aa you get will have a marginal impact on your power. in that same time if you do not raid you will get a marginal increase in gear. for example 30 ldons could get you another 50hp on your bp maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;What zone did you exp in when you started the game? because apparently you have found a zone noone else knows about with infinite unique, dynamic mobs.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
as i said before the original zones provided us a lot of variety. we would stay in one zone for about a week and then move on. even dreadful dreadlands, one of the worst zones in the game i only stayed in for two weeks. while i was in my 30s and 40s i could hunt in dozens of zones and many of those zones had multiple areas with very different characters. by 65 i had a few choices. a handful of PoP zones, 5 ldon clone-zones which are so similar you could do one of those themes exclusively and then move to another one and no one in your group would even care that you hadnt done that zone before. because they are all clone-zones.<br />

Just a guess, but people get riled up not because people post that they don't like EQ and that they're quitting, but because these quitters tend to also say that anybody who keeps playingmust be stupid, or don't have a life, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Yeah, that would do it hehe. :) <br />
I don't agree with Rising.<br />
<br />
I do agree with some of the fault Haass finds in the game to a degree.I think the large leaps in gear strength post velious were overdone.Probably the emphasis on the raid game as well,although, this was in reaction to the player base I think.Players were presented a world with opportunites and many reacted by forming ever more powerful organizations that needed ever increasing challenges.<br />
<br />
Not sure how this could have been done better.More quests more intricately done.More lore.More importance to factioning...kinda like in velious.Some may suggest itemization more geared towards group play.That would have the effect of making things less special though.If everyone could get their hands on the shiny trinket(or something almost as good) off the big dragon it would loose it's luster quickly.Something more difficult to aqquire and more valuable is by nature more interesting in a rpg fantasy game.The way that items grew in leaps and bounds seems a little tasteless and the &quot;specialness&quot; gets washed out by the repetitive encounters and farming necessary to progress through the raid game.That raid progress requires this kind of mutual support for gear has a lot of positive aspects.With good folks it can help form and develop  common bonds which is one of the best things you can have come out of this type of game imo.<br />
<br />
You can apply all sorts of artificial limits on a game.Often they seem to cheapen the gaming experience though.Allowing players to drive the game with their own solutions to problems made EQ interesting.It of course took the game a little ways away from the origional concept.<br />
<br />
The resent expansions allow for some fairly nice group progression.The raiding end of the game has grown more complex and challenging.There's stilll lots of fun to be had imo.<br />
<br />
When Stromm opened my wife and I started there and leveled/quested from the ground up.The luclin and pop stuff was crazy busy and kinda ugly Newbie zones like Gfay routinely hovered around 300 ppl and PC was worse.We stayed out in the old world quite a bit exploring mostly as a duo, sometimes in groups.It was alot of fun doing the old stuff without a bazaar,twinks or the rest of the newer stuff.However, the hunting wasn't more difficult or interesting than it is now.If anything...I think GOD is more challenging generally and I never had any problem pulling mobs in outdoor zones in the old world.I think the player base has become more sophisticated in hunting ability though.Of course there will always be uninformed ill practiced players.</div></div><hr />

BiC, elemental gate neck from pop, secrets of the planes, elemental god collection quest, tradeskill earring thing, and tons of quests that people simply never put the time in to do because they arent instant gratification like mob drops.

This, is total crap. What game are you playing? Are you raiding luclin or velious right now? I guarantee there are dots out there that will drain your entire hp bar fast if you don't have a healer. but whats the point? who runs around fighting these things solo with no healer? what do you want them to do to make you die to a DoT? it just isnt going to happen in any normal combat situation. Like I said before, you just want to be level 10 again<br />
<br />
You claim you can't die in the camps you are in. You use HoH as an example. Maybe try moving out of the tier 2 PoP zones (PoP is now very old) and try something meant to be challenging?<br />
<br />
no charms. no mezzes. no heavy nukes <br />
<br />
Ever heard of Reparm? Pofire charm birds? you think they are called charm birds for no reason? Have you ever tanked a noc in GoD? have you fought TZ/VZ in time? ever been stunned(essentially mezzed) for over a minute by a trash mob?<br />
<br />
its boring. its boring. its changed. it wasnt like this. why cant you see it?<br />
<br />
You are a fool. And you are repeating yourself, with little effect. Bards not being able to swarm kite, wizards not being able to PBAE every mob in fungus, encs not being able to abuse faction in tactics... these don't change the game, they repair it. Grouping for exp makes everyone grow in power at a roughly equal rate. I have a friend who started a bard and swarm kited from level 10 on. He was level 60 in a week of casual play. He knew about as much as your average ebayer about everything apart from swarm kiting. this is broken, im sorry to the bards that lost a really nice exp tool, but it just needed to go. and the thing is, they can still solo for massive exp, its just slower and based on mana (charm).<br />
I can see quite clearly. I just happen to accept that the highend game is different than the lowend. Maybe you should too.</div></div><hr />

i agree it probably was in reaction to the player base. but herein lies the problem. they changed the game in reaction to the feedback they got from those who play the most. hence the &quot;potential new player&quot; never has a say and what was once a populist game turns into a game that only veterans can identify with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
epic is one of the few quests of any significance.<br />
I must say &quot;Breakdown in Communication&quot; and all its subquests are one of the better timeskinks I have &quot;nearly&quot; completed. Very enjoyable with many nice rewards throughout.<br />
<br />
The gate neck and a few other clickys of convience are fun to do.<br />
<br />
The Signet of Might served me well for many months, kept it all the way through time (admittantly the type7 15ac augs prolonged its life) and threw me into the world of Tradeskills.<br />
<br />
I even managed the Secret of the Planes for my Slow Hoe. The level of decent quests for the higher end player is low, as you lower the expectations of rewards the quests star coming out of the wood work.<br />
<br />
I will not go into depth on Veeshan's new quests, for I am still requiring the the final part to transfigure my old keys.<br />
<br />
One thing I am slightly confused about is the term &quot;time sink&quot;. Is a quest only a quest until its reward no longer justifies the inherint time sink required for it? As such would the LDoN charm be a time sink or reward? Are all the key/flag access time sinks or quest? I keep seeing whiners complain about both time sinks and lack of real quests? Are we to then conclude the quests you truly prefer is to kill mob, loot quest reward (assuming you dont need to talk to any bothersome NPCs!)<br />
<br />
commons to qeynos hills to oasis we were never able to get up for a moment without dying. we could have a camp (orc camp?) camped and broken and get wiped by roamersNo, this isn't zone design, but the ability you gained of predicting ADDs and recognising Roamer paths. Long ago i honesty thought Roamers went were they desired, not realising that there are strict rules that each roamers abide by. <br />
<br />
hoh and i can go afk for hours if i want and the only chance ill have of dying is someone training our campDo you want me to show you where all the safe spots to AFK are in the old zones (yet again I use to think it was at the zonelines.....)<br />
<br />
resists are to my knowledge never needed anywhere except against raid mobsBesides the typical dungeons where the puller can be nuked to death before getting back to camp if his resits are really trash, trygoing into any of the GoD/OoW zones where most mobs have procs that are either Prismatic or Chromatic. Procs for 500-950, and with savage proc rates. Most are in the -250 to -300 adj aswell.<br />
<br />
A lot of the mobs are considered &quot;raid mobs&quot; due to the AE. M'saha in Qvic arent exceptionally tough, but once you start getting hit by the AEs and NOT resisting them you begin to wish for resists.<br />
<br />
Overall I find resists VERY important and have always taken resists into consideration whilst deciding which upgrades I prefer (OMG, another reason Signet of Might rocked!)<br />
<br />
if that. no charms. no mezzes. no heavy nukesWhere do you XP? Sure, trash_mob_10034 doesn't mormally have these abilities, but they never did. As for charm, go to Rifts, where it is unresistable. many ENC mobs mez aswell. As for nukers, I am not a good judge since I have stacked my resists a little (OMG, gogo BiC aswell!!)<br />
<br />
PBAE are stil in the game. If you want to playwith the big boys then get out of the Baby's pool and come to the deep end. Don't whine how simple EQ is whilst you are playing it safe.<br />
<br />
ONLY lower level players. high level players do not because there is nothing to buyThe nigher end players have always been in this situation one way or another, soince they are the main source of high quality loot. That is inherint in the whole EQ progressional path. High end players selling a recently upgraded item to another high end player doesnt really quantify as your regular trading. And luckily with the heavily implemented NO DROP policy on the greater loot the poor whiney ass licking twinks can scream for ATTUENABLE cash pits.<br />
<br />
the PoP expansion has single groupable loot better than anything that exists in the bazaar for some slotsOK, now this one can be interpreted in many fashions...<br />
<br />
1. You think that raid loot should be tradeable to offset how later expansion loot is better than before?<br />
<br />
2. You havent seen the items from GoD/OoW?<br />
<br />
3. You believe players should be able to buy items that have greater power (or equal) to those that are earned ?<br />
<br />
levels 65-70 are a joke. of course they are cakeAnd the only reason lvl1-60 (doubtfully you were around for 50) was difficult is the typical level of ignorance with regards to EQ mechanics.<br />
<br />
and any gain of 50 aa you get will have a marginal impact on your power. in that same time if you do not raid you will get a marginal increase in gear. for example 30 ldons could get you another 50hp on your bp maybe.Proportionally the non raiders can achieve greater gain per effort than the hard core raiders. The harder one raids, the harder it is to get significant upgrades. You talk of 30 LDon as if its being tough? I did nearly 400 just to get 100hp gain (omg and some resists !!) You don't wish for mudflation and yet you also don't wish for minimal gains? What do YOU WANT!<br />
<br />
while i was in my 30s and 40s i could hunt in dozens of zones and many of those zones had multiple areas with very different characters. by 65 i had a few choices. a handful of PoP zones, 5 ldon clone-zonesSo the fact ther ehas been 3 near sequenctial expansions dedicated to the upper spectrum (LDoN and LoY were half-hearted and catered for all levels.. mostly) doesn't delight you?<br />
<br />
GoD was semi-limiting by being locked to KoD'Taz, which was openable by one group and thus opeening up another 2 zones (+3 new instances)<br />
<br />
OoW is surprising unlocked in comparisona nd has many options for the end game XPer.<br />
<br />
EQ is not infallable. It has its errors, which are mainly knee-jerk reactions caused from player/developer relationships.<br />
<br />
Is EQ dieing? It is definatelty in her later years, with little future ahead with all the new MMO games being released or already out. The market is very limited.<br />
<br />
If you wish to critise EQ, feel free, but do it with intellect and thought. Not ramplings of a disgruntled ignoramus.</div></div><hr />

All the basic zones in PoP are open or openable to single groups. And a few more are openable with random pick-up casual raids.<br />

Flags give the players a sense of progression without additional increase in any tangeable statistic (well, besides the charm introduced later to PoP). The GoD flags are even better.<br />

Yeah,obviously a game driven by it's player base will be most strongly impacted by those that play a lot and push through content.It has the effect of Dev's giving those players harder problems to solve and the cycle continues.Did they handle this growth of the gameworld and itemization perfectly? No,still the best game going Imo though,lots of stuff to figure out and challenge you and your friends.Albeit ,the most challenging stuff is designed for the players at the leading edge of the game and often in raid content.Would the game have been better had they centered &quot;challenge&quot; and reward around the more moderate players? probably not.It's not so easy to balance Imo.<br />

I think the recent expansions have made strides in developing the non raid game.There's plenty of content for non raiders to see and do and help you progress.Hopefully,more stuff coming.I still think one of the biggest problems folks have with the game is when they get wrapped up in gear comparisons with players who are more devoted to progression.Also, the very difficult social challenges inherant in  EQ can be frustrating.When those social challenges are well met ,though,it adds alot of depth and enjoyment in the multiplayer world.How to artificially limit numbers without detracting from immersion has to be worked out in future games.The freedom in EQ for players to work stuff out was one of it's greatest draws i think.The complication's that go with that for game development  are pretty challenging.Really, i don't want to provoke raider - non raider stuff.If you are driven by a competitive nature to keep up with joe uber tank,but, don't want to raid in EQ than It's definately the wrong game for you imo.If you don't care and just want to kill stuff with your friends  and compete against the game environment then there is lots to do.That stuff is more challenging than it used to be imo.We just have more experience and better support networks hehe.<br />
<br />
Any persistant online game will face the challenge of some people playing 24/7 mixed in with those of more moderate playtime.The best competive games I tried were time limited for daily turns or turn based.I don't see how they will make everyone happy in a world intended to have strong social significance that allows for such variations in playtime.Perhaps WOW or EQ2 will do it better...Perhaps they are just new.A new race for the competitive people,new sights to see and stuff to learn.I agree EQ is taking a hit and won't last forever.At this point I haven't seen a better game in WOW or EQ2.Just my own opinion.They'll get better though and time will tell.Just the newness factor has a big impact of players.</div></div><hr />

yeah, nocs are so fucking hard to come by. I can show you one within 10 seconds of zoning into any GoD zone.<br />
<br />
And there have NEVER been many charm/mez casting mobs. I can remember maybe a handful throughout the entire game that charmed.<br />
<br />
And in case you haven't noticed, elementals and plane of fire aren't exactly uber anymore. If you don't have elemental access by now, you aren't experiencing the full extent of the game and I am sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

I was around when the level limit was 50, yes. I'm not sure what you are getting at however. Maybe you should pick a definitive side- eq is dying, eq isn't dying, one of the two.</div></div><hr />

I thought my stance is pretty clear. I view EQ as not an infallable immortal, but an Online product that will one day (well and truly past its half life) be superceded by more popular games.<br />
<br />
EQ is dying! what a retarded statement is this? IS the statement trying to say that EQ, unlike other more popular games, has a limited life? Or that after 5 years people are surprised to see it have negative growth?<br />
<br />
Does'nt matter, Sony will sell all their subscriptions to Ubis-Soft and all the patches will then occur on euro-times! American tads, be prepared for 5 years of paybacks!</div></div><hr />

Heck, at the least, it shaved off a year or two for casual guilds to hit the elemental planes, or even time.  For lots, that might not be a big deal.  For these guys, they are zones that they figured they would never see.  The first time they go to PoI and zone into Time, do you think it'd be any different from the first time you went a year or 2 ago?  The only difference would be that all the NPCs are targettable, but there's some fun in that too.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think EQ is dying at all.  It's simply evolving to meet current demand.</div></div><hr />

No, really. It is easier. Its easier than 55-60 and its easier than 60-65, albeit barely on the latter.<br />
<br />
55-60 was hell simply because you had limited zones to exp in really. Even at Velks, you would NOT visibly see your blue exp bar move. I saw it move every 30 minutes. I know many people who dragged their inventory bar off the screen to save themselves the depression. <br />
<br />
OoW? I spent a couple hours in WoS and gained 20 % in 67, spent a couple hours in PG and gained 25 %. The zones aren't hard to find, they don't require spoilers. So that isn't the ticket. Its just... easier.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like much the same as leveling between 30-50 in the old days, with the exception of hell levels which were absoprbed into other levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
 The zones aren't hard to find, they don't require spoilers. So that isn't the ticket. Its just... easier.How does this differ from original EQ?<br />
<br />
I think people are missing the point. Its not easier because you can earn 1,500,000 xp/30min (or whatever it is now). The comparisons should be is it the same difficulty to get from 1-70 with a decent amount of AA as it was originally to get 1-50 (pre-Kurnak).<br />
<br />
Of course you would expect xp to be faster, or would we want all the new players/characters slog through months to get anywhere? The game HAS to be friendly of the new characters/players (I include characters because some older players do in fact decide to start a new class) because it would be ludricous to believe that they should be penalised so far behind when the bar keeps being raised with every expansion. As the bar moves, so should the rate of advancement, proportionally,, as it does.<br />
<br />
Now, if we consider the bottom-feeders and how they survive on older content due to lower game understanding and less game comitment. Is ther eany reason to prevent them from allowing them to feel some sort of progression, albeit artifical and always p;d content?<br />
<br />
How many Guilds would have conquered Luclin w/o PoP fueling them, or even PoP? How many guilds would still be sitting outside of Time pondering whats inside if it wasn't for mudflation? Is there any valid reason Sony should not give the lower tier guilds/groups a chance to expirence past Uber encounters? Or does this make the Ubers feel cheated somehow because their Magelo penis isn't larger in comparison?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, except this is the top end of the game. Of course level 31 didnt take very long, it was level 31.<br />

First you say knowledge of the game is what makes todays mobs easier, then you say we always had this knowledge. Contradicting yourself = not cool.<br />
I don't know about you but when I first went to MPG, I didn't have any more knowledge of the zone or mobs than I did when I first zoned into OT. Now, I admit I do know more about the game than when I was excping in OT, but the fact that OT exping is so much simpler balances that out. Its not that we know more... its just easier to level from 65-70 than I was to level 55-60. Thats all there is to it. When I did Top camp in Velks from 55-60, it was the top exp zone in the game, and probably the top spot in that zone. We almost never lost anyone for the entire grind I did there (couple weeks). We had it down to an art. Yet it still took WAY longer than 65-70.<br />

Ok, The zones back in the old world didn't require spoilers to xp, and werent that hard to find. Asking how does it differ from the original release was asking why is it easier if that was th basis of his arguement.<br />
<br />
I don't believe I ever mentioned mobs being specifically easier, I said the game has become easier for people since they are now more adept at the mechanics. If we were to go back adn start again with the understangs that we have now the game would be laughable.<br />
<br />
I would be very surprised if you understanding of the mechanics (and subsequently mob ebhaviour and expectations) since OT, I would be very, very surprised.<br />
<br />
Top camp in velks is Upper Spiders or Upper kobolds. Either way I found shrooms or Juggs to be superior xp, by far. Spiders were overcamped and kobolds were too few before you ran into the castle dispell traps.<br />
<br />
I dont recall saying we always had this information either. I said it was grown, by expierence.<br />
<br />
I would say it is easier to get 70, but for the sole reason there are really easy exp mobs to kill.Well, dont forget to add a healthy dash of AA, since a respectable amount is required to even pretend to be equivalent of the old lvl50, and besides that, didn't you just mention there was a nice easy camp in Velks?<br />
<br />
And again you missed the point. Its not about 65-70, its about the comparative of 1-50 (old school) to 1-70 +aa (now). Why are you bothering to compare 5 levels at the end of EQ when it is niether the definative end nor a fair comparison to the previous pinacle of EQ?<br />
<br />
If comparing the relative difficulty of a pre-defined and a progressively increasing standard, then the whole journey should be considered and not just the cusp of the expierence.<br />
<br />
Again with the self-contradiction.<br />
No, not really. You just seem to be stuck on the whole xp/tic compared to previous expansions. Now, if you believe I am being contradictive by saying 1-50 is far easier than today than it was previous, and then to say EQ isnt really easier... then BINGO, you have me. Though I do believe that both statements can be true and yet not be contradictive.<br />
<br />
Admittantly I am truly niether on the &quot;EQ is easier&quot; or &quot;harder&quot; generalisations. Many aspects have grown, changed and at times been completely corrupted by interventions that were simply not warranted.<br />
<br />
I dislike mudflation, yet I understand its necessity.<br />
<br />
Call me in for contradictions, yet I still stand by EVERY  statement and will happily defend them with my trusty zealous nature.<br />
<br />
Contradicting yourself = not cool<br />

Ok, I think your strategy worked, I have no fucking clue what you are talking about here.<br />

Whats your point? The exp in Velks has been heavily modified since velious came out. Remember that patch they did during PoP to make oldworld zones much more appealing for exp to uncrowd PoP?</div></div><hr />

When you started EQ you knew nothing. Now, after however long you know a lot more.<br />
<br />
When you say &quot;easier&quot;, do you mean simpler or quicker? And are you referring to yourself or someone fresh who has never played EQ? Or am i asking too much here?<br />
