<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know of 2..the DPK one that is or about to be in time (and I could not tell you the server)...<br />
<br />
And Flag Raids on Povar. Just finding it has re-energize me a bit for EQ because now I can see a path of advancement (though still raid centric, not slavishly so) to take me to the next step. <br />
<br />
So I am wondering if they are/have scpread...and if massively co-operative ventures are the way to go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">E'ci has/had a very successful public raiding organization - E'ci Public Raiding. I'm not quite certain if they have killed Quarm yet, but they are in PoTime. Afaik they have several tiers and maintain advancement in each.<br />
<br />
E'ce has a long history of public raid begining with PoHate and some PoFear I believe. These raids took down targets like VS and Trak fairly early upon expansion release.<br />
<br />
Many servers have alliances. Generally these are to allow friends and family or more casual guilds to progress. Some of these do cooperative flagging so guilds don't have to continually reflag as they recruit new members.<br />
<br />
Also many servers have particular targets, like Vox and Naggy, that have become public raids. The number of sub-52 guilds has fallen off and without public raids these targets would probalbly not be taken down much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bristlebane has 2 that I know of that are in effect raiding channels, one is called &quot;WDF Hugs&quot; and also has a guild that formed out of it called &quot;Kute&quot;. Think there is another one a well called &quot;Scholars of War&quot; or similer. WDF Hugs have killed elemental gods, not sure how far SoW have progressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">E'ci has fairly hardcore public raiding on both american and japanese times.  American is based around the guild Infinit and lead by Ashorty, asian is based around Gospal of the Dawn, not sure who leads it.  American public is well on its way through time, not sure about asian but they're at least very close to time if not in it.  There is also a public backflagging channel, and a few smaller public/semi-public raiding groups doing lower-end content and epics and such.  Helps with recruiting for higher-end guilds as its alot easier for recruits to come in flagged up and with basic gear needs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tarew Marr's is decent, got about 60-70 people in channel ready for pretty much anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">we have several on inny<br />
<br />
the organized by invite only (still open but generaly the backflag crew fills up fast with guilded peeps who missed a flag)<br />
<br />
the semi opraganized good leaders stick to requirements kick people out and such. take over  think they just finished up MM<br />
<br />
flagraiders they win but no requirements they general take care of AD and lower stuf on mobs in a open area like MB 100+ people will be wacking on the thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Drinal has &quot;Drinal Flag Rebellion&quot; more then a year ago but that faded out when the flag limit was put in, but eventually &quot;Nightraid&quot; started doing open raids, they are working on elemental gods atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fennin Ro's open raiding force is generally called Khasel. The name is an amalgamation of two players' names that I don't remember, but they've long moved on anyway. There are almost always more than 100 people in the channel. Some of us are guildless, some are in elemental guilds, some are time+.<br />
<br />
Today we beat the High Priest cycle in CoD, failed about halfway through bert event due to an overpull of kings, and they were moving in to take out RZTW as I was logging off.<br />
<br />
It's mostly a PoP flag thing, but bored people are always in there trying to come up with stuff to raid, be it BoT towers or whatever. Generally we do stuff like Grummus, MB, HP, HoH trials, AD... that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Some of the raids are resounding successes, some of them wipe hard... It's kinda a mixed bag. About a quarter of the time though some idiot ninjahails the PP or ploots something. We have some talented raid leaders and tons of skilled players, but it's stupid shit like that that keeps khasel out of elementals IMO. Personally I've gotten grummus, HP, hedges event, terris thule, AD, hoh trials, RD, and MB just from open raids. It's like a second guild to me. (Errr my only guild rather).<br />
<br />
Inevitably there's competition with guilds sometimes, like today with bert, but I think the general conception is that Khasel sort of IS a guild. The two raidleaders discussed it, and the guild ended up sending it's flagless down to join the open raid hehe.</div></div><hr />

Tarew Marr's is decent, got about 60-70 people in channel ready for pretty much anything.<br />
<br />
What's the name/channel?  I never heard about 'em, and I got guildies still inside who'd wanna know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone have an idea if there is an open raiding channel or group like that on Cazic Thule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stemcell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">http://www.ecipublic.org/<br />
Public raids.<br />
We're close to raiding Uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There's at least one public raiding channel on Emarr, but I don't know how organized or productive it is.  (I just found out about it)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah...  puemarr:raid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We should probably get a list for every server that has one. I know that FlagRaids (povar) at least has me hopefull about getting somewhere in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mithaniel Marr has a few channels. flags is the most popular open channel, there is another (flagz) that is invite only, and there is a third for sol ro flagged people that is just getting started, but has landed a successful RZtW kill. Our PURs haven't gotten into time, but there are probably 2 or 3 groups of people who are EP flagged from PURs alone. I am Sol Ro flagged from the PURs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Quellious has 2 I think. One might be gone now but I know one is there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Prexus has 2, both started by the same person. 'barbraid' is for lower tiers (grum, bert, tt, mm, mb, saryrn), while 'barbraiden' is for RZtW and up. The latter has done up to SolRo and fire minis. Channel has only been around for a few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>nennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, Lanys sucks. We have random open raids, but I don't know of any main channels. Hurts hearing about these time+ open raiding organizations when I don't think our server has pulled off even RZtWL. Then again, I haven't played in a month or so for more than a few minutes, so things could have changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We have two on Tunare.  One is Project Betty of the the 'bowraid'.  I hate open raids because IMO it puts some people where they don't belong.  The bowraid has killed RZ a couple times but thankfully they aren't raiding Elementals it's already so damn crowded as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Veeshan doesn't have an open raid channel that I know of, and the only open raid I went on(grummus, 70ppl, 3hours, wipe) ended in a total disaster, recently, my brother went on a pickup grummus raid, they tried twice, got him down to 5% on the second shot :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caelidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah Quell still has 2..ORQ (Organized Raiders of Quellious) and URON (United Raiders of Norrath)  URON is in Ele's not sure if they've killed any of the gods yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Emarr doesnt have any specific raid leaders from our raid channel but they have taken out Bert and last i heard had made a few shots at RZ.  The best raids have been done by Kogur before he went and joined one of our time guilds.  He knows his stuff and is even crazy enough to let me pull from time to time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well on Povar FlagRaiders I hav been lucky--gotten AD (first night), PoS minis (second night), Grummus (third night), and TT last night. While slow does not begin to describe gathering the forces, we seem to do well once we get going.<br />
<br />
Oh and did you know that 23 x 65 + 1 64 = average raid level of 64?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tholuxe Paells as such doesn't have an official public raiding group, but we do have groups of friends who go do old stuff...Team Nizzi is the main example..a bunch of GoD/Time/EP geared people going to kill in VT or Emp etc...that's about it really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BikamarNeebiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Vazaelle has one just started up though I don't believe they've gotten to the flagging stage just yet... more in the getting the core to learn to work together on pre-PoP stuff.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong though  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bertox has allmustdie that runs pick up flag raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The Tarrew Marr one started as a channel for the elemental guilds doing backflagging for new memebers. Channel is Backflag:friends. Originally a bunch of the guilds had backflag agreements where they would let the other guilds members join them.<br />
<br />
  But now it has mostly turned into an Open raid channel for the lower end PoP flags. Sometimes some of the higher end players will be bored and help out, other times its just assorted players who need flags. Ive managed to pick up AD, TT, CoD, MB 2 of the HoH trials and TZ and VZ flags so far.<br />
<br />
Last night we did a successful run at the Virgins HoH trial, then wiped trying RD and I got to play MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hofbrau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">As a guy who is in a family guild on Rodcet, I need to know if there is any open raid channels.  Want to try some of the higher stuff than Poj, Poi, and PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taneldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Emarr doesnt have any specific raid leaders from our raid channel but they have taken out Bert and last i heard had made a few shots at RZ.

<br />
<br />
Yea Kogur lead some good raids back in tha day =P<br />
<br />
Emarr seems to be a little behind in the PURaid secne, perhaps its due to a few guilds hitting RZ alot and the public not getting together fast enough to take him down.<br />
<br />
i think the public raid chan is puemarr:raid or :raids i cant remember as i dont do many of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jamylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Kane Bayle has one that is dying and one that is starting up. /kbflags has successfully done AD, PoS minis, Grummus, and MB (when I got my flag, only successful one too) The person who founded the channel app'ed one of the ele guilds and since has left the game  to play Lineage 2. Since then the channel has had a hard time finding people willing/capable of leading raids. (Mainly because there are currently 6 or 7 raiding guilds Ele + access (4 are in Time or GoD) but there only 2 or 3 raiding guilds progressing through pre-elemental flagging, and both of those are still relatively far away from ele-access, so the people who are able to lead the raids really don't want more people flagged for zones, especially since it seems that only idiots on the server show up for flagging raids) The newest public raiding channel was only started this week /rk (Raiding Kane) so it will be interesting to see how it goes.</div></div><hr />
