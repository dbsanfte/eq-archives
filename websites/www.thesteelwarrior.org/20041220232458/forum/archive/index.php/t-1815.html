<br />
Anybody parsed it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just from casual observation, ID5 hasn't changed my mitigation curve at all.  I still get hit for max just as often as before I had ID from the few logs I've parsed.. (4 sessions of 5-9 hours worth of exping)<br />
<br />
At least I can see that LR5 is doing something.  ID just doesn't seem to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to remember some testing done here previous that showed that Innate Defense was only effective if you had AC above a certain level (which seemed pretty high to me).  It could be possible that your AC isn't above this level so ID and that would explain why ID doesn't seem to be doing too much.  Then again even parsing its hard to see the effect of CS and ID.</div></div><hr />

His results strongly suggest that LR5 and ID5 were damn near identical in terms of reducing melee damage received.  <br />
<br />
I believe your observation showing that ID5 hasnt done anything is faulty.<br />

Just my observations of the AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll go back and recheck my logs.. maybe I missed something.</div></div><hr />
