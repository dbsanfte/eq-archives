Was it based on testing by someone?  I did a search and found 100 people saying you can't proc on a riposte, but no testing or anything to back it up.  Has anything like this ever been done?  It wouldn't be easy to test, but I thought I remembered somebody backing this up with parsing or some kind of concrete evidence, but I can't find it anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't have a log or anything, but it should be super easy to test.  Pull a train of 100+ lower mobs, turn off attack, pop furious with OT hammer equipped and see if you end up in Overthere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">problem is, furious could have a modifier preventing procs while furious, like agressive or precise turn off crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do that and don't end up in OT, you still have to wonder if it's just the disc. I'll see what I can do tonight, let an exterminator beat on me a while with attack off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't tested it either, but the theory I heard explaining it seemed sound. Proc rate is based off of attack delay to end up with an average of 2 procs per minute. So if you swing on average 2 times per minute, you should proc every swing. If you swing 10 times in a minute, you should proc once every 5 swings and so on. However, with a riposte your delay is essentially 0.  This means that you should never proc on a riposte due to its speed. Again, this isn't a test, this is pure theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first trained double riposte I wanted to see how many times it went off so I pulled green mobs for about 20 minutes and stood there and let them hit me with attack off to see how many double ripostes I got. I never procced while doing that. Not scientific really but it seems like I would have procced once during that time if you could proc on a riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curriously, I DID crit under defensive (only have Combat fury 2).<br />
<br />
does the modifier only change the innate chance to crit ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might be wrong but the parsing I have done and I have seen from other people seems to suggest that your proc rate is fixed. Dexterity is what affects proc rate.<br />
<br />
If you use fast weapons, slow weapons dual-wield, use 2-hander, riposte, have 100% haste, 0% haste, etc. the proc rate per minute is still the same.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a proc only happens when you actually swing so in theory it might be a swing caused by a riposte that does the proccing, but the end result should not change, you only proc so many times per minute so doing a lot of riposting would not help DPS or number of procs in any way.<br />
<br />
Not sure if there is some other reason why a riposte proc would make a difference, but I believe the question is pretty moot.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Oh, I now see why this is important. If you are not attacking!</div></div><hr />

couldn't find a proc on a riposte but i did find wht looks like a riposte of a riposte. and thats not supposed to happen either. the critter attack at timestamp 1:58:10 and since slowed should not have even tried except by riposte to hit me again for a few seconds. in timestamp 1:58:11<br />
<br />
procs and such come befor the riposte message. a proc on riposte would read<br />
<br />
name hit a x for # of non-melee damage<br />
you hit/miss x <br />
a x tried to hit you,but you riposte</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The riposte hit is listed above, &quot;You slash a Witness of Hate assassin for 203 points of damage&quot; then you perform another swing that is riposted.  Just realized you getting hit on also, were you attacking from the front or did you move maybe to the mobs side during that time?  Could be what happened is you riposte the hit which is the 203 hit then you strafed to the side of the mob for a second where he could riposte your hit but couldn't hit back.  Eh the log was confusing heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i thought that to but following that hit frequency the attack in second 10 and the hit in second 11 it would have hit me or someone in the 1:58:12 timestamp. guess thats a problem with logs.<br />
<br />
other option is <br />
attack that landed<br />
mob riposting orignial attack and getting reposted<br />
original attack getting reposted<br />
<br />
i also only find this phenomana in guk so it could be a ldon thing in some other one people are getting procs on repost. their is also the whole order of attack that that gets people alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a riposte of a riposte, I've seen it happen to me also.  Not common, but it can happen.<br />
<br />
For an example, if you swing at the mob, and it ripostes and hits you, the log will say first that you were hit by the mob, and the following line is you swinging and getting riposted.  Same with procs, you get the proc message and then the swing.<br />
<br />
As for procing on a riposte, I'll try to do some tests tonight if I have time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of this comes back to a project I'd worked on quite awhile ago... figuring out the order in which events during melee occur.  Basically, with the information available from enough logging with enough different effects and targets, it should be possible to reverse-engineer the programming &quot;flow&quot; used during combat.  Made quite a bit of headway on it early last year actually, but got distracted  by Real Life for a bit and never finished...<br />
<br />
Output would be a flowchart or logic table, showing the order in which melee and melee-affecting events occur.  With it, you'd be able to answer esoteric things like &quot;do weapon procs occur before enrage hit determination is done, before enrage hit damage is applied, or afterwards?&quot;.  Included was a lot of the checks and logic behind them, including check for riposte and check for proc, with following short-circuit of the remaining checks, etc.  Interesting stuff for a hobby programmer.<br />
<br />
I'll probably finish it up someday, will have to dig up the parses I'd saved and do all the other one's I'd planned...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladymir</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might be wrong but the parsing I have done and I have seen from other people seems to suggest that your proc rate is fixed. Dexterity is what affects proc rate.<br />
<br />
Dex has absolutely no impact on proc rate, nor does anything else you or any player can control. <br />
<br />
It is hard-coded to average 2x per minute. So whether you are a monk with triple attack at 65 using speed focus hasted at 110% (with bard song for example) and using a base delay 18 weapon, or a cleric using your summoned hammer, unhasted, swinging once every 5 seconds or so...<br />
<br />
You will AVERAGE to 2x per minute. This means you might proc 4 swings in a row, but that will be averaged out by minutes where you proc 0 times...<br />
<br />
It has been tested over and over again by various Monks, and it took me a long time to come to grips with it, because it is a LAME way to do it, but there it is.<br />
<br />
What I am not sure about is if dex effects learn rate. I still don't have round kick maxed on my monk (useless secondary attack once you get flying kick, or earlier). The only time I do seem to get points in it (at about 185 now) is when I have KEI... so is it INT based? In my experience: yes. I cannot prove that.<br />
<br />
So that leaves what for dex - It is part of the formula (the average of your 4 melee stats) to determine your total endurance aka stamina number. <br />
<br />
Thus dex = near useless IMHO. Get 305 in the other 3 then work on your charisma as Scargoth here pointed out.<br />
<br />
As far as riposte goes, I thought you could proc on a riposte... so I am staying tuned to this thread to see what the smart people say. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at some of the threads in the Overlords sanctuary, it shows the proc rate is independent of weapon delay. However, you may also notice that most top end warriors are proccing more than 2 times per minute, probably due to 305 dex among other things such as combat effect mods. Also, individual weapons have varied proc rates such as the cleric summoned hammer. This implies that no, it's not hard coded into the game, and that yes, there are modifications to the proc rate.<br />
<br />
  Also, yes weapon skill gain is affected by dex. They announced it when describing the effect of stats, and I have found nothing but concurring data while leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is bullshit.  Dex does indeed have a small effect on your proc rate.  Enough people have done proc rate testing with enough numbers that are not 2 to know that it's true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, don't shoot the messenger. Go to monkly business and check it out. There was this thread a couple weeks ago on it; mayby it is bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 220 dex, it's closer to 1.6.  Some people with max offensive AA's and 305 dex are closer to 3.  It is not fixed, that much is so clearly visible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my log shows i riposte so little that the chance of seeing a proc on repost(if possible) is slightly astronomical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can in fact proc on a riposte I doubt you could test it with furious,I know for a fact taht I have never proced while using this disc before and since the melee changes I probably usefurious 3 or 4 times a day at least now.<br />
<br />
If you could Proc while furious then it stands to reason that any mob with an innate proc would also be able to proc while Enraged. This would obviously be a difficult thing to test since the amount of mobs out there that have low enough melee to actually be able to withstand enrage long enough to even see it while alos having an innate proc has got to be incredibly low I can't think of any off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is plenty of mobs with innate procs to be sure but most have such high melee to boot you would drop far to fast to ever be able to know for sure.<br />
<br />
Maybe Next time I tank Reparm or something I will turn him on enrage and ask melee if he proced on any of them....</div></div><hr />

If you look at the effects in Lucy it's simply &quot;Increase Chance to Riposte by 10000%&quot;.  It's not changing how Ripostes work - it just drastically increases the frequency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily.  Innate procs pretty obviously don't work like weapon procs, since we know that mobs can't proc innate abilities on a miss, while they can proc on a miss if they're using a proccing weapon.</div></div><hr />

That's the kind of thing I was looking for.  Can you explain the circumstances?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been testing different classes tanking ability against a Valorian Guard.  Some at different ac levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My theory on procs is that it runs in the background while you are attacking.  This would make it independant of your weapon delay, and such things as haste or slow.  The swing would be the catalyst. <br />
<br />
Auto Attack On<br />
<br />
You have 3 procs, you now have 3 seperate checks being made in the background as long as you are attacking. <br />
<br />
When a proc meets the check, and is set to go off, it attaches itself to your next swing, whether that is .01 second, or 2 seconds away.  If you swing and the target is out of range, the proc would be lost. <br />
<br />
This would also explain why you would not be able to proc on a riposte.  Since the proc rate would be tied to when an attack is activated by you, turning attack on, or hitting an attack such as shooting an arrow, a reflex hit such as a riposte would not be able to generate a proc simply because your character has not activated your attack sequence which starts the proc sequence.  Basically, you aren't checking for a proc if you aren't attacking. <br />

I submit shakerpage as evidence.<br />
<br />
Proc rate is also modified by a value assigned to the weapon.  Most weapons have the same (resulting in about 2 ppm w/ max dex) but others have a higher rate. (i.e. BF with 3 ppm and DB at 2.5 ppm)</div></div><hr />
