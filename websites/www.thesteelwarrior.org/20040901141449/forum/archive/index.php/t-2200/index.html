<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CATEIRE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, in reading slow’s ideas I decided to run with the specialize thought:<br />
<br />
I think that since there is a way for the casting classes to specialize in a form of casting. That warrior could perhaps do something along the same lines. Someone mentioned to be able to specialize in a specific skill but I think that is actually not enough. I suggest the following. Adding these in addition to the already available AA like CS, CA, LR, and so on. <br />
<br />
Specialize Defense: <br />
<br />
Through the need to be a sturdy member of the fighting force, we have learned how to teach you to be able to Increase your Defensive skills above all other skills through practice and training. Specializing in this skill will allow you to avoid and mitigate signigantly more damage than your average warrior.   Along with increasing your avoidance and mitigation as you become more skilled in your specialty you will begin to emit an aura that will cause the creatures about you to become extremely agitated at your very presence. <br />
<br />
<br />
Specialize Offense: <br />
<br />
Although a hearty race designed to take a blow we have learned that some of our profession prefers to be able to inflict more devastating damage than that of their peers. We have obtained knowledge on how to teach you to focus your Offensive abilities enabling you to be quite formidable. Specializing in this skill will allow you to increase your damage per hit and decrease the number of misses per combat round.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I think that having the ability to choose whether or not I want to be all out defensive or all out offensive would be awesome. I think it would Increase the “stack ability” of our class. Me personally, I would go offensive since I am only MA or MT occasionally. If it were to change then I would quest defensive, just as the casters can quest the change of there specialization. Allowing a choice to guide the path of my Toon would be cool.  In the hate generation as an Exp MT it solves both problems of course by the defensive emitting a hate aura. And the offensive by creating more damage.  Not taking the snap agro from the knights and offering the warriors the added benefit of a “skill” based self improvement. <br />
<br />
I’m ready for the flame …. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not to be a dick, but Alternate Advancement.  This is already provided.  I take shit all the time for being an offensive Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CATEIRE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/EM looks at the first paragraph of his post then, ponders Darkoan's ability to read something thouroughly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say skill and level based, just like caster specs, would be best.  Not AA, we don't need more AA's.  Just have it trainable at some level like magic specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is an Idea...<br />
<br />
What would be nice is if they added a couple levels of Specialization. <br />
<br />
Level 20 - level 1<br />
Level 40 - level 2<br />
Level 50 - level 3<br />
Level 55 - level 4<br />
Level 60 - level 5<br />
Level 61 - level 6<br />
Level 62 - level 7<br />
Level 63 - level 8<br />
Level 64 - level 9 <br />
Level 65 - level 10<br />
<br />
At each Level you can choose specialization in Offense / Defense<br />
<br />
Offense = +2 Shielding Mod.<br />
Defense = +1 Vengeance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree, it should be trainable at certain levels.  More AA's are not needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CATEIRE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, I have a question to those who posted that it should not be an AA. <br />
<br />
Do the caster classes have to spend an AA when Training in Specialization?<br />
<br />
Answer:  NO<br />
<br />
At level 20 or 24 (not sure) a caster can choose one to the casting skills to specialize in. It is done through their class trainer. Some of the skills are specialization evocation, abjuration, divination, and conjuration. Every skill can get up to a max of 50 only one can go beyond the skill of 50.  For example a Wizard would choose Specialization Evocation since the majority of a wizard’s damage spells are Evocation based. So at level 21, during a fight or after casting an evocation based spell (garrison’s mighty manna shock), a wizard might see this:<br />
<br />
You have gotten better at Evocation (128) …………... This being the basic innate skill. <br />
You have gotten better at Specialize Evocation (53)…  This being the CHOSEN skill <br />
<br />
So, in retrospect, A warrior of appropriate level having the ability to TRAIN AT THEIR CLASS TRAINER the skill Specialize Defense or Specialize Offense, would see a message like this during a fight.<br />
<br />
You have gotten better at Defense (128) ……………..This being the basic innate skill.<br />
You have gotten better at Specialize Defense (51) …. This being the CHOSEN skill<br />
<br />
<br />
It was said well before in a previous post on another thread. The Basic Engine is what is broke about the warrior this is merely a suggestion on how to implement a fix that applies to a Skill based individual Warrior game progression. Not, just a couple of nice weapons, or more hard to attain war only equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the idea of being able to specialise.<br />
<br />
But there is one problem...<br />
And that's the very fact of this not being implemented from the start.<br />
<br />
If they make specialise defense, then an actual warrior would become a lot stronger vs mobs...<br />
which would render trivial the encounters where the warrior was calculated to be at juuuust the right strength.<br />
<br />
If such a specialisation is made weak enough so it doesnt imbalance the current game... well.. then it would be too weak to even consider.<br />
<br />
But then again.... int he past, VI HAD retcouhed many encounters when changing the caster's spell resists...<br />
They could do the same for us...<br />
they could.... if they cared... but it's all about casters now, melees are going extinct.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
This Idea is what I think is one of our problems. Somehow, everyone has sold us a load of shit and we bought it. <br />
<br />
Why of all the classes in the game, do we think that we are so 'design important' that  everything revolves around us, that they cannot fix us, without breaking the game?<br />
<br />
Hmm lets see MB was &quot;Broken&quot; Wizzies were doing 14k nukes using all their mana... so they fixxed it, Now wizzies can do 6k nukes a dozen times with the same mana...<br />
<br />
NOTHING short of giving us an ability to insta-kill XP mobs, and take only 1 damage from all attacks could overpower warriors. <br />
<br />
WARRIORS are so extremely dependant upon other classes, WE SHOULD HAVE OVERPOWERING Melee skills.<br />
<br />
We cannot HEAL.<br />
We cannot BUFF.<br />
We cannot ESCAPE.<br />
We cannot PORT.<br />
We cannot NUKE.<br />
<br />
What reason is there that we are not the best class in dealing Melee damage, along with taking melee damage? <br />
<br />
I really thought warriors were supposed to be masters of combat, not masters at getting our asses kicked...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they let us deal damage as well as we take damage, all the classes that can only do one or the other would cry.  SoE cant make the other classes cry, that would be mean.  <br />
But seriously folks, when I signed up for this gig in 1999, I had no idea that my sole purpose in life would be to do piss poor damage and struggle vainly to keep something's attention while some guy in a dress killed it with spells.  We have ZERO utility; it's time to make us truly the masters of melee combat, not just second rate meatshields.</div></div><hr />
