<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am a casual player that has recently returned to the game.  Been concentrating on levels(should be 65 tonight or tomorrow) and patching up my gear.   My Magelo shows where I am in terms of gear today :(<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my friends and I are not in a guild, probably never will be so getting any upgrades that involves more than 1-2 groups is out of the question.  My current plans are to upgrade some armor pieces with either Malevolent or Royal Attendents.  I fell im pretty set on weapons and doubt Ill be getting any upgrades for a long time. After buying armor ill work on adding proc augs to my weapons.<br />
<br />
Ornate is just not attainable atm since im just not in the position to reliable camp for the mold drops.<br />
<br />
My question is are there any other single-group attainable upgrades that I should consider?  <br />
<br />
As for buyable upgrades, if it costs more than 50k (FYI something that cost 50k on my sever = 15-20k on most others) then i will most likley never get it since 50k is the most money ive ever had in my 4+ years of playing.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

If you were Tribunal or Rallos Zek I'd recommend heraldic armor as an upgrade to some of the myrmidon pieces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN for the casual player needing upgrades is like a dream come true Especially in your case for an agnostic warrior who can't wear trib or rz cultural to begin with.<br />
<br />
straight out it buries anything pretty much out of Velious. Even a bit of Luclin ( sub-VT ) and it doesn't require the sheer amount of time getting flagged in PoP.</div></div><hr />

You shouldn't have any trouble camping ME in BoT for Bracer Molds.<br />
<br />
Your geared plenty well to tank BoT.</div></div><hr />

Why can't you hit BoT for Ornate Gaylon?  Like specifically what's stopping you from reliably camping it  <br />
<br />
Mostly because alot of my grouping friends are still 61-62 and until 2 days ago so was I :)<br />
<br />
Ive had horrible luck with pickup groups.<br />
<br />
On my server on any given night BoT has 60+ people in it so competition is pretty tough.<br />
<br />
Perhaps once we all get 65 we can feel better about going there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitly work on LDoN. Since you say you are casual, the Miraguls armor is half the price of the Tak armor, and quite close in stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say once you get everyone to 62 either do BoT or HoH.  The xp is much better there than in LDoN and you'll get to 65 a lot faster.  Once you get 65 and some AA's then you can breeze through LDoN normal missions for faster points and work up to the hard missions to get the good drops (and fast points.)  Also, some of those LDoN drops sell for good plat - which could give you the plat for ornate (if you still need the upgrades at that point.)<br />
<br />
Although LDoN gives some reward right away with the points, I think you'd be better off concentrating on getting 65 first and the first batch of AA's, then going back to LDoN.  (but it's a game...do what's fun for you :p )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Veksar also has some decent pieces of loot that are 1 groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LastLizard</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you get your friends to play on a regular basis, there are a few targets outside of BoT that you can hit for upgrades with a group or two of lvl 60+ (the closer to 65, the better).<br />
If you are really casual, hanging out in BoT for the next few month will drive you or your friends out of this game very fast .. sooo boring and repetitive and the drop rates sucketh mightiely.<br />
<br />
HoT is still nice when you can kill the named mobs and The Cursed for tears and symbols. Will also get you nice SS intermediate upgrades.<br />
Quests themselves take forever .. still need a serrated symbol or something to complete ONE and I spent a lot of time there.<br />
<br />
Spirit wracked cord are a nice set of quests, but pretty long.<br />
<br />
Griegs offers some nice caster upgrades from relatively easy mobs (all except grieg 1 groupable).<br />
<br />
Earring of Veracity quest - up to number four or five i guess - isn't that bad.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule has some nice rings and stuff, if you can handle them - should be 1-2 groupable at lvl 65, but haven't tried them for a long time.<br />
<br />
You can always take a look at allakhazam and go through the zones to see where you can get possible upgrades (and sometimes you'll even find decent info about the difficulty of the mob).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lochr</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While not the same quality as the point-purchased armor, some of the drops in level 65 dungeons are decent. Steelslave Bladed Boots drop in EC, cost about 4K on Sol Ro if you don't want to camp them. <br />
<br />
I assume you want the mask for the effect. If you don't mind switching it out, there's a mask (Mask of Flourishing Fungus?) that drops in level 65 South Ro (Guk) missions. About 2 or 3K on Sol Ro. While rare, a FrightForged Mask from Cazic Thule offers more hitpoints, and more AC, then what you have, without the resists. I've seen them go for 1K, but they definitely are not common. A Kylong Darkmail Visor (5K) would also be an upgrade. It's from Veksar, and be easily obtained by 1 group. <br />
<br />
Kylong Shinguards might be slightly better for the leg slot. Kind of depends if you get Stamina buffage from shamans regularly or not.<br />
<br />
If you don't use a bow to pull, a Bloody Ancille's Pouch from level 65 BB missions offers a lot of hitpoints for the Range slot. About 3K. Other affordable upgrades include the oldie but goodie Idol of the Thorn (1K) and a Broken Hynid Claw (also about 1K). Both give fewer hitpoints then the Pouch, but more AC. In most indoor dungeons, and all LDoN dungeons, you don't need a bow. Incite or proximity pulling work just dandy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the range slot, if you can get a wiz to port you, doing the Marsinger gem quests in Hate eventually results in a very nice range slot item.  It takes a long time to get the drops, but Hate is a good xp zone so you can rack up the AA's while hunting for the drops (xp is a little better than BoT.)   There are 4 levels of the gem.  The first 3 levels are class specific and the 4th is the same for everyone (casters normally stop at the 3rd one.)<br />
<br />
Here are the stats for the 4th/final gem:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have 2 decent groups of friends, drop down into the Hole and do Guardian of the Seal.  He drops 2 pieces of gear every time.  His common drops are a VERY nice earring, and a caster-hybrid-ish pair of shoulders.  His other 2 drops are caster FT gloves, and an all-all ring.  You'd be interested in the earring and the ring for yourself.  Purified steel earring, and simple pure gold ring.  Read through the Battlefield section here for tips on Guardian, and then go to town.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a problem with the Range quests from PoHate, Im up to the second one, and the third's only drop, drops off Inny or very rarely, off some of the minis, which would leave out a classic 1 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id say with lvls and AA's that you guys should be fine.  Im not sure about the classes of your group, but with a few pick up folks you can lvl in PoV in no time.  Once everyone is 62, try out BoT.  Most camps are 1 groupable and named ones arent too hard once you get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
Ornate drops fairly well, just give the bracer molds to the clerics.  With a few FT (+mana regen now) items you can max out AA's and lvls and gear in BoT.  That or get flagged for HoH, or PoTactics.  GL and grats on the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time to sorta hijack my own thread :)<br />
<br />
Finally made 65 last night....only took 4.5 years :)<br />
<br />
Now that I have the BoC I am unsure as too what weapon configuration to use?   Currently I have BoC, Bloodsworn and CHoS.  So far ive been using BoC/CHoS.<br />
<br />
Im not sure about the classes of your group<br />
<br />
We normally consist of:<br />
<br />
65 Warrior (ME)<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
64 Druid <br />
64 Paladin<br />
63 Rogue<br />
<br />
We pick up whoever we can for the 6th slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend mainhand BoC, offhand CHoS and sell the SotB. Better proc and almost identical ratios give the CHoS a slight edge IMO.<br />
<br />
You have a pretty good base for your group. I would recommend adding a cleric for the 6th slot if you can. Once you have all gotten 65 and started working on AAs here is what I would do:<br />
<br />
1. Experience in Veksar while your buddies get to 65. There are oogd drops for all classes there. Move to BoT when you are all 65 and have gotten the Veksar items you want. There are many camps that drop decent items and ornate. AA should come pretty fast here.<br />
<br />
2. Learn to do LDoN hards. Once your rogue gets SoS, he can scout a dungeon and see if there are any named mobs up. Get over your win/loss record and just do adventures with easy to get to named. Once you get an instanced with easy to get to named, complete that for the points. There are several VERY good drops in LDoN hard dungeons.<br />
<br />
3. Start working on GoD trials 1-4. Again, there are many named that drop some very nice loot in those trials. When you have beaten trial 1-4, move in to trial 5-6. Those trials are considerably harder and you will likely have a hard time winning, but with a charmed chanter pet, you can go in specifically to farm the named.<br />
<br />
Good luck, there is a ton of single group content that will get you and your friends gear up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peorth12</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also agree that LDoN is the way to go.  I'd do LDoN till u can't stand it...then do it somomore! :p   A full suit of of Royal Attendant will take a long time...but it really is some nice stuff.  Plus, pretty decent money can be made even from the LDoN normals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest a combination approach once you get to 65.  I'd do BoT/HoH (or even better if you have a wiz to port you, Plane of Hate since it's less crowded) until you get the first 30 to 40 AA's.  By that point you will be able to breeze through LDoN.  If you go straight to LDoN you may find it difficult at first - which translates into a lot more time to get the AA's and drops.  For me, normal LDoN mobs became trivial around 60 AA's - but it all depends on your gear, supporting cast, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, in normal mode, AA's are very slow in LDoN.  It usually takes me 3 normal adventures to get an AA.  Considering the startup time involved and the fact that we can only do 1 a night on weekdays, planes xp is dramatically better than LDoN.</div></div><hr />
