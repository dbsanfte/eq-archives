<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many Warriors and Knights alike have commented on automatic trial version assignment as a system that gives Knight kiddie versions of the trials.<br />
<br />
I believe LDoN Hard gives us a hint that Hard does not have to mean a high DI boss mob needing a Cleric and a Warrior to kill.<br />
<br />
So, suggest trials that would have different group staffing requirements and still test group readiness. I'm going to cheat and start with those in LDoN with some modification.<br />
<br />
Assassinate - high DI mob. Always appears in the same place. While getting to the mob can be challanging, it's not a major part of the test.<br />
<br />
Capture the Flag - tracking, navigation, and the ability to avoid unnecessary combat while dealing with combat that can't be avoided is the challange of this trial. Scouting, tracking, invis, and analytical ability gets you through this trial. The flag mob wanders.<br />
<br />
Slaughter - wanderers and fast re-pops makes add control the challange. Add-type tanking is an asset. Some mobs are rootable and mezable/some are not. Good decision skills are key.<br />
<br />
Smackdown - 5ish high damage output/low HP mobs  must be found and destroyed. Since they have low hit points the ability to unload damage quickly as well as to find and reach these mobs insures success. Low HP nuisence mobs complcate things by being a drain on mana.<br />
<br />
Just some ideas. I'm curious that if such trials were devised, could they be a valid test of readiness, allow all classes to participate in trials, and provide some variety that tank your way to the high DI boss mob does't provide.<br />
<br />
The Sewers trials suggested that this was the way things were going to be in the trials beyond, but it hasn't been. Frankly since everyone may have to pass every trial, a choice of trials is needed for each or more variety and an open slot for those that don't provide much value for a given trial.<br />

<br />
I'm fairly certain that budgetary and time constraints aren't going to allow the creation of group makeup specific encounters in an expansion already paid for to cover the wide variety of group makeup types.    It simply makes no sense from an economical perspective.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, LDoN hard wasn't hard, the mobs just were higher level and hit harder.   There was little no no variance other than what constituted a win, it was chosen rather than created by group makeup, and frankly, it got boring REAL fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrmm I'm not so sure Frod.  There are alot more folks who don't own GoD than previous expansions (every darn night I find people I know who don't own it yet).  <br />
<br />
There may be an economic argument to be made to modify the product to make it more appealing (not to mention the re-use of the functionality in subsequent releases) for those who own the rest of EQ havent bought GoD yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Frodlin,<br />
<br />
I'm not strictly speaking about GoD here. Although I think it's better to repair content than to heve every class be given 255 Archery and the True Shot discipline because the boss mobs were cleverly designed to require it.<br />
<br />
I you think back of one of the common threads of the GoD discussions, it's that the Tipt and Ikkinz trials seem to be focused on Cleric healing and Warrior MTing. Classes are different and should remain so, For that to happen, SoE needs to be taken to task for not realizing that hard != high DI boss mob only.<br />
<br />
SoE has realized this in the past, players know it, and here's a thread where players can &quot;propose&quot; that SoE does it and here are some examples of how it could be done in the future.<br />
<br />
Yep, LDoN gets boring - but so do the trials.<br />
<br />
Blue sky discussions aren't out of order IMO.<br />
<br />
On one level Flair is right. It's a lot cheaper to repair just released content that all classes are unhappy with then to see your subscriber population plummet. It's kinda tough to raid GoD when 4 Clerics, 2 Warriors, and 28 others log on for a scheduled weekend raid. That's the kind of impact the trials, GoD raids, outright broken or unfinished content, and the DX9 fiasco is having on some guilds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sewers had good variety indeed.  Some mobs run, some mobs do not.  Some mobs are unstunnable, some are not.  And look at how many people are in Barindu compare to any of the 5 other Wayfarer Camp zones?<br />
<br />
People will simply pick the easiest kind, like how LDoN is invariably slaughter/collect.  Different but equally challenging simply does not work.  Something has to be easier and that's the one people will end up flocking to, ala LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN would have been better without the time limit... could have added more variety to the content then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I'd prefer it if charm was removed from Tipt heh.  Not from Vxed though, that one is just annoying due to length of time it takes, and charm can help decently with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats what happens when an expansion is written for the small number of players in Time equiped guilds. I warned my guild, GoD had no content for them, so 100+ sales of an expansion written for the &quot;I am bored&quot; crowd, was averted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I regret having even purchased GoD, for me it's a completely worthless expansion.  I tried taking one of my alts over to the initial zone where the spell vendor supposedly is, and the magus wouldn't even respond to my alt.  I assume it's because I haven't done the LDoN initial quests with that character.  If so, I think that's a pretty ignorant, requiring people to run quests for expansion A before they can use expansion B.<br />
<br />
I spent the money for two expansions, one for each of my computers, and also because of their DX9 upgrades I had to purchase a new video card for one box, even though the video card it was using was supposed to have been supported and wasn't even a year old (ATI Radeon, video drivers kept going screwy on it).  Needless to say I'm not well pleased at this point.<br />
<br />
I'm an extremely casual player at this time and one more expansion like this will make me so casual I'll probably cancel both my accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GoD was the biggest waste of money on an expansion ive yet to spend.  Natimbi is the most i will EVER see in God.  LOL imagine if PoK was the most someone would have been abel to see when they got PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
But ive learned from this....SOE is never going to provide further content (i.e expansions) for the Avg/Casual player they only care about the tiny % at the top so ill save my pennies next time (if there is a next time).<br />
<br />
The only thing GoD has given me is being entertained at all the Pallys getting owned :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true.  The low end of the spectrum for reasonable GoD content is VT guilds.  VT guilds should be more than cabable of handling Barindu named, some Ferubi named, sewers, and Vxed/Tipt at the very least.  Some of the noninstanced content may require two groups instead of one, but its still accessable to them.  If you go look at the Illia's Bestiary entry for Pixxt Annihilator (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14543) there is a post about him being killed by a VT geared group.  Ikkinz with VT gear definately shows some balls, but it proves that even KT isn't beyond VT geared people.</div></div><hr />

You mean like Legacy of Ykesha?  You mean like Lost Dungeons Of Norrath?  The fact that 2 of the last 3 expansions WERE for the 'Avg/Casual player'?</div></div><hr />

I think I understand where you're coming from.  You're a high end raider and felt that LoY and LDoN offered you nothing of interest.  But you could, if you so desired, go to either of those expansions and play and you would have been successful.  The fact that you choose not to was your personal choice.  However, in GoD it has very little to do with personal choice.  Very quickly if you're not properly geared you can't play in the expansion and be successful.  So while you may have felt that LoY and LDoN were a waste of your money because they offered you no place you &quot;wanted&quot; to play, I see GoD as a waste of my money because there really isn't any place I &quot;can&quot; play.  There is a significant difference between self exclusion by choice and just not being granted the ability to participate.  <br />
<br />
Of course, you'll probably argue that I choose not to be able to participate in GoD because I didn't invest the countless hours in a raiding guild necessary to gather appropriate gear.  But many people don't really see that as a viable choice when all is said and done.  Many of us have jobs and don't really want our hobby to become close to a full time second job with similar obligations and responsibilties.  And we certainly don't see any reason to continue to buy expansions that are obviously designed soley for those who are willing to do that and don't offer us anything of value or even allow us the option to play there.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with raiding guild content.  I think every expansion should contain some.  I just object to paying for expansions that contain raiding guild content to the exclusion of almost all other content.  Up to this point I've bought every expansion that has come down the pike.  Next time, that probably won't happen.  And the next hardware upgrade I have to do for either one of my computers, both of which have been upgraded several times in the last 24 months solely to allow me to play EQ, for an expansion will also probably mean the end of the game for me.  I'm tired of having to make changes to perfectly good functional equipment every six months solely because a company can't design it's software to run properly on a wide variety of platforms.<br />
<br />
SoE is walking a very thin line between keeping their high end raiding clientele happy and pissing everyone else off.  And vice a versa.   I don't think they're going to be able to keep both groups happy much longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think they're going to be able to keep both groups happy much longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly this is very true.  With EQ2 and all the others coming down the pike the only way they can keep EQ1 living is by keeping those that find it hard to just quit hooked.  I doubt seriously that means the &quot;casual&quot; player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">People will simply pick the easiest kind, like how LDoN is invariably slaughter/collect.

<br />
I think the &quot;equally challenging&quot; part is the problem in LDoN.  People flock to the best risk/reward - not the easiest.  (otherwise they'd never enter PoP  ;) )<br />
<br />
Rescue missions (I've done a number of them) seem to be significantly harder because you have to clear the way before the target will follow you out - then you have to add in the time to get the target out once you've found them.  Assasinate is easier than rescue because you don't have to get out, but the downside is you have to fight a named mob with NO CHANCE of a drop.  Both of these missions also need trackers to find the named mob you are after.<br />
<br />
Contrast those 2 with collections and slaughter missions.  No tracker needed, just jump in and kill stuff till you are done.  If you get a named, you get a drop.  <br />
<br />
I generally only play collection and slaughter now because that's the best risk/reward (by far IMHO.)  If they changed the reward on the other 2, I'd play them for variety even though they are slightly harder.</div></div><hr />

I'll admit my perspective is easily skewed, but are you saying that with a good group and care the 4 Sewers and even Vxed wouldn't be a CHALLENGE to a group of Average players who have worked together in the past?  One which would give some significant upgrades?  (Particuarlly from Vxed?)  And if that's the case wouldn't Farming of Ferubi be possible as well giving Aug upgrades significantly better and cheaper then LDON?<br />
<br />
Assuming that an 'Average L65' group could have a CHALLENGE there, that would give: Natimbi, Qinimi, Ferubi, Riwwi, Sewer 1, Sewer 2, Sewer 3, Sewer 4, Vxed as places to go.  Perhaps Tipit perhaps not.  What would be lacking would be Kod'Taz, Ikkinz, Uqua, Qvic, Inkuta, Yxxta, Txevu that would not be unlocked.  Or to put it in PoP terms: HoHB, Plane of Water, Plane of Air, Plane of Fire, Plane of Earth, Plane of Earth B, Plane of Time.  7 of 20 zones in GoD that aren't for 'Average/Casual' 7 of 20 zones in PoP that aren't for Average  / Casual...<br />
<br />
Is the issue that GoD has nothing for you or that it does not have enough for you as PoP did?  (The last heavilly raid orientated zone.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can't really respond as to whether or not a group that has played together previously but were otherwise casual players could succeed at those encounters because 1) most of my friends have either left the game or have joined raiding guilds and so are very occupied most of the time and 2) I've not actually attempted them so can't comment directly.  All I know about GoD is what I've been told, and that amounts to basically that if you're not Elemental geared, don't expect to progress very far beyond the first couple of zones.  Not a real tantalizing incentive for me to go exploring, that's certainly true.  And most certainly not with a pickup group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's simply too hard to motivate the 'casual' players to try anything new.<br />
<br />
Look how little LDoN Hard gets utilized, even though if you are willing to get 5 friends and trash your hard record (which no one cares about unless you're actually in the top 100 where people can see it) you can pretty much come out with half a set of 80-100 hp/mana item eventually (grab an adventure, track for named, if none are close quit and try again).  Sewers is another example.  Before the nerf you could get a new instance in the time it takes your Tracker/whatever to determine that no named are close by.  While farming for spells I have seen at least 10 pitted vambraces rot just in one group.  That's enough to outfit a small family guild with 90 hp plate arms (or maybe 80, forgot their exact stats).  Even with the 5 minute lockout timer, it's still hard to beat Sewers where you can get a new dungeon every 5 minutes to until you get a named at a position where you can kill it fast.<br />
<br />
For the LDoN thing, the one biggest advantage of slaughter/collect is that barring extremely bad luck you don't have to kill more than about 60-70 mobs max to win.  The same cannot be said for an assassinate/rescue.  I've had rescue maps that you've to clear 100 mobs to get to where you're going.  Let's not forget it is still possible to go the wrong way, even with maps, and some people don't have maps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have a regular play group that does hard ldons on a regular basis and are having a lot of success with them.  We have attempted the sewer trial a couple of times and have yet to succeed or even run into a named.  We are able to progress as far as we have becuase we have been grouping together for 1-3 years and can anticipate what each other is doing.   We are not elementally or even VT geared.  I think we will succeed soon on the trial but its a few more tries away.<br />
<br />
Your average player is going to have problems doing the hard ldon not to mention GoD.  The RvR is not there for them not to mention that constant failure will eventually send them back to something easier.   The group dynamics required to succeed is not there which means alot of frustration for the group.  Which would you rather try:  something with a high chance of failure and reward is iffy or high chance of success which will reward you regardless?<br />
<br />
The bottom line is GoD is not for the average player and unless you have some good buddies that can help you along, it will get frustrating very fast.  Its also not as easy as many top end types make it out to be.</div></div><hr />
