<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jamylah</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently am using an Anathema that I won on an Inny raid (my first EB weapon, which I was very excited about) I had been saving up points for an Anger 3 aug in hopes of getting something worth aug'ing (I didn't want to have to aug my Droga weapons since I wasn't a big fan of them). So now I have an Anathema w/ an Anger 3 aug, and the aggro is 10x what the Droga weaps are (which I expected). I am currently in an EP guild, however I am a recent app, so I haven't gotten EP flagged yet. The GL has stated there is little chance of another RZ kill for a very long time, so getting a BoW will be rather difficult. Basically, I am wondering how much am I hurting not having a BoW since I do have an Anathema, aggro wise. I know the BoW has better DPS and stats, but how much difference would I notice from the BoW's DPS keeping aggro?</div></div><hr />

However, since RZ is a stingy bitch, I'm sort of in your position, using an Anathema with A3. While I really miss having a weapon with AC (dps and hp would be a bonus), aggro is a non issue, it works well enough.<br />
I guess it depends on your guild..I want to go for a BoW eventually, but other tanks need firm aggro more at this point so I chose to sit out for awhile in order to give the guild more overall strength.<br />
Looking over your magelo, I think you'd be better off getting elemental molds. You have solid aggro. You could use armor. Anathema is a fine weapon, regardless of the things I wish it had, and its kinda cool to run around with a rather rare item. It'll tide you over while you boost your ac/hp with Raex.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you get the chance, by all means..take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should serve you very nicely. I'd guess that it'd win out over droga weapons without much problem. Higher DPS and higher aggro per proc. If you have a chance for a BoW, go for it. You probably have the second best aggro 2 hander pre-time. I'm *guessing* it'd beat out a SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Anathema and have been very unhappy with the aggro i get from it. But i would imagine that it is an improvement to the droga stuff. If I use my BF and GBOS combo I almost never have to hit the taunt button while xping, but with the Anathema I loose aggro constantly. I can't comment on a BOW because I don't have one, but I would imagine it would be a very significant upgrade. I also doubt that Anathema is better aggro than a SEWS since I don't really see much difference between the Anathema and BBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting that you compare Anathema to a BBB. This gives the rest of us a reference point that we are more familiar with.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, Bow is great too have, I took a sews and slapped anger 3 on it. it works great i am in line to get a bow if one ever drops over a period of a 6 months of killing him...So the score so far is RZ 21 Slammer 0 ......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There certainly seem to be different level of rune aggro but it would be hard to quantify.  Rune aggro is definitely lower than any of the raw hate procs but it does have the nice perk of being AE aggro, although again not a heck of a lot of aggro.  They also can tie up a buffslot, which may or may not cause issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They also can tie up a buffslot, which may or may not cause issues = Yes it can when doing general Rapme in fire, you need heavy buffs i have seen rune take out my kazad or when fighting a DOT mob if rune is up it, then the dot or effect from the mob will overwrite one of my buff slot,However i dont run it to it alot but it does happen from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I estimate rune 3, from using my BBB, to be about 1:1 for shielding:hate. I know higher runes are not that way, but I'd say this particular one is. So about 230 hate or so. Rune 1 and 2 are insignificant in both protection and aggro, I'd wager.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BF/GBoS is hard to beat for aggro, especially if they have A3 augs.  That would definitely beat a BoW aggro-wise.  Dual wield is just much better for aggro since the A3 procs came out.  I use the BoW for the dps and stats, but there's no doubt in my mind that it is significantly less aggro than when I used Bloodfrenzy/BoC with augments.</div></div><hr />
