<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, Im sure you guys get tired of these kind of posts, but I need some advice from those more wise in the arts of warrioring.<br />
<br />
When it comes to being a warrior as far as I can tell its the ability to hold aggro and to save the cleric mana opposed to another class being hit.  I tend to be having troubles with both of these at level 53.  Here is my magelo profile from a couple days ago(was 52 then, but just dinged yeseterday)<br />
<br />

<br />
As far as aggro goes, Im wondering if this weapon combination I have is good.  I read these boards and awful lot and only just decided to post first time today.  But in all my experience, i hear frostys are the key.  I instead picked up this smithed ykesha sword just to be different, and mainhanding curved claws which i picked up for a steal in the bazaar(i spend a lot of time here it seems).   The proc seems to be really nice, but was wondering if anyone knew how they compared with a frosty?<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically what my options are for weapons(by using what i have or selling to get others) are Vengeful Honed Blade of the Ykesha. curved claws, snowchipper, frostbringer, spiked velium mallet, and other weapons in that ballpark.  The DPS doesnt matter to me so much as keeping aggro on me.  I tried the barnacle covered axe as was suggested and honestly....I was not impressed with its proc rate nor damage output to keep aggro on me for times it did not proc.  Ive been told 50 different stories by 50 different warriors on what is the &quot;best&quot; way of keeping aggro and many seem to even contradict each other.  Some said rely on procs, others said rely on dps, and the third group was those who say rely on how fast the weapon is.  One thing I was thinking about is that whip drop in Sebilis that procs snare?  I know those annoying rangers always steal aggro with it by snaring mobs at 95% health and all, perhaps it would help me?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My next problem is my armor and that Im totally getting torn up in the planes.  Perhaps I shouldnt even be hunting here but I keep getting drug out to die by my 51 cleric friend(who ive grouped with 99% of the time since I found him on orc hill in gfay at level 5) who keeps getting invited to join groups here.  We will be hunting with some 54 paladin tanking just fine, but when it comes time for poor lvl 53 Shmashed to take over duties, the group falls apart because Im getting lit up.  I was just wondering if there was any obvious holes in my equipment setup that relitively easy quests/purchases could solve?  I havent played EQ since pre Kunark so this is my main, and I dont have an unlimited supply of cash but ive done my fair share of farming pelts and spider silks.  I would say with a lot of work 15000 plat would be my budget.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and I was looking at fierce heraldric armor in the bazaar and just was wondering which pieces would you all suggest as long term and considerable upgrades to what I might aquire in the near future?  Have been doing a few raids in kael to work on armor, just have not been lucky yet.<br />
<br />
Lots of questions tend to make people not even bother replying, but I could really use the advice.  Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First suggestion would be to lose your earrings,and get either orc fang (very cheap, and ok stats) or the enchanter made earrings. Electum black sapphire I think they are...3 ac, 35 hp. I'd also suggest selling you mask and picking up crystal spider eyes, or a death mask of the elysians if you can afford it. I'd also sell your shadel bandit ring and get another 6/65 ring...not often I find that the resists outweight the better hp on the 6/65.<br />
<br />
For your weapons, I'd highly suggest selling your claws, and picking up a second Honed Ykesha blade if you can find one. I've hear they are excellent aggro weapons on par with the frostbringer. <br />
<br />
As for Fierce Heraldic....get ANY piece you can afford. I'd say bracers are the best buy, and will last you forever since there are *very* few upgrades to them until the elemental planes. After that, legs would be the best, then any other piece other than BP or hands. Although neither of those are to shabby and if you find a good price on them I would pick them up also.<br />
<br />
My best suggestion, is simply browse the bazaar. Put in a nice specific search (warrior useable, your race, etc) and then go through each slot....try and find cheap items with HP and sta and ac. With a few thousand PP, you should be able to upgrade your HP by at least 100, and possibly your ac as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Couple of thoughts on the subject.<br />
<br />
For weapons, ditch the claws and buy a Frostbringer.  That paired with your Yak should be great aggro, play with with to mainhand based on proc rates.  Never had a player made Yak but the Frosty ruled when I used it, the proc was great aggro and ratio is nice for DPS.<br />
<br />
As far as hunting in the planes, no offense, but you are going to get the crap kicked out of you as you have found.  Almost every mob there is higher level than you which means your taunt key is about useless and you will have to rely on procs for aggro.  That is why the Paladin shines, press stun button, viola, he has aggro.  If you insist (or your friend does) on going to the planes, go to POD and kill the small flies (tsetsi?) straight out from the zone or go to POJ (others can help you with suggestions there).  These mobs are the easiest POP mobs I have seen.  If you cannot handle these mobs, go to places like SEB or Velks, etc. and come back in a few levels.  For warriors, levels make a huge difference in tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off, those weapons *should* be fine, but when you hunt in the planes, you'll run across other melees with epics and weapons just as good as yours. Combine that with their spells/abilities/higher dps, it's hard to hold aggro. You basically have to either get weapons with good aggro procs, like the crafted ykesha or two and a frosty, or get a good 2hs/2hb and hope you don't miss too often in the beginning of the fight. Some weapons like this would be widebladed greatsword, reaver, stonebladed axe of dismay, etc. The axe is 44/44 75hp and costs less than 3k pp on most servers since it's warrior-only. It's what I've been using in groups since level 51, and while tanking in the lower level planes, I've rarely had aggro problems. You might want to look into getting something like it yourself and see if it works. I'll throw in a few armor upgrades as well.<br />
<br />
-Stat food/drink- Buy a stack or two of halas 10lb. meat pies and grobb liquidised meat, together those add a hefty 11 stamina and 30 hp, along with other stats.<br />
<br />
-Keep up the hunting in kael, hope for some plate drops.<br />
<br />
-Sell the kylong greaves, buy crusty. You'll take a small dex hit, but the +16 stamina is awesome. Only get these if you see them cheap and don't think you'll get thurg greaves any time soon though.<br />
<br />
-Try and grab Stout Plate Manacles in the bazaar, to replace your shaded wrist. The manacles are 14ac, 4 str, 3 dex, 5 wis, 30hp, and should run you under 1k pp.<br />
<br />
That's about it for cheap upgrades, some pricier ones would be:<br />
<br />
Earring of the solstice MQ (3.5-4k)<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace (2kish?)<br />
Valorium Ring(s) of Gallantry (6.5-7k each)<br />
Cloak of the Maelstrom (3k)<br />
Any fierce heraldic or SS MQ you can get.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use a vengeful honed blade of the ykesha in primary, frostbringer in secondary, and the aggro is overall very good, especially if you have a dexterity buff.  That's my recommendation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So you all suggest giving up a 11/18 for the 12/22 frostbringer?<br />
<br />
If itll help with taunting sure, ill give it a shot.  But the higher dps, lower delay, and more application of the mainhand damage bonus isnt worth keeping it?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the armor reccomendations, thanks.  Ive looked into them and picked a few of the cheaper pieces up.  Lost some ac, but gained a lot of hp.  Will see how it goes, thanks again and if anyone else has any advice to add thatd be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Frostbringer is a great lil taunter, so good in fact that back inthe day  when I got a fleshgrinder for offhand I ended up selling it and going back to the Frostbringer since it was way better for aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd certainly take the aggro from the proc over the extra dps of an 11/18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stommper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One equipment suggestion I can recommend from personal experience, get some<br />
