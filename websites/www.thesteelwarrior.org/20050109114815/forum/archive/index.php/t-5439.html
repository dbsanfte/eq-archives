<br />
Only most warriors don't have a 2HP.<br />
<br />
There aren't any 2HP with EB, or any real hate generating proc period for that matter.<br />
<br />
HP on 2HP seems to cap at about 150.<br />
<br />
Pal/SK have the same 2HS/2HB/2HP caps, while warriors actually lose some skill points in Piercing.  (only 10 but that's still a loss of relative skill).</div></div><hr />

We'll still be able to tank them.<br />
<br />
Emp is resistant to non bane weapons and people effectively tank him using EB weapons.<br />
<br />
And because your post is about balance, who says we have to tank everything? If certain mobs are more suited to an SK or Pally tank that seems balanced to me. If warriors are the only tank anyone wants to use then it's not balanced.</div></div><hr />

My point was- There's already a fragile class balance SoE was trying to fix, and now tossing things like this into the mix just make that much more unsteady.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enough of the game's 2hp are still warrior usable to not make this much of an issue.<br />
<br />
ALSO ... warriors have 1hand piercers available to them. Including one from LDoN which can be given quite a good hate proc.<br />
<br />
&quot;There aren't any 2HP with EB, or any real hate generating proc period for that matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vampire Hunter's Stake, with Anger 1 on it from LDoN mistmoore adventures.<br />
<br />
Narandi's Lance has a DoT proc.<br />
<br />
And you can PUT an anger proc on any piercer you can equip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pal/SK have the same 2HS/2HB/2HP caps, while warriors actually lose some skill points in Piercing. (only 10 but that's still a loss of relative skill).&quot;<br />
<br />
The misleading thing about what you're saying though, is you neglect the fact that warrior piercing cap is STILL higher than the knights' cap. So yeah, it's lower than your slashing cap. But higher than the knights. Soooooo ... where is there an issue?</div></div><hr />

Sure poor warriors #2-10 are gonna have to do subpar DPS for one encounter where they pull out their velium lances from the bazaar or whatever, but you dont bring warriors on raids for their amazing DPS anyway.<br />

Weapon resistances as a whole make melee less desirable for damage, and make casters more desirable for damage.<br />

I suggest you all wait till GoD comes out before making certain assumptions.</div></div><hr />

Been wanting a good excuse to try and convince my guild's raid organizers to go for Vulak ring.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a lot of these have +curse counters and unless there's a way you can cure mobs, those are not dispellable by any means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that works differently, at least as I understand it.<br />
<br />
pillage enchantment works on buffs that are flagged as beneficial.<br />
<br />
+curse counter buffs are normally flagged detrimental.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, unless they're pulling a fast one by having beneficial buffs typed as detrimental, and having the mob's AI buffing themselves with detrimental effects, pillage enchantment will work just fine.<br />
<br />
As a side note, toss me some links of all these mirror/reflect spells with curse counters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">+counters prevent a spell from being dispelled.  You cannot dispel say Turgur's Insects.  There's no reason why counters can only go on detrimental spells.  They just never made any sense to have a counter on beneficial spells for PCs (since you can cure those on accident).  Since NPCs very rarely cure themselves (and indeed most ubers are warriors which means they have no normal spells whatsoever) they will obviously never accidentally cure a buff.  <br />
<br />
For example take this spell:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4415&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
20% spell reflect, 99 disease counters.  Not every spell is like that, but this appears to be a trend.  It particular it seems like boss's self buffs now always comes with 99 of some counters (doesn't really matter how many or what type really since you cannot cure NPCs at all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Paladins and Shadowknights do have a lower piercing cap than warriors.  Knights have all their weapon skills cap at 225.  Warriors at 240 for Piercing, 250 for slash and blunt.<br />
<br />
However if there's already a DPS situation- Shadowknights outdamaging warriors, and an agro situation where warriors are finding the need to weild EB weapons with an additional agro proc on them via LDON augments, is forcing warriors to lower and/or skip their DPS,  and/or skip EB weapons really conducive to balance?  Tell ya what, next grind group you're in, use just a shield bash to do your damage.  How much fun is that for you?<br />
<br />
They just finished Melee rebalancing Part 1, and now before part 2 can go into effect, IF its going into effect, they're taking two steps back again.</div></div><hr />

They'll have the same skill cap.  The SK will probably lose some damage because 2HP suck compared to 2HS and 2HB, but that's matched by the warrior also switching to a 2HP, probably even one that's less efficient than the one the SK will be using.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah Kaesorn I would have preferred it expand beyond 2HP, and skill caps since that's the example I brought in, but people seem to be focused on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no problem with dual wielding a DoD + Knife of Justice if I don't need to tank on something that's immune to slash/blunt.  Obviously if I need to tank I'd still use my normal setup.  It's not rocket science.  Use weapons that mob is not immune to if you don't need aggro, and use weapons that get aggro when you need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">melee resistances would have far more of an impact on melee DPS roles than tank roles... You always need a tank, but when you go to GoD, for example, and are fillint out a group after healer + slower + tank, weapon resistances would make casters more desirable to do DPS.<br />
<br />
Course, it depends entirely on how widespread weapon resistances are... if it's only 1 mob in 100, it would have no real affect on balance. This is why I say, wait till GoD comes out before making certain assumptions.</div></div><hr />

Why shouldn't I be?  How many books do you remember reading where the main character swapped gear in and out?

<br />
As a warrior, you're supposed to be a master of all forms of combat, as well as strategy/tactics and field leadership.<br />
<br />
So having an arsenal at your disposal, it's sort of the point. EQ's not realistic at all, so you keep this arsenal in the magic pouch you carry with you, along with 7 other magic pouches, where you store the better part of your everquest life.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
A warrior would have access to a wide range of weapons. They just wouldn't be in his backpack.<br />
<br />
Remember crouching tiger hidden dragon? When Michelle Yeoh's character squared off against Zhang Zi Yi's? Yeah, she had an entire arsenal there in her training room.<br />
<br />
Go figure.<br />
<br />
If that were EQ, her training room would have been a Tink Bag.</div></div><hr />

What works real good against some armor types (piercers against chain mail) worked real bad against others (piercers against plate mail).

I carry around in my packs roughly 9 or so weapons...and I'm pretty sure a couple of other warriors around here carry alot more then that...But in anywhich case when you honestly come down to it, the absolute min you would have to carry is about 3 types of weapons ( pierce, blunt, slash) maybe at least 6 (if you count DW for each particular type) so complaining about that we have to carry more pieces of gear then inspector gadget is ...well, an overt exaggeration. <br />
<br />
I been running your original beef with this change over and over again in my head, which is that you have concerns that it might break something in class balancing. Maybe your right...rogues won't be able to backstab (or effectively backstab) mobs that are resistant to piercing, monks might have to switch to hand to hand instead of favored blunt weapons they might have had on mobs that are immune/resistant to blunt weapons...Our favored slash weapons with EBlow effect might not be so effective.<br />
<br />
But I don't really see how/why/wtf will this be a danger to class balancing. Sure, paladins/SKs will be able to hold agro without doing extensive damage to the mob...but they already can do that :P and previously mentioned is that many people effectively hold agro on mobs like the Ssra Emperor and Seru without bane weapons (most likely because they threatened to deguild anyone who gets agro :P j/k) I fail to see where the threat to class balancing is. Maybe your just pissed off now that you have to spend plat or DKP on a piercer, in which case, I symphatise, but that really shouldn't warrent a public rant. <br />
<br />
For me, on a personal note, if there are xp mobs that are resistant to a particular weapon type...I'm just glad I got most of my skills maxed out already and already have a good/semidecent weapon to suppliment them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only real complaint I can see is that if a mob only takes damage from piercing weapon, this puts Knights closer to Warrior because our piercing is 240 versus their 225, whereas everything else it is 250 vs 225.  <br />
<br />
But then Knights only have one good piercing weapon in the whole game, Crow Footed Lance from PoAir, and certainly dual wielding a Dagger of Distraction + one other good piercer (Ifir, Knife of Justice, Mephit Talon, etc) should still beat it easily.  And I don't actually know of any Knights with the Crow Footed Lance since it sucks so much compare to their other 2Handers.  Without that Knights will have very poor DPS versus blunt/slash immunes.  <br />
<br />
If a mob can be damaged by blunt or slash nothing effectively changes.  Slash immune, for one, would neutralize the advantage of the overpowered Greatblade of Chaos, since GoC is a bigger upgrade to Knight DPS than any comparable Time weapon for Warriors.  Blunt immune would probably be status quo since best war/Knight weapons tend to be slashing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, piercing was effective against plate and chain.  It was more slashing that plate put a stop to.  Blunt and Pierce were the methods of choice against plate- It doesn't matter what kind of armor you have, someone hits you in the head with a mace, and you're gonna get your bell rung.<br />
<br />
Who says that a mob that's resistant to blunt won't also be resistant to Hand to Hand?  Its more or less the same type of damage- <br />
<br />
Maybe they'll change Backstab to Critical Strike- ala DAOC- so it doesn't matter if its a piercer or a slasher, attacking from behind gives a shadowzer... I mean a rogue an advantage.<br />
<br />
My main problem with the stuff they're trying to add in GoD is around three fold.<br />
<br />
- They just put in half the &quot;melee fix&quot;, haven't said a word about it in a while, except that what they were going to do isn't going to happen as it was designed, AND they're trying to add this stuff without waiting for the dust to settle and see what effect the Fix Part 1 had.<br />
<br />
- Warriors are still not in the same tank class that paladins and Shadowknights are, and they're trying to make it worse- sure 250 to 240 isn't much of a nerf, but when you're already behind every little bit counts.<br />
<br />
-  We're supposed to be friggin heros, Not geared up like Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood in Line of Fire.  We're in a MMORPG here.  Sure they killed off most of the RP part when they flat out suggested suiciding to get more food and water as a newb, but I want, and expect to role play a fantasy hero, not sim my way through a dark ages joust.  Noone has yet come up with a fantasy hero that carried 4 times the number of weapons than he had hands.  There isn't a fantasy hero yet that told the big mean Dragon &quot;Could you hold on a minute, I have to get into my anti-fire armor....&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, in regards to the resistances in general, and specifically mobs that are immune to blunts AND hant to hand ... I find that unlikely ... and HOPE that it doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
If they did something like that, monks and beastlords basically would not be able to attack the monster. At all. Ever. I HOPE they'd never cut off entire classes from fights completely. It'd be a bad design choice.<br />
<br />
So far, I've yet to hear of anything of that sort. In fact, all of this speculation is based off on ONE mob, rumored to be like this from the beta.<br />
<br />
Regarding the lack of updates on melees ... they have been posting tidbits here and there. Read Monkly Biz for instance. They've posted a couple of things there. I don't think warriors have heard much because so far, incite and the mitigation change seems to have gone over very well. What else was there that warriors wanted? Aggro boost, DPS boost from unlinked discs, mitigation change ... that sort of covers the big stuff don't it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Before you go any further with the whole line of reasoning about having to carry a whole armory around with you or having to say &quot;Hold a sec, Mr. Dragon, let me get my asbestos armor on,&quot; answer me just one question:<br />
<br />
How many bags do you have equipped on your character? If you have more than 3 ... well ... don't you find that a tad unrealistic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game is not based on reality, fortunately...since this game is built on code with little rhyme or reason to how things work, there really can be a significant difference between H2H and blunt if the developers code it to be that way.  If you want it to really be that really specific, then Iksar and Vah Shir H2H needs to be changed to either piercing or slashing-type.  I mean really...we got those claws on our hands for a reason.:D <br />
<br />
Honestly I see this idea could have a great deal of promise for creatively making mobs difficult, if used correctly.  Of course then again, I always thought the idea of how the Rathe fight premise worked (12 guys, 6 unmezzable, had to be all taken down within a certain time limit) was an insanely clever one...it's only the implementation that would suck in this case.<br />
<br />
Mobs have had resistances to 5 types of magic-based damage/debuffs/etc since the beginning of the game (AFAIK).  Some mobs you simply shouldn't use magic-based spells on because the resistance is high even with debuffs...so you use poison or fire or cold even...you adjust your damage setup dependant on what you're fighting.  Within this setup, it is entirely plausible to have certain mobs more resistant to certain types of damage (blunt, piercing, slash or h2h) and easier to damage with the other types.<br />
<br />
I find no problem with this, as many people have at least 2 different types of weapons (not talking 2hander/1hander here).  The only thing that would seriously SUCK would be if you had to change your weapon every mob.<br />
<br />
The best way this could work would be:<br />
<br />
1. Make it very obvious, as you start attacking, if the mob is resistant.  (such as...blunt weapons will barely hit over 20-30, whereas slashing and piercing hit for normal)  Rogues should have BS be special, or have a method of making their BSs hit for close to normal even on piercing resistant mobs...maybe even at the cost of endurance.<br />
<br />
2. Be consistant on models/resistances.  If a mob with a certain model (boss mobs are in their own category there), then most mobs with that model should have the same resistances.<br />
<br />
3. Varying amounts of resistance, mostly on trash/exp mobs, would be great to prevent the need to switch out weapons on each mob if this carries over to exp mobs.  If a mob is resistant to blunt and you're dualwielding a blunt and slash, you might go ahead and let it go because this trash mob really isn't mitigating a ton of damage, just a part of your blunt damage.  The people who are all about &quot;efficiency&quot; might switch out, but others might just let the damage go.<br />
<br />
All in all, it opens up some very interesting setups, IMO.  But you know there will always be complaints.  Anyways, like it's been said several times in this thread...this is only a little bit of information about raid mobs, we don't know how things will end up, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think your being either delusional or overtly paranoid. The rest of your post aside, I'd like to address your three 'problems' with the GoD expansion. Firstly, I am under the impression that melee fixes had nothing to do with expansions, since requiring to pay for class balancing would just sink half the playerbase right there and then. While I DO agree with you that maybe they adding too much stuff before fixing whatever class balance 'problems' THIS, as far as I can see is not one of them, if your worried about the class 'balance' being upset, you would have a better argument attacking Beserkers. <br />
<br />
Warriors will never be the same tank class as paladins or shadowknights, Why? Because we are pure melee classes and they are hybrids. Because they have access to spells that we now somewhat match with new disciplines, True, any well geared knights are competiton for any warrior, BUT I fail to see any advantage whatsoever given to paladins or shadowknights by limiting our weapon choices to piercing. <br />
a, because alot of knight/sk specialist weapons are slashing/blunt <br />
b, we have most of the time the same selection of piercing weapons as any godblasted paladin/shadowknight<br />
c, Paladins/SK still have a piercing weapons cap that is 15 points under ours and no matter what they do, it will still be 15 points under. Their overrall DPS will still be lower on the mob who happened to have resistant to slashers and smashers. WHAT exactly is the disadvantage we lose? They can hold agro better? Hangonnow, THEY CAN ALREADY DO THAT...besides, there's a series of parses somewhere that says agro isn't even dependent on DPS. <br />
<br />
The last thing I want to address is your point number 3. If you want and expect to play the role of a fantasy hero, by all means, go ahead, no one is stopping you, heck I myself enjoy a bit of roleplaying on my own time. However, I think you are being silly to expect that making mobs resistant to certain types of weapon would completely ruin your illusions of this game being 'realistic' because now instead of running around bashing mobs with one weapon, you now have to carry a variety of weapons to which you must choose to bash mobs with. I ask you now, why are you still playing the game when you first realize you can carry 8 backpacks at one time? If you can carry 8 backpacks around, then by logic lugging around a couple more weapons wouldn't be too hard, would it? Heck without backpacks you still can carry 8 more weapons in addition to your primary, secondary and range slots. I will repeat myself, You are being silly. <br />
There isn't a fantasy hero yet that told the big mean Dragon &quot;Could you hold on a minute, I have to get into my anti-fire armor....&quot;. <br />
<br />
I did, once...forgot to equip resist gear while we were doing HoT :P Told one of the AE wurms to stop aeing while I get on VBDs on but it didn't really listen to me...</div></div><hr />

Melee resistances are on more mobs than just that one named.<br />
<br />
There are mobs in some zones that a fully AA'd ranger can't hit for any more than 1-14 damage on with an arrow, mobs that won't take more than minimum damage per hit with slashing weapons, and the like.<br />
<br />
It doesn't SEEM to be extremely widespread, but I had neither the time, inclination, or opportunity to do widespread testing in multiple zones with multiple weapons on multiple mobs, I was only in about 4 zones in <br />
<br />
I would expect to see it very commonly in the higher level/more difficult areas.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 'bane damage spell' you're looking for is actually known as spell reflect, which is starting to get used more and more.  Actually, it's worse than being resistant/immune to certain weapons because you can't even get rid of spell reflect, assuming when they tune the encounter they didn't forget to slap some counters on the spell reflect.  I saw some spells with spellshield effects too.  Be glad that we don't get slapped with a blanket anti-damage ability (which would be mega AC on all mobs) and there exist ways to get around those immunity.<br />
<br />
As for piercing, it is quite a viable method of damage.  Yes you lose 10 points of cap, so that's like 30-40 attack there and probably some accuracy hit too, but it's certainly workable.  I mean if 240 isn't viable how in the world are the Knights gettinng too close to our DPS with 225 in weapon skills?  If you're at time level, picking up a DoD should be easy.  Getting a second piercer might take some effort but it's certainly easier than getting a good piercer for a Knight seeing their piercer comes from Plane of Air, which is a zone no one seems to like at all.</div></div><hr />

If you know which bag holds all your gear, and have a handy UI avaliable or heck, even with your hotbutton pad set appropriately, switching spells is NOT easier then switching weapons. <br />

True, switching spells is easier now you don't have to tear through your spellbook to mem the appropraite spell, but a warrior can switch from DW piercing to DW blunt if he knows his setup, in less then half a second.</div></div><hr />

I do in fact know TONS about writing code, I have a friend involved with WoW and anything to do with AD&amp;D that does code work and testing. You defending the morons making bad decisions is what is pathetic. They knew there was problems with kiting issues (and I can pull the posts to prove it), released EQ anyway. Deciding class A will be allowed to solo but class B not, another horrid decision. Ever play Diablo 2? My barbarian does not run around fruitlessly trying to taunt off mobs off casters. Yep, there was problems with that game, with the same old decisions to make casters more powerful than melee. Heres a clue for game developers, instead of working on spells first, work MELEE out first and add spells as addition to melee not the other way around!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradin</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spatha was a cutting weapon based on the swords of the Spainards if was often blunt in the point.   The gladius was the Roman thrusting sword.    I don't care if that guy wrote Conan or the Bible, Hiemdall, he didn't know his swords.  But then authors didn't do much research in the 1930s.  Howard has many booboos in his books I still love this gritty style.  Hyperborea has a plethora of various cultural levels.  This simply doesn't happen in real life unless the cultures are seperated or isolated.  When two cultures clash of varying cultural levels inevitably they had conflicts.   One culture will impose their will on another and the side with the superior weapons has a huge edge.  Often, even the authors we worship have flaws.<br />
<br />
On GoD, I think some warriors have good reputations some bad prior to the expansion.  This is earned through skilled play.   I wouldn't expect am expansion to bail me out for my play.   Either you got a network developed for groups or you don't.  True, our class if far from perfect.  I think we suffer most as we are the class that all others are based upon!  Even the mobs share many traits with us.   Hence,  I don't think there will be a melee revamp of a massive scale.  <br />
<br />
The recent changes did in fact help me and improved my game.   However,  I was a lucky warrior as I always get a group fast as I have endeavored to make friends.   I can't think that any warrior would say they made us worst.  Would have been nice to see old items get END not that I run out anyways.   But face it, the fact is this was not a priority does not bode well for it being a integral part of our future.  Can anyone say backburner?<br />

Her act 2 merc also has more life than you're ever going to get and certainly more defense, and also she doesn't lose XP when her merc dies.  But don't let reality get in the way there, right?<br />
<br />
Or how about when Diablo 2 was first released and Whirlwind was utterly broken that somehow eluded beta testing?  Oh yeah Blizzard actually didn't bother beta testing multiplayer on nightmare or hell mode, which is why they didn't catch Whirlwind being broken.<br />
<br />
All Blizzard games are riddled with horrible design &amp; balance decisions, but guess what, they're smart enough to know that while someone will always be whining on BNet why their class or race is imbalanced, as long as the game is fun no one is really going to care besides whining somewhere on a board.  Actually I'm sure that's the same strategy SoE adapts.  A game can be fun at the expense of balance.

Classes weren't remotely balanced.  I would join a game and half of the players would be Sorceresses.  You think that's a coincidence?<br />

But it's still a fun game, so people continued playing even though it's not remotely balanced, and in the end that's all that really matters.  While EQ you don't have the flexibility of just restarting a character from scratch like Diablo, the same principle still applys.  BTW, I think the Sorceress can live knowing that she can't kill Uber Diablo by herself.  Only Paladin and Barbarian can anyway since to solo him you need to be a melee with magic attack or a way to lower his resistance.</div></div><hr />

I chuckle at attempts to cast on me... all I ever do is resist every damn thing.</div></div><hr />

They'll just keep on cast and then run away if you actually get them low.  You pretty much need a Ton Po's Mythical Pouch to finish off any fleeing caster, at least in the Bazaar Arena.</div></div><hr />
