<br />
proc on strikethrough miss<br />
proc on riposted attack<br />
proc on hitEven if both mainhand and offhand attacked in the same 1 second interval, there are 3 procs which would mean that no matter how you dissect it, there had to be a minimum 2 procs in a single round from one weapon.<br />

<br />
Notice that the Orange proc is &quot;contorts with anger&quot; while the other 2 are &quot;contorts with rage&quot; which would signify that we have a minimum of 2 different procs going off as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Little more infoz - after tracking down a magelo for Igneous I was able to find out that he dual weilds DBotW with an EoE. Both weapons have A3 augments on them. We know for sure that at least one of the procs come from the darkblade. The only scenario in which this log would represent procs in seperate rounds of melee would be:<br />
<br />
1. he had a bard in group playing overhaste to get the EoE delay under 1 second so that 2 rounds of attacks show up in the same second time stamp of the log<br />
2. his offhand successfully dual weilded on consecutive rounds of melee<br />
3. his offhand successfully proc'd the augment in consecutive rounds of melee<br />
4. his offhand did not double attack on either round of melee<br />
<br />
My guess is that what we are looking at is actually a successful triple attack with procs on each attack.<br />
<br />
*** Forget about the 100pt thing, I forgot Anger also has a DD component.</div></div><hr />

Group makeup had no bard, I believe it was Clr, Mag, War, Bst, Wiz, Mag.<br />
Good grind dps  :)<br />
<br />
Edit: the only real way I see it that this is separate rounds procs are still that previous and next round of the EoE somehow made it into the same timestamp, hastecapped EoE being exactly 1 second in delay. I'll find some more in that log, it's a 50-something hour long session total of grind only. There's bound to be more there, it just makes my eyes bleed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IgneousKB</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I did it. I went through that 53 hour log by hand, because I wanted to know, I did not like what I found, but it was what I found nevertheless.<br />
<br />
Total, in the entire log, I found six (6) occurances like the one above, with 3 procs in the same timestamp.<br />
Number of occurrances with 2 procs in same timestamp were 273.<br />
<br />
Never did Anger proc twice in a round. (Nor 3 times for that matter.)<br />
Never did Time Snap proc twice in a round.<br />
All 6 occurences of 3 procs per round was Anger or Time Snap + 2x Anger3.<br />
And given no bard haste, I would contribute the 3rd proc on all cases to EoE delay of 10 exactly being squeezed into same timestamp by server delay or whatnot.<br />
<br />
The largely annoying fact lies in that had I had a piercer or blunt in offhand, maybe I could draw some conclusions from the large amount of double procs in a time stamp, but I cannot do that with two slashing.<br />
So if anyone out there has a really long parse with two different type weapons to compare with, could use some help.<br />
<br />
On a related but different note I found these kinds of procs:<br />

No hard evidence of procs per swing (as opposed to procs per weapon round) (and maybe mainly due that I cannot distinguish primary from secondary) but in total 19 cases of 2 procs per swing?<br />

Someone else on your raid, or group, had an enraging blow weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at that, the top proc (in Orange) could not have come from you.  If it had come from you, it would have come directly before one of your swings (either a hit or a miss).  It really looks like somebody else must have procced on him (either Jobarn, which is unlikely, or someone your log didn't pick up due to filtering).<br />
<br />
I've never seen rounds of melee be THAT intersperced (a proc effect having two other people's actions between it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's even more fun than that: I'll have to dig up the weapon setup and do some parsing, but you do not need to actually -swing- the weapon to proc it. Only the potential for the swing needs to exist. The upshot is, if you fail your dualwield check, you can still proc your offhand! Or at least, so I remember from when my ranger was little and was using a blunt, proccing weapon off hand, and a slashing, non-proccing weapon mainhand - I got lots of procs with no associated 'you try to crush'. I'll dig up a character with lower dw and parse it out this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wha?? I thought you had to at least swing to proc. I'll equip a lantern in my main hand and see if I proc with my offhand with hits and misses on. If a proc shows up and no swings were made then that will be...strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure you can proc anytime if your auto attack is turned on. I have had mobs be out of melee range, yet still get a proc in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was a much, much younger warrior I used to occasionally do run by killings on random goblins and orc pawns and such while running to dungeons.  It was not all that uncommon for one of my ssoy's to proc and the dd kill the mob before I ever swung the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His log supports it as well, now that I consider it: We have here a proc clearly detached from other sources of melee. The immediate impulse is to search for a second Anger/Enraging Blow proc. However, consider the following: <br />
<br />
1: This is an exp grind, and he is the only warrior. <br />
<br />
2: Only warriors may use Anger augments. There are only 3 EB weapons that are not warrior only - Blade of War, Blade of Carnage, and Anathema. The beastlord cannot wield any of these. Therefore, he is the only potential source of 'contorts with rage'.<br />
 <br />
3: We see that he has misses logged, thus removing this concern. <br />
<br />
Once other explanations are removed, whatever remains, no matter how absurd, must be the truth. We see a proc on a failed dual wield check. Igneous, can you please check for similiar time snap procs? <br />
<br />
At level 65 + Ambidex, this will be rare as hell -19 cases in 51 hours?- The phenomenon is probably best looked for with a warrior that just learned dualwield.</div></div><hr />
