<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, having trouble deciding on what augments I want to put on my rings.  I recently finally finished the 10th ring and I'm 2 claws short of Rluas's Chromatic Ring...pics below of both rings.  Here's my problem, these two rings are going to probably be on my fingers for a long time to come.  My guild is currently 1 emp kill shy of breaking into Vex Thal...but I most likely will not be taking any of the rings from there unless we've gotten them on a bunch of other people already.   <br />
<br />
My question is what augments do you think I should stick on these two rings that will last me until the Elementals?  I don't really care about attack all that much, at the moment I'm more worried about resists....but being that we're about to gear up in Vex Thal I'm not so sure that will be much of a concern soon.  So, would like to hear what those of you that have already gone past this stage think.<br />
<br />

The two rings are these....<br />

Take a look at my magelo if you'd like....only pay attention to the dual wield and main profiles though...the other ones are all for testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input whatever I get :).  Oh, and if the Chromatic ring isn't augmentable as some ST items are, would like to know that as well...I don't know anyone atm that has one.</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest NOT spending any points to augment rings with resists. The returns are simply very poor for the investment, and at most +16 to resists. If you really want to augment the rings with resists, do it with dropped augments. Another option is the 20hp/mana augment for 1150 points in Guk, which is also a pretty poor return. One utility augment you could use would be enduring breath. Fairly cheap at 510 points, and rings just don't have many choices.<br />
<br />
 If you're not worried about attack, then you'd be best off augment virtually any other piece of gear. For example, 40hp for the helm and the breastplate is a really good choice. 10ac for the mask is a good deal too. Those three pieces will last you at least into the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />

After sitting down and actually going over the possible upgrades that will be comming in the next 4-5 months..and then considering the augments that I need right now, the ring slot is just something I don't have time to worry about.  Pretty much had already decided to do what you suggested with the augments...which will take some time for me since I don't get a lot of ldon adventures done.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions though :).  If anything I'll put an eb aug on the dain ring so I don't have to slot the shissar eye earring :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boff</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also note that if you turn in your 10th ring for your DA scroll, your augment will be gone as he gives you a new 10th ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last warrior in my guild that turned in his ring for a scroll...even with max ally to dain faction...got to spend 20 hours waiting on a gm to replace his ring...I don't plan on trying that any time soon :).<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides....been waiting a long damn time to kill that lil bastidge and I finally can !<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info though....that definately woulda sucked.</div></div><hr />

I think you are correct to worry about other slots unless you've done 200+ adventures or something.  I'll put vengence 2 on one of mine eventually I think, with vengence 4 and 3 going on bracers.</div></div><hr />
