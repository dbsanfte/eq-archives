<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snowgoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 51 lvl barbarian warrrior and my current hp and ac needs a serious upgrade. I have 873 ac and 2238 hp's unbuffed right now.<br />
<br />
I am not in a big guild, first Kael raid is planed next weekend, and i have about 3K to spend.<br />
Also I am agnostic so deity armor is not posible.<br />
<br />
I do have a 53 shamman i can dual box, and my question is. <br />
<br />
Is there any armor i could camp/quest? What should i look for?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Koralak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can get some fairly inexpensive upgrades, some slots to upgrade, and possible items to replace them as follows:<br />
<br />
Head: Skull Shaped Barbute AC:13 +10 MR +35 HP should run you around 100pp or less in the bazaar<br />
<br />
Fingers: Velium Fire Wedding Rings AC:6 +65 HP each, roughly 300-500pp, cheaper I am sure if you supply your local guild jeweler with the Fire Opals (easily farmable from Seb jail if you get a group) and the Velium bars.<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Crested Spaulders AC:11 +6 STA probablly 100pp or Tattered Mantle AC:12 +20 HP +10 DR, again can't see this going for more than 200pp<br />
<br />
Range: Goranga Idol AC: 8 +4 DEX +3 STA +25 HP would say this will run no more than 200pp roughly.<br />
<br />
These small upgrades alone will net you versus your current equipment (if I did my math right hehe):<br />
<br />
AC: 32-33 RAW <br />
HP: 175-190 RAW<br />
Yes, you will lose some stats, but in my opinion, the AC and hp gain are more than worth it, and that is just the begining. Total cost will run you under 1k if you provied the materials for the rings I suggested. Look at my profile, besides my mainhand, waist item, and range item, my gear isn't all that spectacular, and my AC is more than yours, and my hp almost to your level. You can far surpass me, and it will not even cost you an arm and a leg :) Once you start getting some Champions Armor, you will be on your way!<br />
