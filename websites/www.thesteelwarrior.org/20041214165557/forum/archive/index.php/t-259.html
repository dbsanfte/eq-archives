<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the looks of your magelo, 290.  ND3 is a total of 10% increase in HPs I believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just mess around with your magelo profile and see what it would be. I do it all the time. But yes it is 10% of your HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could just do some simple math involving your max hp and the number 1.10</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note that it's 10% total from ND.<br />
<br />
ND1 - 2% increase in HP<br />
ND2 - 3% increase on top of ND1<br />
ND3 - 5% increase on top of ND2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so from my equipment thing i'd have around 3500hp. i would get 350hp so 3850. now question does nd help the + hp items you gain and how about stamina?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarax</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its based off of your total HP meaning buffs and hp items i believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes if you get a 100hp item and you have nd3 you will see a 110hp return for that item. <br />
<br />
As far as Stamina goes the math gets a bit more complicated since it varies by level, but whatever your hp return for stamina is it adds 10% of that. So a 10pt stamina item at level 60 gives you 60hps, with nd3 you will see a 66 hp increase. This all goes for buffs as well.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok luckily i'm good at math. yeah i get it thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do not gain a  Natural Durability HP increase on any buff, aside from buffs that increase your stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
The amount of HP you gain from Natural Durability, comes from your base unbuffed hitpoints, including Stamina buffs only. IE - Talisman of the Boar, Righteous Health, etc. <br />
<br />
Buffs like Foucs of the Soul, Virtue, etc, do not get a Natural Durability bonus added onto them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooh, a 1550 hp Virtue instead of 1400!<br />
<br />
How come I don't get that from my clerics? *ducks and runs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baudreyt</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this has been asked already, my apologies.  I'm a lvl 60 warrior just starting AA's.  My plan was to do Stamina3 and Run3, followed by Natural Durability3.<br />
<br />
That's until someone told me that when you train in ND, EQ calculates your HP bonus at that time, and the bonus is a fixed, constant value forever and ever.  Meaning, I would be a fool to do ND before I'm 65th level.<br />
<br />
This can't be true, can it?  Please tell me that if I have 5000hp and ND3 at lvl 60 (for 5500 total), that when I ding 61 and my base HP goes up, the ND bonus will also go up?  So like at 61st level, 5200hp, ND3 would add 520hp for 5720 total.  Right?  It can't be a one-time calculation, can it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no i think thats wrong. cuz above it adds to stam. so i think it would keep on gaining within level. try adding levels in magelo to see if it works.</div></div><hr />

Nope, not true.  ND3 just adds 10% to your hp, but not hp buffs.  virtue focus ect... don't get the benifit, sta buffs do.  I am not too sure about +hp items, i will have to check but I would assume that those who said they are affected are correct, but I always heard otherwise.  Guess ill check tomarow and let you know.<br />
<br />
One thing i would advise against though is doing sta 3.  Even at level 65 once you break 255 sta you will only get 3.25hp per sta over 255.  So those 6 you will get from sta3 will yeild, even after ND3 and the like, maybe 26 hp?  Regen 3 will get you 27 hp in one minute.  While 26 hp is a nice bonus I wouldnt' spend 3 aa on it.  The only other first tier AA thats worth a damn besides run3 would be the regen in my opinon.  Go with what you want, but 3 aa for 26 hp or 3 aa for the regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baudreyt</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice guys. Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DinadassDegladi</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i double box all the time, and use stat food so i got meta3 because i'm so busy doing 2 i forget to force feed. Meta3 is a solid 3 AA's just for increasing stat food if you use it :), i'm gonna go back adn get regen3 some day, but when you have 6-7k hp, does 3pts a tick really drastically affect anything. Just my rationale</div></div><hr />
