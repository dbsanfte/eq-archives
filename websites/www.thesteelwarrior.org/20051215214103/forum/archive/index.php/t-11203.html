Why do they keep stepping on our toes in every mmorpg i play? They have 4/5 of our hp's, same weapon and defense skills, they have more Armor than warriors. They can hold aggro, tank bosses, the only thing they lack is the taunt button. They can heal a hella lot better than they did in EQ. They own PvP. Any joe shmoe playing his gimp pally can beat an above average warrior. In group situations pallies stack well. They can wear lightforge and will roll on valor too and being the whiny little bastards they are and because lightforge just sucks for warriors we cant return the favor. Not to mention weapons.<br />
<br />
Now tell me why would anyone want a warrior over a pally? Maybe things change at MC?</div></div><hr />

Your definition of above average must be skewed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surprising.<br />
<br />
But seriously, you can't comment on every other issue i have raised regarding pallies cause you're horde. Now, go sit in a corner and realize the fact that everyone else is not as l33t sk1ll3d as you are :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, pallies are pretty retarded. Even in Alliance/Horde PvE comparasin just due to the lack of non-priest dispellers on the Horde side. If Purge just worked on friendlies it would fix a lot of that garbage, but that's never going to happen. Felhounds for the win?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pallies aren't that good, It's dramatically overstated.<br />
<br />
The only thing they're better than us at is tanking AE fights. We can still manage to do that if we're skilled enough and get our group to wait 5 seconds. <br />
<br />
My groups usually involve a paladin, as primary healer or for utility, he always defers tanking to me in non AE situations.<br />
<br />
Every bonus palies get to tanking is sharable (devotion aura, blessing of kings, etc) and not as good as our bonuses.<br />
<br />
They don't have shieldwall, taunt, or defensive stance. We hold aggro better than they do in defensive stance, we take 10% less damage of all types. (including spells, even if they COULDN'T give us devotion aura its only an extra 2-4% mitigation of melee damage). You have no idea how useful the taunt button is on deaggro bosses. You should see palies tanking the prince in west dire maul. Even a skilled paladin is going to end up with a couple group mates dead from the deaggro, where as we can just hit taunt as soon as he does it and the prince never leaves the corner.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate shield wall either. You can use it 2-4 times per instance run depending on where you are, if you time it right and remember to use it. It makes fights completely trivial. Some people hold it out for &quot;oh chit&quot; situations, but better to just prevent those oh shit situations from happening if you know what you're getting into.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh yeah thats right, most warlocks are imp-gimps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because having warlock pets dispell on mobs like Kazzak where he heals 70k everytime ANYTHING dies isn't really a plus last time I checked. There's other instances in MC also where it's not very beneficial to be using pets, IE Baron Geddon who causes people/pets to explode AEing everything around them. It's all situational, was just saying it would be nice to have the extra dispellers when 3/4 of the raid encounters require them, not like the Alliance doesn't get warlocks either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can comment on them just fine, because I kill them daily.<br />
<br />
Their DPS is utter ass.  Utility is unquestioned.  Durability is so-so.  They survive a good long while in PvP, but die just the same.<br />
<br />
Honestly, from the sheer number of paladins out there, if you have trouble dealing with even half of them, then you can't possibly be using all the tools at your disposal.  A shaman and I killed 2 (that's right, two) of them at the same time...fuckin shaman didn't even use a healing potion.  It's basically just the people who think they're so overpowered crying about it on every message board there is that leads to this perception that paladins are unstoppable.  They're really not.   A warrior should be able to put down an even con paladin no problem with just a fucking bandage in his inventory.  And all of your PvE concerns make me laugh because warriors have a taunt button, and anyone who understands what that means should just be laughing at paladins constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really, my only beef about paladins is Consecration.  That skill is just insane for AE aggro.  In Sunken Temple, doing the Dragonkin room with my usual group, I generally rush a pack hit Demo. Shout and start tanking an Elite or two.  The paly runs in, hits Consecration a few times and the healers never get touched.  Without a paly, its rough.  My group usually has to assist a Hunter pet so I can tab thru targets to make sure they all hate me and don't cream the priest/druid on the first heal.  Maybe not limiting the number of targets on Tclap would help.<br />
<br />
As far as Boss tanking, there isn't a 60 paly in my guild who can tank and keep aggro better than myself.  That is where our class shines.  As long as you are in defensive and using those skills, there generally is no aggro issues whatsoever.  Certain cases listed above will make your life tougher however.  Even with just 11pts in Prot, a sword and board warrior is tough to take down.<br />
<br />
As far as PvP, shield bash/pummel and MS for teh win!  Lame, I know, but it works.  Just remember to save up some rage for a big Execute when they get low.  The PLDs I've dueled generally wait too long to heal.  Shield Bash and a 1k+ Execute usually destroys their healing plans.  Even if they do get it off, maybe they went invulnerable prior to healing, with MS on, it is futility.  We do have to work alot harder to win PvP fights, but it is doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;My group usually has to assist a Hunter pet&quot;<br />
<br />
A warrior shouldn't really be main assist ever. You're job is to tan, have people get targets from you where you -should- be switching targets constantly is bad form.<br />
<br />
In sunken temple just rush in, hit everything with revenge, sunder and shield bash &lt;-- that one especially. For the love of god don't be in battle stance, thunderclap is terrible aggro and rage is better spent elsewhere when you're tanking. By the time a heal hits on you, you should have everything locked down easily, just have to hit them once per heal, ish. Whoever you set to main assist should start with the weakest target first, that way if you lose aggro on the initial mob, no one cares.</div></div><hr />

An evenly skilled (not even con - and there is a huge fucking difference) paladin will kick the shit out of a warrior.  Luckily for the horde, there are a shit ton of really unskilled, pansy paladins.  I think it's too bad because those morons are giving the class a bad name. <br />
<br />
Now tell me why would anyone want a warrior over a pally?<br />
<br />
Personally, I'll take a paladin above a warrior every time (then again, I don't usually have a choice since my boyfriend plays a paladin).  If consecration, blessing of salvation, and seal of fury don't work, I'll shift into bear and he can heal me.  That said, every instance run I've done has had a warrior as a main tank.  We always have one paladin per group and one warrior to MT.  As far as I can tell the &quot;raiders&quot; on my server won't even go in to an instance without a warrior, and they'll take a level 57 warrior rather than a 60 paladin.  I think that's retarded, but I definitely wouldn't say the warriors are going to lose their positions to a paladin any time soon.</div></div><hr />

You're probably correct, but I still haven't found one yet.<br />
<br />
I just dropped a -1 pally a few minutes ago...I let her heal 2400hp, and I still dropped her before i hit half life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. I've seen this happen so many times. You can say the same for rogues, unless the person is an idiot and eats all your retaliates. I'm talking about 1 vs 1 duels. Not your weekend horde gank fests. Face it, everyone knows warriors are least powerful pvp class when it comes to duels. Can you think of a class weaker than us?<br />
<br />
The new changes didn't impress me a bit. There's still a lot to be reconsidered. What I'm going to do is get everything pre-MC with my warrior then level up my rogue until my guild starts raiding MC.<br />
<br />
It's so twitchy dueling as a warrior. Equip shield then bash. Equip 2h then overpower/MS. Switch to shield to bash. Equip 2h. Wtf. And those damn stealth version numbers with each patch completely disrupt my addon usage. Any time someone /duel's me I feel annoyed cause I see a lot of work attached to it.</div></div><hr />

It's because pallies snap aggro is utter ass.  They do a decent job of holding it, but once it's gone.. it's gone.  Druids are a more effective tank in non AE situations than pallies.<br />
I'm not so sure about a 57 over a 60.. you still need to have the minimum level to actually hit the mob. :/</div></div><hr />
