Heard this as well, cant be sure who its originally from though  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well i'm at 20% with no Qvic Loot....<br />
22 With Cynosue Ring, 27 with helm, I was aiming 29-33 depending on luck.<br />
<br />
So having a cap at 20% sure is gonna be a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone Above 20 available to go check it in like HoH for 5 mins with a healer ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i heard that cha affects slow resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it would be logical that sheild does have a cap, like basicly everything else in eq but if spell sheilding can work up to 30% which i know for a fact than there is a 99.99% chance that sheilding cap is over  over 30 as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In velious/luclin when  FT was a legend, no one ever imagined that there could be a FT15 limit.<br />
(I remember debates that this created after the VT revamp)<br />
<br />
In velious/luclin when ATK was a myth, no one ever imagine that we could reach 250 ATK.<br />
(Sean FoH was the first one to hit the cap)<br />
<br />
Did you ever think that there was a haste cap ?<br />
<br />
Shall i continue ?  :D<br />

<br />
20 definatly seems to low a lot of people should have hit that by now and havnt heard anything, so 30-35+ is where it has to be at, because we should have heard about it by now if someone hit it i'd think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have 22%, it doesnt cap below that. This is easy to test, just attack something weak and check its min hits before and after removing a low shielding item. Unless its DI is 1, then a min hit drop of 1-2 proves that you arent capped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So nothing prevents SoE from putting a harcap to avoidance/shielding.<br />
<br />
Based on historical data, it wouldnt be a surprise to find one.</div></div><hr />

They're not gonna let you go to 100, I can pretty much guarantee that.  If they for some reason forgot, it'll be nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's not just high shielding by itself is overpowerng, but that combined with defensive you drop a mob's DPS by nearly half, guaranteed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure everyone with high shielding (20%+) had already figured out that it wasn't capped.  Hell, spell shield isn't capped at 30%.  I'd imagine the shielding cap will probably hit at around 45, or somewhere in that range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">there may not be any cap required if the gear does not let you get too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ZajeerSOE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">there may not be any cap required if the gear does not let you get too high. Definitely Gobsmash. There was no hard-cap on Time mods until Gates. It was much easier to control Time mods and progression when it was only coming from 2 sources: Plane of Time and LDoN raids. However, with more zones being Plane of Time in terms of loot quality and beyond, it wasn't easy balancing the fact that a player could go with all spell shielding items, for example, if they wanted to and it would have been harder to balance out. A hard-cap was put in so I could have more flexibility itemizing without the worry of someone getting 100% spell shielding at some point and making themselves immune to DDs.<br />
<br />
I don't have all the numbers in front of me right now, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be extremely difficult hitting a time mod cap unless you really work hard for it; by sacrificing some hitpoints, stats, and other mods, just so you can concentrate on that one specific mod and get it to max in Gates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Slightly off topic but does anyone know where the 1% shielding aug that showed up on lucy comes from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Slightly off topic but does anyone know where the 1% shielding aug that showed up on lucy comes from?<br />
<br />
Txevu off random mobs.<br />
<br />
There are 1% spell shield 1% stun resist and 1% Strikethrough 15/15/15 augs as well as the 1% shield aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Compared to the 60/60/60 from Qvic trash and the 2% shielding mods off Ikkinz nameds, doesnt 1% shielding sorta seem like a ripoff?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'll take 1% shielding over 40hp, but it seems kinda crappy compared to what was dropping before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I thought the 60/60/60 dropped off the rare nameds in qvic? I could very well be wrong though.<br />
<br />
As far as the 2% shielding aug in ikkinz it only drops off the bosses in trial 1 and 3(though I have only seen it from trial 3)  took roughly 40 wins to get 2 shielding augs so they are pretty rare, espcially with 24 hour lock out.<br />
<br />
The 1 percent shielding aug drops off any mob in Inku'ta which isn't that bad of an idea.  Makes clearing trash not such a drag.  Consider it a minor bonus. If it was off a named or boss I would definatly be irrate.<br />
<br />
Off topic(like most of this post !) They also drop 40 end augs, 40 mana augs and 1 percent dot shielding augs. Super duper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">unless the caps are different for each effect the parases with the monk that has 60 avoidance should be a good spot to think of the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kavhok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">unless the caps are different for each effect the parases with the monk that has 60 avoidance should be a good spot to think of the cap.<br />
<br />
The avoidance number isn't exactly comparable to shielding.  Shielding is a percentage of the damage bonus.  Avoidance is an absolute number added to your avoidance AC, not a percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">So if you had 100% avoidance you would in effect take no or very little damage while with 100% shielding you could still take signifiant damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Avoidance is an absolute number<br />
<br />
<br />
means its +10 for example, not + 10 percent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">So if you had 100% avoidance you would in effect take no or very little damage while with 100% shielding you could still take signifiant damage?Avoidance is not a % so you can't get 100% avoidance. If you had 100 avoidance, your AC would be 100*avoidance_ac_mod higher than without 100 avoidance. If you had 100% shielding you would still take damage. In effect, DB would be 0 so the damage you would take would range from DI*1 to DI*20.<br />
<br />
Having 100% shielding would also make defensive useless since there would be no additional damage mitigated. You only need to get 60% shielding to get the maximum amount of damage mitigation possible while defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">?<br />
<br />
Defensive cuts the DI in half (Well a little less cause of the DI warrior mod)<br />
<br />
Shielding is a % off the DB,<br />
<br />
If you had 100% shielding(If it was possible)  you'd just take the DB part of damage equation off, and justh ave DI,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Yes.<br />
If a warrior had 100% Shielding<br />
No damage from Damage base, but Damage Interval would be still 1-19 (And further halfed with defensive/stone)<br />
<br />
Oh btw - Since they said theyre was no cap in pop/ldon, i counted 23 shielding possible from pop/ldon (5 from ldon) - Whats the new possibile in GoD, anyone see?</div></div><hr />

In addition to the Time/LDON stuff, there is:<br />
<br />
+1% on legs (Greaves of Furious Might -&gt; Jointed Scale or Vadd's)<br />
+1% on BP (Raex -&gt; Vadd's)<br />
+1% on shield (Shield of Strife -&gt; Blackstone Buckler)<br />
+1% on Tiny Orb of Defense (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68995)<br />
+2% on Glyphed Sandstone (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68800)<br />
+2% on Honed Trinket of Protection (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68811)<br />
+2% on Divine Crystalline Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68842)<br />
+2% on Effigy of Kelekdrix (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68952)<br />
+3% on Steel Boots of the Slayer (Txevu, not in Lucy yet)<br />
+5% on Vadd's helm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68850)<br />
<br />
I'm sure I missed an item or two, and then of course all the Txevu/Tacvi stuff that hasn't been found yet... but assuming your 23% number is an accurate pre-GoD max, that would be at least 43% shielding possible(as a warrior, knights very slightly less) if you had everything.</div></div><hr />

Small form just have to splat the same info you put the above list. <br />
<br />
Item name, url, usable classes, slots, and the modifiers of course.</div></div><hr />

What about avoidance, combat effects, and other items without % mods?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">so if we summarise we get about shielding :<br />
no cap at 27 either<br />
All time mods are hard capped, though no one has gotten to the cap yet.<br />
Best total: 44% Shielding.<br />
 I don't have all the numbers in front of me right now, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be extremely difficult hitting a time mod cap unless you really work hard for it<br />
thus we can assume the cap is between 27 and 44%  (because we haven't reach it, and because it is still possible).<br />
Moreover Zajeer says expressly that the cap is a HARD cap and not a SOFT cap, I understand it as they change the bit size of the storage (of this value) to ensure it's impossible by no way (even by a bug, exploit,...) to go over the limit. If my assumption is true the cap should then be 31%  (2^5-1), which is quite reasonnable and what we have expected.<br />
The flaw in this assumption is that Wizard have a 40% spell shield, and that a 50% spell and melee shield spell is listed on lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4571&amp;source=Live). So we may wait for a parse to be fixed especially if 31% is not to sacrificial to attain.<br />
I was aiming 29-33 depending on luck.<br />
I have 31% spellshield <br />
so because of the rune part the the spells (ex: 20% for max 750HP) they might be coded diferently, and thus don't screw completly my point.<br />
so we stay in line waiting ... for the first one achiving 32% of either spell or melee shielding to see if they've got actually only 31%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Rather dumb assumption Yoda. Zajeer said 'In Gates'. Don't you think there will be some significant shielding items in Tacvi that have yet to be discovered? It may go up to 60% after its been cleared. Historically the gear from the final zone of an expansion blows away ANYTHING before it.</div></div><hr />

Well, I can confirm that Spellshield is hard capped at 35% (I have 36% and got hit for 650 every time by discordant energy from Cynosure). So yeah, people are getting to the caps and it would be nice to know what they are.</div></div><hr />
