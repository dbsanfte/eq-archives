<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatanka</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just dinged 30,pretty much following the eq reccomendation pop ups.i did some feild of bone,paludal,mistmoore,marus saru.upon 30 it said to head to tower of frozen shadow.i see that has a small modifier and is pretty far off the beaten path for me as a warrior.<br />
 i guess i'm more inclined to ask where i can solo fairly well as i'm on the role play prefered server and groups at my level are pretty far and few between.i've soloed to to 30 fairly quickly and haven't had any problems so far.i know that eventually i'll have to hang up my solo booties and join the crowd,but for now i'ma lone wolf.  :D <br />
 if it helps,i have a 24% haste item -2100 hp's and about 800 ac.just using a lammy and a wurmslayer.<br />
<br />
 added:i'm a troll and i have about +8 regen in items,not sure what the regen rate is for troll.<br />
 thanks all!</div></div><hr />

Its Old World, so the mobs arent particularly viscious, and both zones have a decent ZEM to offset the Troll xp penalty.  Once you level up a bit more, Mistmoore, especially inside the castle, is excellent. As is Crystal Caverns and Splitpaw. I have a few alts and Ive enjoyed these zones a lot. They're off the beaten path, something fun, and usually deserted as folks go the usual XP route. Hope that helped you some.<br />
<br />
edit-Forgot CC is usually camped thoroughly on my server at least. Folks gathering Velium and camping Geonids and Spiders usually lock everything up. Splitpaw would be the better bet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are a Warrior go wherever there are groups of your lvl. Ldon is probably your best bet. Or wherever the lvl 30's are hanging these days on your server. I think i went and killed giants in rathe mnts when i was lvl 30, but that was a while ago and there are probably much better spots exp wise now. Dsp still seems to draw a crowd of 30ish lvls. I am having the same problem lvling my lvl 33 bst, but I can always solo you can't</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatanka</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the tips,Dununder,i haven't tried CC yet,i didn't care for SolA,i got to much mass trying to navigate those lava pits hehe.citadel was ok but i didn't like having to go that deep to get a dark blue.And who put those dang little people in the newbie zone!foodtrader or something and another little sawed off guy whacked me on my run to runnyeye.<br />
 Been in Infected Paw now and it has a nice ZEM,13% i believe.i usually have it all to myself anytime i want with an occasional straggler.EXP has been pretty decent.<br />
<br />
 Gukruk,i didn't think of that spot,i'll definately check it out,always good to find another level spot i haven't been to.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Cimmer,i wish it was that easy,i would definately be doing LDON if i could.but as i said i am on Firiona Vie server,adventures for people my level are few and far between,i went and tried a couple,last one i tried,it took us an hour to get a group together and even then we couldn't get a healer.FV is a whole nother animal compared to the regular servers.like Paludal,i think the most people i have seen in the zone at one time was like 35,man that was a busy day! :eek: <br />
<br />
 maybe when i get to 40-50,grouping will become a better option for me but for now im doing fine soloing,hoping Paw will last a while,i get a nice mix of dark blue to yellows.took out a couple reds other day back to back,though thats not really worth the time,was a whole lotta fun.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TOFS is even better XP than Paw or Gunthak (the 2nd floor mobs in particular have absurdly low hp) but you'll want a friend with you.  The 2nd floor mobs are all casters, so they tend to have damage shields.  To give you an idea of the difficulty, the dervishes guarding the entry outside TOFS are much harder than the mobs inside on the first two floors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barli</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to try soloing in Firiona Vie just outside of the cave where the spiders hang out on the western side.  I had some reasonable luck soloing there.  Bring along a lot of bandages as you'll need em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also have to strongly encourage grouping. While I am warrior of the oldest school--and that definatly colors my opinions--even if you solo all the way to 65, 95% of the game is spend grouping. Almost more important that HP/AC and all that is rep. <br />
<br />
The time do develope that, and learn how things like provoke/infurate/incite work is now, before 65.<br />
<br />
Heck I miss getting groups in Unrest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definatly wouldnt go to the ToFS at level thirty, and not alone..That place is well off the beaten path and can get ugly quick. Not to mention the keys to get to the other levels are sometimes hard to get.  Im not a big solo'er with my tank, but I did solo a lot with my shaman, and never had any problems getting groups or soloing in DSP.<br />
     You mentioned that your on a rp server, Im currious, whats the difference between those and the standard servers? Are you required to go around saying a lot of Thee's and Thou's??</div></div><hr />
