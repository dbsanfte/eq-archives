I have to say I'm very pleased with it. At first I thought &quot;Rune proc? Pretty crappy&quot;. But when I first fired it off I noticed just how often it procs during the one minute duration. I have not been able to parse it yet, but it added a very noticable amount of mitigation.<br />
<br />
The most obvious use for this discipline and it's 400 point rune proc is when defensive drops and you want more mitigation etc. It's on the same timer as Healing Will which is nice since you can pop it right when defensive drops. <br />
<br />
Another good thing about it is that the proc goes in the song window, not your normal buff window so it doesn't eat a slot. I've not been able to test stacking issues with other rune spells as I dont have a weapon based rune proc.<br />
<br />
This new disc is level 66. Again,  I feel that it's very worth picking up because it procs like MAD. Hope some of this info helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or he could kill a monster in another dimesnsion and happen upon some arcane text, a rune. Upon deciphering it he learns that through not only physical strength, but with mental fortitude and conentration he has the ability to channel what little magic he has in the form of extra protection. <br />

Spells seem to come from an (variable) Muramite Rune. Some runes are all/all, others are restricted to just casters - You'll need the all/all. We got a Lesser and a Minor last night, iirc the lesser was all, the minor was casters. There's a dragorn to turn them into in Dranik's scar. Also, Runes are droppable, but the spells(and I assume discs) they create are not.</div></div><hr />

Sweet.  I was hoping they'd eventually add something useful on that timer.  Healing Will is a joke and Spirit of Rage is completely useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would be much more useful if it was on the healing will timer, I would have waited months to even loot the rune if I knew it was going to be on my invulnerabilty timer<br />
<br />
Aura of runes is from the 'minor' rune and Bazu Bellow is from the 'greater' rune btw, I havent been able to get a regular muramat rune yet but I'm assuming its the level 68 disc and the ancient coins are the level 70 disc but who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but I find the casterization of pure melees to be a concern.<br />
<br />
-discs and abilities all in the spelldat<br />
-addition of the runes to hunt for just like spells<br />
-addition of endurance that drives our abilities, just like mana drives spells<br />
-focii to focus our abilities just like casters<br />
-ability to heal ourselves just like certain classes can heal themselves<br />
<br />
NONE of this used to be this way, these are all relatively recent changes.<br />
<br />
What this does is feeds the knight argument that warriors are casters just like hybrids are, strengthening their argument to tank like we do while weaking our own argument that we're a &quot;pure melee&quot; and should have the advantage because of it.<br />
<br />
It was fine when the similarities were very limited. But the more the lines get blurred, the more of a problem it becomes. <br />
<br />
At this point I'm becoming very thankful that the opening system didn't go Live. If it had, the only real significant difference between knights and warriors would be the way spells are cast. Openings would be reactive only, while spells are proactive, with the only other difference being spells have a cast time, the warrior abilities do not.<br />
<br />
Knights could have built a VERY strong case for making tanking outside of defensive to be equal among all 3 plate tanks in terms of mitigation and average damage taken, had openings gone Live.<br />
<br />
On another, and personal note, not having to hunt for my new spells and abilities is not what I signed up for, and is part of the reason why I changed mains to a warrior from a druid, way back when. I hated hunting for spells. Now I find myself having to do it all over again.</div></div><hr />

If it allows them to add more functionality, and it does, I'm all for it.</div></div><hr />

I got mine last night, it was on the Healing Will timer.  Non-test (Quellious).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cut and paste from rpgexpert:<br />
<br />
Runes for Omens Spells<br />
<br />
There are five types of runes you can obtain through Omens Of War to trade in for 66-70 spells.<br />
<br />
Here is what they are:<br />
1) Minor Muramite Rune: Level 66 spell.<br />
2) Lesser Muramite Rune: Level 67 spell.<br />
3) Muramite Rune: Level 68 spell.<br />
4) Greater Muramite Rune: Level 69 spell.<br />
5) Glowing Muramite Rune: Level 70 spell.<br />
<br />
They are all turned into the same guy, he is SW of the zone in to Dranik's Scar. His location is -1650,-40. (Basically, go southwest and look for the red con mob).<br />
<br />
They all drop from various named, the higher level the named, the greater the rune will be. Obviously, the level 69/70 spells will drop off of raid-encounter type mobs.<br />
<br />
You will never receive a duplicate spell. You only will get a spell you need from turn in.<br />
<br />
The port spells for Druid and Wizard are very easy to get. The components will drop from random trash mobs in the Bloodfields (crystals and parchments), and in Wall of Slaughter (blood and parchments). You need 3 crystals/blood per 1 parchment for a single spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanok</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It goes off quite a lot, but the problem is its spikey and dependent on the RNG just like everything else...  So, you are tanking a 3000 hitter and defensive runs out, you pop this...  You could be fine as long as the mob doesn't get lucky on the RNG or you don't get unlucky on the RNG, but since its depending on the RNG twice and not just once, its really up in the air.  I have used it several times on &gt;3min named fights, and it definately helps, but I wouldn't count on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nonosassy</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pffft, i proc it average of 4 times in the 1 minute....<br />
<br />
NOT a big help at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proccing a 400pt rune DOES make a huge difference, even if its only 4 times....<br />
<br />
Remember what happens when you raise your AC: Overall, you may take 20dps less...but its not like every second you're getting hit for 20 less, its that maybe every 10 seconds you are hit for 200 less.<br />
<br />
Proccing a 400pt rune 4x in a minute effectively makes you take 27dps less in that minute.  It's not huge, but it is comparable to the difference between having Symbol/Nine/WOG versus just having Symbol/Nine.  And in fights where you're barely surviving by the skin of your teeth (general reparm, or the Diabolic Destroyer for a lot of people, for instance) -- it could mean the difference between a wipe and success, for sure.  Rune proc is the reason I went with a SEWS instead of a BoW -- my SEWS will mitigate damage better than a BoW, even though the BOW has more AC on it.<br />
<br />
Also remember that a rune proc is an aggro proc -- a 400pt rune should give you around the same aggro as an Anger2 proc, I believe (I dont remember for sure, and I'm too lazy to look it up).<br />
<br />
Would I like to see the procrate increased, or perhaps the damage sponge increased?  You betcha...but its a disc I would use often (assuming it will stack with my SEWS proc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even the level 70 one I got.  Says chance to stun anything that hits you.  Must be a zero sec stun and even if it is a stun it barely goes off.  They are all just stupid stuff to waste your endurence.  <br />
<br />
Let the casters loot all the runes.  And roll on the incite upgrade.<br />
<br />
Only cool new ability to come out of expansion is Press the Attack.  And well thats getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
Warlord's Tenacity=upgrade to an AA I never use. <br />
<br />
Aura of Runes does help mitigate a little I guess.  They all just toys.  Nothing that will make or break an encounter.  <br />
<br />
Didnt notice any increase in aggro.  It is a different type of spell all together.  Icon lands on your  song window.</div></div><hr />

If it procced a lot it would be nice, but it seems like on average I get 1-3 procs per disc.  Not worth the END IMO.  <br />
<br />
I disagree on the AA though, Warlord's Tenacity was useless, but the upgrade will be very worthwhile if used correctly.  There's nothing game breaking in our AA, but there's at least 150 points worth of stuff I'm looking forward to, and Origin is very cool.</div></div><hr />
