Of course, something in the slot is better than nothing. That said, would the time spent seeking out a charm be better spent working on non-charm gear upgrade? Hmmm...guess that would depend on current gear status...<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just missing the point here - for example, what's with the charm effect? CHRMGold? CHRMNoHasteBuf? Huh?? <br />
<br />
Anyone have info or a link to info describing this in detail? <br />
<br />
Bit confused...TIA...</div></div><hr />

<br />
it has warrior oriented stats, and goes up with your faction to the steel-warriors, and we all wub the steel warriors, <br />
<br />
and if your a hearty dwarven battlemaster like mehself those 6 monthes in crushbone (5 of which for revenge) should have all the steel-warriors likin' ya<br />
<br />
i &lt;3 steel-warriors, cuz the vendors are real nice with max-ally</div></div><hr />

<br />
CHRMNoHasteBuf-  the charm loses stats when you have spell haste buff up<br />
<br />
CHRMGold- I think this one increases power with the amout of PP you have.<br />
<br />
Overall i would say if you enjoy rubbing broken glass in your eyes, charm hunting should be right up your ally.  I spent 120+ hours geting mine and I'm happy as hell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charm of the Brotherhood (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=61002) is fairly decent.  Go to Dulak's Harbor and collect a Silver, Bronze, Gold, and Platinum Medallion of Service.  Take all 4 to Firon, an NPC on the roof of the Neriak Warrior's Guild.  If you are a good race(or just have really bad faction with dark elves) bring a few invis potions or have someone come with you to re/cast Invis on you.  There is a guard who stands on the far side of the roof, but he won't bother you if you keep Firon between you and the guard.<br />
The medallions drop from pretty much any mob in the zone.  My main got his doing the treasure sorters and scouts just past the zone line.  My lil Froggy dinged 40 last night out in DL and I'm already sick to death of it.  I'm headed down to Dulak tonight with him to see if I can get this charm for him.  Its nothing great, but 5 extra hp for having a second warrior in the group never hurt anybody:D<br />
Eventually, I'd like to get him that Ebony Dragon Figurine, but I haven't heard of anyone actually getting it to drop yet.<br />

It doesn't seem worth it. I could get at least an aaxp in the time to run around doing this.  Has anyone found a charm worth the time yet?<br />
