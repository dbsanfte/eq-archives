<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We tried the rz script again tonight and did pretty good.  Downed fake with one or two losses.  Before we entered the pit, i think one of our monks pulled him to the far side to be sure he didnt agro.  But when we dropped down and hugged the wall, he suddenly popped in the middle of the raid.. BOOM I was going to be MT, so i took agro and backed up to the corner.  Got some lag and saw rztw popping back and forth between corner and mid raid, again and again. In the end i got him out by moving out from the wall.. Sadly a lot of time had passed, my disc was running low before we got some dps on him.  And it caught us unprepared.  Only one or two encs had gotten pets and so on  :mad: <br />
Do rztw easily agro from the middle? Can pulling him away make him warp to the other side now? Was a big downer for me, since we were doing pretty good up to that point.<br />

You can get the raid down in the corner without moving RZ.  He won't agro if you keep fairly close to the south wall.  Moving him around before you're ready to pull him is bad juju now after the dx9 patch.</div></div><hr />

We have done it once like this since the dx9 patch with no added problems.</div></div><hr />
