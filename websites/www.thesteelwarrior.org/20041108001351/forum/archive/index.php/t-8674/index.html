<br />
The only problem I find is that sometimes they make the wind too strong.  There's simply no way to win sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kalthanan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A game very similar to this has been around since at least the Vic20.  I had a version for my Commodore 64 called &quot;Artillery&quot;.  You enter the power and the angle.  There have been various other incarnations; &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; being one of the most popular PC versions.<br />
<br />
It's still fun in this new incarnation as archers...</div></div><hr />

Dont forget the gorrilla game! Back when dos was still hanging around, if you knew how to find it you could get at least two decent games, nibbles, and gorrillas. The gorrillas game was like this, only you typed in an angle and speed to throw bananas at the other gorrilla. You had to account for wind, distance AND height differences since both were standing on skyscrapers like king kong. I got so good at that that I was able to undercut the gorilla, take the entire roof out from underneath him with my exploding bananas all without touching him. This game though, bleh. I just cant seem to get the angle right for that stinking wall. Wind is easy to account for, its that wall thats tough!</div></div><hr />

That reminds me, there was this game called Weather Wars on the Commodore 64 that was sort of the same thing, but you were a wizard with different weather powers at your command, and you had to destroy a certain percentage of your enemy's castle blocks.<br />
<br />
You could bring down tornados, rain, hail, lightning, and one or two other effects.  Was pretty cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the trick is 100 power and about 22.5 degree's. Works like a charm~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually I checked it out and have not linked it anywhere or anything and do not intend to but it is kind of fun. Ya don't need to blast it all over the internet to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
I don't see why people get upset because people get a bonus for referring people to games if the game is enjoyable and does not require it.<br />
<br />
This is not anything like guild wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To be honest, I dont even think there are any rewards setup yet for the refferal points. I also havent been spamming the link, this is the one and only place ive posted it, and only here because I actually like this game.</div></div><hr />
