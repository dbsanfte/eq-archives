<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can this quest be mq'd?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brolie Paragus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yesi believe so, the items are all lore nd....  <br />
but they identify diffrent...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone know if this quest is still flagging entire groups, or just person who completes quest?  GMs keep avoiding answering me, and the folks I'm sposed to get flagged are never all online at the same time... so I'd rather just DO IT and skip the crap if it's only flagging personally again now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe the &quot;fix&quot; to Wembly was to stop people out of group from helping with the MQ.  Now every quarter must be turned in from someone in the group  (I haven't confirmed this yet, it is even possible they stopped the MQ completely...I should know tonight for sure).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Will try in the next couple days.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Confirmed, you can still MQ if all members doing the hand in are in the same group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What if the members are outside of group?  I'm a tad puzzled on how Verant would go about making it so that all turn in people had to be in same group... makes no sense to me how the server would tell group members from non group members, and what would happen if you attempted to MQ without the other people in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If people outside of the group try to MQ the pieces, you get nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  Unless one of my guildmates is a complete moron and turned in the wrong piece, after having ID'd it.  Not out of the realm of possibility, but still....<br />
<br />
EDIT:  And I'm very hesitant to attempt this again, since I've already wasted 4 pieces.  If someone has MQ'd this from outside of a group in the last 3 days or so, please let me know, as I'll have a guildmate to beat senseless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did it today with no issue, but didn't have the courage to try the hand-in outside the group.</div></div><hr />
