<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am 54 war on Tribunal server.  I am currently using Splitblade of destruction and Horn of Hsagra. Blade is not yet giving full stats as it has recommended lvl 56, but I am thinking on an upgrade for HoH. not sure on that as I love the extra Ac. <br />
<br />
Got like 150k and could increase that amount by 50k selling stuff from alters, perhaps even more. Question is, is there any upgrade I can get a) with that amount of cash b) With a group hmm say (65 ENC 65 PAL 60 CLE 54 MAG 54 MAG 54 WAR &lt;-myself 8P)<br />
<br />
I heard of BoC or SoD but I don't think I can afford that. Had Sword of the Bloodsworm or whatever but even with 255 DEX it does not proc much and can hardy notice effects on aggro 8(<br />
<br />
Dunno what to do 8/<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Btw, first post ever  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where's yer procs? :)<br />
<br />
Simple upgrade would be:<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking.  Same ratio as your Horn, but with a nifty agro proc on it (not to mention 179dd).  Easily better.  Your group could handle camping it fairly easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, lose the HoH and get a CHoS.<br />
<br />
..also if you want to make a whole lot of money for armor upgrades, sell the SBoD and HoH and just get a GSoT for 25pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, go with what Baadan said.  You can do just fine with a GSoT and get a whole bunch of Ornate with that knid of cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for answers. Just a few considerations..<br />
<br />
Already got GSoT, my skill sucks, but oh well just some hard work to but in.<br />
<br />
About CHoS, how easily that procs, and how much is it resisted, if it procs and lands like DOoFM then it will rock but if it is like SotB then no benefit of it.<br />
<br />
My armor is mostly Fierce with 3 or 4 upgrades over it including one ornate sleeves mold waiting I ding 55. I will only get ornate gauntles after that and the rest of my armor will be Nro LDON, so not needing armor upgrades. Also got soulscream, Bloodmetal, Valorium...<br />
<br />
My concern are the 55AC I think I got from SBoD + HoH and DPS...<br />
no worried about procs as I am thinking on Augs for it...<br />
<br />
Main problem is there are very few dropable weapons I can purchase, SoD, BoC and 5 o so more but can remember names....<br />
And when the increased ratio overcomes the benefit on the AC from my current weps....<br />
<br />
Lol I just keep thinking on what to do all the time... that 55Ac is my headache!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">do your 55AC help you get agro ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play mostly whith a group of rl friends and we manage agro pretty well, im tanking in PoN PoD and PoI mostly an already got flagged for PoS and PoV, sure will need the AC... plus ill get some Anger Augs.... besides that an agro proc... depends mainly of how easily that proc fires...<br />
<br />
I am more concerned with an AC/DPS matter than with an Aggro one, besides that already got the GSoT and can get easily the CHoS and SotB if not camping it, in bazaar. Im just looking for more options...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Both the SoBS and the CHoS are better than both the SBoD and HoH. High aggro stun procs are better then DPS, better than AC, better than HP and (almost) better than ice cream. The only upgrade is Enraging Blow and the only tradeable EB is BoC.<br />
<br />
&quot;We manage aggro pretty well&quot; is another way of saying, the slower waits (wasting healer mana) and the DPS holds back (cutting down on your kill rate). Get the aggro weapons and use them, your group will be the better for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well everyone seems to agree on agro over everything else...<br />
<br />
Guess ill need to try that CHoS and SoBS combo...<br />
<br />
But... 55AC isnt just 55Ac final number when you equip them is more like 90AC. With Virtue I got 1307AC and man, AC rocks!!<br />
<br />
About managing agro... I only can remember cleric going below 50% mana after some train so I think we doing pretty well. I Just try to increase my HP to give cleric a litle more margin when healing, a litle more profit from CH, a litle more time for chanter to decide when to slow... usually got 1300+ AC 6khp full buffed at lvl 54 and already upgrading gear... and as soon as I hit 55 gotta love ND. And we got no problem using Dots for buffs, runes etc... Things get a litle different when a character mostly plays with the same 5 people. And being rl, and working together, we can discuss, preparare strategies, more indeep than usual... And.... I hate this... we got pally for stun and some agro control :/ Just dont wanna be the perfect tank, nor an all purpose tank... just the best fit for our group... Thats why Im not really concerned with agro... by now ;)<br />
<br />
Another question is...  usually less than 10% of the total hp of the mob are wasted without slow, only in that first 10% I can loose agro to chanter (when slow lands). so, do you think the weapons will proc in that 10%? If not, dunno at higher lvls but now they are useless.... and provoke is working fine )<br />
<br />
but I take note, BoC way to go.... I guess just need like 200k more lol well, lot of bazaar/farming/camping work!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">These guys are all right but no way would I get rid of the SBoD for those agro weapons, it looks to good, and its dps is nice and the AC is nice.<br />
<br />
Dump the HoH and get the CHoS or SoTB in main hand (the SBoD looks good in either hand) then slap a Anger III on the CHoS/SoTB (mainhand).<br />
<br />
Sure you miss some proc in the offhand but with 2 procs on the mainhand you should do well enough. <br />
<br />
All the other people are absolutly right but they do not value looks obvioulsy or status. You can look like every other warrior on the server at your level with SoTB/CHoS or weild a sub 1000pp weapon (GSoT or WMBS) (dont get me wrong the GSoT is in Fact supiour to what I am suggesting for dps and agro) or you can appear stonger then you are with the MIGHTY SBoD!<br />
<br />
I mean what ya gonna do go on ooc and say &quot;Woot! GSoT! I finanlly got one!&quot; or &quot;Woot! SBoD yur mine baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
I sold my SBoD for 80K but only when I bought a BoC for 210K....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sam, you are the only person that looks at the Splitblade as a status symbol. Everyone else sees a warrior with a splitblade and says &quot;Wow, what a dipshit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, and Copper Hammer &gt; Splitblade for DPS on mobs that aren't MR.  Proc is 6dps in mainhand on Hammer, it's a fat fucking zero on Splitblade, and I highly doubt splitblade outdamages hammer by 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">YOU WON!!!<br />
<br />
Got my CHoS and SoTB ;)<br />
<br />
Way lower DPS... and CHoS proc can be full and partiallly resisted 8/<br />
<br />
Not sure yet on that setup, but I still dont give away...<br />
<br />
Lol not anymore 150k as I spent some on the CHoS the SoTB and a LSoY but I think I still got some items for sale plus I could just use the GSoT and sell all my weapons<br />
<br />
So question now is.... way to go on armor? I link my magelo here...<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=899803 <br />
<br />
 Got an ornate mold from a friend 8D but spending like 50k+ on each new mold is something that makes me cry. I spend lot of hours getting that cash, more like weeks, to just burn such amount on a no drop item 8/<br />
<br />
As I said most of my eq exp is with my RL friends (65 ENC 65 PAL 60 CLE 54 MAG 55 MAG 55 WAR &lt;-ding ;) ) so any camp must be something we can do... no big guild making the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The AC means nothing when the mob is hitting your cleric and not you. I'd suggest some procing weapons from the bazaar easily abtainable -<br />
Blade of Carnage Mainly, Copper Hammer, Sword of Bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
From the planes of power, Cord Hilted Spike driver isn't shabby, along with Great blade of Storms, you're set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WTF you took the words right out of my mouth =-| Personally, I can't help but snicker whenever I see someone with that gaudy split blade. That thing is a joke. For a status symbol I'd rather carry around a lammy... at least someone might mistake it for a BoC. In all seriousness, if you're really after looks go for the warrior look - get aggro weapons.<br />
...<br />
Just realized you already did. Good man. I upgraded to SotB and CHoS from some mediocre (aggro-wise) weapons and was blown away. At the moment I use a GBoS + CHoS and like it even more. (GSoT or Sword of the Cryptkeeper is my DPS weapon ^.^)<br />
...<br />
You may consider a Cloak of Greater Pernicity for your back slot. You'd lose some AC, but the gain in STA an HP (and STR &amp; CHA) would be worth it. I take it you don't raid a lot, but you might look into the MQ of Gauntlets of the Myrmidon. Those are the first things that come to mind.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Removed eqitem tags that weren't in database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well ive been using CHoS and SoTB in PoN and PoI (Factory red cons at 55). I cant notice any advantage over SBoD and HoH by now and my dps and my AC and HP are lower. But as I was rarely loosing aggro already I guess its normal I did not perceive advantage.<br />
<br />
But I still cant find when those random procs will be useful... I mean I dont loose agro to cleric when CH me, I rarely loose it when the mob is beign slowed and CHoS/SoTB cant help with that as a proc in the first 30 sec is rare... It is possible that at higher lvl with longuer combats Ill notice some advantage but not by now...<br />
<br />
I pull with my bow and I Below (well whatever the name is the lvl 52? skill) before I get to the camp so that when the mob is slowed I got some good agro and if I loose agro I can taunt and below again...<br />
<br />
Ill keep testing both combos by now, Cant wait to 65 then I will test LSoY/SBoD against CHoS/SoTB<br />
<br />
As always remember im not raiding, just Exp group...<br />
<br />
About cloack of greater pernicity looked at it, but I already got my STR maxed and I always get SHM buffs so I get greater benefit from raw hp as any sta buff maxes it by now... So I keep Stone splinted cloack by now, and CHA? well that will be the last I think ;)<br />
<br />
btw, dps...<br />
SBoD &gt; CHoS if you ask me, I guess I need some parsing here....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your ideas guys, lol now my rallic pack got plenty weapons in it, need to get rid of some but still cant choose one combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Fabel, part of it is also where you are fighting.  Tier 1 PoP is fairly forgiving on aggro, even more so now with the Provoke line.  As you move up in the Planes, that proc aggro becomes more important.  Once you start doing more LDoN it becomes critical.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone else sees a warrior with a splitblade and says &quot;Wow, what a dipshit.&quot;  I saw a 58 warrior trying to trade cash and a Droga weapon for a SBoD last night and I tried to talk him out of it.  Didn't work though and I thought &quot;Wow, what a dipshit.&quot;  As I zoned out of the bazaar, I saw someone else start to try and talk him out of it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well Im keeping all the weps in my bag... just using my AC/DPS weps till I notice agro problems..., it just looks pretty sad every single war need to use the same 2 weps cause agro issues til you are in a guild or can get a big amount of cash for a Boc/SoD or whatever.<br />
<br />
I think in a month or two ill be able to purchase a BoC then prolly Ill go for some Anger Aug on my SBoD.. why? just cause I love it. I can remember first time I saw it beign a newbie... and then see its stats 14 19 wow isnt that wow now. but I still love that wep<br />
<br />
13 20 and 12 19 weps just cause SOE cant figure out how to solve agro issues...  <br />
<br />
Hey you war! you cant have better dps cause your agro sucks!!! No matter ill use my AC and better DPS weps cause Im gonna solo!!! hmm wait !! I cant solo!!!<br />
<br />
$%#·$% SOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wubba Wubba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm gonna go slightly against the grain here.  I am currently in a casual guild, but I am often 2T or 3T with an open raiding guild that does Tier 1-3 PoP bosses.  I also tank for hard LDoNs.<br />
<br />
As I don't have the cash for a BoC (350k+ on Ayone Ro).  I have settled for a CHoS in main and a Horn of Hsagra in off.  Both are augmented with Anger.  I will keep this set-up until I can get a GBoS or gather cash to buy a BoC.<br />
<br />
I find I have plenty of aggro with the set-up and Incite.  I am giving up 0.75 procs a minute in my offhand by not having a proc weapon there, but the ac35 75hp in off-hand is a big plus.  That's ac50 I wouldn't have otherwise- the same as a lot of shields plus you got a bit of dps and Anger proc there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Way lower DPS... and CHoS proc can be full and partiallly resisted 8/<br />
Resists are irrelevant.  Aggro is the same whether it is resisted or not.  You have mentioned resists as being a bad thing several times now, so I think you are not clear on this. <br />
<br />
SBOD is indeed better... if you put Anger 2 on it.  I encourage you to go this route if Anger 2 is available to you.<br />
<br />
You may also wish to look for the Ornate Stone Battle Hammer (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread/t-4806.html), which drops from hard LDON adventures, and is tradeable.  You may find it at a decent price, because it is a garbage weapon for those people who can do hard adventures.  With Anger 2 it is equivalent to a Xanamech hammer.<br />
<br />
As far as the benefit of AC goes, here is the rule of thumb: you take 4% more damage when you drop 100 AC.<br />
<br />
As far as DPS goes: if you really want DPS, then you should not be looking at dual wield at all.  The benefit of dual wield is having more procs and more stats, not DPS.  For maximum DPS buy yourself a War Marshall Bladed Staff for cheap (or a Windblade for far more), and if you have aggro issues then add Anger 2/3 to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well I would just like to know one what is in your normal group? What type of classes (BL, MK,etc) because based on what you have in there might be why you keep agro ok with lower agro weapons. Also would be curious to see how long your fights last cause it the people in the group are fighting slower and blasting slower you might keep agro better too. Also if the people (especially melees) have lower level equipment or are lower level than you are that could mean you can out damage them or close to keep up which means you will keep agro ok. I have a normal group too. A monk, enchanter, druid, necro, and cleric (I am the cleric 2boxing actually) all of us 65 and all of us got pretty good equipment. My roommate who is the monk has the 2H weapon that drops off of the dragon in PoV which has a great ratio. I think it is like in the top 20 of ratios maybe not sure about that and I can Incite, proc 2 or 3 times with my CHSD and my CHoS which both have Anger 2 augs and he can STILL steal agro from me cause he just does tons of damage. I mean he averages doubles of 250 to 300 each round I think. So maybe for your current group in your current situation it is ok but I have to agro is what the warrior is all about. I had to learn a long time agro my agro is nothing compared to Rangers, Monks, BL, and several others but none of them can take a hit like us. I have watched my roommate pull and get one round of hits and loss thousands of hp cause they might be able to avoid damage a little more than me but they can not take a hit like me. So HP and Agro should be your main concerns as a warrior man. The more agro the better. And for me it is not always about are they hitting me or not. Sometimes the push is pishing the mob to a area that will draw adds or a wander is coming and you have to back the mob you are fighting up and if you have enough agro you can pull them anyway but if you only have enough to keep them on you when you pull back they will stay on whoever you are fighting and not follow you.<br />
<br />
One other question? Have you ever tryed LDON with your group? I was like you but in like BOT and having no agro problems what so ever but started doing some LDON and have nothing but agro problems. Especially since it is indoors and casters have to sit. Sitting raises there agro alot and you have to get over that so they can med up. Most of the planes do not have that problem cause of horses. Tactics that is one of the problems there cause it is inside.<br />
<br />
Well that is my 2 cents. Hope it helps something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">no agro problems what so ever but started doing some LDON and have nothing but agro problems <br />
<br />
That's really only place I have &quot;problems&quot; cause everyone wants the mob DEAD NOW !!!!<br />
<br />
I personally can not do duel wield in Ldon High adventures, I have to use a GSoT.  The cleric I group with uses much more mana through a fight duel wielding, sometimes having to do a supernal then a CH, or two supernals then a CH just to catch up.<br />
<br />
I am thinking about getting the Time Worn blade and auging it to 40/35 with anger3.  I believe this may be next weapon upgrade. <br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">keep the split blade and put angar on it. SBoD + angar = poor mans BoC. the ST in my guild uses that with a BoC. <br />
the HoH however has to go. i use to use one and it was an AC crutch. every weapon will look weaker in comparison to those stats, but you really need to give it up for a better DPS weapon or a better agro weapon. <br />
DPS can be a good agro generator. before angar augments and provoke line, i traded a windblade for my WMBS to another warrior in my guild for the burrower ring in deep, he eventually pulled agro on the last fight and got killed. also, not to long after pop opened and also before augments, i use to see alot of warriors pair their BoCs with high DPS weapons like double edged storm blade off agnarr, ifri dagger, and a few using ivory hilted cleaver. most of them, if not all, now use 2h aside from the time lvl warriors that use some odd offhand weapon with their DBotW.</div></div><hr />

And 2 more 54 Magi/50 magi/55 Necro/55 Wiz/50 Pally/65Pally/55 Ranger<br />

We usually fighting by now in PoN/PoD/PoI (factory)/Sebilis/Droga and most of us flagged for PoV/PoS. Chanter and 65 Pally are Tier3..<br />
<br />
btw our chanter rocks :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Got the War Marshall staff and the GsoT and Im not feeling comfortable with 2hnders by now, but  I keep raising my skills. 2hs like 19X and 2hb very very low, like 9X. Im just raising 2hb to try the GSoT. Had no chance cause the 55 req lvl...<br />
<br />
Resists are irrelevant. Aggro is the same whether it is resisted or not. <br />
Someone said Proc is like 6dps... It is no DPS at all  if it is resisted, so resists are not irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Hmm long long time ago I heard hits per minute had more impact on agro than pure DPS hence making DW more valuable for agro and 2h more valuable for DPS . Is that true? If so what is better LSoY (12 17) with anger or SBoD(14 19) with anger. Ratios are close, but LSoY is faster, prolly better for Primary than SBoD, and SBoD prolly better for offhand<br />
<br />
Question CoM/CCoM or Cloack of Flames? Go for that after or before BoC? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your answers guys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ah, think I figured it out (the agro thing that is).<br />
<br />
a) You're hunting in either non-pop zones, or Tier1 PoP zones.  Holding agro in these zones is almost entirely different than that challenges you will soon face in PoS/PoV/CoD.  At 55, if I remember right, you are now able to enter without a flag.  In these zones, getting mobs slowed immediately is not a huge issue.  The hardest you're going to get hit is upper 200's. <br />
<br />
b) You are hunting with mostly burst DPS classes, not beastlords, monks, rogues.  With the exception of the paladin (who's not likely going to get agro unless they are stunning) and the Ranger (who has more agro potential but at 55 isn't going to be a huge agro magnet unless they really want to be), you're fighting with DPS who come into play later in the fight.  I'm sure the DPS casters are not nuking until you've already got a huge solid lead in agro.  Melee DPS cannot afford to wait until a mob is at 75% before engaging.  <br />
<br />
c) Your support class groupmates (61 cleric and 65 enchanter) are overpowered for what you are hunting.  The 61 cleric can easily keep you alive in non-PoP and Tier1 PoP with low-agro HoT spells while you generate enough agro to let the 65 enchanter slow.  Also, it's highly unlikely your chanter is getting many resists on slows or Tashes.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, with a group like that, hunting where you are, you could probably hold agro with a pair of SSoY's and still be just fine.  It's no surprise your DPS weapons are handling the situation so well.<br />
<br />
Since your group can all get into PoV/PoS now, I'm guessing it won't be long until your group is moving up a tier for xp.  Tier1 XP really starts to fall off at mid-50's.  When you get there, you'll be looking at xp mobs that hit 400's and 500's.  It's here where I really started to hate getting riposted - there's nothing like that extra burst damage when you're sitting at 20% to make your day.  It was then that I bagged my dual wield setup for a 2H solution, and it wasn't until I hit 65 that I even attempted to use dual wield again.  <br />
<br />
They'll also have more hit points.  That means if you are using pure DPS for agro, you'll have to do even more damage than you are doing now so the mob doesn't bolt after the slower when slow lands.  That means you're looking at taking damage longer, putting more pressure on the cleric, which means more agro for them too.  Nukers will start engaging earlier too (earlier in terms of mob hp %).  You might also be hunting with DPS melee in their upper 50's to 65, who are going to make your DPS look like rusty daggers. <br />
<br />
When you get to this point (keep in mind this point is today for you - you're just a zone in away from this scenario), you will quickly notice your current preferred weapon setup is going to be very shakey agro.  <br />
<br />
Also, don't forget about LDoN.  I'm guessing once you're 58 your group will be doing plenty of LDoN work.  The DPS weapons aren't going to cut it.  I have a GSo4W which is downright awesome DPS and I can't use it safely in LDoN to tank (though I can in PoV).  I have to use my agro weapons, and hope for early procs.  The time limit in LDoN really pushes people to get their DPS in early and you need to be able to cope with that.  <br />
<br />
The game's going to take a few giant steps in just a few levels for you.  Be prepared.<br />
<br />
In regards to the resists, it's in reference to agro generated by resisted stuns and immune to stuns.  6dps in a 30 second LDoN fight is 180 damage, or less than one overall round of combat of the fight.  In all honesty, my CHoS could proc happy flowers for all I cared, as long as I got the stun agro for the proc.  They DD from the CHoS is icing - it's nice, but it's not the reason I use it.  The agro generated from the DD is really fairly insignificant overall.  <br />
<br />
As for the haste, depends what your current haste is.  If you're at 31% already, you might be able to wait.  CoF is nice, and CoM is nice too.   Keep in mind that if you hunt with that 65 chanter a lot, you're going to be at or very near your max haste anyway.  Personally I'd wait until you're doing higher tier PoP and LDoN and see what you need more, agro through haste or agro through weapon selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Someone said Proc is like 6dps... It is no DPS at all if it is resisted, so resists are not irrelevant. <br />
<br />
 Resists are irrelevant when it comes to aggro. This is why Paladins keep a level 9 stun memorized, why Shamans get pasted faster when they have to recast slows, and why stuff like the CHoS is so in demand.<br />
<br />
 Talking DPS while you play a Warrior is like talking nitrous kits in cars - fun to have, but not necessary to it's operation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Then I am also curious how much AA the chanter has. If he has all of his agro reducing AA then you could take agro from him pretty easy. Back when I was fighting in the zones you are in now, my friend who is my enchanter could pull with slow and with one round of swings I would have agro over him even before I ever auged my weapons. Again being able to use horses and not having to sit is a BIG difference so some of these questions you have about what weapons depends on where do you fight and where you plan to fight in the future. Another thing is since the chanter is pretty high he never gets resisted I bet. When you start fighting things higher level that resist his slows and stuff you will start having more and more agro problems. Me and my group think that the agro reducing AAs only work spells that land cause he gets alot more agro when the mobs resist then they do when it lands right off the bat. You also have to think he is probably landing slow in one cast. There are times when I can go half the fight or more and he still can not get the slows to land on some of the high level mobs and you have to be able to hold agro through a couple of resisted slows. So my thought is if the combo you have now works and you never have agro problems I say save your money. Wait to you start having problems and then look around for what you can get. If you are not having any agro problems now then upgrade your armor and get your HP up so that you can start tanking things you can not tank now and if then you have agro problems then upgrade your weapons is my thought. No use have great agro weapons and can't stay alive to use them. Just my thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">65 shammies and enchanters dont need to debuffs tier1 mobs to slow them. you can probably get away with not using tash/malo in tier2 as well. i 3box in BoT using a beastlord to slow, and less than half resist the first slow. an enchanter could probably just LOOK at a mob and slow it.</div></div><hr />
