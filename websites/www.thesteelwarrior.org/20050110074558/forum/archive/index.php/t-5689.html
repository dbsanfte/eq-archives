<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice chart.  I tried that instanced sewer zone with a pickup group the other day.  Lets just say be at least Vex Thal level equiped and have a really good group or it is very hard.  We did ok until our puller got 2 adds and then the cleric went down and we wiped.  Also might want to have a necro or sk or rogue in group to get bodies if you wipe since stuff here repops fairly fast and a lot of random things see invisible.  We ended up aborting it so we could get our bodies since we couldn't get to them.  This zone would be pretty good as a one group experience zone if you stayed close to the zone in and didn't care about winning though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is purely pre-ssra with some BoT tower and LDoN high risk stuff and experience. However, we have 5-9 ish people that play together constantly (which makes up most of the active roster, heh).<br />
<br />
Our group finished the Purifying Plant expedition on the third try. First try was totally blind, and we even used gamesh which assured us we wouldnt get anywhere since we didn't know =)<br />
<br />
Second time, we did pretty good. Made a dumb mistake near the mite room, and lost our cleric. Losing your only rezzer is a total pain in the ass btw. Also, there was a named mob in sight, which really bummed us out. heh.<br />
<br />
Third time, we had a scary moment or two, but still with not much spoiler info, we managed to beat it.. and even scored one of the nice earrings (and a 65 ranger spell that rotted =p )<br />
<br />
Funny part was the end boss was almost easier than his 9 guards (which, those guards musta underwent a change, cause we were told to make sure we snare them, but they were immune.. they also had another nice little surprise we were not ready for too. hehe). I did use Stonewall tho, so that made a rather big difference.<br />
<br />
Point of all this is, if you are a pretty well equiped, but lower &quot;tier&quot; guild like us, and you have your heads screwed on straight you can beat at least the first expedition.. not sure how hard the next ones are =)<br />
<br />
FYI - the &quot;win&quot; group was all 65's Cleric, Warrior, Bard, Monk, Druid, and a drunk Chanter =p<br />
<br />
Could see doing it with a pretty wide variety of classes tho... but for us, the cleric and warrior prolly mandatory right now =)<br />

65 druid for evac<br />
65 cleric full ft damn good mana pool<br />
65 ench 170+ aa's<br />
+ 2 random melee do well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That group should be okay, provided people know what they're doing.  <br />
<br />
Fortitude, Nimble, Voidance are your friends on the boss mobs.  So is Stonewall.  It's great to hear guildchat:  &quot;This guy is impossible for our 10.6K Paladin, we need a Warrior here.&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh yeah, you need someone who can pull singles, but I assume you know that.  Crowd control is nice, but if you're constantly pulling multiples, it's going to kill you sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sealody</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That group would be more then enough to geto Kodtaz.<br />
<br />
We got our flag there (kodtaz flag) with only cleric and druid backup healing. This is with a monk as the tank.  Yes, this included the bosses during and at the end of the expeditions.<br />
<br />
Chanter isn't needed btw, less you looking for pets.  We didn't have one, almost everything was single pulled and we stayed well ahead of repops.  (Hint... Druid can pet also... it wasn't worth the trouble tho, at least for us.)<br />
<br />
Sea!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found the Sewers trials extremely exciting but very doable by a 'above-average' group of tactical players, as Cily mentioned.  A time Paladin could easily do all the trials as main tank - discs are nice, but with the HPs/AC the Paladin is likely to have, you should've have any problems, considering they can easily hold agro so the Cleric/Healer can start CHing prior to mob engage (that was the one key mistake I see a lot of pickup group clerics making; they start healing too late and unless your tank has 9k+ HP, a few unlucky 1k rounds or a hasted mob can put you down fast.  Thank god for Furious Disc.) ;)<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, remember to have someone annul or what not mobs on inc, because a fair number do in fact get hasted and it makes a big difference (well, for someone around my level anyway, 8500ish HP).<br />
<br />
Also as Sealody mentioned, an Enchanter is not needed at all in my experience, and in fact I'd highly recommend trying to find a good Shaman instead (just get VoQ beforehand if mana will be an issue).  The additional slow amount and increased 'tankability' of a shaman to get slows landed faster makes a huge difference.  And their haste should cap out pretty much everyone who will be trying these expeditions anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think monk is actually preferable to Knight for the Tipt boss because you can Voidance and then Stonestance while you're getting the boss slowed.  Knights have no way of keeping aggro while being invulnerable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh aye Phantron, you're probably right (I've not personally done the Tipt boss fight yet).  I didn't mean to imply a Knight would be ideal per se, because some discs really make or break a fight, just that for the Sewers quests at least, a Time Paladin should've have a problem (and beyond if there's enough healing).<br />
<br />
Worst thing that would happen Dobbo is you'd die and learn something and have to try again &gt;&lt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of those encounter seems to be designed around /disc fortitude or the equivalent.  There's just no way to deal with some of the boss's unslowed (or worse, hasted) DPS unless you have 3 healers in one group or something like that.  This makes warriors, and even monks, far superior to Knights on bosses.  And /defensive is huge on something that hits from 200-2000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to clear something up, Stonestance/Earthwalk and Voiddance (and Whirlwind, for that matter) are all on the one timer for monks, so noone can use any of these discs back-to-back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have attempted the 2 sewers that last 2 nights, both cleared to the big room, then no mobs there to kill.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the group hailed the NPC inside the sewers, once told us he was busy, other time he said he was doing research.<br />
<br />
Is there a preflag before you can get the mobs at end of sewers to spawn, or some event you need to do to trigger them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Evasive/Fortitude is not on the same timer so I thought monk is the same way.  But the point still stands that the 10 seconds a monk doesn't take damage is far more useful than whatever HP/AC you have on a Knight, unless you're willing to sacrifice a slower (Knight aggro do not help here because you can't aggro the boss until he's slowed unless you want to die).  If you're going to screw up on the bosses you're most likely going to mess up in the first 10 seconds trying to slow him.  Not that they're pushover slowed, of course.  Have heard of Knights being one rounded even slowed since they don't have defensive to help them out, but it's definitely a lot more manageable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My regular group is all 65 with average 150 AA-Bard, Shammy, Wiz, Druid, Mag and WAR (me).  We've been grouping for well over a year together and are doing ldon hards successfully w/o deaths.  What are our chances doing some of these instances?  I'm able to buff them with a 65 ench/62 cleric prior to starting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where exactly are these trials?  I've been around the 4 zones(Qinimi and the others) but where do i find the entrances to these trials? What about expeditions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can do LDoN hard without deaths, you've a pretty good chance to get through all the trails that do not have a boss at the end.  The ones that do have a boss is really dependent on the gear of the tank involved.  Under a certain amount of HP it just becomes infeasible to pull off a win.  <br />
<br />
The hardest boss is Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru, the boss of Tipt.  Hits for 200-2000 (might be a little bit less), yellow con so he dual wields.  Can be slowed but probably mitigates some (he sure still hits pretty fast).  If you can beat him you can beat any of the other trial too, at least from a tanking perspective.  Of course, Tipt is the hardest trial.  Some other trials don't even have a boss (like Creamtory, Lair, Vxed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok first off to acquire a trial you must speak to the High Priest in Barundi. If you have never talked to him or hailed, hailing him 2x will give you the first trial. These trials are not timed based for the most part and you can swap out people in your group during the trial if people have to leave.<br />
<br />
Hailing the High Priest he will give the person who has hailed the lowest trial he has not completed yet. Say you have never done a trial, you will get trial 1. If you have done trial one and 4, you will get trial 2. If you have done anyone one other than 1, you will get 1. <br />
<br />
You will not recieve a Real Flag unless you do them in order. If you happen to do them out of order you will recieve temp flags. Make sure your entire party is in the zone at completion or they will not recieve a flag. <br />
<br />
And one final hint having a rogue with you on all trials makes them 100x easier. There is respawn during these trials.<br />
<br />
Trial #1 - Purifying Plant <br />
<br />
This trial involves clear or invis/ivu running to Anashu. Once you get to Anashu the leader of the expedition hails. This should spawn 8 Aged Stonemites. Head ivu/invis/clear to these mobs(in stonemite room if you have map).<br />
<br />
Trash mobs on this trial tend to hit for 1200max and the golems are unslowable.<br />
<br />
The Aged Stonemites must be killed to spawn the final boss. The Aged Stonemites hit triple 1200 or so and ae rampage. Fight them in one of the corner in the room where they spawn left of stairs is where we did. You can only cast on them from above water so, but good thing is you can melee them from above water so best way is to lev above the water and fight them. The AE rampage range is small so keep casters away and cleric especially. <br />
<br />
After killing these 8 Ancient Kyosops (Spelling?) spawns and will autopull to your group so hold off killing last Aged till ready. The Ancient Quads 1400 and flurries only hits 981 on defensive war. From what I remember they are all slowable. Once he dies your done and recieve flag.<br />
<br />
If you die, as long as one person stays in zone the expedition won't reset(not sure on time but happened last night). The Aged Stonemites will not respawn so invis/ivu/run etc to them for cr etc till they are dead. Dunno what happens if you wipe on Ancient.<br />
<br />
Trial #2 - The Crematorium<br />
<br />
Ok this one you kill random junk trash mobs till you recieve 4 different remains(Yogundi, Mabiki, Nyogi, and Taloki). Make sure if you have Rogue with you he collects these or else you have to race at the end.<br />
<br />
Trash mobs on this trial start off hitting 500-600max and towards end are a little more resistant and hit upwards of 1k.<br />
<br />
Once you have these 4 pieces you head to furnace area if you have map where the ovens are. Have the rogue run out into middle of oven area to spawn the 4 Ghosts. These ghosts are cake they can be single pulles by me of all people and hit for around 900 and cast random junk.<br />
<br />
Each time a Ghosts dies a Will-o-wisp spawns DO NOT KILL THESE. These will start travelling upon each ghosts death to the Gem room on the map. Once last ghost dies you have to race these back to the gem room or if you are smart and brought rogue its cake. The Named ghosts depsawns fairly quickly so you have to move fast good thing rogue can out move the will-o-wisps.<br />
<br />
Once these arrive in gem room they will coalesce into a named ghost. Turn in the 4 remains to him bam your done.<br />
<br />
Trial #3 - ??? I forget ???<br />
<br />
Ok if you do not have rogue on this trial you are in for a world of hate, and a long ass trial. Before entering this trial the HP will give you a seal to use. Rogue is only person required to get it and you can recieve it again if you quit during. Does not have to be a rogue but like I said if you dont your in a world of hurt.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a rogue clear to last room on the map and talk to NPC there. He will tell you you need 3 Shaping tools which can be gotten from the Coccoon room(SE Bottom room), Wheel Room(SW Bottom Room) and Entrance of this Dungeon(Middle Bottom Room). These are not labeled on Map but easily distinguishable. This NPC is hard to see he is under debris trapped.<br />
<br />
Once you do the turn in the 218 or so mobs in the zone despawn to about 1/4 of what they were before. Kill mobs in each room till you see emote that you got a tool then move to next room.<br />
<br />
Once you have all 3 tools send rogue or if you like pain clear run to final NPC and hail. Then say something along the line of I have your Shaping tools. Blam your done got flag evac clear or whatever out.<br />
<br />
Trial #4 - it was 5 am I totally forget<br />
<br />
Ok Named npc spawns about 3 rooms in go and hail him he will tell you he needs 4 map pieces. Upon talking to him a named Slime Cube spawns in the very last room on the map(go figure). Head clear/invis/ivu or whatever to this room. Kill the cube pretty cake hits 1k or so.<br />
<br />
Upon killing this slime cube 6 more cubes spawn through out the dungeon, funny thing noon in the room you are currently in. Head back killing parts of slime cube on the way till you loot 4 map pieces. Once you have 4 map pieces (remember rogue loot) turn them in to npc blam your done.</div></div><hr />
