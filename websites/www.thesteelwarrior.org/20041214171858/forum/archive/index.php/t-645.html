<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note: This is NOT for discussion of &quot;what needs to be done&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is simply a small poll on if an AA should be required to let warriors do their job.<br />
<br />
We all know PoP is a problem, the major reason is that warriors have no way to reliably gain initial agro at the beginning of the fight, unlike hybrid tanks.  However, I don't see this as a PoP-only problem.  This problem never started in PoP, it simply became more prevalent because:<br />
1. You NEED that initial agro for the slower/healer to do their job fast, or else they get hurt/killed.<br />
2. Mobs that hit as hard as PoP mobs were mainly in the high end fights in previous expansions.  Now, much more casual and lower level warriors are fighting mobs that hit this hard.<br />
<br />
Lower level warriors suffer from the same problem, and many if not all don't have the equipment (or the same type of equipment) as higher end warriors, making the problem compounded.<br />
<br />
I don't want this to be a discussion on what needs to change.  Many suggestions made by all parties involved seem to give the &quot;solution&quot; as a new AA.  Not discussing whether these ideas are any good or not, lets hear about if warriors as a whole overall should be required to buy an AA in order to do their job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">supposedly we have the tools to do our job now, those being our defense skill, our taunt skill and the range of weapons and high AC armour available to us.<br />
<br />
If 'fixing' the warrior class requires a new skill to be added then I think if the tool is class defining then warriors shouldnt have to earn it via AA's or whatever, if it is something that merely improves a skill / ability we already have then go-go AAs.<br />
<br />
Either way we wouldnt be the first class whose roll changes dramatically with AA's.  Who wants to group with a ranger these days that doesnt have AM3 / EQ ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd rather they give us something along the lines of an innate ability that can be improved upon through aa's. (much like the /shielding line, a base value and something better for those able to commit time to improve themselves.)<br />

<br />
Nothing is more frustrating then trying to taunt a mob off of some crazy caster running around like a chicken with it's head cut off.   Everytime you go to hit taunt (and pray to the RNG gods), the caster takes off dragging the mob out of range.  By increasing the range, we will have a chance to save the caster.<br />
<br />
I would like to think that the caster would know by now that running is really not the best solution, but some never learn. <br />

AA's should make our job &quot;better&quot; or &quot;easier&quot; or however.<br />
