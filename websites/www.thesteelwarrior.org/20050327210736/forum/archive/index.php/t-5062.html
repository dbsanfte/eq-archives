If you thought your pullers died alot before on pulls just wait.  You have to be on your toes as you cna expect up to 10 mobs in the camp at any given time.  We use a Pally to MA the trash while our warriors do the kings and this works for us.  Just did the ring the other day and completed it in a little over 1 hour.  <br />
<br />
1) Make sure your encs/bards are ready to mez on command and lock down everything asap.<br />
<br />
2) be ready to rez pullers alot.<br />
<br />
3) Spellsheild and rune help a TONNE on the last kings which proc a 5k hp tap.  <br />
<br />
4) this has to be one of the funnest events I have done in EQ, and it is never boring 8D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate that event, so much trash to clear and it's a pain that the whole thing is timed, had Bert despawn literally at 2% one of the times but now I think we clear the trash way faster, either way annoying to wipe on Bert and have to recover with the chance of all that time being wasted.  Oh and a little info would be 12 kings (3 waves of 4 at each direction)+ Bert + lots of trash within I think we timed it at 2hours and 12mins(maybe?) not sure off the top of my head, originally thought it was 2 hours but then once we went way over to about 2hours and 12mins or so I think.<br />
<br />
Like the above poster said rune/ss chain on the MTfor the last 4 kings is ideal.  For Bert himself, we corner tank him in the main room, pull with ramp tank(single target) MT tags, quick chain on the MT or just spam heals and a few to watch the RT.  Bert puts out pretty good dps, 1900ish max hit(no disc) quad unslowable.  If all your healers just focus on keeping the MT/RT up including spot heals and such he's not too bad, not much hp at all and his AE is a splurt, usually doesn't start hurting much until after Bert is dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tough event and kinda frustrating, but for a VT level guild, it shouldn't be too bad.  Everything is undead, so Necromancers can assist in mezzing.  Having a solid Enchanter/Necro/Bard lockdown crew is essential for this unless you plan on offtanking 10+ mobs every time.  It's usually a good idea to have a monk or &quot;Kamikaze&quot; to run in and break up the spawns in the rooms, as they all spawn on top of each other.  None of the kings are that hard, but the later ones will lifetap for 5k, and that can get very nasty.  <br />
<br />
Bertox is another matter all by himself.  He doesn't have that many hp.  In fact, he doesn't have that many more than the kings, but his melee dps is rather insane.  He quads for 1900 (1100's in Defensive).  The entire key of this fight is keeping your Rampage tank alive.  Bertox ramps a lot and it's like keeping two MT's alive the entire fight.  If you don't pay attention to rampage, he'll burn through your entire raid on that premise alone.  <br />
<br />
Other than that, it's dps dps dps.  It's roughly a two hour event with a lot of trash killing, so good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We always have 2 MA's, usually Pally's.  We have groups 1-5 assist one MA and groups 6-12(if we have that many) assist the other.  Chanters and Bards lock down the rest as the monks train the shit outta the raid.  Have everyone(except MA's and Chanters) jump on the King when it gets to camp.  Having Pally's doing the MA'ing also clears up your Warriors to just worry about the Kings.  Last Bertoxx event I 'think' we did in like an hour and 20 mins if that.  Was really damn fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the spawn breaks, I really suggest using a DAd/HSd knight. It's not entirely uncommon for the breaker to eat 3-5 1250+ Harm touches, plus initial melee rounds + potental nukes started at the break. Many monks will just fold under this, and res-rebuff is wasted time and mana. <br />
<br />
Last time I was a guest with someone doing this, we just rushed the spawns, sending in one of the knights to break. We won, so I suppose it's a valid strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually just send a monk to pull large amounts of mobs (monks die a lot in our guild) and have everything mezed or offtanked by pallies while a warrior MA picks targets.  IF your people are paying attention and up to par then the clearing should go quick and easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zxcvasdf</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies, I really appreciate it. <br />
<br />
Now, just another question, where does the 12 kings spawn at, and most importantly where will Bertox spawn at? In the big area or at those multiple 'tunnels' along the ends of the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The kings spawn at the summoners east, west, north and south. Bert spawns in the east end of the room you port down in, right next to the pedestal thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to remember, after king 8 dies, king 9 pops immedietly on top of him.  Remember that. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's only if you kill at the spawn point of the King(killing 8th starts next 4 wave), don't remember that happening with my guild ever, pulling kings to the main room.</div></div><hr />
