<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I did something stupid last night.  Two-boxing my warrior and my beastlord on a couple of LDoN missions, I accidentally flipped to the wrong hotkey page on my warrior.  And spent one and a half of those two missions without a taunt key.  When I finally discovered my error, I had already spent all of my endurance trying to compensate for my suddenly bizarrely bad aggro--and thus effectively did the last half of the LDoN mission without Incite.<br />
<br />
Which gives me a big red face, and some first-hand experience with Taunt vs. Incite.<br />
<br />
Bottom line?  Taunt is essential.  And Incite does virtually nothing for my aggro in practice.<br />
<br />
Now, I've got some odd and probably atypical advantages.  I use my beastlord's slow to pump aggro for my warrior, making Taunt effectively a plus-600-or-so-hate command if it works the first time.  And we're only doing LDoN normal, so it's acceptable for the Beastlord to be tanking for a few rounds, even without defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
But working without taunt, it was literally impossible to hold aggro.  Even using Incite twice per mob.  Even when my weapons (CHoS/SotB, un-aug'ed) proc'd twice near the beginning of the fight.  The mob would still ping-pong to virtually anyone else in the party rather than stay on me.<br />
<br />
With Taunt, but with no Incite?  I don't think I lost aggro more than twice in the remaining 25 minutes of that LDoN mission, and that only for brief moments and only to an early snare by the ranger, or a resisted slow by my beastlord.<br />
<br />
Incite is nice, if you're pulling; by the time the mob gets back to camp, you've got a free 500 hate on it.  But honestly, that's not enough (even with the first-melee bonus) to make a slow-on-incoming not pull aggro.  It's not enough to let the ranger snare whenever he wants to.  In short, it doesn't actually change the pattern of the fight in any significant way.<br />
<br />
If I'm waking a mezzed mob, and I miss my taunt, I have a choice.  I can wait around until one of my taunts is successful, at which point I don't actually need Incite to hold aggro.  Or I can Incite and then break mez, at which point it promptly heads over and beats on the Enchanter.<br />
<br />
When I was playing without Taunt, it got to the point where I'd triple-slow a mezzed mob with my beastlord, so that at least it would pull onto the beastlord when mez broke, rather than onto the enchanter.<br />
<br />
Playing without Incite?  If I taunt it successfully, after the chanter has tashed and mezzed it and the beastlord has slowed it, *nobody* is going to pull aggro from me, Incite or not.<br />
<br />
*sigh*  I really wish that they had given us a version of Incite that cost 3x the endurance, or had a 1-minute reuse timer, but that did more hate than a tash or a slow or a mez.  Something that could actually be used, even if only rarely or at high cost, to ensure aggro for the warrior.<br />
<br />
Because as Incite stands, the most it ever does for me is to make it possible for me to be a little more sloppy, a little less careful.  It doesn't actually change anything about a typical LDoN normal fight.  And I don't think, from my experience, that it would change that many things about other XP-grind fights.<br />
<br />
Hear that, SOE?  Give us an Incite that costs four times as much END, that has a two-minute cycle time--and that gives us 800 hate instead of 400.  That's what I call a useful ability.<br />

Even with only barely adequate weapons (no augs, no WA at all), I am able to hold aggro extremely well using only Taunt, and adding Incite doesn't seem to make any actual difference.<br />
<br />
If I had a CHSD and a GBoS, each with Anger III, and WA 5, I can't imagine how Incite could do anything at all for me in a non-raid situation.  Which, if you will recall, was where Incite was supposed to help our desirability vs. knights.<br />
<br />
OTOH, I grouped with an elemental-geared knight a few weeks ago.  He had more trouble holding aggro in normal LDoN than I do.  So...mmmm.  I'm glad for the 5% mitigation bonus (extremely glad), and Sturdiness, and unlinked disciplines.  But I'm just not sold on the idea that Incite actually solves any real problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite's great. As the bard mentioned, it's pretty much required for yanking agro off a puller when them getting hit is a disaster waiting to happen. I did an LDoN hard today with a bard that has pretty crappy gear, and incite was all that kept him alive on this pulls. Eventually I had to take over pulling, since I can't incite two mobs at once. :)<br />
<br />
I agree that taunt is a good skill. Back before I had an attack indicator, I could often be found holding agro simply with well-timed taunts and no attack on at all.<br />
<br />
That said, incite is exactly what it says it is -- 400 instant agro plus a bit down the road. Another LDoN today (normal this time), I was faced off against a rogue with an Ifir that averages 250 DPS and another rogue that regularly pushes 200 DPS. Despite my very nice agro setup, they would pull agro from me anytime they failed an evade. Incite, if it was available, got it back instantly, though.<br />
<br />
My conclusion? Incite is great for when you're riding the agro line, and just need a bit of a boost to lock a mob on you that is otherwise flipping a bit. The new Health of Target's Target ability has made this very clear to me, since I can see agro switches instantly, and know who it's switching too.<br />
<br />
If you have crappy agro, taunt can keep you in line, especially if you can use debuffs to boost your agro on a successful taunt like you're doing. Incite will never fix that. Keep in mind, though, debuffs are a fixed source of agro. The debuff from an EP enchanter generates just as much agro as the debuff from one who geared themselves in the bazaar. On the other hand, EP-equipped and above melee generate far more agro than these debuffs, whereas poorly equipped melee are easy to out-taunt (as long as they are poorly equipped without being stupid equipped!).<br />
<br />
Once you're dealing with melee who put out more agro than your beastlord generates, taunt will become useless to you. All it will do is ride you to the top over the ranger, rogue, or monk who is, blow for blow, generating consistently more agro than you can. Incite can give you a lead, and it's the only skill we have that can give you that lead on demand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just remember it may not look like much, but just like the hp on your gear, it adds up.</div></div><hr />

Unless you pull with dots, a single arrow tag works to aggro the mob off you, just as a single incite does. Assuming you run past the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would have edited but still, Incite acts goofy if your not meleeing which is dumb. If I incite a mob for &quot;400 aggro&quot; and another tank beside me lobs an arrow at it and is closer to the mob then me, it goes for the ranger. A single arrow is not 400 hate. I just wish it was more reliable instead of acting weird if not meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently the Incite/Bellow line is bugged like some SK spells, and does only 1 aggro from outside melee range.  For this reason I do not use it outside of melee range. (except on rooted mobs before we are ready to engage, but even then I try to stay as close as possible)<br />
<br />
What I do is intercept mobs as they come in.  Autoattack, slam/kick, taunt, and bellow give you four chances to hit the mob before it runs past.  As Besrikarle mentioned, have the puller run past you out of melee range, and the mob won't even hit them if they pulled with a low aggro spell/skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A number of problems with that.<br />
<br />
Many times I am rounding a corner so arrows are not an option. <br />
<br />
Bows (other than the vallen zek bow) make crap range items vs the ones my tanks use.<br />
<br />
In Ikkinz raids I can get jizzed in a blink of an eye ( I buff to just under 10k) if I have a archer on me and agro is not taken more reliably than with an arrow. And yes I am well aware of how to use fade. In god raids pullers die very often though so many times we are pulling OOM.<br />
<br />
In other words,<br />
<br />
Incite is 100x more reliable than an arrow. I know this first hand as someone who has been pulling for years now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite/Bellow is nothing more than an initial aggro grabber.  The amount of hate it generates over the course of a fight is what, 1-2 procs worth?  Having 3 procs on each weapon (Anger/Anger III/Pestilence Shock, and Timesnap/Anger III/Pestilence Shock, WA5, etc) makes the hate over time from the Inicite line nearly obsolete (but of course I still use it; even tiny edges in hate generation are worth using).  Incite is godly for pulling, pulling an incomming mob off the puller, or getting the mob to run to you instead of prox aggroing on someone that's standing too far out.  It is unreliable at best for getting back aggro once you've lost it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on why you lost agro. Lost it to a wizard? Good luck getting it back with incite, you might or you might not. Lost it to a rogue? You can almost certainly get agro back with Incite unless they have some nasty agro proc and that's why you lost it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaiel is right.  Incite is to grab aggro.  Taunt and weapon procs are to keep it.  What's more, your &quot;experiment&quot; is a bit flawed.  You can't say Incite doesn't work in a group setting since there are only two characters in the test and you're playing both.  You invariably have worked out a way for your BL to do his job with minimal aggro.  In a full group, which even you yourself said Incite was intended for, it works just fine.  You have pullers pulling, healers healing, debuffers debuffing and others just doing damage ... not one other person whom you control.  When I came back and started using Incite on a regular basis in group settings, I can easily grab and hold aggro where I had difficulty before ... even with knights in the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also use an un-auged CHoS and SotB (well CHoS has heated blade), and even using taunt and incite I don't have near perfect aggro control.  The reality is when grouping with me, other members of the group need to pay attention to aggro in order to keep it off them.  It doesn't help when group members don't understand proximity aggro and are also using weapons like a CHoS.  The reality is if you have a good group and you use the tools given to you, you should be able to keep aggro no problem, but you need to use both taunt and incite.<br />
<br />
Off topic, is a BoC a significantly better aggro weapon than a SoD?  I'm looking at picking up one of those weapons to help with aggro....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep seeing people posting in agro threads with unaugmented weapons. The general concensus is that erither a) A3 id to expensive to put on 2 weapons that will likely be upgraded soon or b) they are saving up points for A3.<br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion for anyone who doesn't have aunger augs - buy 2x A2 for non-end game weapons. You can get 2 A2 augs for less than the price of a single A3. You will have what better agro control since you will be at least doubling the number of procs you get. Sure, A3 is still far superior, but it won't hurt as much when you upgrade your weapon and bag an aug you spent 1150 points on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Few comments:<br />
<br />
1) Sk spell isn't 'bugged' to generate 1 aggro outside of melee range.  It's a deliberate design decision to nerf an exploit of SKs tanking rooted mobs by running out of range of summon but staying on aggro list.  The fact that incite shares this same issue could be considered an oversight/bug.<br />
<br />
2) Warrior/Beast is probably the worse comparison towards aggro.  Beastlord warder procs (I assume you were using those?) Have added effects that give hate to their pets CASTER.  Plus beastlords have no innate way of shedding hate.  (One of the few classes who don't.)  This just made the lack of taunt even more pronounced then it normally would be and ironically made the best hate generating duo into the worse.  On most raids a beastlords warder is the highest aggro thing around and you can 'taunt' to the top of the warder aggro even if you already have the mobs attention to ensure the mob never leaves you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice is to stop trying to make incite into something more than it is.<br />
<br />
Incite isn't meant to place you at the top of the hate list.  Incite is meant to help you stay there AFTER you reach the top of the hate list.  And it does a good job of that.<br />
<br />
In general, there is no point in inciting a mob that you are already meleeing, unless you are at the top of the hate list.  Your melee and procs are much better aggro-over-time than incite.<br />
<br />
There are a few times you might want to use incite when you're not at the top of the hate list:<br />
<br />
- When an add is rooted/mezzed, incite it early on.  That way your hate is ticking up on the mob while it sits there untouched.  Re-incite each time it is re-mezzed/re-rooted.  Once you get around to engaging that mob, or if the root/mez breaks, chances are good that you'll be at the top of the hate list already.<br />
<br />
- When a mob is being pulled, obviously, incite is your ranged aggro skill, and it works fairly well for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having stuck a 510pt Ykesha stun proc (no longer knocks back mobs) on my BoW at first, I highly recommend it or even the cheaper one for folks who are holding off on buying Anger 3. The stun probably generates just as much agro no matter which version you have, so it's a cheap way to get some decent agro added to your weapons. <br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I haven't tested the cheapest or the most expensive version of Ykesha, just the middle one, but I haven't seen any evidence that stun isn't a fixed amount of agro regardless of additional effects. Sticking the 510pt stun on my BoW significantly increased it's agro, it was generating less agro than a dual-wielding warrior with OSoW and BoC, both augmented with Anger 3 -- and the Ykesha proc changed that so that I generate substantially more agro (both me and the other warriors have WA 5).<br />
<br />
I added Anger 3 to it last night and will be interested to see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's really hard to verify if Incite works at range or not.  It always took extra aggro to move a mob, and 400 aggro is simply not enough to move a mob.  I guess one way you can test it would be to have someone pull a mob, and then you incite, and someone else shoot an arrow and get closer, and then see if mob turns to you when you get into melee range, which it should if Incite was doing its full aggro at range.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't use it out of melee range unless I'm pulling anyway.</div></div><hr />

Pull a mob from range 99 with incite.  Have someone do a 20 pt DD on inc.  If mob makes bee-line for caster...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also enough agro to move a mob. I frequently move mobs that have been tashed, slowed, crippled and mezzed -- simply by landing a successful taunt, breaking mez and inciting.<br />
<br />
If I don't incite, the mob will always flip to the chanter, assuming the chanter is standing next to it.<br />

If I do incite, it follows me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify: it wasn't just my warrior and beastlord, it was a full LDoN group, including a cleric, a ranger, an enchanter, and a mage. <br />
<br />
As for buying Anger II (or even Anger III) augs; if I were going to buy any aug, I'd buy a single Anger III for my CHoS, figuring it'll be a while before I can upgrade it (even if I get a GBoS, which can be obtained from pickup raids).  That adds two more PPM, raising my total PPM from 3 to 5; putting a hate aug on the offhand only adds 1 PPM more.  So for efficiency, only aug the primary hand weapon; but since I tend to take the long view on efficiency, and expect to be at least offhanding my CHoS for quite some time, I'd make it an Anger III rather than an Anger II.<br />
<br />
The only reason I haven't done so is that with both Taunt and Incite, my aggro is more than sufficient for normal LDoN, and I'd rather have 40 more HP than better aggro at this point.  When I finally have enough defensive AA to tank Hard LDoN, I'll buy an Anger III aug; but I'll obtain a GSot4W first, and put it on that, to minimize riposte damage.<br />

P.S. I'm told that riposte damage is significant enough in Hard LDoN to make a GSot4W a better option than CHoS/SotB.  Is this true?  Or am I better off putting that Anger III into my CHoS, in which case I may do so earlier rather than later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;If I had a CHSD and a GBoS, each with Anger III, and WA 5, I can't imagine how Incite could do anything at all for me in a non-raid situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, that's my set-up.  I don't have both auged with Anger III yet, and I don't have all the levels of WA, but close enough for government work.  And I like Incite, a lot.  <br />
<br />
Incite is very useful, in several ways.  First, any aggro addition is helpful.  Second, I use incite to pull solo mobs, much faster and easier than a bow, and better aggro.  Third, probably most importantly, incite helps when taunt fails and you get a bad run on the RNG on your procs.  Fourth, incite is very useful when someone accidentally grabs aggro from you .. incite first, then taunt, and you are much more likely to get aggro back quickly.  <br />
<br />
Note the order.  It's a different order than I use at the beginning of the fight, because I find that, the farther behind I am in aggro, the more likely it is that taunt will fail.  You don't believe me?  Leave /pet taunt on, and after the halfway point of a fight see how often pet taunt causes a mob to change targets.  Answer:  never.  If you are too far behind in aggro, the first taunt does nothing, it almost always fails.  <br />
<br />
I don't use incite all the time, on every mob, or every time it ungreys.  But I do use it regularly, and I like it.  <br />

Beastlord warder procs (I assume you were using those?) Have added effects that give hate to their pets CASTER<br />
<br />
If i'm reading this right, this isn't true.  Beastlord warders were specifically designed to generate tons off aggro, they proc mini enraging blow+ mini anarchy every 8 seconds or so.  They however have their own place on hate lists and do not transfer that aggro to the caster.  If they did, beastlords would always be tanking everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question is:  Do you know how agro and hate work in EQ?<br />
<br />
There is proximity agro.  If you are close to the mob, you have temporary &quot;bonus&quot; hate.  This is only true if you are already on the mobs list (because you hit it with an arrow or incited it.)<br />
<br />
This value (prox agro bonus) is very LARGE.<br />
<br />
This is the exact reason you sometimes can't pull a mob out of a group of melee classes beating on the mob.  You might be on the top, but you are not high enough ABOVE them to run away and the mob will follow you.  This is why you need to run back, beat on the mobs some more, throw another incite, then run back into the corner again.<br />
<br />
I have NO trouble using SK ranged agro (from an SK friend) and Incite at a distance.  They DO work, and they do not lose any points of hate.</div></div><hr />

Were you playing EQ when guilds who could not kill the Archliche normally were doing so with ShadowKnights?  <br />
<br />
If you were, do you know why the process stopped and what change was made?<br />
<br />
kkthx.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I considered the possibility that pure hate abilities/spells not functioning normaly at range was intentional, but considering you can still accomplish the goal of aggroing mobs from a distance using another spells, I think bug fits it well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheHuzMan</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo box my warrior with a shammy a lot. Huzy is using a Split Blade of Destruction and a Shortblade of Lightning. Both are un-augmented, so I have no hate procs. To start the fight I have Huzy pull with a bow, and hit Incite as soon as the mob hits camp. <br />
<br />
I have found incite to be a great help. Incite allows the shammy to start slowing the mob as soon as the mob gets into camp. Huzy either doesn't lose aggro at all, or loses it for half a second. Before incite came along Huzy would have been guaranteed to lose aggro until the next successful taunt.<br />
<br />
Using both incite and taunt I can also quickly follow up with a DoT from the shammy. Before Incite, I had to wait a few seconds to let Huzy get aggro before casting the DoT. <br />
<br />
Does 400 free hate points at the start of a fight make a difference? You betcha! It's was always the start of the fight where I had most trouble getting aggro in the pre-incite days.</div></div><hr />

If I incite, and it didn't grab aggro (which is often since I group with an SK and shaman) &quot;then&quot; tuant, I've wasted my endurance, trumped my own incite, and the SK has no problem overcoming my 1 point hate list lead.<br />
<br />
Successful tuant, &quot;then&quot; add 400 hate on top of that.<br />
<br />
All too often I've had the shaman slow, and incite was not enough.  It's definately no where near enough when grouping with my SK friend.  He pulls with Darkness.  And now recently, if he doesn't pull with Darkness, he Darknesses the mob after it's gotten to camp... even if it's a mob that won't run.  The reason he does this is because he knows I'm using his aggro to piggy back off from, which I'll explain below.  If it wasn't him, I'd use the shaman's slow to piggy back off from.<br />
<br />
If the shaman slows right off the bat:<br />
<br />
Hate list<br />
----------<br />
shaman 1000<br />
me 0-300 (depends on how many cleaves I've gotten in before slow)<br />
<br />
if I incite:<br />
<br />
Hate list<br />
----------<br />
shaman 1000<br />
me 400-700<br />
<br />
then tuant:<br />
<br />
Hate list<br />
----------<br />
shaman 1000<br />
me 1001<br />
<br />
Endurance wasted, might as well have not even hit incite.<br />
<br />
So I opted for this method instead, and the reason the SK darknesses every mob:<br />
<br />
slowed:<br />
<br />
Hate list<br />
----------<br />
shaman 1000<br />
me 0-300<br />
<br />
tuanted:<br />
<br />
Hate list<br />
----------<br />
shaman 1000<br />
me 1001<br />
<br />
&quot;then&quot; incite:<br />
<br />
Hate list<br />
----------<br />
me 1401<br />
shaman 1000<br />
<br />
Now imagine the SK in place of the shaman.  Same thing applies over his Darkness, only the beautiful added bonus of incite is the 70 per tick that I get which keeps me trucking above the whatever-per-tick Darkness generates.<br />
<br />
The only flaw in this plan is what if I fail tuant over and over.  But that's no different than how things were before Incite was introduced, and I did fine then so /shrug.<br />
<br />
I love how this works out with an SK in the group.  It's perfect.  Cause if my tuant fails a few times, he's more than beefy enough to hold aggro till I get a tuant off.  Kinda of a shaman buffer.  Keeps the mob off the shaman even during those rare times where tuant fails constantly.<br />
<br />
Point is, I'd rather be 400 hate ahead of everyone, rather than 1.  Most of the time incite isn't enough (with my group makeup anyway), and you end up relying on tuant anyway.<br />
<br />
There are group makeups where incite is enough to grab aggro instantly without tuant, like last nights group I was in for example.  Enchanter and me 3boxing (war, clr, wiz).  Incite easily grabbed aggro off his slows every time.  Doesn't seem to work as nicely when a shaman is slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I frequently move mobs that have been tashed, slowed, crippled and mezzed -- simply by landing a successful taunt, breaking mez and inciting.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I don't incite, the mob will always flip to the chanter, assuming the chanter is standing next to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isn't this totally contrary to prevailing theory about taunt?<br />
<br />
Mob is mezzed.  You land a successful taunt.  No one else does anything.  In theory, you are at the top of the hate list, by a small amount.  You break mezz ... and the mob turns to the chanter?  Aren't you supposedly still at the top of the hate list because you landed a successful taunt, and the chanter did nothing?<br />
<br />
Folks, taunt is not working the way we think it works.  There are wrinkles to the math that we haven't figured out yet.</div></div><hr />
