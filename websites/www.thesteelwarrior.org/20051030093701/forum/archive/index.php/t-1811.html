If you wish to get the conclusions without reading the whole thread, see Post #305 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=32130#post32130) for a summary of the thread to that point by Arantius.  This testing was motivated by questions posted in this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1673) which may give you some insight into the early tests which aren't clearly explained.<br />
<br />
 UPDATE 7/10/2005  Draxxalon did a nice test to verify that nothing's changed in the last two years and determine a more exact value for hate.   You can find it here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=12046)<br />
<br />
Went down to FG with a cleric tonight (tried it with the bot but he got owned by the shroom stuns :p).  Had the cleric pull a mushroom and spend 5 minutes pissing it off...stunned 8 or 10 times, healed herself multiple times, meleed, etc until it was at around 20% health and then I had her turn off attack and stop casting and I tried to taunt it off of her.  I didn't attack at all and hadn't done anything to the mob until this point.<br />
<br />

That's right folks.  4 &quot;I'll teach you to interfere with me Brutul!&quot; successful taunts to get it off of her.  This couldn't be right so we tried another shroom.  Same deal, 5 minutes of stuns, heals, hammer bashing by the cleric, mob is at 25ish percent and I start taunting without attacking.<br />

<br />
4 successful taunts again.  <br />
<br />
Anybody have any explanation for this?  The only thing I can think of is that we're wrong about how taunt works.  If this is true then my hat is gonna taste mighty bad.  Full log file is attached with some chat channel stuff edited out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well hell.  Could it be that there is a limit to how high a successful taunt will put you?  If highest on the list is above that, maybe just gives you a certain number of hate.  Thats my only guess, I don't believe successful taunts help if you are tank still, but as proven here, we could be wrong.<br />
<br />
If you do another test, using the ranger, would be good to try with him using different a number of snares a few times.  See what the difference is in how many successful taunts to get at the top.  Maybe an sk would be good, to get exact numbers of how much hate he does (assuming the sk uses only terror spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try guards. I've seen that weird behavior with shrooms mentioned here before. Think it was Frodlin? Can't remember.<br />
<br />
Go to West FP and try it on the guards at the zoneline to NFP.<br />
<br />
I'm curious wtf the shrooms are like that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There has always been a cap on the amount of aggro a successful taunt will give. There is even a cap on how much aggro a AE tunt gives. When you get a succesful taunt you get one of 2 things to happen. You get either X aggro or Y aggro where X is enough aggro to put you ahead of the person and is smaller than the cap or you get Y which is the maximum hate taunt will give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't ever remember hearing anything about a cap Adarion. It wasn't widely known if that's the case. VI never mentioned anything about a max +hate cap from taunt, and it never tested out as having one in the tests back then. Like I said though, that was about 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
That cleric cast sound of force 4 times and either tarnation or enforced reverence 6 times in the first test. That is 10 stuns and 2680 points of spell damage. That's a hell of a lot of hate, but I still would have thought 1 successful taunt would have pulled aggro. <br />
<br />
Maybe testing with an SK would be a good idea. We can find out exactly how much hate the SK +hate spells give, so if there is a cap, would be easy to find out what it is. I would also recommend (if someone is willing) to try different mobs. Anything that speaks that isn't in FG, basically. I can probably do something similar with my wife's shaman and my paladin in an old world zone...but not tonight. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really am hoping it was just the mob, that somehow they are different.  Finding out that everything we thought we knew about taunt is wrong would just be a shock.  Still, better to know than not to know.  Thanks Brutul for doing the test, and passing this information along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that is interesting...never heard of a cap on Taunt tho.  People need to check this on a variety of mobs, not just one type.  I think the fire elementals in SolB respond to Taunt too...I know they respond to Pick pocketing rogues. ^_^<br />
<br />
SK hate spells have a hate increase of 10x the mana cost, easy to figure out how much then.  The SK needs to do some damage first tho, the hate spells don't work as well it seems otherwise.  Someone grab a paladin to help parse this also...maybe we can also find out how much hate is on each stun. ^_^<br />
<br />
If someone wants some help from a 60 SK on Veeshan to do this, give me a tell on one of my characters below, and I'll see what I can do about helping you with my SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not one to start questioning widely believed theories, but I've always suspected that something like this was going on.<br />
<br />
For example, I double box a warrior and a shaman.  If I pull two mobs, I can take care of one, and my shaman can piss the holy hell out of that second one....Turgur's, Epic, Blood of Saryn and Pox create an unbelievable amount of aggro.   When my mob dies, and the other is around half life, with no DoT's still active on iti'll try to pull it off her. There have been times where I have mashed taunt every time it came up and that mob stayed stuck to Cag until it died.  On the other hand, when we're split tanking mobs and I finish mine first, I can walk over the other warrior's mob, taunt once and pull aggro off all of the damage he's done to that mob, and hold that aggro as well.<br />
<br />
I can't explain it, and like I said, it's not conclusive of anything...I may just fail taunt every time I happen to pull 2 mobs.  Weirder shit has happened.  I'm guessing tho that there's something else going on that we don't know about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try in Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since even low HP aggro is not infinite, it does not seem unreasonable that taunt or even AE taunt has a limit to how much aggro you can pull.  For one, clearly AE Taunt is never enough to pull it off a low HP aggro, so this implies whatever AE Taunt gives is less than low HP aggro.  Some friends were testing low HP aggro to try to AE mobs in Fire and I think they quoted around 10000 damage of PBAEs being enough damage to peel a mob off someone who's low HP aggro (not sure what this translates to in aggro though).  I have successfully escaped from Sol Ro with 100 HP (from rampage tanking and no one botherng to heal me) which is clearly low HP territory.  Of course, it is very easy for the MT to build a ridiculous amount of aggro on the Sol Ro if you avoid the AEs, which is why I suspect it works.  Sol Ro pretty much won't notice me even if I continue to melee him, but if MT dies then it's instant summon.  So that seems to suggest you can get enough aggro to overcome low HP aggro, though I have never seen that happen in a situation where everyone is attacking at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait a min...<br />
<br />
I remember VI saying something about spells having a maximum +hate value based upon the hp of the mob, could it be that they were just lazy and capped the taunt skill like they did spells?<br />
<br />
Someone kidnap a sk, I think it is time to find just how hps effects max aggro per spell! :cool:<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: And I thought low hp aggro was a multiplication and not an addition to your hate value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the fact that FG mobs are 'messed up' at all suggests that taunt isn't as simple as we had accepted. <br />
<br />
For there to be any form of anomoly from the norm, surely taunt cannot just be a binary equation? how can you mess up a decision that has only two possibilities (taunt or failed taunt) unless there's more too it than that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since we know there are at least 2 different agro modes in EQ (undead/rooted and regular, if you will) and taunt is intamately tied to agro there is no reason not to assume that taunt would be simple either.<br />
<br />
Brutul, your test ring true with my impression of the way the messages work. Not that I have anything to back it up at the moement, other than about 4 years of game play.<br />
<br />
Of course it could be something as simple as the assumtion that the verbal responce from the mob does not represent a successful taunt. It could be that mobs are ware of ALL taunts and respond randomly to any taunt message. <br />
<br />
Are there anytimes in your log that you got agro from taunt without a message?<br />
<br />
I have never much gotten into agro theories becuase alot of people run with the assumption that responce = successful taunt and I have never seen that justified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know I'm not Brutul, but I noticed the same sort of crap when I was farming lucid shards in Fungus Grove.  I didn't have my log on or anything, but after 6-7 hours there I don't recall having gotten aggro from a taunt without that message popping up.  Sometimes though, it seemed to put me high enough that when I swung my weapon twice for ~150 it immediately turned to me (although my next taunt was about to refresh at the time).  <br />
<br />
I wish I had a log, but I don't.  So take my experiences with a grain of salt :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent,Should these tests prove that this occurs in other areas outside of FG ,It further proves how useless That button really is..<br />
