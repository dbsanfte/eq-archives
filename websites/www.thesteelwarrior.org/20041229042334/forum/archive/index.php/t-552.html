<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm... I'm pretty obtuse about the message board searches.  I never seem to get good results.  But wasn't there a thread on here about where to get different Ornate drops?  Is anyone seeing ornate these days other than the bp and legs off certain known named?  <br />
<br />
Yeah, I know, the tower and wing bosses in BoT have a chance to drop  bps and legs respectively.  That doesn't help myself or my guild at all.  In their infinite stupidity, SOE made these easily reachable static spawn, so people who play entirely too much just time them and gank them as soon as they spawn.  Thanks for that one, SOE.  You'd think after over 3 years of EQ they would have FINALLY figured out that easy to reach, relatively easy to kill mobs with great loot and static timers really, really suck for most players.  /smack SOE<br />
<br />
So anyway... i guess the frequently spawning minibosses in BoT have a chance to drop ornate, but ever since AFTER the ubers swept thru tier 3 and got whatever ornate they cared to get, the drop rates have been nerfed all to hell.  We've killed scores of those things and seen ONE piece of ornate.  Incidently in having 2 or 3 groups with BoT access for 2-3 months and PoT access for thel ast month, my guild has seen that ONE piece of ornate drop, a silk hat.  That's the only piece any of us have EVER gotten.  Wow, great itemization there, SOE...  Thanks for the massive drop nerfage.   <br />
<br />
So anyway, pardon the rant, but where the hell do you get armor upgrades now if you're not an uber guild going to the elemental planes and you're not competing for BoT named with the insane, constantly playing boss timers who gank them?  Of course even those BoT named are for bp and legs, but where do you get the rest of the pieces?  It's completely unrealistic to suggest that a guild outfit themselves with Ornate.  Let's see... at one piece every couple months, it'll only take as a couple hundred years to get everyone set. :p  <br />
<br />
PoP desperately needed an area to move up from ToV and cultural armor sets, somewhere you could go and outfit your guild.  It's perfectly reasonable to think that tier 3 should have provided that.  Hell, you're routinely taking on mobs that hit for 600-800 a pop.  This is no Halls of Testing crap.  In our experience and that of others I've heard from, the risk versus reward for us in PoP is horrendously bad.  Our group can be all exciting about taking out some named ogre in tactics who quads for 800 something, flurries spiking him to 8-10 hits in a single round... and most of the time he drops nothing.  wtf?  /rude  Our little raid party can be excited about taking out a similar mob who throws in some knockbacks and AE attacks, yet most of the time HE drops nothing too.  Smashed war grubs!  woot!  <br />
<br />
My friends and I are bored now.  We're almost done with PoP, much like the shaman quoted in a recent Mob Hunter editorial.  Some named in PoP are completely out of our guild's range and always will be.  Most of the ones that are in our range frequently drop nothing or are permakilled if they do drop something.  What few upgrades are available for us, we have farmed.  I've got my rings from Valor and my earrings from Tactics.  Armor?  yeah right.  where?  So as we &quot;finish&quot; PoP, there isn't much else to do.  Leveling made all the older zones totally suck for exp.  How 'bout that old Luclin progression?  Umm... no thanks.  On our server, Ssra is still camped out pretty much every night anyway by guilds trying to get into VT.  It was always a boring progression.  It's even more boring now that the exp is so much worse AND it's still camped all to hell.  <br />
<br />
Without some good zones for non uberguilds to reasonably outfit their characters, PoP soon loses it's appeal.  Loot is so ridiculously rare that after plugging away faithfully at it for months, we're sick of it.  It's not worth it.  People are losing interest and quitting now.  The game life could have been prolonged with a well done expansion, but SOE's horrendous PoP itemization (unless you can take uber guild targets of course) has done us in.  It's about to the point where we're just hoping the next good MMORPG comes out soon and that maybe it will have a fun progression that isn't just catering to people who play 40 hours a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The scope of a lot of pop type raids is really annoying if you ask me - and i'm in a guild that is lucky enough to have the resources to keep progressing.  The amount of dps some of these mobs put out is really ridiculous though.</div></div><hr />

Add to that the number of silk, leather and chain drops i'd estimate it at fewer then 15 total in howerver many months spent in tier3 zones.<br />
<br />
The point has been made many times, they don't care period. The only way you can make them listen is to quit, and even then random_65_#2312314124 just fills up your spot and grinds for another 6 months only then to realize &quot;Hey, this expansion is a huge pile of shit. Wtf was I thinking&quot; and either bails on their current guild for the lure of actual ele loot (I see huge player turnover on our server at least at the tops) or quits.<br />
<br />
You want the loot you have two options. Dick your way into the ele's or farm old content (Seru, Ssra, VT).</div></div><hr />

BROKEN BEYOND REPAIR.<br />
<br />
Elemental Gods = Bullshit overall (see Rathe vs Seru/AHR)<br />
Elemental Planes = Very decent (i'd say too easy in some cases)<br />
Sol Ro/Agnar/MM = Almost Balanced RVR (dont tell me they are hard)<br />
Anything under that = TOTALLY INEXISTANT<br />
<br />
Lets face it. If you cant Be on Sol Ro/Agnar/MM  and + level<br />
Thats AT LEAST farming HoH trials, Sol Ro minis, VZ/TZ<br />
<br />
Dont even bother stepping foot in PoP. Its a waste of time.<br />

BoT was nerfed beyong recognition the day they made the key quest easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Certain mobs have a high chance of dropping certain ornate molds in tactics, Overseer for instance drops a chain bp like 75% of the time, Glykus also drops a silk robe mold pretty often, and I hear bp mold can drop off Tagrin? or whatever the guy is who summons those sword pets. Once in Sol Ro each of the mini's besides the Protector seem to be able to drop a bp mold as well, in fact with jiva you can sit outside his room continously killing the efreeti mobs he spawns which drop bracer molds. Also bracers etc can drop off named that randomly spawn in the arena(although very rare).<br />
<br />
But the good news is this, shortly verant will be opening up many zones and removing the flag requirements needed for these. Zones such as Halls of Honor, Plane of Tactics, Crypt of Decay, Bastion of Thunder, Plane of Torment, Plane of Storms and Valor(as well as nightmareb) will be opened to all the noob masses. On top of which they stated on eqlive that zones will be populated with more named mobs and reitemised, including new items for lower tier gods, even some nice rare loot.<br />
<br />
So who knows, maybe they will increase the ornate drop rates somewhat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully they do reitemize because right now, this blows.  Currently my guild is like an ornate dominatrix convention.  A bunch of leather, a bit of silk, not a single plate or chain.  40 something people, 1/3rd of whom wear plate and not one piece of plate.<br />
<br />
I have a cleric friend in an elemental guild who has 3 pieces of elemental plate.<br />
<br />
Ornate drops in general and plate and chain specifically need to be increased.</div></div><hr />

Since most servers have 2+ more tier 4 guilds, POE POW etc plate will be up for sell soon.<br />
<br />
Also if they do make it easy to get/drop(ornate plate molds), the farmers aka 4 boxers, will just farm the hell out of it and abuse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too many items in everquest? That is about the worst arguement i've seen in regards to keeping ornate drop rates as they are. <br />
<br />
So what if ornate (non bp - legs) is actually dropping off xp mobs that people already farm in vain attemps to actually get a piece? I didn't kill thangbrand, thorlof, valbrand, ymir and roreck in earth wing of bastion 50+ fucking times to get fungus clumps. What is so bad about actually getting rewarded for the increased difficulty of pulling, killing and lower xp in that shit wing then the alternative to sit in PoV and xp risk free like a mindless lemming? <br />
<br />
Please tell me, it sure as hell isn't loot right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got my ornate plate greaves last weekend on a Vallon/Tallon Zek raid when one of the named on the way dropped them (i think 2 runes dropped as well, one of another named though) but they arent exactly mobs you'd do with an exp group.<br />
Only other piece i ever saw was ornate leather greaves off nort wing named (not tower) in BoT once.<br />
But havent spent too much time in KC 2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seen Plate Greaves and Silk legs drop off wing named 2 or 3 times. Our first night trying BoT Towers we had leather arms on a mini and 2 plate BPs on 2 of the named tower bosses. Had Ornate plate greaves drop off a named in Tactics that I can't remember (He splits at 50 life and is relatively close to the zone in)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I agree the drop rate sucks and for some pieces like Plate Gauntlets I have never heard of them dropping anywhere on any server. I am sure they do but where and when? Those and the legs are the only pieces I even want and the gaunts mainly for the effect since I don't have an eyepatch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unlike every other armor set in existence, the ornate bp/legs are actually the most common drops and they are still rare.<br />
<br />
Switching back and forth between PoP and WToV as my guild is doing a while ago, there is such a huge difference in drop rates it isn't funny.  We could pretty much equip one person in plate per raid per night in WToV with nearly full gear yet almost 8 months since PoP came out and not one person in the guild has a single piece of ornate plate.<br />
<br />
PoP itemization blows.  Today's patch at least makes the BoT uppers drop something every time.  I almost punched my screen when we killed one and it dropped fungus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Had Ornate plate greaves drop off a named in Tactics that I can't remember (He splits at 50 life and is relatively close to the zone in)&quot;<br />
<br />
Anival the Blade.  He's a pain the butt, but he can also drop nothing quite a bit.  Most of the ornate reports mentioned here are from BoT tower bosses, which as I said are moronically on a static timer and get ganked immediately by people who are logged in all the time.  My groups and guildies have never once been there when one was up.  We were there once at the moment a wing boss popped.  We were in the wing too and had been calling the area camped for awhile.  As we fought a couple of giants,  a group invised past us to the named and ganked it.  Typical.  No way in hell you should be able to invis straight back to those things and timers absolutely need to be random, not every 6 hours.  The devs should have learned that about 3 years ago.<br />
'<br />
Main point, as in my long rant, is the drop rates though.  Hopefully the upcoming changes make it much, much better, but that should have been done ages ago.  They've had 4 years to figure out what people like, what's challenging, and what sort of drop rates and loot are appropriate on different mobs.  So who the hell at SOE does the ridiculous nerf it out of the existence BS the moment someone starts getting a little loot?  They need to find a different project to work on because all they do is drive players away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anival the Blade.  I absolutely hate him.  We took him recently with a single group.. empty.  We had taken him before that.. spectral parchment.  Only seen him up those 2 times.  BoT wing bosses have such a shitty drop rate, we've killed all of them more times than I wish to count, and only have 3 pairs of leather pants, 1 pair of silk pants.  As for tower bosses, they haven't given us a single piece of ornate.  Occasionally items, runes are a bit more common.  They are guaranteed to drop something now... but with how PoP is turning out, I'd guess that fungus clumps count as something, and we'll keep getting those a good majority of the time.  This armor is the next logical step up from SS / Kael, yet the drop rates are so horrid, it would take years to outfit a midsized guild.  It's just pathetic.  Not a single piece of plate armor in my guild.  Tagrin only gave us a neck piece that luckily didn't suck.  PoP itemization makes me wish World of Warcraft was out already.  Most likely my guild will move over to that when it comes out.</div></div><hr />

Sub elemental loot is way to rare, soe knows this apparently and is going to change it.  now.  If the mobs were droping too many items do you think it would take them months and months to fix it?  <br />

That's SOE for you.  It's the same double standard with mob pathing.  If bad pathing leads to the wholesale slaughter of your entire raid, it works as designed.  Maybe someday in the far flung future, it'll get fixed.  If bad pathing in any way benefits you, you're a damn good for nothing exploiter and could be banned!  :p<br />
<br />
Husser, great example of a mob that a single group should be very proud to take out.  Maybe that's nothing for a top tier guild exp group to do. I don't know. I don't think any of my groups could 1 group Anival though.  We get screwed up when those damn things split.  Now you've got 2 mobs on you, both with zero aggro, and repeatedly we'd have both immediately attacking the tank.  The cleric is forced to heal right away, gets aggro, and dies.  heh... it sucks.  He's a pretty tough fight though and for all that effort... nothing!  woot!  You at least got some smashed war grubs, right? :D</div></div><hr />
