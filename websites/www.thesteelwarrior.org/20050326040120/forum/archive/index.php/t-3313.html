I'm pretty sick and tired of explaining to people why they shouldn't do this or use that and I'm probably starting to look like a know it all ass, but on raids and exp groups we have a lot of members just clueless about managing their aggro, and these all being 60-65 in lvl, or maybe they've been grouping with knights lately /shrug  Just annoying as all hell when people that have been playing for 3 years still don't get that warrior's rely entirely on procs for aggro, and even when you do proc, you're not going to hold aggro indefinately off a ranger snaring+proccing CoF +nuking +dotting.  Hell, I can even live 3 of those but CoF is just fucking pointless aggro, god I hate sony for giving rangers that buff.<br />
<br />
A link would be much appreciated, otherwise I might have to write something up myself in which case I'll likely get accused of telling people how to play their class.<br />
<br />
Might as well add that I use BoC/SotBS for aggro before anyone asks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people know better and get lazy and some people just don't know.  The lazy ones need to wake up and the ignorant need to learn.  Agro can make or break some raids and as a healer it annoys me even in xp groups if I see it bouncing all over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro Management Guide, By Moglar Moregoth, Troll warrior of bristlebane<br />
<br />
1.)	Don’t mash you’re taunt key every time it refreshes.  Instead, wait for the mob to turn from you, to another player, THEN hit taunt.  Many people do not understand that taunt bumps you to the top of the mobs hate list, then adds only one hate point.  So, if you are already at the top of the mob’s hate list and hit taunt, you gain a mere 1 point of hate.<br />
<br />
Say, for example, you’ve got the mob’s attention and you hit taunt cause you feel like it.  Just so happens that the mage nukes the paste out of the mob the second after you hit taunt, thereby ganking you’re agro.  Now you’ve got to wait until taunt refreshes before you can use the button for it’s intended purpose.  The mage will take a round of melee, which could kill him depending on the mob.  Well, if you’re taunt fails, you’re looking at 2 or 3 rounds of melee possible on the mage b4 you can hit taunt.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that it’s more efficient to hit taunt only when you loose agro.<br />
2.)	/shield the person that stole your agro.  Sometimes I get agro back just form the sheer act of /shielding the mob’s target.  Assist the mob and hit shield.<br />
3.)	If those don’t work, use that area taunt button ONLY if the mob’s target is at or above 2 bubs of health.<br />
4.)	CONTROVERSIAL? – a LOT of times, when taunt fails at first, I’ll sit/stand/attack and the mob will switch back to me before taunt refreshes, simply based on a touch of sit agro.  I don’t have any numbers or testing to back this up, but it works so well for me that I live by it.  I won’t /shield a target before I try the sit/stand/attack again, because sitting will cancel your /shielding.<br />
5.)	Most importantly, weapons.  Sure, DPS is important I guess, but high agro procs like (stuns) are the bomb.  Get the greatstaff of thunder or the copper hammer of striking/bloodsworn combo.  A few procs per fight mean a world of difference.<br />
6.)    Establish agro before anyone else engages.  It’s a delicate matter to insist, to a pickup group, that they give you 8 to 12 seconds of whacking on the mob praying for a proc before they start casting and melee; however it’s important and greatly reduces the chance of loosing control of the mob.  You loose you’re agro for any signifigant portion of the fight, and the entire efficiency of the group is reduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was actually looking for a guide on what everyone except the MT should be doing to avoid aggro, though I appreciate your input Mog.<br />
<br />
Such as the ranger self only buff Call of Fire (65dd 0sec stun)  I fail to see any use for this in exp groups or on raids with 2 exceptions.  1) If the ranger is the MT 2) If caster interupts are absolutely essential.  Other than that, this buff, while adding very little dps to the ranger, does much more harm than good.  Example, if you have a rogue in the group and the ranger is positioned on the side of the mob, procs CoF, draws aggro, rogue misses bs dps, cleric wastes mana on ranger, and on top of that the rangers dps actually goes down since the mob is now facing him and parrying,riposting,dodging etc. <br />
<br />
A guide with tips like this for other classes would make my life so much easier as a war.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quoted from a thread on the old board, taken from a Bertox guild page, here is the assist and aggro management guide.  I find it funny and mostly right on.  But I do note that it's just not the same game in the elemental planes.  For instance, many guilds have an MA and an MT, with the MA being a Knight to begin aggro and the MT taking it off him without killing any casters in the process.  In addition, the caster line about not emptying the manabar also is tweaked when the mobs are hitting so fucking hard and fast that you need them dead ASAP - but I think the general application applies (i.e., don't cast so much that you fuck up the agro). <br />
<br />
<br />
I - Assisting the Tank<br />
<br />
Ok, so groups are now formed, people are buff, and the casters have good<br />
mana once again. Now for the fun part:<br />
<br />
- Figure your who your Main Assist is. The Main Assist is your GOD, he<br />
is the one who decides what to attack and when to attack it. You DON'T<br />
attack a MoB unless he says its ok, his word is law.<br />
<br />
- Figure out who your Secondary Assist is. In the event that the MA<br />
dies, go LD, is AFK for an extended period of time or else cannot<br />
perform his duties then the SA takes over. While the SA is in charge he<br />
has the full Rights of an MA and is expected to be treated as such.<br />
<br />
- When a MoB is pulled into the raid camp, they may sometimes stop to<br />
cast a spell at the puller. DO NOT RUN OUT TO ATTACK THEM, WATCH YOUR<br />
CHAT SCREEN TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON!!! YES, THE MOB WILL COME TO YOU, BE<br />
FREAKIN' PATIENT!!!<br />
<br />
- When a MoB comes into the Raid camp, the MA is FIRST to engage it.<br />
This is done to build up the MA's aggression, the entire idea of an MA<br />
is to keep the MoB on one and ONLY one target during the course of the<br />
battle, this target is preferably the MA.<br />
<br />
- The MA shall call out to the entire raid that he has engaged the MoB<br />
and is building up his aggro. Now is the proper time to /assist the MA<br />
(But make FREAKIN' SURE that you have typed &quot;/assist off&quot; prior to doing<br />
this!!!). Do NOT engage the MoB at this time.<br />
<br />
-Unless you are the MA: DO NOT TARGET MOBS WITH THE MOUSE!!! You should<br />
NEVER use the mouse to target a MoB because you WILL break a Mez! ONLY<br />
use /assist &lt;MA&gt;. ONLY!! ALWAYS!! If you don't know how to make hotkeys,<br />
ask someone.<br />
<br />
- When the MA has built up sufficient aggro they will call out to kill<br />
the MoB. Each MA may have their own unique Kill message so be sure to<br />
figure out what is what among your MA's. DO NOT ATTACK THE MOB UNTIL THE<br />
MA CALLS IT!!! DO NOT THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE THE MA IS ATTACKING THAT<br />
YOU NEED TO BE AS WELL!!!<br />
<br />
- Once the MoB is dead, the King Looter from the group that got the kill<br />
should immediately loot the corpse. If there is droppable loot, loot<br />
it. If something is no-drop, announce what it is, unless its some junk<br />
that we have told you to destroy beforehand.<br />
<br />
II - Aggression Management Guide (also called: &quot;Taunt Sucks&quot;)<br />
<br />
When we attack a normal MoB on a raid, the idea is to keep that MoB on<br />
the MA at all times. Complete Heal is very mana efficient when used on<br />
characters with a High HP level. Hence it is best if ONE tank with a lot<br />
of HP tanks the MoB for the entire fight, it is NOT mana efficient to<br />
Divine Light 9 or 10 peeps who can't control their aggro.<br />
<br />
Here is the Golden Rule for ALL Main Tank situations:<br />
<br />
IT IS NOT THE MA'S JOB TO HOLD ONTO AGGRO. EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE<br />
GAME CAN OUT-TAUNT THE MA. IT IS EVERYONE ELSE'S JOB TO MAKE SURE THE<br />
AGGRO STAYS ON THE MA<br />
<br />
Read that line. Now read it again. Copy it, print it, hang it right over<br />
your monitor where you can easily spot it. Above all: Worship it<br />
<br />
(Author's Note: The following insults apply only to the major raid<br />
proper, the ones doing most of the damage. They do NOT apply to the<br />
Healers, Slowers, Mezzers or Debuffing team, which typicaly take aggro<br />
only because they absolutely have to land those spells. Thank you and<br />
have a pleasant day)<br />
<br />
The premise is clear: The skill &quot;Taunt&quot; really, really SUCKS. This skill<br />
WILL NOT save your weak caster butt from the MoB man quadding you for<br />
300 . If you get aggro, do NOT say &quot;The MA needs to taunt more&quot; because<br />
the MA IS taunting, your own epic incompetence and failure to think<br />
properly has gotten you aggro (Yes, I detest aggro stealers) Now GET<br />
YOUR BUTT OUT OF IT. EVERY SINGLE CLASS should know by the time they are<br />
46 how to get something they don't want off of them. This is NOT done by<br />
spamming your &quot;Help, Beastiez is on 'da n00ker!&quot; hotkey and running in<br />
big circles around the camp. If its on you and it looks like its gonna<br />
stay that way for awhile, do everyone a favor and STAND STILL. If you<br />
die, you'll be rezzed, and the longer you stand there and let the melee<br />
beat on the baddie the faster it will be to that rez.<br />
<br />
Hopefully by now you have identified when to cast to avoid excessive<br />
aggro (if you are a caster) or how to ditch that aggro if you out-melee<br />
the MA (if you are a melee).<br />
<br />
For Nukers: Learn how to play your freakin' class and WAIT TO NUKE. You<br />
are NOT quad-kiting here! Your entire mana bar DOES NOT need to be<br />
inside the MoB within the first 5 seconds of combat. Wait until the MoB<br />
reaches 50% health, that is the accepted time to start nuking.<br />
<br />
For Melee: For Warriors, Paladins and Shadow Knights: If somehow you<br />
out-aggro the MA the best thing for you to do is STOP ATTACKING. Just<br />
turn off your auto attack and take a few steps back. NO, you are NOT<br />
cool because you got more aggro, you are merely a threat to the entire<br />
raid.<br />
<br />
For Rogues: If you haven't figured this one out by now... That's all I'm<br />
gonna say.<br />
<br />
For Monks: I play a monk. I read Monk discussion boards. I know this<br />
class well. Stealing aggro from the MA seems to be a &quot;Big Dick&quot; kind of<br />
thing among Monks. Apparently they seem to get a real rise out of it. If<br />
you are one of these monks, then you can take aggro once and log to go<br />
beat it off for the duration of the raid. YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL because<br />
you did more damage than the warrior. Turn off your &lt;expletive&gt;<br />
auto-attack and FD. I also understand that in some zones FD is bugged<br />
and this will not work properly. Under these circumstances please just<br />
stop attacking for the love of god and let the MA get his MoB back.<br />
<br />
For Rangers (Thank you, Fenia): Jolt jolt jolt jolt jolt. If you don't<br />
have this spell your entire life outside of raiding should consist of<br />
trying to get it. It's low enough level that you can reasonably be<br />
expected to be that level (51) and it's vendor sold. Weapons are also an<br />
issue. You're a dual wielding blender death machine in the eyes of<br />
mobs--never mind that you're being out damaged by the bard, they don't<br />
care. This means one thing--WOODSMAN'S STAFF. Or a better 2hb, but<br />
that's the old-school death weapon for rangers. Woodsman's Staff out<br />
damaged a surprising number of dual wield combinations, believe me, I've<br />
been in on tests. This is an uber enough weapon and generates FAR FAR<br />
less hate than just about any dual wield combination for comparable or<br />
better damage. If you're raiding, use this for Pete's sake. And if<br />
you're 54 , go hunt in Fungus Grove and get Jolting Blades. Remember,<br />
it's the lives of EVERYONE on the raid that depend on you not taking<br />
aggro, so don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time is the best answer to aggro problems, for tanks and other members.  As the tank, it is imperative that you jump on the mob as quickly as possible.  Even one or two rounds can be a huge advantage in initial aggro while you're waiting on a proc.<br />
<br />
Likewise, if someone is drawing aggro, usually the best thing they can do is wait a few seconds before engaging/casting.<br />
<br />
Use paladins to your advantage.  For example, lets say you wake a mob, taunt having failed, and it's whacking the enchanter.  A good paladin (or cleric) can stun the mob for many seconds, accomplishing two things: 1) it protects the ench and 2) it generates higher over-all aggro and you'll have one or two more chances to get a successful taunt in, stealing that aggro, before the mob can do much damage.  Of course, this tactic assumes you can out-aggro the paladin's straight melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all good, except on Mog's post...2 things.<br />
<br />
First:<br />
Taunt is (Hate_of_most_hated_player + 1) + (Hate_bonus)<br />
Hate_bonus is a combination of things like proximity, whether or not mob is snared, whether or not you're sitting or /shielding (I beleive /shield gives a boost in aggro, that alone gets mobs to turn for me. On a related note, /assisting mobs seems to piss them off too, sometimes when I type /as to get my shield target, that makes them turn)<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
8-12 sec solo tank on EXP mobs is too much.<br />
When the puller pulls, pump arrows into the mob. When the puller runs by you, run up and attack/disarm/taunt to make sure you get the mobs attention. Doing this gives you quite a bit of aggro. <br />
Don't worry about &quot;wasting&quot; Taunt now.. any slower who slows within the first 6 seconds of a mobs life is asking to be dead. In reality, slow takes a few secs to cast and you will have plenty of time to refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moglar</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's something I forgot to mention :D<br />
<br />
When i am tasked with pulling, i'll come to where I want the mob to be.  IF any group members have moved up a hair, which will cause the mob to path near the the player before it arrives where i want it to be, I can make sure it doesn't stop at that individual by sitting until the mob runs past them, then standing just before it reaches melee range.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, 8 to 12 seconds is a bit long for a grind group.  I usually ask for that, when I use seconds, in hopes of getting 5 seconds out of them.  Another way to approach is to tell them to wait till one heal lands before attacking / casting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really is that simple.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Uh... no. I'm sorry, I've been in guilds where I was the main tank on certain raids. Yes sometimes I would lose aggro to an overnuker. And I'd send them a tell &quot;Wtb aggro off your overnuking&quot; or &quot;Wts you a FAQ on not overnuking&quot; or sometime just a simple &quot;You're over nuking, please control your aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
After this being said I'd sometime get a tell from an officer or guildleader saying &quot;X caster says you're trying to tell them how to play their class.  X caster says they'll guild remove if you're not put back in your place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors are so easy to replace it's disgusting. Most high end guilds -will not- take warrior unless they meet insane requirements. Such as level 65, Maxed Defensive AND offensive AA, elemental or time flags, all keys, and the like. Whereas the same guilds take the time to go back and flag a level 62 cleric or wizard recruit with under 30 AA all the way through time.<br />
<br />
So I feel that this isn't a solution unless you are the guild leader or an officer with power. If you've experienced different, that's great but I've really been forced to keep my mouth shut when it comes to explaining to a caster that things should be done a certain way.</div></div><hr />

It's also a little inconveniant to explain to someone in detail why they shouldn't do this or that when you're trying to tank.  Must be nice for knights to never have to worry about explaining the most basic shit, such as telling the slower to give you 5 seconds to build aggro first.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the guide Vig, I've seen it actually but was hoping something more current and detailed popped up somewhere.</div></div><hr />
