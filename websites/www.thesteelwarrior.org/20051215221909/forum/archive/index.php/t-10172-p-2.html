<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I don't understand this question at all, because the game clearly tells you where to go.  If you're paying any attention at all, you don't need a &quot;Road Map.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you only go where the game leads you, you are missing out on a shit load of content.<br />
<br />
Some of the best areas I've been too came without a &quot;lead-in&quot; quest.  For instance, I didn't have any introductory quests into Stranglethorn Vale, I just decided I wanted to know what was dear Duskwood (or Dustwood or Darkwood or whatever); never had an introductory quest into Desolace.  Same with Uldaman, Kraul, Shadowfang.   I'm sure such lead-in quests exist somewhere out there, but in the way I progressed I didn't come across them and I'm damn glad I didn't wait for them to knock me across the head and allow me to droolingly play paint with numbers to the next path...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You probably missed them then.<br />
<br />
Shadowfang is standard fare for Horde (likely not for Alliance, since it's pretty balls deep in Horde territory, but we are told from the get go that we're heading there).<br />
<br />
Stranglethorn Vale comes to the Horde via being told to talk to Nesingwary from a guy in Desolace, or from doing anything that takes you to Booty Bay, or just by hopping on the zepplin and landing in Grom Gol.<br />
<br />
I did get a desolace quest.  I can't remember from where, but I was definitely quested into the zone.<br />
<br />
Patrick Garret in the Undercity tells us to go to Uldaman.<br />
<br />
Razorfen Kraul quests come from Auld Stonespire in Thunder Bluff, and from the Apothecary in the undercity.  <br />
<br />
Given how much more 'polish' is on the Alliance side than the Horde side, I'm guessing you missed them.  There are indeed quests to go almost everywhere...the problem is that if you've already spoken to the person you're being sent to, you won't get the quest.  Example -- I went to Arathi at like 30 or so, talked to everyone in Hammerfall.  Later on I went to Grom'Gol and did some quests.  In the process of doing so, I abandoned a few Hammerfall quests, and immediately a troll lit up with an exclamation point.  I ran over and talked to him, and sure as shit, he's sending me to Hammerfall.<br />
<br />
I can't tell ya where Alliance stuff is, but I can tell you that if you keep your eyes open, you're definitely told of 2-3 different areas you can go at any one level on the Horde side...and that's only from the places I've been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instances don't really have a 'report to soandso in area X' lead in quest, but it's pretty hard to not get any quest to any instance of your side just from talking to everyone with a ! on their head.  For the areas, virtually every area has a 'report to soandso in area X' quest if you look hard enough, and really, even if you miss that quest, the game follows a pretty standard RPG fare where the area 1 zone further away from your current zone (relative to home areas) is usually 1 tier uberer than the one before.  It's not hard to deduce where you're supposed to go next.<br />
<br />
The only instance I can think of that you might miss would be Scarlet Monastery on the horde side since the main quest is in the royal chamber in UC (not somewhere you go to often) and I think all the other quests have prereqs you might miss (like one requires RFK).  But if you ever did any of the Undead newbie quests, you should at least know this dungeon exists.<br />
<br />
Desolace was a standard 'we need more people fighting in this zone (and every other zone in the game), go report to soandso' quest.  I can't remember who gave the quest either, but it wasn't anything obscure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you don't, but everyone who's playing Undead and has played WC3 sure as fuck goes back to the Royal Chamber every level to see if Varimathras and Sylvanas have anything cool to do. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really liked the way the Thunder Bluff quests had you run around to discover the different pools in the barrens and ended up sending you into Wailing Caverens to kill the 4 named Leaders of the Fang.   The reward was a really nice weapon and you also open up a little ring event once all 4 of the leaders are dead.<br />
<br />
I knew when I got to the first boss in Ragefire and got grav fluxed into the lava this was gonna be a fun game.  Running through the WC quests/events sealed it for me.<br />
<br />
So far most of the lower level instances have had some sort of scripted event with in the zone along with a quest progression that causes you to enable the event (at the very least) or makes you go through it.  I kinda quit exploring the completness of the instances long about the RFK level.<br />
<br />
Neat thing is I can always go back and do it... or better yet help some friends through who are of the level.  The WoW version of a PL =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play an undead and I played WC3.  I don't really see much appeal to the Undead guys aside from the Kerrigan factor (Sylvannas is just a cheap Kerrigan knockoff).  Then again, Kerrigan was quite popular back in SC, so I guess it kind of make sense people would want to talk to Sylvannas, not that she says anything (at least not yet to me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably missed them then.<br />
<br />
The point is not whether I missed quests.   But I can fucking confirm that I didn't miss any quest for Shadowfang or Kraul.  <br />
<br />
The point is that there was zero reason to go flaming someone for asking folks where they choose to hunt at certain levels.<br />
<br />
In my 20s I went from Westfall to Redridge to Deadmines to Duskwood to Loch Modan to Barrens to Shadowfang to Stockades, primarily.  I know people who stayed pretty much on the Ashenvale side of things because they started out elf, stayed in Darkshore and their &quot;go see&quot; quests lead them right down south to Ashenvale ... where they stayed.  I don't believe I got a SINGLE quest leading me to Ashenvale staying on my little side of the universe and I also don't believe I missed the almighty exclamation point.<br />
<br />
But even if I did it's still a valid question to ask, essentially, which areas are better.  I knew Ashenvale existed, of course I did as I am a Night Elf, but I think the experiences I got travelling to all those areas in my 20s were richer and better than had I stayed in Ashenvale the whole time.   As a general rule there are so many quests for all over the globe that we simply cannot complete them all within the right level range so some folks prioritize and in doing so they ask others what areas they feel are best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I would have never know about the southern barrens, hillbrad or ashenvale had I not just gone wondering hehe :)<br />
<br />
And yeah I hit the UC royal chamber each time I am down there, but yeah no flames guys its not the outhouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're someone like me who has to have a map of a zone filled, you're going to find everywhere you need to go just fine.<br />
<br />
The zones themselves even follows the same pattern I speak of.  If stuff around town is level X, then go Y distance out and it'd be X+1, go 2Y distance from town and it'd be X+2, and so on.  Very easy to tell where you should be going just based on proximity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats definitly true as well, natural too in a way.</div></div><hr />

While largely true, I can think of 2 spots where its a lil different... not by much though.  The Booty Bay/STV area has a road with level 30's on one side of it and level 40's on the other.  The other is RFK vs RFD area where its mid 20's mobs on one side and mid 30's on the other.  I kinda like those spots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
That is simply inaccurate.  I could fill in my entire map of Westfall and Redridge, the two most-commonly Alliance traversed zones through the 20s, and not get a single quest for Kraul or Shadowfang (or WC or Ashenvale or any other number of places).  What I will get is a bunch of quests for those zones, a bunch of quests taking me to Stockades or other specific NPCs in Stormwind, a bunch of quests in Duskwood and maybe a few in Wetlands or Loch Modan.  <br />
<br />
 I would never suggest to someone to do that in order to make sure you catch everything.  Sure, fill in your map for other reasons.  But if you want to see everything and experience it when it should be experienced, you are going to have to go outside the box a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vig...Razorfen Kraul, required for warrior level 20 (well, in actuality level 30) quest.<br />
<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?q=920<br />
<br />
Talk to a dude in stormwind, and he tells you to head out there to kill Roogug.<br />
<br />
You also have a duplicate of the quest given by Auld Stonespire to kill Charla Razorflank given by an NPC in Feralas.<br />
<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?q=742<br />
<br />
Paladin quest requiring you to go to Shadowfang keep.<br />
<br />
So, lets try this again.  Did you miss them?  Yes.  Is it due to you being lazy or blind?  No.  It's due to you not having a paladin or a warrior I'm guessing, since you definitely would have found both quests if you did.   Everyone class might not be required to go to every zone, but if you've got a bunch of friends playing, and you're comparing notes, you should definitely be hearing things like &quot;Uhh, it says here I gotta go to some place called Shadowfang Keep...we should try to find that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not being insulting.  The game does indeed spell out places for you to go, you just need to keep your eyes open and you'll find them.</div></div><hr />
