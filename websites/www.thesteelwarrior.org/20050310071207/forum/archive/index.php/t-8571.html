<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goopie</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, after playing a cleric exclusively for two years, I started an ogre warrior and it almost hurts me physically to play him.  Oh, it is fun, sure!  But, I can't check the health of pets, and I can't turn around to see which mobs are on who.  I have to continually hit kick and taunt.  Arrrgggghhh!<br />
<br />
Okay, so I'm asking for some advice and maybe sympathy.   :p <br />
<br />
Question #1 KICK/TAUNT:  Goodness, do you have to keep pressing that taunt key and kick key over an over forever?  Isn't there a way to automate it?  Do you watch the taunt button to see it refresh before hitting it again, or do you just sit there hitting it over and over without thinking?<br />
<br />
Question #2 GROUP STATUS:  How do you know what is going on in the group?  Do you just watch group health bars and group chat?<br />
<br />
Question #3 GETTING AGGRO:  At level 15 I couldn't pull a mob off the mage in the group, even though I was taunting and kicking and whomping on the mob.  Whassup with that?<br />
<br />
Oh, I'll have many more questions for this thread.  Mostly I'm afraid I'm not watching the correct things on the screen to know what is going on in the group so I can help.<br />
<br />
Wow, what an experience this is.<br />

<br />
I always tend to face the group.  When the mob comes in I'm the first to tag it off the puller, bash/tuant at the same time, and circle strafe around behind the mob so that I'm now facing the entire group.  I can see what's going on, everyone has the back of the mob to beat on (forgoing the mobs parrys, ripostes, and blocks), and if another mob wanders up to us I'm the closest person to it and usually the one that gets hit first.<br />
<br />
You can also use the external cameras to see behind you if you like.  Just flip through them situating them to look in different directions.  That way when you feel the need to take a quick look around you can just pound the switch camera button 6 times real quick.  You'll see all of your camera angles, and be returned right back to first person view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I was always in the habit to smash the f9 key 6 times really fast. Would do it without even thinking about it. That way I could see everything going on around me in several different views and can tell is pathers are coming close or whatever.<br />
<br />
As for kick, yes I just slammed the key all the time or as soon as it pops up. For taunt, just wait and use it when you lose aggro. Usually I don't have the time to look and see when the buttons pop up so you kinda hafta have a feel for how long the refresh is, cuz you gotta watch other things going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also like to face the group. you'll want to communicate a bit with your group about that though, especially if there's a rogue in the group. And sometimes it's not terribly practical to move the mob around.<br />
F9 and watch everyone's health bar and the chat box.<br />
<br />
Certainly stop hitting taunt each time it refreshes. Taunt (if successful) will put you to the top of the mob's hate list plus some very small amount. If you are at the top of the hate list, it will add essentially no hate, but it will not be available if you need it suddenly. Only use taunt when the mob turns away from you, or before you break mez on a mob.<br />
<br />
Try using slam as well as kick once in a while--especially against casting mobs. Wait for &quot;Mob X begins to cast a spell....&quot; then slam him. Sometimes it will interrupt the casting.<br />
<br />
And, good luck! I wish more clerics would try out a warrior for a while. Oh, and this: &quot;At level 15 I couldn't pull a mob off the mage in the group, even though I was taunting and kicking and whomping on the mob. Whassup with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
that's not the last time you'll ask yourself that question, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't taunt if you have agro :P Otherwise your fingers start to hurt! Unless you are trying to farm skill ups for taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree...<br />
<br />
1) Face the party so they have the mobs back...if nothing else is good practice for the big nasty's later on. Better to learn good repost disapline now than in GoD when you see the rogus HP drop a bubble from 1000 point repost. (I give pets back before I give rogues back...most (though not all) rogues are smarter than pets.<br />
<br />
2) Don't mash taunt. Save it, your keyboard (#3 on my keyboard), and your wrist. There is no way to auto kick/slam. I would say slam &gt;&gt; kick anyway. (Slamming uses (and raises) your bash skill so that is one less thing to worry about raising.) The gods gave us barbarians, trolls and orgers big shoulders for a reason. Besides you know how silly you look hopping around on one leg?<br />
<br />
3) I would wonder how much of a twink the mage was (compaired to you) or how much of a newb--if they were chain nuking. The best answers are over in the Arena for agro generation. But procs are always a good choice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aamen</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question #3 GETTING AGGRO: At level 15 I couldn't pull a mob off the mage in the group<br />
Don't sweat this too much.  At that level mages are still used to soloing and can and will pull aggro without difficulty.  Gently remind the mage, then boot him from the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I simply zoom out from first person with the mouse wheel. This is how I play all the time. After you get used to it, you wonder how you ever played in first person for so long. This view follows you around with the camera always directly behind your character. You can use the mourse raise or lower the angle. From this view I can watch my group, announce adds from the sides, invite players in the middle of combat without turning around. It really is an awesome perspective on the game. Hardly anything catches me by surprise anymore.<br />
<br />
Only downside is the camera can get a little funky when cornered or near a wall, but moving around a bit or zooming back into 1st person for a minute while in close quarters solves those problems. A mouse with a middle button wheel is required to get the view, I think. Either way it makes controling the camera much easier.<br />
<br />
Absolute worst part about the view is seeing adds, double pulls, group members goofing off behind you, and watching the group sit on there thumbs when they could be avoiding the situation, all because they are using first person.</div></div><hr />

Fixed it for you.   :D</div></div><hr />
