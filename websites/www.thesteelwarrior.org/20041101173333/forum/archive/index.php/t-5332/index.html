<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use SoTB and CHoS with two anger3 augs in them.. Although I am well aware that you should put the lower delay in your primairy hand.. I seemed too be swayed..<br />
<br />
The delay difference is only 1. And the copper hammer offers a larger proc(179dmg) while the SoTB only goes for 79dmg. Also the copper offers one more damage too it..<br />
<br />
I do hold agro well but could it be held better by putting the lower delay in primairy hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's all in teh math; if you're a sheer DPS calculatin' type than maybe it will be better the other way by some number or fraction.<br />
<br />
but if you just like beating things up; well; like they say, &quot;if it ain't broke.....&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not really worried about damage. Just always looking for ways too improve agro. I just wasnt sure if that extra bit of damage and the stronger proc would help agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your logic seems sound Angel. Personally when I had that weapon combo I off-handed the sword with the hammer main. By a tiny fraction the hammer is better melee dps, and it makes some sense to have the force shock proc in primary.<br />
<br />
Aggro is a difficult thing to quantify, so I would suggest just experimenting with the two for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used that set-up for quite a while and generally put Copper Hammer in pri and Bloodsworn in sec. The melee DPS and aggro from both are about the same, but CHoS proc damage makes it main hand. I recently upgraded to CHSD and sold the Bloodsworn, thinking I can pass the Hammer down to my monk when I replace it.<br />
<br />
BUT, when I was fighting where there were a lot of 56-65 caster mobs (like LDON) I would main hand the sword. I would get a few interupts from the Bloodsworn proc per adventure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would be surprised if the Etheral Stun from the SotB is not higher agro than the CHoS's 179 DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From Sword of the Bloodsworn:<br />
Planar Strike<br />
Slot 1: Decrease hitpoints by 75<br />
Slot 2: Stun (0.00 sec/65)<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Force Shock<br />
Slot 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 171 (L20) to 179 (L24)<br />
Slot 2: Stun (0.00 sec)<br />
<br />
Both procs are essentially the same, except that the CHoS' DD is more than twice that of the SotB, and something I just noticed: it doesn't say /65 on the Force Shock description.</div></div><hr />
