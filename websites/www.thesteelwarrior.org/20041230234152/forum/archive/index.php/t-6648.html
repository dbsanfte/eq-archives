I rarely get off more than 2 arrows before melee and have been stuck at skill of 35 for a few months now. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Ovewrtime your skill will raise. My Skill is at around 150 now at 65 not maxed but what does it matter Arrow is for pulling intial agro not DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can shoot rooted mobs.  Yelinak works good for this if you have SS faction, or at least it did, I haven't been up there since they added extra mobs to his room.  He's not the only rooted mob though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Load up on arrows (Bloody Ancilles Pouch is great!) and ask groups near zone-ins if its ok to shoot their mobs.  Make sure you use common sense and dont get squirelly if there are multilple mobs in camp (i.e. dont break mezzes, etc..)<br />
<br />
At least you get some benefit from your LFG time. Used this same plan for skilling 2hb--just carried my trusty shovel around till skill was maxxed.<br />
<br />
Archery is at 230  now, and there are a few mobs we fight as ranged encounters that help out as well. Mainly Cursed and TZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda depends on what level you are. There are some permarooted mobs here and there, but obviously they have to be at least light blue to you.<br />
If you are low enough and have a friend who can root, you can find a high-hitpoint, non casting mob (say, a giant) and have at it.<br />
You can also ask to tag along with a group and shoot arrows at their mobs.<br />
As for improving your skill ups through pulling: If you are in your 30s or 40s, go to an outdoor zone like Overthere or Dreadlands. Bring a 150 range bow and 150 range arrows and pull. These zones are, I think, falling slowly out of favor, but an excellent bow puller in these zones can be a tremendous asset to a group.<br />
If you are in your 50s, and you like a challenge, find all your guild clerics who are working on their epics. And all the human smiths in your guild. Offer to pull and tank Chromos for them in skyfire: both of these groups of players can use drops from these mobs (though they can get the drops off other mobs as well). Chromos dispell and part of the terrain in that zone is hideously steep (next to the OT zone) and adds are very hard to avoid unless you pay attention to your business. But: it's interesting pulling, interesting tanking. Very good training for your young casters, too: if they pull aggro, they lose their KEI. Makes an impression on them, heh. Or: leave the smiths at home and take the clerics and pull everything except chromos. Other mobs drop the cleric stuff and it's also very challenging to avoid chromos. the cleric epic is pretty good and clerics become quite fond of tanks who help them with their epic quest.</div></div><hr />

Could duel wield it (I still can) and Archery skill would go up, without ever consuming arrows.  And double atks etc. worked with you.  I maxxed Archery ages ago.  Too bad they took that quest out of game.  I would tell everyone to get one just for skill ups. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I think Nexus Scions would be best for long range skill ups...<br />

Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
ohh and use fieldpoint, wood shaft, large grove, cheep vanes you can get enormus ammounts of arrows to plink at him for a few plat. buy cupple bags of compenets or more and click combine while waiting for archery key to reset. every 4-5th arrow. if you want you can bring various components and skill up fletching at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was in my 30's (with my l33t rubi BP, I was unstoppable), I would kill mammoths in Everfrost for XP/cash, and when I went berserk, I'd simply bow kite the next 4-5 until I healed up.  My archery was maxed essentially at every level after that.  It's not hard to gain 5 points off just pulling every level, but it is hard to make up some huge difference.  Just go sit your ass down, fletch up enough arrows to fill all your slots and go bow kite something blue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
point of this story is if you are a warrior your archery is never going to do enough damage for you to even notice. so spending a couple days on a perma-rooted mob getting the skill up to 250 is kind of a pointless task. for most people i would recommend not worrying about it and letting the skill slowly go up on its own.</div></div><hr />

So did my RL brother ( ranger) and we've been trying to build the skill by tossing hammers at nexus scions and other people mobs in BoT and PoV and last night I tried it on some mobs in the Deep while shard farming.  Everytime I toss one of those hammers it says the mob is invulnerable.  Am I just choosing the wrong mobs?  I'm a level 64 and my throwing skill is 25.  I just want to max it out so ....well I guess there's no reason really....I just like seeing my skills maxed on my magelo when I'm at work, LOL.  But I got to 25 by using the little shard things that drop in PoV, I forget the name of them but they're NO DROP.  I loot them when I can and toss them back at the mob.  What's the skinny?<br />

DuH!  Sorry for that post.  I guess I was assuming that since they were summoned hammers , they'd be magic.  I never thought to look at the darn things. LOL.  I thought everything summoned was magic, I guess that's just arrows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorereaper</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created my warrior about three days ago and yesterday and the day before I got him to level 20... that's the most levels I've ever managed with a toon in 2 days btw, yes I twinked him fairly well but I went solo and had only temp and a few shammy buffs but the shammy buffs only for one of those levels. I didn't 2box, only have one account and no pling action (if you don't count the temp, lol).<br />
I agree with what I saw posted earlier; if you pull for your group using arrows (I did this going solo, but I'm sure this is much, much easier to do at lower levels) My skill at level 20 is 100 and that's as high as it would go. I have found it's much easier to level your skills as you go, even if you have to slow down your experience grind a bit in the process, it's much easier to do when the mobs aren't as strong and can't  really beat you silly. Also, high Dexterity is a must, you can get a shaman to make you some of these...&lt;10 Doses of Greater Accuracy&gt; These will increase your dex by 25 and agility by 15, you can't go wrong with them even though they're a bit pricey to make, and yes I used them too, but I make them with my 59 shaman so I can get em' at cost, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason why this happens is because of two things, distance and aggro list.<br />
<br />
As you may/may not have noticed in PoP, when you go too far from a mob, it stop chasing you, even tho you are still on the aggro list, it won't come after you. The problem is, because of the screwiness of aggro, when a mob gates,and/or gets too far from the aggro'd PC(ie: the tank), it still has it aggro'd, however because it is too far away, it cannot run after him/her.  So when another person tries to aggro it, its still &quot;aggro'd&quot; to whoever is at the top of the list, so until you become top of the list, it won't come after the puller.  Not sure if that makes sense, and if someone else can explain it better feel free to do so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belce</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always paid attention to this during my early life.  There were times when healing was short adn I would back out of combat and use the bow to keep contributing.  When I am MT, I start using my bow when I feel it is safe to do so on our pull.  When ever I soloed, I would use a bow and run backwards to get as many shots as possible in.  I am now lvl 65 with a bow skill of 217. <br />
<br />
Having a good bow skill is nice, but whether you hit or miss, your pull is coming.  A warrior can use the cheapest arrows possible and still pull as the mob doesn't care that your field point is useless against it, and it is not like your poor skill will result in hitting an unintended target either.  <br />
<br />
The only class that really needs a good bow skill is ranger.  They actually have a chance to use it in a fight and do something in terms of dps, we warriors help provide that oppurtunity.  Archery for us is like throwing for monks, nice and all, but not what this game thinks of in terms of what we do.</div></div><hr />
