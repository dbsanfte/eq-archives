<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was the 3/10 patch the end of the promised melee changes?  If so, what can you tell us about why we have received nothing in place of the &quot;openings&quot; system, which was scrapped in response to our feedback?  <br />
<br />
My recollection is that the openings system was meant to address a perceived imbalance between melees and casters at the high end of the game.  Is it the opinion of the Dev team that the melee changes as they stand have addressed this imbalance?<br />
<br />
Your presence on this board, after the painfully estranged relationship this community had with SoE via Absor, was (and hopefully is) a welcome change.  Open communication with the Dev team has had a tremendous positive effect on the morale of this community.  We are looking to you now to be straight with us about what just happened, because the wording of the patch message on this point, to put it politely, was obtuse.<br />
<br />
Please don't let us down.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The opening system was scrapped completely a long time ago and replaced with the incite and multiple timer disc system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, as I recall, the openings system was scrapped after we got incite and the disc changes.  Openings never actually made it live, as the negative feedback from those using them on test was apparently huge.<br />
<br />
I distinctly remember Kavhok posting that further changes would be made in the place of the openings system.  This has not happened, this is what I am asking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In fact, here's Kavhok from 12/16 - This patch, the new endurance bar and discipline system will be going live. The extra warrior mitigation and provoke line will be in there as well. As you may have seen on the monk board, we're holding off on the opening system for now. We'd like to get more time to test and tune those skills and the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And here's his last statement, to my knowledge, about the openings system, part of a post he made to MB on 1/9 - The opening system as it was on Test will probably not return. The goal was to make combat more interesting and add some reactiveness, but the attention required and randomness of it didn't do much to help with the class balance aspect. We'd rather use skills like the Phantom and Incite line, disciplines, and innate abilities to define and refine the class' role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/waves at the moderator who moved this from the Tavern<br />
<br />
I posted this in the Tavern for the specific reason that I was trying to make it as visible and non-ignorable as possible.  I did the exact same thing some months ago with a post asking for a response on this same general issue from Absor, which recieved a response in the Tavern, I might add.<br />
<br />
I have zero faith that the Devs look at this forum regularly, unlike the Tavern, which is the main forum for this BB.  Please move this post back there.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The opening system was scrapped completely a long time ago and replaced with the incite and multiple timer disc system.<br />
<br />
And you were calling ME stupid... look in the mirror lately?<br />
<br />
The disc changes and incite was added as the Phase One melee changes. The openings system did NOT go live as scheduled, and were kept for further testing and eventually dropped altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe you misremember the purpose of the Openings System. It was to provide more challanging and interesting gameplay and add some groupability value to pure melee.<br />
<br />
It was suggested that instead of the opening system there would be some static and player activated abilities and disciplines introduced in the future.<br />
<br />
I believe the Openings System anticipated that since improvements to Warrior survivability would have little effect in normal experiance groups, that even with adequate aggro control Warriors would have fewer groupability assets than for example Paladins - who who have practically equivalant aggro and survivability AND utility from their spellbook. However, Warriors have not been generally /lfg dispite the &quot;imbalance&quot; and therefore the priority to change things I imagine is low.<br />
<br />
Given the unusually stable balance in normal experiance groups I doubt that there is any particular desire to change things much except for perhaps a desire to provide pure melee with more challanging and interesting gameplay,<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, what I'm remembering is the line that was in the &quot;future plans&quot; section for about 8 months running about how there was a disparity between Melee and casters in terms of DPS at the high end of the game.  My presumption was that the openings system was a move towards addressing that, since the changes we already got were about aggro management and disc flexibility.  <br />
<br />
On the whole, Im actually pretty content with what we got.<br />
<br />
But.<br />
<br />
We were promised a second phase of this process.  We were offered the openings system.  We said no, thats not going to be fun.  They scrapped it, and we have patiently waited for the promised alternative.<br />
<br />
I'm just asking for an honest answer, instead of the doubletalk and handwaving that the patch message consisted of.   What, if anything else, are we getting?  And if its nothing, why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We don't need anything else. Warriors are in pretty good shape finally (as long as knights don't get defensive of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i just want to know why on earth there is no endurance on some tipically warrior stuff... helmet of RZ, blade of carnage, eradic bp come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by Kunis Marfury <br />
i just want to know why on earth there is no endurance on some tipically warrior stuff... helmet of RZ, blade of carnage, eradic bp come to mind.  <br />
<br />
Cause they probably missed some warrior only items. Think of picking 200 needles from a haystack, you will probably miss some at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Imho they should have made a script to update the items, it would count 4 things, expantion its linked to, amount of stats already on it, req level, and classes that can use it.<br />
<br />
they used a script to update the item database to do the augments, i dont see why it would not work out here.<br />
<br />
then again what the heck would we use it on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kabon Ssteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Long Story short <br />
<br />
Newbie War vs Pal balanced<br />
Advanced-High end War vs Pal could use a tiny enhancment ?? <br />
<br />
thoose are my feelings about Pals with 12k hps FT15 Foci 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 for spells (mana regen spell items) vs Wars with 13khps<br />
(well i dont know any super high end pals ...but maybe somoene could compare and tell me :) )<br />
<br />
And i hope (even because of all the were balanced already sayers to see some more use for endurance)</div></div><hr />
