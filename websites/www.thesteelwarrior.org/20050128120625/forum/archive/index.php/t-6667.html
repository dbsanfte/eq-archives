You will always have this problem. It's the nature of the game.</div></div><hr />

I mean is that the more important thing?  I was just thinking that what good is killer armor if you cant keep aggro... Does anyone know the name of a few lower costing aggro 1handers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll try and answer in more detail this time. Sorry to be so non-descriptive the first time around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think i should just get armor?&quot;<br />
<br />
I think good weapons are important at your level of play. But not aggro generating weapons. I think killing the monsters the fastest way possible will help you and your groups far more than that extra 10 to 25 hit points may. And I think that aggro generation isn't a serious issue at your level (more on that later). <br />
<br />
BUT, armor is also important. In fact, at your level of play, armor class is still a stat that means something. You see noticable differences in the damage you take when you add AC in small increments. For high level 65s and the like it takes a lot more AC to see a difference.<br />
<br />
So I'd try and balance it. Which weapons are you using, anyways? Knowing that may help me answer that question better.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean is that the more important thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
It depends where you are the weakest. But 780 AC sounds pretty good for your level. And aggro generation is a terrible way to judge weapon effectiveness at level 33.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just thinking that what good is killer armor if you cant keep aggro...&quot;<br />
<br />
This is where it gets tricky. And what I was hinting at before. At your level, you're often going to group with people who are a little above of below you in level. Higher level characters, no matter what weapons you are rocking, are going to be able to steal aggro from you at the worst possible times. It's just the way the game works sometimes. Which means even with GOOD aggro weapons, you can and will run into the same trouble you describe in your first post.<br />
<br />
The other problem is ... there really isn't that much out there for aggro for people under level 40 or so. Frostbringer I think starts to proc at level 35? But most aggro weapons are aggro weapons because they proc. And at level 33, there isn't much you can equip that procs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does anyone know the name of a few lower costing aggro 1handers?&quot;<br />
<br />
- Praetor's Blade of Debility (quested from Sanctus Seru, so it's free)<br />
- Black Blade of Tormenting<br />
- Barnacle Covered Axe<br />
- Frostbringer<br />
- Short Sword of the Ykesha<br />
- Honed Blade of the Ykesha<br />
- Silken Whip of Ensnaring<br />
- GNOLL HIDE LARIAT! (Hey, stun procs are aggro, the problem is the DPS on the lariat is pretty bad)<br />
<br />
Those are some that I would hope would be inexpensive on most servers. I'm just not sure which ones actually would proc for you at your level.<br />
<br />
It says ALSO that you play on FV. So you also have access to no drop weapons that others wouldn't. (Like the Praetor's Blade you could actually buy if you wanted to). That probably changes things a bit. But not much.<br />
<br />
Oh and finally ... Blackened Acrylia Blade is 14/22 and is equippable for full damage at any level. It's a GOOD 1hander. If you can afford it, it'd probably be worth picking up, as it'll last you quite a long time. Up until you start dealing with needing LDoN for anger procs and the like.</div></div><hr />
