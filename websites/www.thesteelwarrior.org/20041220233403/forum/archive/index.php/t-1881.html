I realize that PE gives a boost to ND,CA,CS.  Question I had was would it benefit me more to have ND/CA/CS 3 before I get PE or does it really matter what order I do them in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it is worth, I had ND3, CA1 and CS1 when I took PE.  To my mind PE is seriously worth the points, and I seemed to notice a nice difference when I got it(in fact, I only mentioned that I had aa dinged in group, and 15 minutes later, cleric was asking me what I had spent points in, because she could notice a difference).  I am not sure if it is better to get CA1 and CS1 first, but I would definatly get it before maxing CA and CS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get at least 1 point in CA, CS, and ND, then put your points into PE. PE is a really big return on investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it matters what order you get them in.  Even if you don't have any points in ND, you still get the HP bonus from PE, so there's no reason to think that the mitigation and avoidance parts don't work if you don't have the archtype CA/CS.<br />
<br />
PE is a damned fine AA for the points, though.  It's a whole point less for the same return you could get from Archtype points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You actually won't get any bonus in either ND/CA/CS from PE until you have at least 1 point of ND/CS/CA. If you don't have at least ND1, PE won't give any hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally went ND3, PE, then CA and CS.  While it's true you get no bonus to CA and CS until you have lvl 1 in each, I personally wanted more hps first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't think so Graal.  Buddy of mine did Run3/Regen3, CF3, Flurry 1 and 2 and then got PE and gained HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullon One</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree 100% with graal<br />
haas i think your buddy must have been mistakin as to where his extra hp came from<br />
thats simply not the way pe works<br />
this isnt speculation it has been thoroughly tested</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not speculating either, I was there when he trained the points.<br />
<br />
I remember when Warriors were given PE, I actually trained mine a couple days after that.  In one of the following patches, everyone who had it noticed a small HP decrease because PE was being calculated on top of ND, rather than another 2% of your base HP (meaning instead of getting 2% of X, they got 2% of 1.1x).  If your tests were done before that change, then it explains how it could have been true then, and this is true now.  I checked magelo too and it also agrees with my theory, and magelo is pretty good about calculating effects on things.<br />

/shrug...he could have exxagerated to me, but i've known the guy for years and he's not an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azlana</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wot m'knows is dat ya gotta spend least some points in ND, CS, CA ta get da benefits o'da PE. So likes ifn ya has CA1, CS1 buh no ND ya no gonna get no HP boost.  Least m'no noticed. <br />
<br />
Wot m'did is CS2 an CA2 den got PE.  Figya it would be 7% benefit dat way an was close nuf ta da CA3/CS3.  Den m'wurked on ND3.   M'cleric noticed da change in healin me when did da PE ...<br />
<br />
Dat bein said will has ta do da CA3/CS3 ifn m'wan do da PoP verisions o'it.  It jes dat m'has patience o'a gnatt an da six points are a killer! *laughs*</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that feeling.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, well I ain't gonna level up a toon to 60 and grind out 23 aa points to test it, so I'll drop it at that then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullon One</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well in your defense haas i too just ran the magelo test and PE did give an hp increase with 0 points in ND<br />
<br />
but i have a confession that i dont think i ever told anyone about cause i was embarresed<br />
<br />
i thought pe was so cool that i bought it with with 0 points in ND CA or CS and gained absolutly NO benefit from it whatsoever<br />
i checked my hp before and after i bought it to see how many hp i would gain and was sadly dissapointed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, just to make sure here.  I am planning to get PE after ND3 but before my CA/CS runs.  I will get the hp bonus yes, but no CA CS bonus as I have nothing to bonus.  However when I do get CA and CS I WILL get the bonus then correct?  I dont have to wait to get CA3, CS3, ND3 before PE to see the full effect?  I dont loose anything by getting PE before CA/CS</div></div><hr />
