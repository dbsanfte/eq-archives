<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so he really didn't bitch at me, heh.  I'm an officer of a pretty strong elemental guild on the Druzzil Ro server - Veneration X.  We usually raid the elementals with 35-45 and somehow bring out 75+ for brand spanking new kills.  I lub how that works!  Anyhoo, I have a very high playtime in my guild, so I tank all the time.<br />
<br />
With that said, my guild leader was glancing over my magelo the other day and he asked me, &quot;So when are you going to replace your shitty backslot?&quot;.  Shitty back slot?  That bugger is 60ac and 75hp!  Then it kinda dawned on me.  While the AC is phenominal on my beloved Loyalist Shield of Honor, the HP is subpar for even VT level and there aren't even any resists!  I look at other backslots, and while the AC can't even hold a candle, they seem to offer a far superior overall package to just 15str 15wis and 75hp.<br />
<br />
Elementals:<br />
-Cloak of Combusion - 23ac 140hp +70 overall svs and +5% dodge modifier<br />
-Ensorcelled Metalcloth Cape - 20ac 140hp +60 overall svs<br />
-Leaf-Jointed Cloak - 25ac 140hp +40 overall svs<br />
<br />
And while I don't like to cross my fingers for god loot... <br />
-Exquisite Phoenix Feather Mantle - 20ac 155hp +54 overall svs +8% Dodge<br />
<br />
Another possibility, as my guild still kills VT on off-nights like Fridays<br />
-Cloak of Icy Shadows - 30ac 125hp +25 overall svs<br />
<br />
So my question is, should I bother?  I have an enormous amount of AC at my level.  In fact, I'm apparently 12th on my server in AC (raid buffed to 2175ac), but I know not every warrior is even listed.  My hitpoints could use some work, that's for sure.  Svs are always a good thing.  <br />
<br />
I'm just afraid that when I get to Time, that 60ac backslot will do more good for me than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Still wearin my old cloak of thorns 35ac 100hps insta click and decent stats. I have found it very hard to replace.<br />
<br />
Mofu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't even question it. In the EPs, 2k+ ac is a good thing. Time, it's even better. Resists are a bard's job, and yours are plenty high enough already. Let's apply my formula: 1ac = 6hp! BTW, not counting augments because they're universal.<br />
<br />
Loyalist Shield of Honor: 62 points.<br />
Cloak of Combusion - 46 points + 5% dodge<br />
Ensorcelled Metalcloth Cape - 43 points<br />
Leaf-Jointed Cloak - 48 points<br />
Exquisite Phoenix Feather Mantle - 46 + 8% dodge<br />
Cloak of Icy Shadows - 51 points + clicky<br />
<br />
  Let's see... According to that formula, Loyalist shield wins unless you consider 8% dodge to be worth 16 raw ac. I, personally, don't. Nor do I consider the DS clicky on the Cloak of Icy Shadows to be worth 11 points. Your resists are at around 200+ unbuffed... with a bard and resist buffs, you should be easily maxed for every resist, which is why I didn't even care about the resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What Fitemore said.  I would hold onto that backpiece until you got to Time.  There just aren't any high AC cloaks in the elementals.  Ideally, wait until you can score a Platinum Cloak of War off RZ, or if you don't want to wait that long, Fiery Crystal Guard in Tier 3 is very nice.<br />
<br />
I try not to take upgrades that don't equal or exceed the existing AC in the slot, its just too important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd tell your guildleader &quot;as soon as you shut your f**king mouth you silly fat wanker&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would stay with what you have as well for a back slot that kicks ass, And it will last you for a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am of the opinion this is probably the best cloak pre time. <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=26765<br />
<br />
It is 45 AC, 110 hp. decent stats. So after you 10 ac aug, you would only lose 5 ac, but gain 35 HP, so it meets the 1ac/6hp rule and you gain 5 to all saves. <br />
<br />
That would be my suggestion.<br />
<br />
Item is Vex Thall drop off the 2 blobs that are just before AHR. So you even have 2 shots at the item per clearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never saw that cloak drop in many VT clearings. I'm pretty sure it doesn't drop anymore. If it does, it's so rare it's worthless to count on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Silver Steel Cloak no longer drops.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the incite guys.  I'll be sure to tell my guildleader to &quot;shut your f**king mouth you silly fat wanker&quot;.  lol  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">best back slot pretime as others have said IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ozox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ideally, wait until you can score a Platinum Cloak of War off RZ, or if you don't want to wait that long, Fiery Crystal Guard in Tier 3 is very nice. <br />
<br />
The quarm cloak is also an excellent choice if your holding out for a time back item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd use what you have and hold out for a RZ or Quarm cloak.  The AC on that more then make up for the lack of HP and Resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I were you, i'd take the cloak of icy shadows from VT, only because its probably less DKP / merit acknowledgement then elemental items, and it's just as good for up to potime stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dunno, dropping 30ac to gain 50hp doesn't seem like a fabulous upgrade to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tell your GL to shove it, and continue to work toward real upgrades, not ones that involve sacrificing one stat that could be situationally better than an other. AC is much more useful that hp, especially the more you get hit. Other classes want hp to survive a few hits when they grab agro until the tank can peal it off, that's why they want it. Tanks have a different perpective on hp.</div></div><hr />

 You can specify criteria for rating items on many item databases. The result will vary based on how you wieght different stats. The ones I use is the Alla's equipment search and the search on Magelo.</div></div><hr />

i think your list is broken. Silver steel and Fiery Crystal are inferior to rz cloak.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, I lost more AC than I gained HP, so no fuckin' way I'm gonna wear it while I tank big boss mobs.  But, eh, I'm still raid buffed over 2100ac.</div></div><hr />

42ac cost for 50hp upgrade?<br />

God just strangled a kitten ....<br />

(i hope they didnt charge you any dkp for that)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Recorded, but not counted against me.  The drape isn't too bad stat wise.  I use it for when I'm not tanking.  The extra HP and Svs are a definite plus when I'm not being whacked on for 3000+.  When it comes time to take the heat though, it's back to the Loyalist Shield (had 2272ac for Xegony tonight).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input guys.  I guess it's all a moot point now.</div></div><hr />

Would the 42 AC increase be worth the loss of 2% haste?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanter haste is a 68% increase so with either item you will be at the cap.  You are only going to notice the loss of 2% when you dont have a chanter hasting you and then, its only 2% haste so if its a significant upgrade in AC or HP I wouldnt hesitate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You won't notice 2% haste.  You will notice 42 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I traded my CoF for the loyalist shield yesterday, using Tribute haste right now till I can either get the points for a 36% haste aug for my helm, or talk the guild into killing Xanamech and hope for a necklace.  After all ive killed IV 3 times recently for caster gear, bout time they all came to Xanamech again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I use Loyalist shield and it totally rocks. I plan to use it until time. AC on that is amazing and don't underestimate its value.</div></div><hr />
