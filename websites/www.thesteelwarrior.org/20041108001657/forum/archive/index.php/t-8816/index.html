<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where do I put stat food like a 10lb halas meal for the stats to take effect. I just made 12 of them with my druid but I have no idea how to use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">above any other food (like in the top left corner of the container in the top left inventory slot). you may want to manually eat one to see instant stat benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't force feed stat food unless you have a ready supply of them, or plat isn't a worry.  (I get alllll the halas pies I want thanks to my GM baker druid.  Saving aa to GM brewing on her for kaladim constitutionals.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is how I use stat food.  Stat food can only give you the stats when they are the highest food item in your inventory.  However, if you eat them, then you lose the items and eventually have to buy more.  This could be a problem if you go for, say, the Tormentor Stir Fry (50hp + 8 to stats) since they're rather expensive.<br />
<br />
You need to force feed other food.  Here's an easy way to set it up.<br />
<br />
First, I buy at least 5 of them.  Make sure you have 6 or less bags, so you have two open slots in your main inventory.  Then, buy several fish rolls or some other banquet or higher level food that doesn't have stats or is cheap.<br />
<br />
In the upper left bag of your inventory, stick the stat food in the highest slot.  (you could stick a couple in one slot, then stick a stack of rations under that, then the rest of them under that if you're just starting out and not used to force feeding).  Then, stick the cheap banquet food in one of your open slots in your inventory (preferably right under the bag with the stat food).  You can only force feed food from a main inventory slot.<br />
<br />
Make a hotkey of the force food, stick it on the second page, and every so often tap that hotkey a couple times to make sure you've been filled to full.  The idea is that the stat food is nestled in your highest bag, but your cheap food that you force feed yourself with is in the main inventory so you can quickly eat something instead of the stat food.  If you're not getting the stats, then mix the food around until you are.<br />
<br />
You can do the same with stat drink (Qeynos Afternoon Tea is my fav), and use the second open slot in inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">kaesorn's system is pretty good for the very expensive stat food--stuff you really don't want to accidentally eat.<br />
When I'm running Halas meat pies and either grobb liquidized meat or Kaladim constitutionals, I'll put my stat food in the top slots of one bag, and my regular food and drink in the top slots of a different looking bag. Before I fight, I force feed food and drink (fish rolls or patty melts are good) and then switch bags so the stat food bag is on top.<br />
If I think of it, I'll force feed now and then between pulls or during other breaks. If I'm really busy, eating a meat pie once in a while is no big deal. But it doesn't happen very often--those things last a long time, and they rank really high on the &quot;bang for the buck&quot; scale.<br />
Fish rolls trivial at 135; recipe is one bat wing and one fresh fish in an oven or spit. Fresh fish and batwings are both sold by Darius Gandril in the western traders building in PoK at loc 50, 1530.</div></div><hr />
