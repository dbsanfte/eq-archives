But being forced to kill a group member every time she charms one blows. Incase you think the fight is too easy she will regen when someone is charmed!<br />
<br />
I've only tried it once with a single group and we got destroyed. The jump in dps to a 10 person raid made the fight a heck of a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been disappointed in the game in not handing out resist on gear often enough .  I mean you COULD go full thorium gear, but you'd suck in all other aspects.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see resists thrown on all shields in teh game.  Every shield has it just like a block rating.  This would make shields a lil more desirable when tanking as logically should be the case, but for some reason folk's do debate the need for it now.  How many post's you see &quot; I tanked with 2hs just fine in high lvl instance X.</div></div><hr />

She's very beatable after the patch, just tricky.  You need to beat charmed members down below 50% life ASAP, then lay off them for when she pops out.  The faster you do this, the more time you get to wail on her between charms.  Warriors and pallies should be using 2h's for damage, and frontload as much as possible.  You might as well use recklessness, because if you don't, she'll use it on you. ^^</div></div><hr />
