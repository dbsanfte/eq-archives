As for the Cultural Armor, what you have is good. It's unfortunate it's bugged and you cannot augment it. My only suggestion would be to get some Ornate in those slots where it is an upgrade (I believe FH is better in quite a few spots but not sure on that and too lazy to go look :p ). I'd suggest perhaps farming points in Ldon for the armor you can buy with &quot;adventure&quot; *cough* points, if that's what bakes your cake (I personally find it incredibly boring).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
