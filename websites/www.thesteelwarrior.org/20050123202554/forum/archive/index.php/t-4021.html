<br />
I would like to get one for my BP and have had no luck. I have yet to see one drop, yet I know they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there is a common theme, they are just rare.  If you get one, i'd recommend putting it on an armor slot that won't support the 40hp augs.  I put one on an earring for instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">12hp drop augs are now type 7, as such they won't fit in your LDoN bp. Pre-nerf 12hp augs would have tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ear slot will take type7 20hp/mana augment (ooze-covered pebble). Bracer/gloves won't take the solid coal of prowess or ooze-covered pebble of perfection, though.<br />
<br />
BTW I've seen 3 of the 12hp augments drop total through friggin bucketloads of adventures, 1 went to a caster, 1 to a hybrid, and 1 to a warrior. I've seen tons of 12manas drop, of course. /grumble</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocaly</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who are wanting to change your +12 or +15 hp type 7 augs to type 8,  there is NPC in South Ro camp that will change them.  He will change a perfect/pristine garnet of constitution into a radiant crystal/garnet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BattleaxTN</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Around 250 LDoN Adventure,  saw 2 hp 12 aug dropped (Both from Everfrost, but ALL themes drop it)<br />
ONe went to Ranger, one went to a shaman but he let me loot.<br />
<br />
It's seems so rare, and the chance to win is more rare. To me, it's<br />
2/250 * 1/6= 0.133% to get a hp 12,15 aug in a full group.<br />
<br />
And for all slots, seems only BRACER no HP/AC aug u can buy and put there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i saw my first 12hp aug on my 100th adventure in Takish theme. I was lucky enough to win it and put it on my earring. unfortunately i had to get rid of my nice Cha aug :(<br />
<br />
for bracers i threw a vengence 4 item on it</div></div><hr />
