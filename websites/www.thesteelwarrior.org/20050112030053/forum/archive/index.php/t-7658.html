However, given that I only play a warrior, does anyone have any tips to figure out when to call out reslow? I personally turn off the melee misses filter by the way.</div></div><hr />

But it should always be the shaman's job to reslow.  If I am boxing a shaman I always reslow every time CanniV pops up.  That way you're always covered in case you forget it once or twice.</div></div><hr />

Well, guess what I need to worry as MT now is when to pop that Fortitude or Area Taunt if needed hehe  :cool: <br />

If the mob needs reslowed- the duration of the fight the MA should already have enough agro to not need to pop Area Taunt.</div></div><hr />

It just makes sure that it lasts, in case an over-dotting shaman (cough, not me  :p ) is summoned and killed. <br />
<br />
Although I have been on a Dozekar raid (back in 2001!) where the raid leader kept having to call for slow been refreshed because the 1/2 shamans there weren't keeping it on, and in those days with my guild, Dozekar unslowed was a baad thing even for a few seconds :) (Note, I was level 56 and landing slow was impossible for me :))</div></div><hr />

that is pretty damn funny i will keept that in mind</div></div><hr />

I hope you aren't serious.</div></div><hr />

No no no, I still vote for the taunting into suicide.  You really want some inept tardmo slower to play a healer?  a tank?  Hey why's that lvl 55 rogue trying to BS from the front on enrage?  Didn't he used to play a shaman in our guild?  Hmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my only experiences in actually being the slower are when soloing and when i played my necro. when soloing i slow with tod and i do wait for the message before reslowing because i usually have the mob pretty close to dead by the time it does wear off and i dont reslow unless mob seems to be getting a lot of lucky shots in. on the necro i was almost the opposite in that i reslowed quite often because i smoke a lot of weed and have terrible short term mempory so i figured if i did see a message that slow wore off i wouldnt remember what order i slowed them in, so i just did a round of slow, dotted the mobs not mezzed and then slowed all mobs again after a min or so<br />
<br />
im sure a full time slower has a timer so he doesnt worry about ever seeing the message.<br />
<br />
was more saying it so he knew it was the slowers job and he didnt need to worry bout it at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course were talking about raid mobs here not solo xp.If  the RL ,GL , or  me get worried we'll ask/prompt for reslow.Obviously you want your target reslowed before it breaks not after the spot healers go &quot;HOLY ...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe some guilds would find this to cause offense and not worth the effort.My experience is that when you least expect it ,something won't get done  and the cr will suck.My wife is a shammy in our guild and we have a great debuff crew.Our success so far isn't do to our tanking hehe.It shouldn't hurt to make sure stuff gets done even if people are already on it.For a young guild coming up I'd foster that sense of teamwork.Sure you may usually have a top notch slower on it, so what .It gives him a chance to send you a smart ass tell and you stay up.</div></div><hr />

The MT  is often consenting a rogue at about the same time.</div></div><hr />
