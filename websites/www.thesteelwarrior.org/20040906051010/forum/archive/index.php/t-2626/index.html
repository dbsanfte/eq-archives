Drop delay on 1H's to 14/18 , even 14/19 , and the Tactics effect Rage of Tallon was right click insta cast<br />
2H dropped to 31/36 and bumped Rage of Vallon and Rage of Zek to 700 hate (yes the same as EB I dont understand why the Epic weapon the weapon we as a class strive to aquire is made useless) <br />
There would be a lot of Warriors out there with a real shot at an EB weapon, this could solve a few issues with aggro. I for one would like to see Warriors epics as a viable alternative to BoC HG and BF.. <br />
In the time I spent getting my epic, a guild could have camped KD and AoW for 10 - 15 BoC's<br />

After as long as drawn out as that quest is (dont forget PoSky Spiroc Island) the reward for this quest is intolerable, Red dragon scale, green dragon scale, Blade drop from Queen of chardok, blade drop from Spiroc in PoSky, Drop from Golem in PoFear, anyone of those mobs is worthy requirements for actually dropping the epic sword itself, AoW is a 1hr fight and yeilds almost the last 1H you'll ever need, wheres the balance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Droprates should be upped and a green scale source more added.<br />
The proc should be unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Epics were great several years ago, but you can't expect Kunark-era weapons to compete with Luclin-era weapons. <br />
<br />
They will never be upgraded; if one epic was upgraded, then every other class would bitch and want theirs upgraded. It would be more realistic to wish for Epic 2.0s</div></div><hr />

I totally agree that our epics need to be updated, but so do everyone else's.  <br />
<br />
No, most classes epics do not need an upgrade. Only Warrior and Mage need really.. Mage because the pet now is totally useless and warrior because warrior epic HAS ALWAYS BEEN fairly useless <br />
PPL were like &quot;wtf is this?&quot; during kunark already.<br />
<br />
The proc needs to be made unresistable. nice delay ratio changes is too much to ask for imo (Epic shouldnt be as good as BoC, dont forget that AoW is the hardest mob of the followup expansion), maybe 14 /22 would be debatable. but epic proc needs to be unresistable so also non hardcore raiding warriors have a shot at getting an EB weapon, which IS currently the best way we have to solve agro issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;It would be more realistic to wish for Epic 2.0s&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually I like this idea.  Make two components of the quest be the Blade of Strategy, and Blade of Tactics.  In the end you get new, different weapons with much better ratio/stats/proc ect.<br />
<br />
Maybe its just me, but I'd actually like that, give me something more to do than exp grind all the f***in time.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, most classes epics do not need an upgrade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, yeah, they kinda do.  Most of them just need their ratio's adjusted.  Warriors are both 14/24, Beastlords 13/22 (yea, better than Warriors, but still nothing impressive).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I know I only added Warriors and Beastlords, but others too, Rangers 14/24, 13/21, Rogue 15/25, Bard 16/26, they just need to be changed.<br />
<br />
Now Paladins are a diff story, 35/40, should be made like 5/1000000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only reason to do epics anyway to get the unusual effect.  Unfortunately for most Melee, the &quot;unusual effect&quot; was just more damage.  You can replace a damage source with another damage source.  This is the reason why most melee epics are junk.<br />
<br />
Epics were fun toys in their prime and mostly junk now.  I would rather have a res sword with no stats than another weapon I'll depricate in the next expandsion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All the Epics need upgrades, some sort of Epic 2.0 or something.  It will likely never happen though.  Warrior Epic has always been a huge pain and is now so totally useless it isn't funny.  Rather than worrying about getting your Epic at 51, camping Sev or buying a green scale at some stupid price, you can simply level to 56, buy a GoT for 600pp and you'll never need the Epic at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All the Epics need upgrades, some sort of Epic 2.0 or something.<br />
<br />
No. No. No.<br />
<br />
I was around when epics first appeared in Kunark, and that was the beginning of the widespread disdain and disrespect of players for others, for no other reason than they both (or all 3 or 4 of them) wanted the same stupid piece for their epic. The first and some of the worst KS fests I have seen as a player revolved around Ragefire when he was in SolB, Faydedar until he was made spawnable and Sev. <br />
<br />
As a former guild officer, I think epics are a waste of resources and divisive: your members are scattered all over hell camping their own parts and trying to rally their friends to support them instead of member_02, pursuing a long drawn out quest that benefits ONE member, instead of mobs with mulitple drops that can benefit the guild as a whole.<br />
<br />
Fuck epics: let them remain a relic of past expansions, like they are.</div></div><hr />

Once I've gone through luclin it's 16/20 with upgraded stats and effects.  Once I've gotten to tier 3 PoP it's 17/19 with upgraded stats and effects.  Once I'm in EP it's 20/20 with upgraded stats and effects.  When I kill Quarm it's 24/20 with upgraded stats and effects.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think that the warrior epics are one of the biggest jokes in the game.  I have two toons with epics, war and bl, lets compare.<br />
<br />
BL  13 at 22  about the same as warrior 14 at 24<br />
<br />
BL proc mainhand  55% slow 460 dot magic based, warrior 100dd and 500 hate fire based, Argo about the same but the war is resisted far more then the BL proc.<br />
<br />
BL offhand  40% haste, war offhand 30 atk 50 dex.  How many of us STILL dont have 40% haste.<br />
<br />
now the good one, TIME to get.<br />
<br />
BL epic took about 24 man hrs total, one group 30mins a fight tops.<br />
<br />
Warrior epic took me plus guild about 500 man hrs**.  A lot of added time because most guilds DONT goto fear for the golems, ya do the whole damn zone and ya dont goto dok just for the queen (at least my guild never did).<br />
<br />
This for me puts the BL epic at about 50 times the value as the warrior epic, 25  X  man hrs to get and half the value once you have it and about 1/10 the usefull life.<br />
<br />
Rodney<br />
Overlord CT<br />
<br />
** yes a big guild could do it MUCH faster but then a big guild would never waste there time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Plus the fact that the Beastlord epic was designed 2 expansions-worth of mudflation later...<br />
<br />
The leafblower still gets used a lot, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If the blue blade was 40% haste, you would still be bitching about it for the same reasons rangers do.  You get stuck with some bad ratio weapon in offhand that you can't replace with something good because it is your haste.  The epic is time consuming yes, but not actually that difficult.  If they upgrade anything, it should be to make green scale more accessable, and make PoSky not suck ass.  The actual difficulty of it isn't high enough to justify those upgrades.  Also, remember, these weapons are kunark  era.  They are not supposed to compare to high end velious, let alone high end luclin or PoP.  Though the BL epic is Luclin era, I think they did good on putting it on par with other epics.  The effects on them are basically the effects on ranger epics, and ratio is fairly close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">To warriors that are either unguilded or in smaller, family-oriented guilds, the warrior epic can be nearly impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can see three epics that stand out:-  The Rogue epic (15/25, 41% haste and a fat ATK boost are great for the effort involved), the Monk epic (100hp hand slot with 40% song haste is pretty good for the effort), and the Cleric epic (which pretty much all clerics past 50 still have to do, even if they're bots).  Other epics, like the Bard and Ranger ones, deserve a mention as items that are still useful.<br />
<br />
The problems with the epics are the great variability in the difficulty of the quests - Shadowknights and Mages have it very rough here - and the fact that a few of them still have effects that are hard to replace, so some classes really have to do them while others do not.<br />
<br />
The role of the epic quest has changed, and most players would agree that epics should not be the pinnacle of raid loot.  From the point of view of a game which is going into its sixth expansion, your epic should represent a worthwhile item for the &quot;casual&quot; player to strive for, but not required.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd use the Cleric/Rogue epics as a benchmark for the rough difficulty of the quest.  Both epics can be completed from start to finish with a single group.  In terms of the Warrior epic, that would mean that the Fear and Sky drops should be replaced by solo camps (which might be for a reasonably rare spawn), and Sev should be triggerable in the same way that Ragefire and Faydedar can be triggered.  You can do the Queen in Chardok with a single group so that encounter should stay, but memory says that the Queen's drop is not guaranteed, although it should be.<br />
<br />
In terms of the stats and the effect, I'd use the Rogue epic as the benchmark for non-tanking melees.  15/25 with Seething Fury, useable in the offhand once you get a better main hand.  The knight epics ought to be marginally but not significantly better than a Windblade (so say 50/43 with 75hp and 25mana), and the warrior 2hs epic should be similar but with 100hp.</div></div><hr />

dont mean to derail ya sparky but the thing is they didnt have the code to do such a thing back then, just like we are getting modular items now, the game changes alot dont expect pre charm items to be charmed now, and also epic items are ment to be EPIC big, larger than life! useful at least!</div></div><hr />

 EPIC ARE DEAD, DEAD AND BURIED GET OVER IT <br />
<br />
Please let them be. <br />
<br />
People that need them work on them.<br />
People that dont need them, will get other weapons.<br />
<br />
Epics where designed in KUNARK to be the ultimate weapon.<br />
(And they indeed were), and still were awesome until the end<br />
game of VELIOUS (SoD/NToV/Willsapper).<br />
<br />
ITS A KUNARK/VELIOUS era weapon.<br />
<br />
As for the quest beeing &quot;EPIC&quot; please you hypocrits stop the fucking bullshit.<br />
Every god damned piece of the epic (exept Sky) is trivial to 12 65s.<br />
<br />
I remember FAILING the queen 8 times in 1 night with 50 lvl55-60 people.<br />
I remember FAILING severilous 2 times with 40 lvl55-60.<br />
I remember Crying when we did PoA.<br />
<br />
Yes at that time the quest was EPIC, so was the reward.<br />
<br />
Shit, at least have the decency to be HONEST. <br />
<br />
Your so called &quot;EPIC&quot; is designed for lvl55-60 its just a gimp easy quick quest (for 12 lvl65).<br />
<br />
It should not be better than a weapon normally optainable by 12 lvl65.<br />
I will agree that its worse than some weapons attainable by 1 group of 60s atm.<br />
<br />
And dont give me the retarded &quot;I was promised an Epic Weapon&quot;<br />
the weapon of all warriors, the myth the one, the legend...<br />
<br />
WELL DUMBASS, if u did the epic when it was MENT TO BE DONE(See RoK/SoV). <br />
Then you got exactly what you were promised &quot;THE WEAPON&quot;.<br />
<br />
1) It WAS EPIC when it WAS MENT to be DONE<br />
2) Its a KUNARK weapon<br />
<br />
Even the &quot;Most uber insane car/computer you name it&quot; in 1980 is just &quot;outdated&quot; today.<br />
Thats life.<br />
<br />
THE EPIC IS EPIC FOR A  LVL55-60 WAR/GUILD DOING KUNARK CONTENT<br />
IF you are not in that category STFU , REALLY STFU. <br />
<br />
Go camp chardokB or bazaar, at let the Epic be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">your missing the point emilia, and your also using bad logic<br />
<br />
beastlords where AFTER kunark, there epic is BETTER than the warrior, that shouldnt have ever happend, SECONDLY the monk epic has been changed, and improved, if they do this for one class they need to stop playing favorites and make them all better, especally after making hate a harder raid zone (tho i havent been on 1 failed hate raid, it is harder to pull off)<br />
<br />
and the fact that 12 65's can &quot;gimp&quot; the epic is also a mute point, not many people have 12 65's doing nothing better, the only people i can think that do this is very high end guilds (1 or 2 on each sever) we should not balance the game based on what 5% can do.<br />
<br />
tell me emilia what has got you so bitter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I agree with Emilia except for 1 point. Epic wasnt even THE weapon during Kunark :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Harkov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I can't see epic 2.0 being in game as it can't be implemented right.<br />
<br />
Kunark was a different game.  In most cases I saw and were involved in it was a person getting his/her friends together in some raid to kill a few mobs.  It was on hard mobs at the time, that were very difficult to kill or get to.  The reason to get an epic was prestige for yourself.  Oh, depending on the class it made you a lot better too :)  <br />
<br />
Ok speed it up to now.  Guild mentality has set in by a factor of 800%.  We need to kill this because our clerics need better mana pool, we kill this because our rogues need 17dmg piercers.. blah blah.   An epic quest for a single person just isn't viable in a guild mentality.  <br />
<br />
Also, just how would they do it to support the huge range of player base there is now.  Just because you are lvl 65 and have 200 AAs doesn't mean shit compared to someone decked out in elemental or better.  Both are same lvl with same AAs but totally different characters.  How would the epic effect it?  Will some of the pieces only be in Time? Cutting off 97% of everyone in the game..  Or lets just say pieces will be scattered in older expansion areas? Well that would make it trivial for a lot of higher end PoP flagged peeps.  <br />
<br />
Nope, it's not a reality in EQ today.  It's a shame.  Banking my sabers was one of the saddest moments I had in EQ.  Maybe LDoN will change the game enough to allow it, but look how much PoP changed it too heh.  I'm not optimistic!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I really doubt they will ever  revamp warrior epics. Or any other epic for that matter. <br />
<br />
What could possibly happen is that the new mods that are applicable to gear in LDoN, might be applied on epics. Maybe to lower its delay, increase damage and add some ac/hp to it. <br />
<br />
But since none of us has any clue what type of mods will be aviable, they could turn out to be as crappy as charms when LoY came out. <br />
<br />
If the mods are only about adding +modifiers to  str/dex/agi/sta or +modifiers to saves, then it will be a total waste of a good idea.<br />
<br />
Now if mods can add a good amount of AC/HP/ATK, increase weapon dmg and lower delay, then my hat is off to SoE.</div></div><hr />

Heh, this just makes me laugh.  She didn't say 12 elemental / time geared lvl 65s, she said 12 65s.  For most classes, getting to 65 is extremely easy.  And trust me, a lot more than 5% of the people in game are lvl 65.</div></div><hr />

I can't speak for her but this whole line of thinking is stupidity to me. I hate epics. I saw the problems they can create and never want to deal with that shit again. I also think that if we as a community want to ask for something, lets get our heads out of our asses and ask for something useful, not an upgrade to a 3 year old quest that was mediocre when it came out.<br />
<br />
As for this &quot;well Beastlords are new and they have an easier Epic&quot; crap... boohoo. Keep crying and you'll get a spellbook and LoH. Maybe SOE learned what NOT to do when they made the BST epic. Its one more of the group that are easier than the warrior but who really cares?<br />
<br />
If you need weaps then go get a Willsapper, Skybreaker, Copper Hammer of Striking or Sword of the Bloodsworn. They are easier to get, 2 of the 4 can be sold when you upgrade, and they are better all around than the bloody epics.</div></div><hr />

Very high end, 1 or 2 on each server, 5% can do.  That isn't just &quot;top guilds&quot;, thats actually just Time.<br />

They're called friends and / or guildies.  If I plan it, they will come.  If none of your friends are 65, then you'll just have to get more people, or ask them to ask their friends, etc.  It's not like you need 12 for all the fights either.  Also, being in a top guild and being 65 are not always the same thing.  Guess what, people just like you do end up 65 eventually even if they aren't uber or even near a top guild.  You seem this hatred for higher level people without understanding that even normal people get up there too (not just from this post, but other posts as well).  Truthfully, with PoP I see more high level people who aren't in top guilds or such, than you used to prePoP.  You no longer have to show much dedication to the game to get that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">1) Take 2 typical lvl65 groups that group in BoT/PoV.<br />
<br />
Severilous / Queen / Talendor are dead.<br />
The dragons are total gimps.<br />
Queen might be hard to pull, but she's dead.<br />
All it takes is some practice (and CR) to get the pull right.<br />
<br />
If u dont have friends/guild i am not to blame.<br />
<br />
2) Epic Balance<br />
<br />
Some epics are shit (ours)<br />
Some epics will never ever be replaced until EQ dies (Cleric)<br />
Some are overpowered (monk/bst/rng) <br />
Some are free (rogue)<br />
Some are almost useless (necro and to some extend ench)<br />
<br />
BST epics just like BST are insanely overpowered (but thats not a surprise).<br />
BST came out with SoL, so their EPIC weapon was designed to<br />
be on par with other SoL high level weaponry.<br />
(Still its way too overpowered &amp; easy but thats another issue)<br />
<br />
EQ was never ment to be fair, just like Real Life.<br />
<br />
3) tell me emilia what has got you so bitter?<br />
<br />
Seeing lvl65 complain that the epic is underpowered.<br />
While they fail to realise Epic (which has a name design flaw)<br />
Is not MENT to be a weapon for lvl65.<br />
<br />
Because when it was designed there were no 65.<br />
There were no 13/20 weapons, no 14/18, no 15/20 weapons.<br />
No 50/40 No 48/32 etc etc etc<br />
<br />
4) Epic Sword Power<br />
<br />
I'll be in PoTime by the end of the month.<br />
So i have seen a decent number of war weapons.<br />
<br />
If a low lvl war asks me &quot;are epics worth it&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Its a long quest an accomplishment, but if u want the swords<br />
just for the agro, there are many better &amp; easier solutions&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted the swords some time ago, seeing the quest would<br />
be impossible for me i settled with  DN disease whip + Frostbringer.<br />
<br />
They are weapons designed for lvl55-60 warriors that<br />
- Want a long quest with a decently good reward<br />
- Want a status symbol<br />
<br />
5) The Epic Whine<br />
<br />
We all agree that a lvl60 will not bother with Yaks.<br />
Because they are not lvl60 weapons.<br />
<br />
I dont see any lvl50 complaining crafted is too long/hard/sucky.<br />
Because they have access to better<br />
<br />
Then why the hell do 60/65 whine epics are underpowered<br />
(i do agree they are, but there are 20 alternatives to epics).<br />
All are easier better faster are and some are even droppable.<br />
<br />
Epics are a lvl55/60 kunark lvl long quest mediocre weapon.<br />
Just let them be.<br />
<br />
There are a million things SoE needs to fix to improve EQ.<br />
Epics are not part of that list, at best on the very bottom.</div></div><hr />

Dude, do you have no friends?<br />
<br />
When I was doing my epic I had no problems at all getting 3 groups of level 60s to come to hate and knock off maestro for me.  A good chunk were guildies and there were friends from 2 other guilds.<br />
<br />
Sure sometimes it can be hard to pull it together at the drop of a hat, but if you plan ahead a little and send tells to your friends that you want to have a crack at a particular mob at a certain time I have found that people will make the extra effort to be there for you and there will even be a few who were offended they weren't invited.  And for the rare spawn camps like sev where you need them to come at the drop of a hat for some reason the opportunity to one group a dragon seems to draw about 3 groups there and you have to turn the slower peeps away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Given that it does still take 2 groups of 65's (unless very high end) I don't see a reason why you couldn't balance epics should you so choose to perform as well as a level 60 one groupable weapon from nurga/droga however :p <br />
<br />
I would in no way suggest epics be better than Blade of carnage and up but in the current state of risk vs. reward they could reasonably be bumped slightly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Given that it does still take 2 groups of 65's (unless very high end) I don't see a reason why you couldn't balance epics should you so choose to perform as well as a level 60 one groupable weapon from nurga/droga however <br />
<br />
Because if warriors get an upgrade (hence Epics 1.5)<br />
<br />
- Rogues will ask for a BS mod on ragebringer (done already)<br />
- Rogues will ask for ranged slot on ragebringer (done already)<br />
- Pal/SK will ask for an huge boost (they already whine for % mods)<br />
- Monks will want epics to work from inventory (done already)<br />
- Magician will ask for a better pet (and trust me they whine a lot)<br />
ETC ETC ETC ETC ETC<br />
<br />
The only epic that could use a small change is cleric one :<br />
Clickable from inventory (thats it) fuck all other epics.<br />
<br />
<br />
SoE Dev crew have between 10 and 20 grey cells in total.<br />
I do not wish to use any of these for pointless stupid issues<br />
while there are much bigger problems around.<br />
<br />
When i was 60 in late SoV there were no fucking agro weapons exept :<br />
- SoD (Yeah right, couldnt even remotely get close to a ST key)<br />
- Jaelens (Yeah right, Vulak lol)<br />
- Willsapper (vaniki was a 4-6 group raid monster, and never up)<br />
- Gaudralek (with a crappy 2H ratio)<br />
- Epics (The Marathon Man)<br />
- DN disease whip (owned until nerfed)<br />
- Frostbringer (Yeah good old frosty)<br />
<br />
Never went to VP so no idea, and BoC did not exist (with EB)<br />
Thats it folks, thats it, thats what i could hope for when 60 in SoV.<br />
<br />
Take a lvl60 in late PoP (caus we are late PoP atm)<br />
How many good agro weapons do they have access ?<br />
A FUCKING BILLION<br />
<br />
Go camp/buy a GSoT and/or Droga/Nurga/Chardok weapons.<br />
And leave the god damned dead epics alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Drach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Actually except for the ratio, the red epic / 2h epic is still a damn fine aggro weapon.  I got mine because I wanted them.  I don't give a rat's ass that there are better / easier weapons.  I don't care if you're bitter about the epic.  I don't care if you feel the need to whine and bitch and moan about someone who'd like to see the epic made a bit better.  Its a long and somewhat difficult quest for the reward you get, if they do get upgraded..sweeeet.  If they don't , meh.<br />
<br />
in short...both sides of this argument...good god, SHUT UP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">im just saying that the warrior epic takes to long, to many mobs, and to many raids for the reward it grants, i went to a zone with 55 gobs, dropped 2 mobs and now i have 2 weapons better then my epic.. that is just sad<br />
<br />
i guess im just mourning the loose of the marshmellow rosters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Supposedly all the Epics will be receiving more attachment slots in LDoN than any other items.  Thus with enough attachments the Warrior Epic might become respectable again.  Personally I am sure that our Epic will get totally screwed up because of the ability to switch back and forth between the 2h and 2 1h.  One way or another we're gonna get screwed by this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Epic is what ?  36/41 ?<br />
<br />
In order for it to compete with todays weaponry (40/30 &amp; 14/18s) they will<br />
have to add  to it 4 or 5 improvement charms for Base DMG.<br />
(Thats is +2 or +3 dmg bonus improvements are the cap)<br />
<br />
That would be great, and boost the epic to where it deserves.<br />
(46/41 would be a good idea).<br />
<br />
1H improvements will be tricky because....... VERY TRICKY<br />
<br />
Adding +3 dmg to a 13/20 piercer for everyone is great.<br />
Adding +3 dmg to a 13/20 piercer for a rogue offhand is great.<br />
Adding +3 dmg to a 13/20 piercer for a rogue is mainhand TOTALLY INSANE<br />
<br />
How will the off/mainhand piercer rogue problem be dealt with ?<br />
(RB starts main hand, goes offhand, ends up bagged)<br />
<br />
Its gonna be a nightmare to code :<br />
&quot; If its a piercer and used main hand by a rogue&quot;<br />
&quot; If its a piercer and used main hand by a non rogue&quot;<br />
&quot; If its a piercer and used offhand by anyone&quot;<br />
<br />
Into the damage improvement charms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Roehm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Emilia is 110% right.<br />
<br />
I remember the fights with Sev, Queen, and Spiroc Lord. We failed them over and over and over. Now they're trivial, utterly trivial (Spiroc Lord is just getting there, the fight is ridiculously easy even with that lame ass DT).<br />
<br />
I have epics, I got them in early Velious, I loved them.<br />
<br />
Then in mid-late Velious, I got Primal and a SoD, then I banked the lightsabers. They've been there ever since.<br />
<br />
Warriors still have an epic weapon, we have several actually.<br />
<br />
Blade of War<br />
Edge of Eternity<br />
Dark Blade of the Warlord<br />
Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair<br />
<br />
The effort to get these weapons is similar to the type of guild effort we had to put forth to get the original epics.<br />
<br />
Epics were meant to be special, not general issue, not everyone was supposed to get them. <br />
<br />
There are one group drops that surpass them, get those instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Got my info on Epics having more aug slots than other weapons from a guildie.  Given the synopsis on the Safehouse, please feel free to ignore that comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">From Safe house chat:<br />
<br />
Extra: <br />
- Mage and Warrior epics are being modified to hold augmentation (!!!!!). **I know this is in conflict with the info above but we could not obtain clarifications as the chat is heavily moderated. ** <br />
<br />
So evidently, warrior epics WILL be improvable.  Hopefully I can knock my red blade's Delay down to 19 or 20 hehe.....that'd put it back in my main hand for now(replacing my willsapper).   Anyone know how many Augmentation slots it will have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">all pre-LDoN items will have one slot, Epics may or may not have even one slot, so far I haven't heard of any delay reducing items, so don't hold your breath.</div></div><hr />
