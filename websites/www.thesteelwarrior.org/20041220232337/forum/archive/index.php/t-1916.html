Any spots for better money then kurn's?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your best bet is to just exp up until you are able to hunt in places where sellable (to other people) items drop, ie named spasns in Kurns, Warslik's Woods giants, etc.</div></div><hr />

All mobs drop change and yes it does add up nicely. MOre importantly you get tons and tons of bonechips. People buy that stuff on terris for 4 or 5 plat per stack. at level 16 you shouldn't need more then that.<br />

I have 2 stacks or so that have been sitting in the bank from bazaar trips. The good money I've found was on my shaman who hunted animals for their pelts for great money.-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you're iksar so you don't have great charisma.<br />
<br />
But, plague rat tails drop in newbie yards, along with a lot of other things like skeleton tibias and king snake skins and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I've found Qeynos newbie yard to have the widest variety of amazing newbie drops. But all the others have them too.<br />
<br />
The Plague Rat Tails sell for 1 plat each.<br />
<br />
The other stuff sells for a few gold each. My level 8 wizard racked up 40 plat just on this stuff while levelling.<br />
<br />
Also, you're on target with the pelts market. Hides, spider silk, and other tradeskill items sell well and sell frequently.<br />
<br />
That's probably your best bet for good money at 16 ... tradeskill items like spider silk and LQ pelts for leather padding that smiths use and HQ pelts for tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People on Torv don't like to buy bonechips or batwings from newbies cause there is that NPC in the Bazaar that sells both, along w/ coffins and other components I believe. If you really wanna be mischievous then buy a ton from the vendor and try to sell them through your Bazaar mule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree about the pelts.  Some trade skill items and you can find the items here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_tailoring.htm#basics<br />
<br />
Particularly look at trying to make some if the items that are trivial to higher level tailors and you can sell the combined items for a bit more.  Items such as: silk thread,silk swatch,silk cord,leather padding.<br />
<br />
Since your an iskar, you can forage so you could sell some of that forage as well. Items such as:vegetables,fruit, eggs of all types or most edible items sell for a plat or 2 per stack.<br />
<br />
You can also try your hand at baking.  combining fresh fish + bat wings give fish rolls and you can, evenutally, sell the for a profit.  Fresh fish can be bought or you can fish during your down time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paludal Caverns has quite good money drops Iksargo, and you can often go there at level 16, but (apologies that this is off topic):<br />
<br />
Warriors are far and away the most gear dependent class in the game.  Most warriors that get to mid / high levels these days are equipped by people who already have masses of plat from a high level character.<br />
<br />
After a certain level (and well before you can get access to decent gear from raids), you'll almost certainly need much more gear than you can afford, get discouraged and give up.<br />
<br />
If I had a friend starting EQ for the first time, sadly a warrior is probably the one class I'd recommend he avoid more than any other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best I've found for plat is to farm spiders and spiderlings.  Combine 2 spider silks, get a silk swatch, then sell it in the bazaar @ 20pp a piece.<br />
<br />
Take 2 spiderling silks, combines to silk thread.  Combine a silk thread and a LQ pelt to make leather padding.  Sells for 25-30pp in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'm spending way too much time farming right now though.  I was at about 50pp and needed to buy supplies to survive (food, water, bandages, arrows).  So I decided to load up, buy a sewing kit, and go to town in EK for spiders and Feerott for spiderlings.  I must say, the spiderling silks are more rare than spider silks.  Anyways, the point is, I've sold enough and am now a little over 2k richer.  All because of silks.<br />
<br />
Yeah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm always so put off by Guk, its confusing to me.  Top floor?  Where at?</div></div><hr />
