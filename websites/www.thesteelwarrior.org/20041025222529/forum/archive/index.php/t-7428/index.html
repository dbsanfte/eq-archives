<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i finally got my RZ flag tonight after many failed attempts ... so i guess i can now say hello to water/air/earth.<br />
<br />
i'm 6900 unbuffed atm .. will be 7k after a few more aa's ... more after i can grind out some ldons.<br />
<br />
where can i tank ... what can i tank ... what cant i tank ... where's good xp ... and are there any mini-named i can hunt/camp/kill that drop any gear which can upgrade me?<br />
<br />
i havent tried getting a group yet as i have been pretty busy since the kill, but what is the xp like here?  <br />
<br />
i am giddy to say the least  :eek:   :D   :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had 8600-ish hps virtue buffed when I entered the elemental planes and I tanked everything in there except Blazzax in PoFire. When I first tanked Fennin (after the upgrade) I had 9280 hp virtue buffed.<br />
<br />
The field after the castle (field of gib) is a great exp spot. We used to get an AA every 30 minutes and that was pre-LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can tank anything with enough good  healers,luck and DI.<br />
<br />
For xp until you get to POF(my fav atm) Earth is an easy start.Move down left on the wall from zi until you hit the ledge It's a common good spot you can single pull with a little care.You can clear to it while learning the area(best),or, run high with lev and drop down to the ledge if you're careful.Water is good too.I'd bring a bard<br />
or chanter though and stick with the higher up blue and even stuff for a start.POA with 1 group  just scares me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah u shouldnt have problem exping in pofire or poearth. enjoy!</div></div><hr />

Plane of Fire - First castle off the minis:<br />
<br />
Charm of Defense Slot: RANGE +5% Parry Mod<br />
AC: +28 Sta: +10 Agi: +30 Fire Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +10 Magic Resist: +10<br />
HP: +100 Mana: +75  <br />
Classes: Ranger Shaman Cleric Paladin Shadowknight Bard Rogue Warrior Berserker  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
 <br />
It's a heck of a range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah charm of defense rocks, we had a lil grind in PoF one night at hamburger hill, not sure if it's called that on other servers, but that's what we call the area between the fort and the charm birds. We had 4 Charms drop in that one night, so there pretty damn common. Pretty nice rot item IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That first fort in Fire has 4 named PH's for the 'So-and-so of Fire's.  The rare from that camp is the paladin pet weapon, so you won't have *any* trouble getting paladins to come help you get xp/camp for the charm (uncommon drop off the same mobs).  Just beware of those phoenixes beyond the fort are up...had some monk get charmed and bring one into our XP group.  Unfun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i havent tried getting a group yet as i have been pretty busy since the kill, but what is the xp like here?  <br />
<br />
  Amazing. I suggest Earth or Fire in or beyond the first fort. Water is fun too, and also great experience, but the bobbing gets old. Also, the trash can hit over 1k, which kinda hurts. Alot.<br />
<br />
and are there any mini-named i can hunt/camp/kill that drop any gear which can upgrade me? <br />
<br />
  PoFire has some easily accessible mini-named that drop fine loot. First or second field. Also, PoFire has the warrior pet sword, if you want an ungodly awful camp. I'd seriously suggest finding out what tradeskill items are valuable as well, they will come in VERY handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He said they just got the RZ flag meaning he has no access to Fire.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Earth (almost anywhere) or the deep part of Water is by far one of the best exp grind zones. Someone suggested the &quot;ledge&quot; area in Earth and I agree. This is one of the better spots due to the ease of the pulls and overall mob numbers. It's hard to run out of mobs to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 6900hp unbuffed you should be able to tank anything in any elem plane assuming a competent healer. Other than a charm of defense and maybe the pet sword, most everything you want is going to be a raid drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">thanks for the input guys ... i will be trying hard to finish up my solro minis and solusek ro for fire.  i did a few grinds in earth tonight and this morning .... 2 word ... HOLY FUCK (pardon me french).  the xp is phenomenal.   it is above the xp rate i see in vxed, and i dont have the headache of trash mobs that triple/quad for 1100.  i think i'd rate it right around the same as Hard Ldon, but max dmg on non named is only 650ish, which makes for a lesser degree of dmg spikes.<br />
<br />
DPS i can deal with and dont mind .. but spikey dps makes me and my healer very very sad pandas.<br />
<br />
Farmed several named in PoEarth ... all caster shit so far, but i'm going to look into the warrior 1hs when i can get into earth, and the war/pal/sk lance from earth and the big hitting 2hs from water (1groupable names) in the near future.<br />
<br />
thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">PS- my mangelo is fubarred ... any ideas how i can fix it?  i know you cant show tribute hps etc, but even without tribute i should be reading in the 6700+ ... i always am behind on my hps in magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Filthee Mcnazty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Make sure your food/drink is in the slots and also you might be seeing HP's from Leader AA's.  <br />
<br />
Dunno....just a couple of Idea's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">6920 ... 0 leader aas .. unbuffed and ungrouped =)<br />
<br />
is there a way to make it so mangelo recognizes stat foods?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Assuming you have the stat food and drink you want to use in your Magelo inventory (which it looks like you have), just select the food and drink options under &quot;manage my inventory.&quot;</div></div><hr />
