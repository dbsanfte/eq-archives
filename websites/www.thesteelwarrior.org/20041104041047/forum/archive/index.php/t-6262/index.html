<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a question for you Fierce Heraldic folks.<br />
<br />
I just recently got the ornate bracer mold, and I upgraded my Fierce Heraldic Breacer to the Kizrak's one.  Its not too much of an upgrade, but it did add Veng II.<br />
<br />
My question is that if I get another ornate mold (say bracer, or boots), should I turn them into kizrak's or should I sell them for other upgrades?  My helm would be a better upgrade and Im thinking that maybe I should have tried to trade a bracer mold for a helm mold.  Ive read the thread about how little upgrade fierce heraldic --&gt; kizrak greaves would be.  <br />
<br />
I guess my other question is which pieces are worth upgrading and/or is there an order of which gives the most benefit.  Also would selling a few molds and buying something like boots of the storm be a better idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">considering the absurd amount people are prepared to pay for ornate and the small upgrade you get compared to FH I'd be selling it and putting the money towards something more useful - save up for a set of horn spiked pauldrons or crystallized acid pauldrons.  One of the collars from tactics (iron bound collar?) would be a good upgrade for you too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree.  Sell the bracer and buy something more usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm Tribunal so I didn't wear FH, but Helanic Tundra is pretty close to it.<br />
<br />
The BP and arm molds were, IMO, the best pieces to upgrade from cultural. <br />
<br />
Gauntlets - I still use my myrmidon's gaunts as I didn't want to give up the hp on em. <br />
<br />
Greaves - I have ornate legs and at times I do debate the wisdom of keeping them vs selling: the upgrade really wasn't that significant.<br />
<br />
Bracers -  they would be a little bit of an upgrade, but I play with a pretty regular bunch and I would rather see FT2 on a cleric than Veng 2 on me :p If the clerics don't need 40-60K (price on Veeshan) goes a long ways on other upgrades.<br />
<br />
Boots - I have thought about but I ended up with the dark rites ones instead<br />
<br />
Helm - I actually had one but it was banked in favour of the Helm of Rallos off AoW. I do actively regret using that mold now:could have passed to a freind or sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd agree with the other posters here.  Kizrak's is better than FH, but if you can get plat to make bigger upgrades in other slots I'd do it.  Of course the FH is worth a fair amout of plat as well, so that's something to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe i disagree on the Ornate Greaves being not much of an upgrade, the clicky is a really good effect. 31 sta :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Currently Im looking for +HP gear.  Usually in groups or raids my Stam is maxed so I dont gain any additional HPs from Sta gear.  Then next is AC or Dex, which allows procs.  Its nice to have a +31 sta, but basically that mold would cost me 100k+.   I could use that to upgrade other stuff.</div></div><hr />
