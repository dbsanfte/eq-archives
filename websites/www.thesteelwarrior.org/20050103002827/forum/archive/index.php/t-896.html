<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxus Diablus</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of a while ago, Vah Shir started showing up naked to me.  I have the low poly Vah Shir models turned on.  If I switch to the high poly models, I see their armor graphics fine.  The oddest thing is that ever so rarely I find someone who I can see armor graphics on.  <br />
<br />
Before I has this problem, I noticed that turning on velious textures with old models would cause Vah Shir with velious armor to show up naked, but when I turned velious textures off, I saw the armor graphics again.  I double checked, and I still have velious armor graphics set all to FALSE.<br />
<br />
Of course guides/GMs are no help.  I sent an email to eqtech or whatever it is, but got no response.  Anyone else experience this?</div></div><hr />
