<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, assuming you can't use both...<br />
<br />
go with Kizrak, Vengeance is sooo sweeet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually I was asking myself the same thing.. Is Kizrak really an upgrade to FH ? imo, it is not. Lets just compare<br />
<br />
AC, the difference is minor really.<br />
STR is maxed anyways with 1 buff at this level, so it hardly counts as well<br />
DEX, equal on both<br />
STA, huge bonus on kizrak really. Unless maxed of course.<br />
HP is a small advantage for FH bracer.<br />
Resists really own on FH bracer.<br />
<br />
So the answer to myself was that I wont swap out FH bracer for Kizrak, but my bracelet of fortitude! That doesnt help you tho, I guess. Whats your other bracer?<br />
Since you are maxed on sta though, and with vengeance being not THAT uber really I'd say the FH would serve you still better <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
btw. Kizrak bracer really Lore ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope.. not lore.. just logged in and checked mine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fierce Heraldic all the way because :<br />
<br />
- MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH CHEAPER<br />
<br />
Which in turn will leave you with the option of buying other stuff.<br />
<br />
3ac 10atk vs 10hp .... i would agree ac/atk wins.<br />
<br />
But the price difference is so huge its not even funny.<br />
<br />
2 FH over 2 kizrak will leave you with ? 20-40k ?<br />
(For clerics these bracers are THE THING to have they are godly)<br />
That you will be able to spend elsewhere ...<br />
(like bloodmetal earrings, weapons, etc etc)<br />
<br />
And increase a lot your overall effiency more than 6ac 20atk ever would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think the question ever was, which one to BUY, it was if you already have both, which to use?<br />
<br />
Plate bracer is very easy to get in BoT anymore... pretty common off Valbrand.  I got both of mine in the span of 2 days, and I am quite happy with them.  Granted, it's not a huge improvement, but vengeance does add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grishnak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have both bracers, Kizrack is the way to go, the stats are slightly better, and like Grendonbb said, Vengance does add up some.</div></div><hr />
