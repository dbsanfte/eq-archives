<br />
edit: I guess I should go into more detail:<br />
<br />
Don't spam taunt. Use it only when the mob turns from you.<br />
Weapons with agro generating procs are best (anger/enraging blow, stuns).<br />
AC and HP are more important than other stats. (Good amount of dex helps with procs though)<br />
<br />
I'm sure others can add more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior Role 1.1 : <br />
1. Pull a MOB from his location to a safier zone to face him quitely.<br />
2. Position him away from caster.<br />
3. Face the DPS team to let them strike his back (thus increasing their success).<br />
4. Watch around (and especialy in caster's back) to prevent additionnal MOBs to come in directly on the weaker teammate.<br />
5. Yeal for heal if healers are not doing their role right. <br />
6. Recover the MOB attention as soon as you lose it by using every skill you have.<br />
<br />
Warrior Role 1.2 : <br />
1a. you are the puller, see above. <br />
1b. you are not the puller, then tag the MOB at his incoming to make him stop at your feet (and thus stop chasing puller_01).<br />
2. see above.<br />
3. see above.<br />
4a. there is no crowd controlers around, see above.<br />
4b. there is crowd controlers around and they are not too busy, let them park the adds for a later fight.<br />
4c. there is crowd controlers around and they are too busy, Yeal for a wipe, try to get the attention to this new adds, try to give to your teammate enough time to escape/feign death/evacuate/gate while you get your location (/loc) for your future corpse recovery.<br />
5a. Yeal for heal if healers are not doing their role right. <br />
5b. to help the healers keeping you alive, try to maximise (even if it's impossible) your AC (to get hit for less) and your HP (to give more time between emergency heal).<br />
6a. a healer or a crowd controller draws attention of a MOB (wherever he comes from) , see above.<br />
6b. an other melee draws attention of a MOB, let him face his fate alone.<br />
6c. somebody not sited above draws attention of a MOB, do what you want.<br />
<br />
Warrior Role 1.3 : <br />
I guess You have understand the points by now and that you are capable to improvise by yourself when you meet a situation not listed on this 'basic warrior guide' otherwise you would be just a robot.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope it's what you wanted (a very basic guide).<br />

When DWing, the offhand ratio is the only thing that really matters. For example, a 10/20 is as good as a 20/40 offhanded. For the primary hand, speed *does* matter, so sometimes a lower delay weapon is better than a better ratio, higher delay one. <br />
<br />
  For armor: ac is good, hp are good. I recommend a 1ac = 1sta = 6hp formula as a rule of thumb. Other stats just aren't significant enough to matter, as long as they're over 75. Regen and attack are normally overrated and overpriced, though 15 more regen, like on a fungi tunic, is very nice below like 60.<br />
<br />
  For skills:  Don't mash taunt, save it until you lose aggro. Taunt won't help if you already have aggro. Max all weapon skills, or at least get them near max. You never know when a new weapon will pop up. Use incite line after a successful taunt, not before one. If you can't handle the mob coming at you, don't be afraid to use a defensive discipline (if you're high enough level).<br />
<br />
  More general advice: Know a little bit about every other class. Know what they can do, so you can act to compliment it. Know when a caster roots an add so you can get out of melee range of it. Know which classes have the buffs you want, if they're not offered immediately. Know how to react quickly to changing situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Until you start raiding you job is really simple ... piss off the mob and make sure it hits you.<br />
<br />
Once you start raiding you get to learn the finer arts of Mob placement and direction ... how to get the beast the the corner and control the push of the raid (assuming they pay attention) .... and once you get some fancy tools like ae taunt and your disc lineup you have some freedom in what your job is.<br />
<br />
In the end though, there isnt anything overly complicated involved in being a warrior.  I balance things out and make things exciting by both being the designated raid leader and the point man in our guild's battles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be aware of where you are in the dungon and if the push generated on the mob is either going to agro another mob or wall the mob so that rogues (and pets with rogue abilities) loose back. <br />
<br />
Remind people to get out of the repost arc so they aren't taking unessary damage. <br />
<br />
Always wear sunscrean.<br />
<br />
Generally parallele to the wall is better than perpendicular.<br />
<br />
Be aware of where the big pushers in your group are (generall pets). Let rogues know that you will try and face the mob away from the group.<br />
<br />
Play a rogue some so you get a sence of what thier needs are.</div></div><hr />

Just want to dispell this myth, pets do NOT push any more than a PC.  This is parsed on the beastlord site, by Coprolith, link (http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2021).<br />
<br />
Cop parsed that PC's push .213 /loc units per hit, with 1h weapons, twice that with 2h weapons, and around 4 times that with special attacks, flying kick, bash, etc.<br />
<br />
Pets push an average of .25 per hit, but there is NO WAY to stop a pet from bashing and kickin when it refreshed, so .25 is the average of .213 per hit, and the extra push from the bashes and kicks....ie, PET DO NOT push more than PCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, when I solo, I stand on one side of the mob, and my pet is on the exact opposite, and I can verify that there is a net effect of no push, and that my push is just as much as my pets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuddar Raddut</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just want to dispell this myth, pets do NOT push any more than a PC. This is parsed on the beastlord site, by Coprolith, link.<br />
<br />
It is true pets do not push more. However, it is the cumulative effect of multiple pets all pushing from the side that causes issues. Once a mob starts moving in a certain direction, the pets will eventually all be on the same side of the mob. This can create a huge push. In other words, once a mob starts moving in a certain direction, it will accelerate in that direction as all the pets will align themselves on exactly the same side.<br />
<br />
Just as if 20 PC's were all attacking a mob from exactly the same direction would cause a huge push, the same is true for pets. However, it takes only a matter of a second for a PC to reposition themselves. It is much more difficult to reposition a pet. Given this, most pet classes do not take an active role on repositioning their pet, instead leaving it to the PC's to contend with countering the pet push. Which means if all the pets are on the mobs back, PC's must move to the mob's front to counter. Which is the last place most melee want to be, due to ripostes.<br />
<br />
It is for that reason that pets are blamed for push. And rightfully so. However it's not the pet owners fault, that's how the game mechanics work. Which doth suck mightily.<br />
<br />
Until SoE builds some intelligence into pet positioning, this will always be a problem. Personally I'd like to see some pet controls that let the pet owners reposition their pets without the pet owners having to move. Something like /pet attack (mobs)front, /pet attack (mobs)back, /pet attack (mobs)right, /pet attack (mobs)left or equivalent buttons on the pet window to do so, or both so you can either use the pet window to reposition or hotbuttons, whichever is your preference.<br />

<br />
in exp groups with pets, position mobs so that their back faces the pets. casters will love u for that.<br />
<br />
when u get /shield make a hotkey and use it.<br />
<br />
more often that not, as a warrior i find myself taking charge of the group.  to quote a cheesy line be who u were born to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As to push, I am only going by what I observe. I would tell you, just from looking (not parsing) that bst pet (and their procs) push more than anything lse in the game. The perfect allignment of vectors may be the cause, but I am just worried about the over all effect. <br />
<br />
DOn't be shy about asking the pet casters to move their pets (and on the flip side, encourage pet casters to pet up, they are a nice add to a group).<br />
<br />
ON push. at least. you will be the most aware of it as you will have stuff pushed though you, so its priobably your responcibility to mention it. I have never had a pet caster respond badly to a request to change a pets attack direction (as I will sometime have them drive a mob into a wall I am parallele to).<br />
<br />
Hail (the H key) is a really, really fast way to say what you are attacking. I will often Hail a mob 3 times if I do a switch or have a new target amoung a bunch. (Its also a nice secondary confirmation that assist worked).</div></div><hr />

I wonder how the new collision system (wth collision sphere insdeed of points) affect this ? Is it really still possible to go through mob when then wrap (due to melee push) or will the collision spheres block it 'half way' like when mobs, now, partially enter a wall but can't do it totally, and are still attackable.</div></div><hr />

Yes, mobs still can be pushed through you.  Happens all the time to me. Wall a mob and if push on the mobs back is too great, mob will get pushed right through me and I'll have to either back up or turn around to re-engage mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe you that pets don't push more sorry hehe.A couple warders on one side of a mob routinely push it through 10 melee on the other side.It may not be that they push harder each attack ,but, for whatever reason the end result is the same.You get multiple pets pushing one way and that mob is likely going somewhere fast.By the same token having warders surround and pin a mob can help hold it place.I'd be surprised to hear anyone whose ma'd awhile disagree that pets exert more directional force on a mob than most melee individually.<br />
<br />
Anyways,after making sure your getting beat on postioning is your bag.On raids you'll need help with this by the raidleader or yourself directing dps push including caster nukage/stuns etc.In groups you generally determine where to engage incoming mobs and with enough aggro tow them around to allow for max dps,safer dps facing(especially on enrage) and positioning with regard to adds,rampage,ae etc.<br />
<br />
Like Gulug said ,If you're pulling tee up with the chanter for coordination.Even just giving a pre mez or root target  on multi pulls can help.Then again I often just pull a little train and hit stuff that's fun too. :)</div></div><hr />
