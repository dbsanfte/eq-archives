1)  Any one able to confirm that this drops in ALL trials<br />

AKA if you have seen one drop, what IKK trial did you see it in?  1, 2 or 3<br />

2) does this mask only drop in trial 3?  ( my only confirmed drop is from 3)</div></div><hr />

I could not view your magelo, so I am assuming you are a warrior :)<br />
<br />
First, answer to your question - it drops in all trials randomly from any of the mobs inside, and it drops from any mob in Ikkinz potentially, raid or exp trial.<br />
<br />
Second, it is stupidly rare, and the focus is amazing for shamans/necromancers so I would leave it to them first.<br />
<br />
The advice I had would be to instead get 18 friends or so and do the Ageless Relic Protector event for a Gaunt Veil of Purification, which is much better, and much more common - the caveat is it takes a few more people to do.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

I suggest u try the mask from Ageless Protector if u can gather a force of 18 peeps as I did.<br />

I was worried that it was a trial 3 drop only (or beyond) in which case I was going to have to focus on actually winning trial 2 (hate that trial).<br />
<br />
In terms of gathering 18 friends.  That ain't gonna happen.  1) if 18 or more of my guild is in a zone it's a raid and any items are bid.<br />
<br />
2)  I ain't gonna pass to a necro or a shaman.  The last thing i need in a group is a shaman thinking he's DPS dumping BoS on a mob at 97% and then continuuing to unload dots with that mask.  Or worse a necro.</div></div><hr />
