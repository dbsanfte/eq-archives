<br />
Furious Bash has been an ornament (for warrrior) since the day it was introced into EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : It could work with incite since incite is a warrior spell.<br />
Making EB a warrior spell will also solve that problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are sad to inform you, that Furious bash never worked as inteded.<br />
<br />
Like all focus, it affected only player castable spells.<br />
And since EB is not a castable spell it did not work.<br />
<br />
It did however work for Pal/SK Stuns.<br />
<br />
That was nerfed. <br />
And it became a focus that works only on bashes.<br />
Since bash agro is at best non existant, the shield is useless.<br />
<br />
BF+Shield would not help you vs Ripostes (20 delay mainhander).<br />
It will however provide increased hp &amp; mitigation for lower agro.<br />
<br />
It could work on the Incite Line, but since i do not have a FB shield.<br />
Nor have heard of it glowing during incite, i suppose it does not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hassan</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, using the methods that are so often asked for by the sarcastic posters (Haass in particular, who never offers up any information of worth these days, just biting and entertaining vitriol), I tested this myself since I recently obtained a Stormrider Carapace on a Raid.<br />
<br />
Test was simple. Grabbed myself a Druid, equipped a non aggro Main Hand with a non aggro offhand, and we tested aggro on mobs. MoB used was a Blood Raven in Plane of Nightmare.<br />
<br />
He'd start with a Root. Then when Root broke, he'd Snare, Snare, Snare, Snare. Then I would start following mob, and try to grab aggro (tried this form of test since I'd heard someone else tested Furious Bash). It took me forever to grab aggro, roughly 3 Incites running their full duration plus the damage I was dealing. When MoB was at around 40%, I'd have aggro.<br />
<br />
Using same Main Hand weapon, Stormrider Carapace.<br />
<br />
Same method. Following Raven, attack, Incite (same as before), Bash (instead of kick). Next cycle of Bash, and after it I had aggro. Mob was at around 80%.<br />
<br />
So unless some of these brilliant geniuses on the board who deride, insult and complain about how worthless something is and does nothing, I want to see their own tests, and not demands from people to do their own testing. I have, it seems to me that Furious Bash IV (at least) works as intended. Unless there are some arcane calculations that make Incite deliver random hatred, or my swing rate magically decreased for the first test.<br />
<br />
Oh, I was buffed with Virtue, and the maximum Tribute Haste the entire time. Thats its. Main Hand weapon was Architect's Scepter, no augments, Second Hand weapon was a Gold Plated Koshigatana, weapon doesn't proc on non summoned and otherwise no augments. I used them because they seemed nice low aggro weapons to me and that could emphasis the impact of Furious Bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">correct me if i am wrong here please:<br />
<br />
slam, kick (post lvl 55), and bash (w/ a shield) all have a chance to stun.  stun = gewd aggro.  FB enhances bash aggro by X% (40% in the case of the SC).  So when you bash with FBIV AND roll a stun on the bash, its 40% more hate than your already primo stun hate, than if you slammed or kicked and stunned em.  Does this sound right to yall?<br />
<br />
Can some one say yes or no that stun hate from slam/kick/bash is any different than the magic based stun hate that pallies use and we use in the form of weapon procs? Also, isnt the normal bash swing increased hate as well... versus kick or slam w/o a focus?<br />
<br />
BTW, I LOVE my Stormriders Carpace.  Have ever since Incite was put in.  I main hand a CHSD aug'd with Anger II.  There are two circumstances I see it lacking in the aggro department:<br />
<br />
1) grabbing initiail aggro on pulls.  nothing beats dual wield for that imo.  i find the hammer/shield == a good 2h weap.<br />
2) rogues and monks tend to gank aggro for their dps late in the fight just like when I use a two hander.  the hate proc's fix that along with a lucky bash roll.<br />
<br />
In other words, only when the people around you play dumb is there a problem.  /gasp.  Depending on the content im upagainst, I may be trying to stay alive (1k+ riposte) so I use the shield mostly and swap in a sword when I can.  When the mobs are wusses, I 'rutha' bash cause the riposte dmg is meaningless.  I view these as being 2 completely different situations, staying alive vs. just slaughter en masse.<br />
<br />
At no point do I concider dps something to be desired by a MT.  aggro &gt;  all, next is staying alive hahaha!<br />

To know whether or not FB is a viable aggro tool, you'd have to test it against other aggro tools to make that determination.  Is FB better than no aggro weapons at all?  I'd have to say yes based on my experience.  Is it better than a good anger aug'd dual wield combo.  Not even close.  From what I've seen personally, and gathered from discussion with other warriors, FB is broken, and has been since it's inception.</div></div><hr />

No worries after that.

<br />
Sooo it's just seat of the pants stuff ...no parses,but,we've played with aggro quite a bit.Normal aggro setup for him is BOC/CHSD. He often swaps out to the shield for extra mitigation and less ripotse.His aggro is far stronger with the CHSD than with the shield.The differance for me is quite apparent.My aggro production must be lowered and I belive our dps casters take a few extra rezzes when that shields equipped hehe.:)<br />
<br />
Of course taunt can make aggro comparisons while raiding tricky.Usually with my  auged BF/BOC equipped we can keep aggro mostly on him when we want.However, the differance is plain to me...CHSD is far better aggro than the carapace.I'm looking forward to playing with some better shields.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
then get a horn of hsagra if you can afford one. 35 raw ac AND good damage output. dont worry that its a piercer. the piercing cap isnt all that much lower than slash and blunt and besides:<br />
1) parses did not reveal that my offhand with a piercing hit any less or for less damage than a slashing and<br />
2) my attack stat shows no evidence of being dependent on my off hand weapon choice.<br />
<br />
as for jerks on tsw ... get used to it ... its part of the warrior class. they gravitate toward warriors. obviously not everyone by a longshot. those who get angry at me for saying it know who they are. those who dont get angry know im not talking about them :)<br />
<br />
someday id love to figure out why a moss covered twig goes for so much on veeshan since its damage output is so low in secondary which is the only place its listed as being equipable. i presume its because of its good agro generation although not having a proc im skeptical whether its agro is up to par with the better procing offhanders. ive never been able to convince myself to even try a shield in the offhand because damage output is a significant concern to me. i mean agro is important but its not the only concern i ever had.</div></div><hr />

hehe, thats a big IF for some of us.<br />
<br />
When I dual wield, my lil red health bar always goes down faster.  riposte may average out to be low dmg, but tell that to my cleric who just shit their pants cause i took a riposte or two for around 1k each.  On trash mobs that dont hit hard, dual wield is the win.  Then again, so are paladins =)<br />
<br />
2h OR one 1h + shield will never equal two 1h's for aggro.<br />
2 1h's will never equal 2h OR one 1h + shield for survivablity.<br />

<br />
When it dropped I was psyched, when I used it I was pissed. Anyone else have this problem? Ive read the posts under Alakazam and they are BS. From what I know, from testing this item:<br />
<br />
1. When used &quot;Constantly&quot; with epic 600 hate aug...I loose aggro rapidly until I switch back to another 1h in secondary.<br />
If I would have kept other weap in secondary I wouldnt have lost aggro. Zero aggro on bash. Not using taunt btw.<br />
<br />
2.  with monk gaining aggro pulling and approx 10 seconds of hitting before I start in with two weaps, and switching back and forth with shield every time slam/bash pops back up you switch, hit slam/bash and then immediatly switch back to your other weap. Results?..... Aggro is gained on weapon proc, not at all when a bash lands. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong here, the shield does come in handy when your MT on boss.. /furious, /Deffensive...after deff drops,  pop shield in for extra hps and especially the AC. I would like to think that it helps. Other than that, I have found that it has absolutly zero aggro gains using it constantly or switching it back and forth. If you read the description on the bottom it is very misleading. Don't be fooled, it's just another BS sony F-ck up. <br />
<br />
Edit: Does someone else know something I dont about it? Please let me know, or if its just broken, would be nice if they fixed it.  Also if you look on the sony site they mention upcomming upgrades to making shields compare more to duel weilding, any other insite on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">first thing you will notice is useing the slam key does squat except make you slam and never uses the shield. you have to make and use the bash hotbutton.<br />
<br />
bash can be reposted just like any other attack. so it only reduces repost a minor amount unless you just wear it for looks.<br />
<br />
ac of the shield = damage of the shield so 15 ac = 15 damage weapon= 88 damage max bash. sc 54 ac 54 damage 318 max bash(please let me know if this doest hold trure for high ac shields ive only used low ac ones)<br />
<br />
iirc bash delay is 100 and effected by haste so delay at full haste is 50 that makes sc a 54/100 offhand weapon.<br />
<br />
bash = stun agro. if bash didn't grab agro a stun wouldn't have either. bash has added bonus of you know when it is going to be availble. unlike stun procs.<br />
<br />
when useing you shield some things you will notice. your off hand dps is piddly anyway and you didn't lose that much if any. # of riposte seam the same to the eye. chances are your useing same mh and your off hand wasn't riposted that much anyway.<br />
<br />
so rember if you can slam you gotta use the bash button or you just slam like normal defeeting the whole purpose of useing a shield. off hand dps sucks for most people anyway. bash = stun agro and you know when its availble. <br />
<br />
monks with them rune stick/gsot4w will still out dps you by huge amounts and draw agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the worth of bash stun aggro seems to be up in the air... I asked in another thread if it was on par with magic/proc stun aggro and was told no.  I'd always assumed they were the same amount of hate thinking a stun's a stun's a stun.<br />
<br />
When deciding what to do with that kick, slam, bash round of attack that we get, bashing with a high AC shield with a FB focus looks to be the most effective... for the kick, slam, bash round only.  Rutha bash!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for an experiment to their effectiveness, one of the other warriors was using a CHSD and SRC combo while I was using a Greatstaff of the 4 Winds on Vakshiz the Shade in PON a couple months back (it was an odd group but fun... 2 warriors, a druid, an ENC, a cleric and a rogue). We knew it would be a longish fight so I led off tanking and when my disco dropped he AETed, discoed and took over, with me backing off then going behind the mob to try and do some DPS. With a CHSD and FB4 shield, he could not keep aggro. I had to constantly turn off attack and back out to let him re-establish his aggro. The DPS aggro of the Greatstaff owned the FB shield and taunting blow off the hammer.<br />

After LDON came out, a couple of us dropped Anger III on the greatstaff and it is even better. IMO if you have a choice on a Chaoswind drop, go staff, not shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am one of the lucky warriors that never had huge problems with Aggro - I switched mains from a wizard to a warrior right around the release of Velious and it seemed back in those days warriors had a pretty good DPS output that wouldn't outdamage monks or rogues but was pretty much ahead of knights. (Heh, I remember getting groups pretty much within 10 minutes of logging on).<br />
<br />
Then as the game progressed and casters were brought into balance and knights seemed to be given or &quot;discover&quot; their  aggro abilities - I was able to get my hands on some decent aggro weapons. <br />
<br />
I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a bloodfrenzy and SOD and then later the FB IV shield.<br />
<br />
After those I moved to a BOW.<br />
<br />
Aggro with a BOW is nice but its not even close in terms of aggro. BOW lets me hang with other melee with DPS, but the BF procs and the FB effect are very formitable in terms of aggro. (FB IV only remember)<br />
<br />
Bash itself was given an aggro multiplier and I have done CC on Emp runs using no attack and only bashing the mob repeatedly - the mob regened about the rate I did bash damage - and I held aggro through repeated slows, tash, cripple.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I also have a lvl 55 SK and as a little experiment I used a frostreaver (42/43 two hander with a stun proc) and then switched to a 19/24 onehander + regular shield. No comparison, I held aggro better with the lower damage, no stun, but with bash.<br />
<br />
Of course that's all just talk because I never did any testing.<br />
<br />
My plan was to have a SK cast an aggro spell (known aggro) and then see how many bashs it would take with naked slam, then a regular shield, and then a FB shield to take aggro to test its difference.<br />
<br />
Of course, that wouldnt tell me how much aggro each bash is worth because we don't know the aggro delay formulae, nor do we even know if each bash is worth a set amount of aggro, plus there are misses with bash, and probably other modifiers we don't know. But it would tell us the efficiency of bash. Maybe I'll do that one day when Im bored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For aggro, it doesn't do even as well as my Cord Hilted Spike Driver in offhand, but I find that it's nice to switch to shield after I have established good aggro, especially as my disc fades and I start taking more damage.  <br />
<br />
If Furious Bash ever gets fixed it might actually be nice aggro, but for now the AC, HPs, and Endurance are nice to survive the longer fights.<br />

Hi bro. I tank for Primal Evolution on Morell Thule now. Great folks.<br />
<br />
I tried DAoC, Shadowbane, SWG, and AO before deciding they had nothing on raiding in EQ, so I came back and changed servers for a change of scenery.<br />
<br />
Hope all is well with you; I hear Bristlebane has gotten crazy.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

Strategy procs 500 hate and 100 dd, Zek Buckler does roughly 200 hate, at a push of a button.<br />

<br />
If you're comparing a Stormrider's Carapace to something like a BoC, well of course it won't be the same aggro.  However, its more AC, more HP, more parrying, and less ripostes.<br />
<br />
You decide if its worth it.  I use shield when I tank General Reparme all the time.  When I dual wield, I die.  When I shield, I don't (I also don't lose aggro).<br />
<br />
Obviously, you would only use the shield on raids, where DPS isn't as important as tank survivability.  Of course it doesnt work in an exp group -- the danger of a riposte and the extra AC is hardly worth it.<br />
<br />
FB is working as intended.  It provides you the option of going 1h+shield, and compensates you SOME aggro for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sup daabu! hate to tell you bro fb isent working as it was intended, the focus was not only supposed to haste bash but it was suposed to multiply hate on procs and casts such as incite. low and behold SoE doesent really care . altho it does have good bash agro<br />
<br />
unless they changed something during the time that i had no computer <br />
<br />
anyways just to backup daabu some he is right, when you get  to tanking something like general rape duel wielding is not an option, with increased ac as such stormrider carpace is a good option, even better is the Earthen ageis(shield off of arbiotor.<br />
<br />
it seems retarded to me if you can keep agro with a shield on a raid why you wouldent use it, thats just me though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My opinion on shields for warriors...<br />
<br />
If your an RT often, definatly pick one up and use it, since rampage has to do with order of aggro and not amount of aggro, its worthwhile to get more AC/HP to asorb better.<br />
<br />
On MTing<br />
<br />
If your really wanting to a lot of switching, furious isnt up, or need it for something else, or clerics are just slow, using it to go into a mob  might give a little bit of extra survibality while CHC etc gets back on track. However once CHC gets back on you, Its better imo to go back to using a good aggro offhander,  more aggro = faster burn = less chance to die.  (Although if your the absolute last MT it might be worth it, cuase if you die its over)<br />
<br />
If you happen to live past disc, you should have a good amount of aggro built up and it might be worth swapping out....</div></div><hr />
