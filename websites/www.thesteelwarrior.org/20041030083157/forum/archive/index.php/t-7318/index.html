<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read over as much of the posts as I could find about this topic, however none really answered my question completely.  I am in an EP guild and me and another warrior share tanking the really big mobs like Fennin Ro and what not.  I want to get maximum aggro but do not want to make my BoW useless unless I am the Main Assist.  If I have BoW with an Anger III aug on it plus WA5 will I be able to DPS with it when other warriors are tanking?  Aggro isn't an issue at the moment btw.  I was leaning towards the 75 hp leach aug cause it is poision based which is some aggro and the extra procs during a fight might help me live a lil longer on some mobs, plus it will help in duels.  Is Anger III the only way to go or are there other alternatives, not sure if I really want Yak 125 proc with stun.  I am interested in a proc that is unresistable more so than anything (after talking with a few spell casters they think poision spells are resisted the least).  Has anyone ever tried to increase the dmg of weapon (BoW) instead of getting procs?  If so, would they recommend it or not?  Thanks for your advice in advance.  My magelo number is 103628</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally have not used one, but I am have been unimpressed with the agro from a BoW. Bow procs just as much as a blade of carnage. I think if you want to tank with a BoW put anger3 on it. I know there are alot of people who do very well with bow+yak aug. Hell I have seen sews+yak aug go along way. You could get by without anger3, but putting anger3 on it, is no were near ebing to much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this is a joke right?<br />
<br />
you show me a BoW with a lifetap or dd aug on it and i'll show you a wasted weapon.<br />
<br />
get another 2hander if you want dps.  seriously ... the lowest proc i would even consider putting on a BoW would be the low-end yak proc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No joke, the other war that tanks with me has no Anger III on his and if I put it on BoW i have heard from other war's that they have to bag it when they are not the MA.  For me to spend DKP on a weapon for DPS that is simply a waste of time for me.  I raid and exp way more than I do LDON so I want to make the best choice I can with my LDON adv points.  If I have no problem holding aggro and I upgrade to an Anger III proc  what does that get me?  Just a weapon that I can not use unless I am the MA.  Just trying to make the best informed decision I can is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have anger 3 on my BoW and when im tanking and trying noone takes aggro from me on raids, when another tank is tanking i just wait a little longer to attack, turn off attack for about 20 seconds every once in a while ect. a BoW without anger 3 or yak augs is nice dps but a complete waste.<br />
<br />
and omnus, when i used a my bloodfrenzy i thought the same about BoW, unimpressive, but now since i got it theres no way id ever go back, the dps is a bigger help for aggro than i had figuired and i think i generate about 85% of the aggro i had dual wielding when i use the BoW</div></div><hr />

You can augment you ornate greatblade with any lifetap or DD aug you want, but anger3 your BoW.<br />
You NEVER have enough aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">get 1 group of your guildees together and kill auliffe .. loot a staff ... boom there's youre dps weapon.  <br />
<br />
sure its not quite as good as BoW for dps ... but its up there fairly close, and it doesnt require a raid to get.<br />
<br />
it's your BoW .. do with it as you want.  a yak aug will add both dps and aggro.  that sounds like it fits your situation perfectly.  anything less than a yak aug is just plain silly imo  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">haha yeah sass ever since getting the BoW and moving away from pure proc aggro (my old bloodfrenzy/BoC dual wield combo) i realize how important dps can be for aggro. i went from having 14 procs per minute down to 8 and dont notice any noteworthy drop in agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My opinion is to do whatever you want. Want to put a poison lifetap on your BOW? Go ahead. No augment is permanent in any weapon.<br />
<br />
Naralli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If the only difference between your agro generation and this other warrior is a single a3 aug and you can not control agro so he keeps it at all times, there is a bigger problem than augments.<br />
<br />
You seem to already be set against an a3 proc, even though 99% of all tanks here will say use a3 or 125 Ykesha proc. <br />
<br />
To specifically answer your question, my guild has had VERY poor luck with bow/sews drop and only have 1 BoW in guild and no SEWS. The BoW wielder in guild has used A3 on his, and while he has to watch his agro, he can get away with using it during most fights if he is feeling lazy and doesn't want to switch weapons.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps encouraging the other tank to get A3 or Yk would be better than you trying to limit the full potential of your agro generation? ;)<br />
<br />
Good luck, I hope this helped some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is a nice weapon that drops off of ZMV in GoD that has a nice ratio that I might get for pure DPS when not tanking.  In all reality though, every war should have an Anger III on there BoW and then I wouldn't have to deal with this situation at all, not my fault they lack putting an Anger III aug on it!  Thanks for your input all, it helps a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The BOW is a tanking weapon.Aug it to tank with .I'd use anger 3.<br />
<br />
Any warrior raiding at this stage knows how to mitigate and increase aggo beyond the base average of their equipment.I've assisted with my anger 3 BOW with warriors wielding BOC/shield  and  no procers with a3 augs,but, it's situational and not good practice imo.Dps is not an important enough consideration to a warrior to gimp your ma gear.If you're not usually ma I'd say swap in a bazaar or non dkp assist weapon for dps.You're still in the raid to situationally tank not kill stuff.<br />
<br />
I'd a3 the BOW, or yak aug it if you prefer.Don't forget what defines you is tanking not dps.A lot of warriors in my guild use their eb weapons when I'm tanking and we seldom have any problems.Once on a really heavy lag day in fire Reparm stunned and knocked me back a little right after engagement.He then turned and flattened the sa who had engaged quickly at close melee with a3 augs procing.The fight finished fine after that,but, I never like losing the sa despite having good depth in the tank order.You can use your aggro weapons assisting,but, you have to be very sensitive and alert in serious fights.I normally swap at least my main hand out for a non aggro weapon if I know i'm assisting.So make the best of your BOW for what it's meant for ...tanking and use it with care or bag it.Just imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Warfeld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you arent having any problems holding aggro with an unaugmented Blade of War your guilds DPS people are slacking hard.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you are a warrior.  AC/hps/aggro is what you do.  If the other tank in your guild wants to slack thats on him, dont give yourself worsened conditions in the future because of it.  Also if you noticed above you wont find attack or dps as something we do, although that is something we can do, its not something you should be gearing towards.  If you want dps quit and make a rogue/wizard/necro it will be the only way you find happiness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Priceless !<br />
<br />
Let me tell you its a shitload of agro.  Its not DBoW+BF and maybe not BF+BoC.<br />
But i can pull agro off a DBoW if i'm not carefull with it.</div></div><hr />

If you aren't willing to have one set of weapons for DPS and a second for Aggro then you picked the wrong class IMHO.  What you are saying is kinda like a wizard saying, &quot;well I don't want to spend the plat, do you think I can get by with half my spells?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thorvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Anger3 the BoW!<br />
<br />
I have a pretty good DPS weapon (Greater Poleaxe of Sorrow) that i have held out putting an anger3 aug in because it does not have an innate hate proc like BoW.  I have an anger3 aug sitting in my bank for the day, soon enough, when i can get a good hate weapons.<br />
<br />
Dont make me cry, please, anger3 the BoW....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Too much agro??!!! Bah!, heresy, where's my rope?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i was never &quot;unable to hold agro&quot;. my good groupmates would just throttle back their dps and everything would be fine. slows would be done after a good ten seconds on the exp mob and nukes would begin at 20 seconds. when someone got agro anyway he just learned to start nuking at 25 seconds.<br />
<br />
then i ditched my high dps weapons and went for 2 stuns and 2 anger augs. i also got incite.<br />
<br />
because of incite the slowers usually slow as soon as i make contact and the nukers start after only 5-10 seconds and chain-cast. and i still hold agro. i see the mob drop in half the time. i can pull a mob off a wall simply by backing up without begging my groupies to pull their pets back. its a lot better.<br />
<br />
and then i hear a suggestion to not agro aug a BoW because it holds &quot;good enough agro&quot; already.  good enough for what? any amount of agro is good enough to survive. but until your agro is good enough for your wizard and necro shaman and enchanter  to chain cast with reckless abandon starting immediately upon engagement your setup can still benefit from increased agro procs.<br />
<br />
and if that means you have to switch to a different weapon when not the MA and if you cant find another weapon with the same dps then ... dont worry about it. nobody notices your dps anyway. you say that the chance is zero that the main tank will die so you dont need to worry about having enough agro to take over for him? in that case your dps doesnt matter either because your raid is going to win the encounter with or without you.<br />
<br />
agro aug the BoW. someday you are going to be on a raid and the regular tanks dont show up and your guild leader is going to ask you about your ac and your hp and your weapons. you will get a gleam in your eye as you wonder whether today is the day you will get to tank the big mob. it will be a close decision between you and another similarly geared warrior however. the leader will discover you didnt agro aug your weapons and he will choose the other warrior. agro aug your BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I love how much you are quoting me and saying how priceless it is. But I know what my agro is like and I have grouped with people who use a BoW and seen them in action. The difference is easily noticed. I specificly said I have not used because I feel I could provide a much more detailed opinion. Because it is hard to know what aa the people have when I seem them use a BoW and what tactics or level attention they have at the time.<br />
<br />
But from the experience of grouping with people who use a BoW, it is nice dps but agro seems to fall short alot. More noticable during exp groups and ldons. I imagine raid tanking the performance would be more efficient becuase you won't call engage until you have had procs, regarless of how long it takes.<br />
<br />
A good example was before I was even useing a boc, i just had BF and blackout. I was tanking for a group and i think i had wa3 at the time. Group took on a warrior useing a bow, he had about 300 more HP than me so I happily let him tank. But then seeing tthe agro of him useing a BoW seemed like a joke. I guess I expected alot more, but the shaman kept getting beat down, and died once. The rogue kept getting hit off and on. Eventually the rogue would wait to engage, shaman, would wait alittle while longer on slows etc and it was okay. But when I was tanking, the other group members might have taken a hit every 5-8 fights. Then with the war useing bow, it was every other fight.<br />
<br />
I have a guildie who uses sews+anger3 to tank. Works great, so it might just be the player, but I know even he has problems when other guildies keep their BoC's on when assisting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thanks for all your advice guys.  The reason I was leaning away from getting an Anger III aug on BoW was cause the Guild Leader kept stressing that us warr's had great aggro and didn't understand why we would go for an Anger III aug.  After reading all these posts I decided to go Anger III and tell the other warriors to get one soon too or they will have a tough time.  If I have to I can always whip out a Fabled Exe Axe or something like that to DPS.  And as far as that last post bout me not tanking much, not true, I just tanked Xegony as a first for our guild and did Fennin Ro as a first for our guild the week before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Omnus if you have WA3 and the warrior doesn't have it or aug'd BoW you would steal aggro often.  I have heard that WA is huge for aggro so maybe that is the diff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Weapon Affinity definitely separates the men from the boys when it comes to aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Oh yeah there could be a ton of differences. I don't know exactly what the war had for aa, so it could be entirely based on the player. I had fero 3 and all of the flurry aa. But honestly I don't know if he even auged his BoW. The guy was a marshall, so he wasn't low aa. Just listing an example. <br />
<br />
personally i used to have the impressiont hat a BoW would be better agro than BF/Boc, which pre wa5 and pre ldon augs that might have been much closer to being true. Just doesn't seem close anymore.<br />
<br />
I am working on some data for BoW+A3 vs BF+A3 &amp; BOC+A3. I know the BoW is much better DPS, just trying to see what the agro difference is. Someone said they thought it was about 15% loss switchin to BoW. I think it might be worse, but probably not to far from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just to clarify the other augs<br />
<br />
MM lifetap aug is 75 hp, -25 disease resist check 1150 point<br />
EC Nuke aug, is 125 hp, -10 poison resist check 510 point<br />
EF Nuke aug is 150 hp, -25 cold resist check 760 point<br />
GUK Stun aug, is 125 hp, -10 magic check 760 points<br />
<br />
i think when you get to time weapons the dps nuke augs change for type 8 slot to<br />
<br />
NRO nuke aug 125 hp, -10 fire resist check 510 points<br />
EC nuke aug 150 hp, -25 poison resist check 760 points</div></div><hr />

That is the perfect way to put it. Weapons are pricy but so are spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">In defense of the poster, it is really on fault of the guild. The guild leader is saying they have enough agro and encouraging the warriors not to get anger3 augs. It seems the system of the guild discourages warriors to have mutiple weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy BF+BoC combo will come ahead with WA5 (and probably by a noticable amount).<br />
<br />
That doesnt mean a BoW+A3 wont draw aggro off it, or be more than enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">there had to be something wrong with the BoW warrior omnus, you stated how someone did fine with SEWS and anger3 then the same person with BoW + anger 3 would generate more aggro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'm happy with my BOW.I'd say the differance in aggro now compared to my BF/BOC with the offensive aa I've done is small and doesn't offset riposte spike damage for me.Probably, there are mobs I should swap out the BOW for,but, it works well for me and I haven't bothered.<br />
<br />
Er...If you're a pre- time/god tank be impressed by the BOW. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Was it an augmented BoW? Did the warrior have any WA? Did he have any offensive AAs? The difference was between night and day for me, when I upgraded from a BBotE and a BoC to a BoW, and augmenting it only made it scarier. I had wizards in EP guilds (my guild just broke into the EPs; they'd been there a while) complementing my aggro. And yes, this was pre-melee fix so I didn't even have the current bonus of incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I ma full time using my BOW, it works well.If warriors in your raid are using eb weapons for assist then aggro will likely shift occasionally.EB and hate proccin weapons have that  purpose right.<br />
<br />
 LDON mobs die too fast  for me to judge aggro between my auged BOW and BF/BOC.The differance is too close and written off to the randomness of procs.On a standing raid mob I'd give an edge to the dualwield combo over time,but,honestly I think it's hard to see with the rng.It seems that close to me.<br />
<br />
I was botting my wifes shammy duo with me in bot for fun the other day.I haven't played her much for awhile so I loaded up her dots ...has bane now! hehe.I'd pull a mob to camp with her assisting on my incoming and engage standing right on top of her.I slowed and dotted with bane ,anathema and bon as fast as I could and she rarely got hit if i had singled.<br />
<br />
Anger 3 BOW is a great aggro weapon and with offensive aa's to go with it I doubt many warriors would look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">BoW has a 'DPS agro' that BF/BoC can't touch so when it isnt procing it still gives reasonable agro.  We had a few issues early on with clerics getting too much heal agro at the begining of fights on mobs like Ginto and Xegony, once our warriors got BoW's those problems stopped.  The 'DPS agro' of a BoW was enough to hold Ginto on the tank after blur while BF/BoC combo wasn't.<br />
<br />
XPing in Kod'Taz over the last week had a shaman using malo on inc and then slowing immediately (clicky slow stick) as the mob hit camp.  90% of the time the mob would stick to me, with only 2 rounds of swings from a BoW, if the shaman pulled agro and taunt failed I'd have it back before taunt refreshed.  It's just that good.</div></div><hr />
