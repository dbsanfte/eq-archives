<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to do a search for this question, but since you can't search DPS (only three characters, you need a minimum of four, even if you are searching for other terms too), I came up blank.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the DPS of a Greatstaff of the Four Winds is, compared to a Windblade or a War Marshall's Bladed Staff?  I lucked into one recently, and it certainly seems as if my DPS has gone up, a lot.  I'd like to be able to quantify it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its more than Windblade or WMBS for sure.  Hard to say exactly how much more though I would venture to say that if your dps with Windblade was like 70 dps then GSo4W would be 80-85 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't parse my dps, but the few times I have been in groups where someone has been keeping track of my dps, the Go4W has been pushing out dps in the upper 90s - low 100s range for the most part.  HoH and BoT mobs in all of those cases.  Like I said, I don't parse it myself and don't have logs to back it up.<br />
<br />
-edit- at least once it was a bard doing the parsing so overhaste probably factors in a bit too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not counting proc<br />
<br />
41 X 2 = 82 plus 36 = 118/31  =3.8<br />
<br />
<br />
WMBS is like 3.4<br />
<br />
<br />
On pure dps not couting procs the four winds is better. the above forumla gives modal hit which is direclty related to dps... higher is better.<br />
<br />
<br />
50 X 2 = 100 plus 45 = 145/44 = 3.2 for da windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Using EQCompanion to parse the GSo4W, I've found that in LDON, I am averaging 130-135 DPS, with occasional fights exceeding 150 DPS.  I have a few offensive AA's (see my magelo), and always have avatar up, and I am usually tanking.  For me, at least, it produces better aggro than GBOS+CHSD, just thanks to its terrific DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The claims of 130-135 dps in LDoN easy missions with GSo4W is a little high sounding to me but not too unbelievable.  I parse quite a bit and using GSo4W on easy missions with PB3, TM3, Fero3, Crits2 and avatar and enchanter haste I can end up doing 100-115 dps while tanking.  This is an average over the course of a whole night xping though, obviously you get those freak fights with very high dps every once in a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With maxed offensive AA's, I would say a GSot4W could average around 115dps at most.  I don't have one, but I have used eqcompanion in a group with another warrior with one a few months back. . .the average seemed to be about 110dps (not counting procs).  This person had almost all offensive AA's except double riposte I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are probably speaking in terms of POP mobs.  I would expect my DPS to be a little lower on those, but I haven't had a chance to parse the GSO4W there yet.  My DPS numbers do seem to be pleasantly high in LDON.  I really do see &gt;150 DPS on every fifth LDON mob or so, even though I tank.<br />
<br />
The last parses that I did in Tactics were with SBOD+CHSD a while back, and I was averaging about 90 DPS tanking with that setup, about 100 DPS from the rear.  I do always have avatar/FA up, so this may inflate my numbers a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In LDON with the Greatstaff, the warrior in my group regularly reports 125-150 on the rear of the mob, with perhaps.. vengeance 3?,Avatar, SoT and my Aura for attack buffs. Under aggressive she'll post ~175 on fights without flurries, 200+ when flurry is kind to her. If I recall correctly, it's with an attack of about 1650.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With PB3, Ferocity3, Flurry3 and Raging Flurry 2 I do about 110-115 in POP and 125-130 in LDON (I use YALP as my parser) with my Greatstaff of the Four Winds. I also agree that the DPS alone does a decent job on aggro a lot of the time (superior to CHSD, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't forget to remove any Damage Shields from those numbers. With full offensive AA's when overhasted and always while tanking (with GSo4W) I'm would be content to say I am averaging:<br />
<br />
BoT just under 100 dps<br />
HoH just over 100 dps.<br />
LDoN up to 120dps, peaks at 140.<br />
<br />
Actually parsing and proving it would be a pain in the ass. Was I hasted properly that fight? How much did that DS contribute? Was I paying attention and not miss the first 20 seconds? Did I switch mobs before it was dead? Did Finishing Blow give that 400dps? Did I have Avatar on? Ranger ATK buffs or Beastlord or Bard or none or just some? etc. etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ldon are short fights that inflate the dps numbers. in a 23 second fight i can hit 150dps. when your hitting for 280+ evey few seconds its easy. a longer fight would bring your dps down again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/cough 135dps? I dunno if I'd buy that. You don't have maxed offensive or anything and in LDoN I was grouped with a time geared group and the warrior with maxed offensive AA was getting around 135dps, I wasn't parsing at the time, but the monk said I had around 98ish dps with my GSot4W.<br />
<br />
And these claims of 175dps? I really think something else is going on there... maybe severe brain damage? Or your warrior is lying abotu his dps :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just parsed on a katta banker.  116 dps, with avatar, 41% worn haste, 20% clicked haste.  Max flurry (but had few during this parse), PB3, Fero1.  Full buffs (especially haste), fero3, and normal luck on flurry, I could easily see 135.<br />

Nice job making an ass about yourself, while showing low reading comprehension. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hussar's numbers come pretty close to mine when i did these parses.  Full atk buffs , enchanter haste, 41% worn haste. most offensive aa's. Came out to 131dps over the course of 2 hours.  <br />
<br />
As for Aggressive disc.  You get bad discs and you get great discs on occassion.  Its a pretty wide range, on a good disc seeing 180-200dps isn't out of the question/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So agressive increases Dps by 40%? Mine must be broken then. <br />
<br />
Maybe the time warrior I was grouped with was doing 135dps with only ripostes, in which case he managed to out damage me by far without pressing auto attack. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The GSot4W will bring you a real steady stream of damage. Maybe its 115 or 125 per second but thats the region you can look at when youre 65 with full maxed AAs in regular mode. You will have fights with 150+ DPS and others with 100 or 95 DPS but thats all about the RNG by misses and hits.<br />
<br />
The warrior in my guild use this one ( when they have it  / others use BBB ) for the damage part on raids when they are not tanking. For the effords you have to do its the very best 2h weapon in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There's nothing to wonder about, Omnidream, run your own parses on yourself or the people you group with, and I think you'll see what everyone else in this thread sees.  If the BoWar averages 150 DPS in xp groups as reported, then the GSo4W is reading correctly at 130-135.  98 DPS is low for a GSo4W, I could see you getting that in Luclin perhaps, or if your ATK is under 1200, or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">With ~1650atk and max haste, I push about 95-105dps in LDoN groups.  With full Offensive AA's, I could easily see someone pushing 125-140dps with this weapon.  It puts out a very solid, steady stream of damage with its 31 delay. <br />
<br />
Max crippling blow hit is like 748 or something.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Okay, so Sass you're saying you parse normally at 135dps with your unmaxed offensive AA?</div></div><hr />
