Anyone have any clue as to what was changed with yesterday's patch that completely FUBAR'd all my possible choices for UI? currently run Delta and SARS4 and neither will work at all. keeps throwing me back to the default one. Any help would be appreciated as I didn't realize I had become that used/dependant on the UI /grin.</div></div><hr />

But use Delta 3 on most of my toons.  I went to EQInterface and found the changes that were made.  Modifications need to be made to your EQ Animations file.  Directions for what to do are in their forums.  Worked like a charm after applying the changes.</div></div><hr />

Sars posted an update to the UI after that patch to fix a few things. Not sure if that would have anything to do with yours not working now, but i updated my sars4 and it still works after yesterday.</div></div><hr />

Software suite used to compare xml files in the fly from different directories and it shows you the changes in each folder from the default UI to most custom UI's. Also allows you to cut/paste the changes directly into the modified files.<br />

Ive been using this tool since Vert's UI stopped being updated and ive had no issues with my UI's on patch days.</div></div><hr />
