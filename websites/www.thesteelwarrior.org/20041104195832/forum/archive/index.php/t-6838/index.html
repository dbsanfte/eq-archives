<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ourgarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there new to this board and from what I have seen so far this is a real nice forum.  Lots of usefull information.  <br />
<br />
Today while grping in DawnShroud I had another warrior run up and inspect my gear then proceed to tell my grp that I was under equipped and that my grp needed a real tank with good hps.  I was in shock.  The grp started telliing me that the guy is a UBER twink and and Ass Hat.  <br />
<br />
I started feeling badly about my gear.  He was 15 levels under me and had over a K easily of more hps.  Needless to say I could use some help.  I know from reading on this board and other generic boards not Warrior specific that I want AC and HPs.  <br />
<br />
Please look at my gear and let me know what I could change or possibly farm to get better gear.  I want lots of Hps this is why I made an Ogre and put all starting points into Stamina.  I can farm other areas with my 55 Monk, and guild support as we desperately need a warrior in our guild.  I have about 10k to spend and can get about 10k more by selling off some of my Monks stuff.<br />
<br />
Ok I updated his AC and ATK so its a bit better for U to get a idea of his true stats.<br />
Thanks for all the help so far.  Just felt like wow I must really suck if this guy was saying all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, go into your magelo and set your offense and defense skills properly.  That will fix your overall AC and ATK numbers that are computed by magelo.<br />
<br />
I have a totally untwinked level 39 ranger on a different server from my main.  She has 1370 HP, 780 AC and 800 ATK unbuffed, strictly from bazaar purchases funded from 39 levels of looting monster corpses while soloing.  I think you are looking pretty good compared to that.  Obviously when you get into serious twinking, the sky is almost the limit, and this will skew some people's perceptions.  You appear to be on target to exceed 850 AC and 2500 HP in your early 40's, so you are definitely not underequipped.<br />
<br />
I see that you have the &quot;skeleton army&quot; weapons, just like my ranger does.  Those are nice catches, and can serve you into your 50's.  I suggest that you use your Steel Rod of the Knight as your primary weapon.  You'll get better DPS than your dual wield setup, and I also find that the 2hb gives better aggro.  It is enough aggro to compensate a level 39 druid casting 3 DOTs, snare, and multiple castings of Greater Heal vs. a yellow mob, and then sitting immediately.  The lifetap proc also works at your level, and is very pleasant when it goes off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry too much about equipments, you're doing great for your level. I think I had a bit less when I was 39...<br />
<br />
Once you hit 50ish, you may want to consider taking a break from XPing to catch up, gear wise. Theres lots of stuff out there you'd be able to duo with a shaman, druid, or cleric and make money from, or even net some upgrades. Velkators Labrynth would be a good spot once you hit 46ish, and by your 50s you should be able to easily handle the frenzied (or other named) camps with a shaman. The frenzied velium broodling drops Silver Chitin Wristbands, and even at 63 I still use em, mostly because they're the only affordable or easily obtainable wrist items. Even after you get two of em, they go for at least 6k on most servers, and on ARo its common to see them for 8k. All the mobs in velks have a chance to drop velium bricks and blocks, which are usually an easy sale in the bazaar at 100pp per brick/block.<br />
<br />
You could also try some Legacy of Ykesha zones, you could probably handle the Gulf of Gunthak with a partner/group at 39, and then move into dulak at 46-50. Most of the mobs there have a chance to drop a gem, and theres also the boats and various other nice camps that give you an equal shot at gems as any other camp, but also drop loot that sells for several thousand plat. <br />
<br />
If you really want to get some cash now, you could try going to the feerott and killing any spider in sight for spider silks/spiderling silks. They sell pretty fast in the bazaar for roughly 10 plat each, and if your willing to skill up a bit in tailoring you could also make leather padding (http://www.eqtraders.com for recipes) which sells for about 20-25 plat each in the bazaar. I suggest you just tough it out until 46 or so, then move into one of the zones i suggested with a group or partner, preferably a partner so you could get a bit more of the loot and be able to afford some upgrades in reasonable time. As for what gear you should be looking for, look for stuff that has some AC on it and HP on it. All of your slots should have decent AC and at LEAST 20 HP. STA is nice, but its easily buffed to its maximum and doesn't give you a very noticable HP boost until 55+. I imagine most of the gear that you'd find with AC and HP on it also has some form of STA on it anyways.<br />
<br />
I would suggest reaching a minimum of 3k HP and 1k AC by the time your 50ish, that would be more than enough to handle the common level 50 experience zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your gear is fine at your level; the guy was an idiot.<br />
Heh, once when I was in dreadlands I was grouped with a person who kept inspecting people in the group and saying in /g &quot;your arms suck&quot; and so forth. First person he did that to was me. I was pulling and tanking, too busy to talk. Had an SK in the group, so I'd pull and tank until the mob was 10% or so from running, then SK would grab aggro and I'd go pull another mob so that it arrived in camp just as first mob went down.  Fire was always concentrated on one mob, and there was always just one mob in camp, and never less than one mob, and we were mowing them down. Finally about the third time this guy told someone that their gear sucked (shoulder piece, if I recall correctly), I had just started pulling. I stopped, waited for the mob to die, then stood in front of the group. when I was sure that they noticed that there was no mob and no pull, I said, /g &quot;Bad shoulder pads have never ever ever caused a death or group wipe. Stupid playing, however, gets people killed all the time.&quot;<br />
That was the first thing other than /g &quot;Incoming %T&quot; and /g &quot;mana?&quot; that I had said for 20 minutes or so, and after that Mr. Inspector stopped being a dick.<br />
<br />
When you go to upgrade your gear, be methodical in your bazaar search. Search by your race, class, religion, and budget for each slot. Take notes on what gets you the best AC/hp upgrade for the buck. then buy that.<br />
<br />
Soon you are probably going to be looking at a lot of Fierce heraldic stuff; start checking prices now to see what amount you'll have to save for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turgan7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't worry if any uber twink tells you that your gear sucks. It will always compared to his. Worry about how good you can tank the mobs you are usually faceing. If you stay alive and you healer isn't burning all mana on you you are fine. Save you money and buy more cultural when you can afford it. On the way stock up some money for aggro weapons for the time when you have trouble keeping aggro in regular groups.<br />
<br />
It's the player that matters not the gear, within reasonable margin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Holofernes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The guy was a dumbass, don't even worry about him. Some can buy all the best gear in the world, but they will never buy a brain...</div></div><hr />

Well thank you all for some great words of wisdom.  I found out that one of our old Tanks who has now moved on to a Planar Guild had old armor he had on seller.  He asked me how much Plat I had and told him about 12k saved now he sold me every bit of that Fierce stuff you now see on my profile for half of what I had.  6k yes sir there sure are some great people out there.  He also told me since I had money left over to buy that face piece.  When I did that he said hey here is a new weapon too.   Needless to say I am very grateful to this person.  Promising when I replace with better to help out another New Warrior.   <br />
<br />
Now to work on More levels hehe been a blast so far and as he told me it only gets better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just thougth I would make this comment:<br />
<br />
Up until the upper 50s, warrior gear isn't that big of an issue.  Get some HPs and get some AC and you are set.  Where things get hairy is around 60+.  This is when warriors become very dependant on the gear they wear.  I remember back in the day when I was 6k group buffed in BoT trying to XP.  I would get owned pretty regularly.  Inc &lt;&lt; a Jord Kriegar &gt;&gt; could = splat for me.  Also, aggro is a big issue for warriors.  Not so much now with incite, but before incite I would get so pissed that I couldn't hold aggro.  Then I got a Greatstaff of Thunder (before they went to 20pp each) and my aggro inproved significanlty.  When I got to around level 60, I started farming like crazy.  I couldn't do what my class was intended to do with the gear I was wearing.  I had to correct it.  As you approach level 65, you should have at least a greatstaff of thunder (someone told me they changed the aggro on this though) or a sword of the bloodsworn/copperhammer of striking combo.  Armore wise, you should have at least Fierce Heraldic (or other comperable cultured) on arms, chest, legs, feet, neck, wrist, face, and shoulders.  A helm of Raldukan on your head.  That 31% haste belt from Veksar (can't think of the name, and I can't get on Alla at work).  2 Vallorium Rings of Gallantry on your fingers (at least they are ass cheap on Torv).  2 earrings with 50hps+.  A cloak of greater pernincity on your back.  A bow with HPs in range slot.  This is what you should be working for gear wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ourgarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Dozan<br />
<br />
Thats kind of cool that U told me some stuff I need to be looking at getting when I am 65.  I am going to just keep me how I am and start going LVL crazy again hehe.  Do appreciate the look into the future and I Now own that staff was only 50p so I picked it up.  Will look into those weapons when Im higher in level and have a bit more Plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dude, now that I&quot;m at home and can look at your profile, you are pretty hauss for lvl 41.  OMG!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i had a crusty bp at 41 ... and crusty legs .. and crusty arms ... and crusty bracers ... get the point?<br />
<br />
<br />
who the heck cares how many hps you have at that lv?  its not like the lv 39 clerics you group with in DSP need the extra 1k hps to land that cheal in time.<br />
dont sweat it bro, your gear is good enough for a lv 60 tanking in PoDisease.  the guy is just an asshat.  do your server a favor and kick him in the balls next time you see him.<br />
<br />
if youre really looking for upgrade suggestions ... i would first fill every visible and nonvisible slot you have with fierce heraldic .. one at a time.  after that, buy youserlf either the droga combo (CHoS SoTBS) or a greatstaff of thunder if youre 55 by the time you finish buying fierce hereldic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Phbt. I had almost full Crusty at level 52! Don't put that stuff down, it owned back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ourgarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">HEHE <br />
Unfortunately when U update Magelo it changes all the other times U posted so It looks like I have been UBER equipped when in fact when I first came here I had not crap gear but not as nice as I have now.  I too was wearing alot of Crusty hehe I love that 16 STA legs.  Yeah now Im no longer worried about Armor and will continue to do the Furious Upgrades I need.  Deffinately need to upgrade the Helm and Bracers.<br />
<br />
Weapons well that is another story all together will work on them as I can.  Pretty Happy with how I am now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the great advice I have gotten on this sight do appreciate it greatly.</div></div><hr />
