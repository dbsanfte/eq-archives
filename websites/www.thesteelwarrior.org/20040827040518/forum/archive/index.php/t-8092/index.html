<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Furious may have been nerfed in the recent patch, in Tipt/Vxed.<br />
 <br />
Now, if any warrior uses furious, you get the same emote that you used to get with defensive. The mob will turn to any other melee instead, and kill them, if you engage furious.<br />
 <br />
Not sure if the other types, IE WS, got nerfed as well, but it seems likely.<br />
 <br />
I am not at ALL happy with this. Almost our entire ability set has been nerfed to oblivion, and made useless, with no compensation that I am aware of. Meanwhile the knights still can use their entire ability set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope not. The defensive changed sucked, nerfing furious as well /rude.<br />
<br />
This would be one of the great times for our class correspondant to come out of his burrow and poke his head up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ouch, that would really really bite.  But it would also shut the Knights up once and for all on their continual bitching about WS.  Kind of a mixed blessing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stemcell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did Tipt on the 14th and Jhiru didn't turn when I was Furious. So must have been the 15th patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When does it fucking end?<br />
<br />
That is 2 direct nerfs to our class, I think we should be up in arms over this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where is that guy anyways? I haven't seen him post since he got the position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Changing capapbilities of one mob I wouldn't really call game breaking or a nerf to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scrabler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Changing capapbilities of one mob I wouldn't really call game breaking or a nerf to us.<br />
<br />
When it was too hard for Knights it was &quot;game breaking&quot;. Fuckers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where is that guy anyways? I haven't seen him post since he got the position.The war liason? He's awol or some shit, pretty much the most useless class rep of all the communities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is this confirmed?  Is it just select mobs?  Is it evident in other GoD zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There were reports that you could lose aggro using any discipline (including furious) when they put it in game, so it wasn't restricted to just defensive.<br />
<br />
Now, there were reports on the 14th that it was producing a corrupt line (&quot;?&quot; where a player character name should have been) and indications that you always lose aggro on him.<br />
<br />
I think this is more along the lines that they broke the &quot;check if my tank is using a discipline&quot; script.  If true, it may behave differently than it is supposed to behave.<br />
<br />
I do agree the whole change (making us lose agro if we use any discipline) is a lame way to solve the problem of level 65 characters in level 70 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I lost agro using fortitude in ssra for a split second.  I was tanking XTC got low hp's poped fortitude and it spun on someon else after i had the lock for like 5-6 minutes.  I was able to use AE Taunt to get it back but it was after i clicked fortitude off =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey guys, I took this issue to the Class Correspondents' forum as the first issue I commented on, asking if it was an oversight or not, and whether it has been fixed, if not, a tentative date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cool. Did I miss something? When did you get picked for class correspondent? I thought we had someone else? kalanu or something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dont ask just take it and be glad we got frodlin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Has anyone seen this and confirmed it? <br />
<br />
I asked a dev and they said that nothing was changed, its possible that he just wanst informed of it, but again has anyone actual seen and confirmed it or is it just a rumor?<br />
<br />
\\\\\\\\\<br />
<br />
Re: My opinion, if its true its dumb as hell, the only reason fort is so powerful is because of charm, thats the problem, nerf that! (haha)  furious is probably a little to powerful against single group named, but not enough to warrant a change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They need to stop fucking with tipt and let it be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Reports are coming in that monster in SSra are also doing this even tho they are not ment to.<br />
<br />
Nice of the jackasses to sneak this into the patch and not even have the balls to mention it.<br />
<br />
Same old shit, minimalize the people who are moderitly vocal and make the really loud bitchers happy.<br />
<br />
Since we are content with our class they decide to fuck with it and then not even admit they nerfed us AGAIN, all damage control bullshit and they are making the really dense paladins and Sks who dont have a clue what is going on jump for joy, notice I didnt say all, just the retards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I dont think many knights were advocating fort/furious having that effect, nor probably do many think its fair. (espcially when coupled with dev/eva)<br />
<br />
keep on making assumptions to keep up the hate though it makes class balanancing forum more interesting to read.<br />
<br />
will try to find out more, but might not have update till monday or so cause of weekend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">All this fucking animosity is over nothing, you get aggro BEFORE using furious and the discipline works fine. <br />
<br />
<br />
I tanked Blazzax, Offossa, Reparm, Drurav, KTM, GTW, Seru, AoW could keep going, but 2 patch days in a row, have tanked all of water/earth/fire minus the gods, ssra and a few other zones/mobs I normally start the fights with furious and have no issues what so ever...<br />
<br />
<br />
In tipt, if you use Furious or Fortitude *BEFORE* you pull/have aggro, then jhiru will attack your group members and ignore you.   Use Bellow or Incite on pull, make sure you get one hit in, for any amount of damage - then use furious, and it'll work fine. If someone else gets aggro on pull, area taunt it back. Its not that big of a deal, if your healer was decent you wouldn't even need these invuln disc's on this mob... Just use evasive, get him slowed, and dont use CH's.<br />
<br />
<br />
and no, this isn't happening in ssra either, we cleared all minus emp and had no issues with furious or fortitude (we being my guild and I, + our ST and MT(me))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just use evasive, get him slowed, and dont use CH's.<br />
<br />
I haven't done Tipt since I beat it which was a long ass time ago but wasn't the nerf before on def/eva/stonewall?  And it's a DA type effect where they completely ignore you or it just lowers your aggro by some amount every tic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">caught a dev on at this hour..<br />
<br />
when they changed the AA to database, it was very similiar to how evasive works, so anyone with avoidance aa's, it would think has evasive, and would ignore.<br />
<br />
Said it was fixxed with the patch last night, if anyone has any problems with it as of 16th or later please post, thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shintarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">D's post pretty well sums it up. That is the first time i've done Tipt with two warriors in many times flagging people. Honestly due to the spam i dont see those messages, and did not see that one. but when i innitiated the pull, and jhiru came into camp. Attack was on, and i engaged combat with him, then clicked into furious. the moment i clicked furious he switched to Daemon, ripped him and turned back to me. after that it was just ridiing out furious and converting to evasive. in which he died like normal.<br />
<br />
 So, im thinking really if daemon had not engaged him till my furious had timed out, area taunted, engaged his furious, and took over from that point he would not have turned on anyone. But, nevertheless its still buggish and i dont think it should react in that manner.</div></div><hr />

we got three successive patch to correct many pb in less than a week, and still he seams to be in hollydays. So if Frodlin7th gets the unofficial war correspondant title then it can be just perfect imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly a nerf :P ALthough tipt is still completely doable, there is definitely a nerf that made some of the &quot;equal&quot; tanks more equal than the others. At least sony should have the guts to admit it (either it is a bug that wasn't fixed, or that it is a nerf.)<br />
<br />
Tamov</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jateki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I was helping a guildmate do tipt yesterday and the beastlord in my group mentioned this nerf so we tried him with no disc and 1 healer and got owned. Had the necro rez us up and tried again using furious and defensive and beat him. <br />
<br />
We used a basic named pull. Beastlord pulled him with dispell to get on rampage. I peeled with bellow then hit furious when he was on me. I did lose aggro for a second and the enchanter got owned but then he was back on me, this was after I hit defensive and I did use aet. The wizard I was helping pulled aggro for a sec and got owned as well but we ended up killing him with the 4 left alive and I thought it went well for only having one healer. I really wish I had my log turned on for that after reading this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">how the hell did you keep aggro with defensive up?  very high end taunting weapons and everyone else doing gimp damage?  I'd think from reports about how quickly people lose aggro that your slower would likely die before he got the mob slowed, your cleric would die from having to heal, etc.</div></div><hr />
