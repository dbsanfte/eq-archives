Friends that crossed over from EQ to WoW logging in less and less, my own WoW experience becoming a lil more boreing and not having the tolerance for some of the bug's in WoW like I used to.   I also can look at the TSW Board activity and see MUCH more frequent posts in the EQ section.    In the wow section, the frequency is typically measured in hour's.  In the EQ section it's EASILY measured in minutes(now granted this site is a traditional EQ warrior site and may not be as of yet with WoW ... but still).<br />
<br />
Anyone else getting a little uneasy about the state of the game?  I Know i'm a lil concerned to see friends that I know played EQ or other games for years losing interest allready, this soon in the game.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying WoW is in trouble allready or anything ... it's defenitely not losing folks as fast as EQ II .... just wondering if anyone else is noticing anything similiar to what I am seeing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really seems to me that the people pulling the strings wanted the game up and running before it was really ready.  That being said, I think they've done an outstanding job getting it up to speed.</div></div><hr />

If this is your rationale for the game sucking, you need to have your head examined.<br />
<br />
Maybe the silence is because PEOPLE ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME?<br />
<br />
Fuck, when I was playing EQ, there were a lot of times where I actually preferred spending time surfing TSW rather than playing EQ.  That is not the case with WoW.<br />
<br />
Plus this is an EQ board, wtf do you expect?  There's just a lot of us who are part of the community and aren't gonna leave just because we change games.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Read the whole thing man .. not just bit's and pieces.   I have friends that were LONG TIME DEDICATED players of these kinds of games that are losing interest soon after hitting 60 and it concerns me is all I said in my post and was wondering if anyone else is seeing this as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll second that.  Despite the fact I played a cleric and needed to pay attention, there was so much downtime and boring play involved in EQ that I preferred looking at messageboards and posting to playing sometimes (more and more as I got tired of the game).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't seriously expect WoW to have as much of an endgame as EQ, which has been around forever and has turned into nothing except a raid game?  I can argueably say that until PoP rolled around, EQ's end game sucked balls too.<br />
<br />
If they can be accused of anything at this point in time, it was making leveling a little bit too easy.  Now there is just going to be a wait until they get enough high end content to play around with.  Which is something I'm more than willing to wait for.<br />
<br />
Another thing I can &quot;possibly&quot; fault is it's pretty difficult to recruit/meet solid people in WoW outside of instances.  There is literally no need/desire to group outside of them in most cases.  But then I don't see anyway around that while making the game have decent soloability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see that Greysen.   But that's one thing that concerns me.  How many people will hang around waiting?  Enough to keep the game going strong?   If they take too long before releasing mroe end game content peopls won't hang around.  WoW don't have one luxury that EQ had going for it when it was first release ... EQ had the luxury of not having alot of competition for thier monthly fee.   WoW does, and it will have more in the future as Vanguard, D&amp;D Online etc etc come out not to mention competition from EQ and EQ II.  <br />
<br />
EQ ALSO souffered from very little competition as it grew and experienced all it's various growing pain's.   I really like the game and I just hope they can avoid some of the mistakes Verant / SoE made and keep the end game interesting.... so far with friends leaving soon after dinging 60...it concerns me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the raiding game issue, expectations have changed from when EQ went live to WoW went live.  You can't just get away with the 'this is new' excuse anymore.<br />
<br />
At any rate the only way Blizzard can really screw this up is if they continue doing nothing.  Anyone can tell the game isn't going to be any better if nothing is ever done about it.  At this point even a fake patch would help more than the silence, because at least it'd keep people's hopes up.  Now of course if they did that you'll have a ton of post like &quot;I lost faith in Blizzard blah blah&quot; but then 99% of the people who say that will still stick around anyway.  Heck, I never had any faith in Blizzard to begin with and I'm still playing WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well .. let me rephrase that ... lvl 60 friends are not necessarily LEAVING ... but they are not logging on and playing either .... reason is always the same .. no / boring endgame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the expectations of a huge raiding endgame, that would be the correct answer -if- you were making EQ.  Blizzard is clearly not trying to make an EQ remake, given by the gameplay and style.  Will it be ultimately successful?  Only time will tell.  I generally agree that the only way that they can go wrong at this point is to do nothing.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure Battlegrounds is the answer.  Many folks don't get excited about PVP and look for PVE activities instead.   The thrill of exploration is what binds alot of folks or the feeling of accomplishment that comes from advancement type things akin to PoP in EQ.  Right now WoW has very little to do for the lvl 60 that don't pop a chubby at the thought of PVP.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure about that.  PvP is a lot of fun and there are always nightly raids of people doing stuff.  What most people don't like is getting rampantly ganked while trying to xp or questing.  Battlegrounds give you a good option to butt heads with other players on even turf, without screwing over your regular gameplay.   This is why I'm not overly upset my guild landed on a &quot;regular&quot; server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think those level 60's should be pointing the finger at Blizzard at all.  It was their choice to pretty much play day-in/day-out and reach the max level.  That may be  because other MMO's rewarded that type of play.  WoW really isn't one of them.  Just look at the rest state for example.  You're rewarded for having a social life outside the game with faster leveling.  Even alts accrue rest state.  Personally, I think that if players are upset that there is no new content  for them, that's just their fault/perception.  One can always make an alt on the same side/server, switch faction sides and experience leveling up in their homelands.  As of yet noone has played every class up to 60 on both Alliance and Horde side.  If those that are bored refuse to leave their main char a seek out new experiences, whose fault is that?  Just my 2cp tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The argument about playing an alt or whatever is stupid.  Did you ever take every race/class combination to level 70 in EQ?  I'd assume the answer is no, so that means no one is ever qualified to say EQ is boring?<br />
<br />
If it's boring to get to level 60 once it's probably still boring to do it again.  WoWcensus puts at about 10% of the people at level 51+ range (assuming no one has more than 1 level 51+ character, and that each account averages 2 characters) so it's certainly not as small as people think it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still love WoW and I think a lot of people still love WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do feel very strongly that WoW, despite being a far superior game, will not have the staying power of EQ.  The reason for that is simple (imo, anyway):  EQ required grouping and WoW does not.  In EQ you had to interact with others, be social, get involved in the community.  In WoW you don't and for hte most part no one does.  People don't get to know strangers, they rarely (and never in my experience) stay to hang out with others past the end of the current quest....It is simply not a game that fosters community.  And, lets face it, community was the main reason most of stayed hooked on EQ for as long as we did.<br />
<br />
So, mostly for that reason my own personal opinion is that WoW will not last.  But for me, at least, the game has been a blast - mostly because I went into it with an automatic community of friends that I acftually made in EQ.  If all those people quit tomorrow, though, I'd probably play infrequently and end up quiting ... because I do not feel it is possible to grow the same relationships in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The time it takes to level a char to 60 in WoW seems completely tiny to the time it took to level one to 70 in EQ.  Also, faction side determines alot of the quests one can accept and complete, again unlike EQ.  I did have many 50+ chars in EQ.  I quit when GoD was released after I saw no change in the Sony mindset as far as gameplay.  WoW seems like a great bridge between tradition MMOs and Hack'n'Slash  Single Player RPGs.  Did you ever play Diablo 2x?  How many Patriarchs/Matriarchs did you have in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets get something staight here guys.  ALOT of folks that play these games do so EXPLICITLY for end game content.  Getting to the end game and working the &quot;cutting edge&quot; content is what they do / how they enjoy gaming.  It's why they work their ass off to get to the max level, get adequate gear.   From some of the responses I'm seeing, this is not being taken into consideration.  <br />
<br />
Is WoW meant to be a Social game with no end game push at all?  If so, then they should stop saying that WoW is casual enough for the casual player but has an end game for the hardcores out there.<br />
<br />
FYI, before the flamers start .. I'm not saying WoW is one way or the other ... or attempting to be both but hasn't had time yet.   I'm just saying IF it is the plan to be more of a casual game with little end game, then they need to say so and save alot of people alot of time.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd LOVE to see 1 huge progression based end game expansion for WoW simply so there is plenty to do for a while and plenty to look forward to...... alot of &quot;carrot's&quot; to use the term as I did above.   I don't think I'm alone in wanting this.  As far as other expansions, hey things along the lines of battlegrounds is fine IMO.  But atleast one very large progression based one would be pretty sweet IMO and help keep the hard core friends of mine busy for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder, of those people who are dinging 60 and then just not playing anymore, do they have the mindset of EQ where &quot;hit max level and then the real game begins&quot;.  Here's some things I've noticed...I may be wrong, but this is my take.<br />
<br />
WoW tends to encourage alts, I've noticed.  In EQ, if you played a different race...really, what was the difference?  If you played an evil class/race, was there any difference whatsoever in gameplay or what you did?  Maybe if you were a role-player, perhaps you acted different but you did the exact same stuff as a good class/race.  If you only stuck to one class in EQ...did you really miss out on anything other than the lore of the epic quests (which you could read on websites)?  It was only the playing of the class.  Race didn't matter starting with Luclin/PoP.<br />
<br />
In Wow, you can actually do different things by playing a different race.  Switching to a Horde race from an Alliance race can really change the game, or at least add a new perspective, as you're hitting a new area with new quests and completely different yet similar mindset (instead of the &quot;we're evil...rawr&quot; mindset of Freeport in EQ2...sorry, it was just hilarious, not immersive :p).  Sticking to only one race-class combination makes you miss out on a huge amount of stuff, unlike EQ did.  Later stuff may be similar, but even just Horde/Alliance has large differences in location and lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it's the fact I've played games like this for too long, but does anyone else wish that there would be games released that had a similar look and gameplay-style of MMOGs?  I mean it's not very hard to look at WoW and imagine a single-player/network-only-multiplayer version of the game being released later considering the ease of soloing.<br />
<br />
Part of me wishes that if WoW doesn't last, they retool it, add to it, and release it almost just as it is as a single player game so those of us who do have fun with the multitude of combinations and areas can still play.<br />
<br />
Oh, and that &quot;get to max level with best equipment so you can play the end-game stuff&quot; is the exact mindset that turned EQ into the majority raid-only game it ended up being that caused a huge amount of it's population to jump ship when better games came along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morf</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well .. let me rephrase that ... lvl 60 friends are not necessarily LEAVING ... but they are not logging on and playing either .... reason is always the same .. no / boring endgame.<br />
<br />
So they've completed every encounter in the game, including Onyxia, then repeated it until it was no longer challenging/fun?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn, guess bliz does need to get cranking on some new content if that's the case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deurgeran, your friends aren't playing anymore and you plan to do so untill bliz releases more end game content ?<br />
Super! I am very happy for that! it will decrease the server overpopulation.<br />
<br />
Vigdis said truth, but it will just decrease a bit the population and gives us a new way to play a MMORPG, a way that let us have a RL or let us sleep more than four hours a day. Last year I would have support Bliz no matter what, but since Bliz lost most of its blood and has been ganked by VU I won't give a s*** if WoW chrashes as fast as it started cause of a lack of content/interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you leveled up one character to 60 you've seen it all.  Sure you have to kill 10 Scarlet something when you're in Forsaken territory as opposed to 10 Defias something in human territory but it's still the same old hat.  If you didn't notice every race's starting area has the same kind of quests duplicated.  E.g. there's always one that takes you to the first inn.  There is always one that goes from your capital city to the nearest gryphon/wind rider/whatever point.  <br />
<br />
You can probably do a search and replace a few key words and that'll get you 95% of all the quests on the other side.  The only real difference between the races/factions is your starting zone.<br />
<br />
As for the complaint about ending game, it is a pretty well known fact that raids don't exactly work the way they're supposed to which would explain why people who are raiding are not exactly finding this interesting.<br />
<br />
And really even if the content existed if people don't enjoy it, it might as well not exist.  For example there are something like 5 guilds maybe that have actually killed Tunat Muram in EQ and he's been in the game for a long time, and I heard the encounter is actually pretty good too.  But it doesn't really matter, content people that are not interested in is the same as content that doesn't exist, and currently WoW endgame aren't interesting due to bugs and itemization issues.</div></div><hr />

If you honestly expected the kind of end game PvE experience you can get from today's EQ out of the Blizzard crew, with the amount of noobie problems they have had thus far, you have GOT to pass some of what you are smokeing my way.  I gotta try it.<br />
<br />
Some how, I dunno why, but some how I got a feeling that everyone who cancled their account cause they are &quot;done&quot; with the content will fire that bad boy right back up when new content is release.  Call me crazy.</div></div><hr />

That's assuming they released some new content in a reasonable frame of time.<br />
<br />
Gamers don't take much to satisfy but anyone can tell no patch = nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the definition of &quot;reasonable frame of time&quot; varies greatly and widely =)<br />
<br />
Remember, MMO's move at the speed of business.  A slower creature there never was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing EQ has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt is that it is not possible for a MMORG design team to pump out quality content at a pace that keeps the &quot;hardcore&quot; raiding set satisfied.  They can either pump out the content quickly and have it be buggy and in some cases out right crap, or they can take some time, produce some quality, and minimize the bugs.  In other words you can have it good or you can have it fast, but you can't have it good and fast.<br />
<br />
Also EQ has shown us that if a MMORG company begins to pander to the &quot;hardcore&quot; player base too exclusively, they generate a great deal of discontent in the less &quot;hardcore&quot; player base.  Can Blizzard find a middle ground?  Perhaps, but in my opinion they're better off in the long term leaning more towards the take it a bit slower but produce better content that keeps a broader cross section of the player base happy than in leaning in the other direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slow but quality is a myth, especially in Blizzard's world.  Just see Diablo 2 1.10 where there's something like a total of 2 noticeable changes before and after the 8 month or whatever 'beta' period it went through.<br />
<br />
3 months without a patch is worse than 3 months with a patch, even if the patched content is trivial.  MMORPG players are extremely forgiving of bad patches, but on the other hand even the most generous of players aren't very forgiving on silence.  How are you supposed to look forward to improvements when there are none?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taking it slower does not equal not producing any changes at all.  If in fact Blizzard maintains a policy of implimenting patches only very rarely, then yeah there may be reason for concern.  I'm not sure we can say for certain that will be the case yet.  They have been working on a lot off small to medium size issues over the last several months and seem to have been making at least some progress.  Holding off on new content in the mean time seems reasonable.  But once those fixes are in place and the environment is stable, that had better change, I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm level 48 in WoW, and have quite a ways to go before experiencing the end game content.  A lot of my friends are around the same level.  We all are enjoying the game still, and likely by the time we're at the end game there will be more content available.  I have a few friends who are level 60, some are bored, some are just scary addicts.   :) <br />
<br />
WoW is geared towards the casual and semi-casual player.  I play every day, but typically only a couple hours every day.  It is not so much geared to the hardcore gaming addict who only logs off to sleep when it is absolutely necessary to do so.  Those types of players are going to get bored, hell many of them got bored with EQ which has years of content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't see how WoW needs to be 'fixed' for the casual player beyond your usual my class is not as good as your class complaints.  It's probably not balanced but it doesn't have to be.  Although the game places no value on grouping and quest grinding gets boring after about level 10, it's at worst the same level of boredom as say someone who soloed 1-60 in EQ and in reality it's probably as boring as someone leveling from 1-60 in a group (which isn't too exciting, but obviously not boring enough to make people quit).  So I'm not sure what they need to fix on the lower end aside from stability issues but that is almost certainly not the job of the content designers anyway.</div></div><hr />

We all know how well lotsa changes all at once dont work out all that great either.  They've also made the battlegrounds their #1 priority for their next content patch.  That alone address a BIG ol chunk of the subscribers, who are seeing this style of game somewhat for the first time.   If they stick to what they've layed out as their plan for future zones then there will be more to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beyond that, PvE servers just got boring.  There was nothing to do if you weren't doing instances, so naturally it just came to me wanting to get some sport for killing other people.  The players are always going to provide more challenge than the AI.  So far I'm pretty happy.  You end up getting ganked occasionally by skull con jackasses, but you just take that in stride and beat the people down who pick fights with ya.  It's all good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Damn, guess bliz does need to get cranking on some new content if that's the case<br />
<br />
The problem is that Onyxia and Molten Core are only available to a miniscule fraction of players. For most people that are not in a well-organised hardcore guild, they are simply not an option. It gets worse though - while most EQ players probably have formed groups for instances and can get a lot of mileage out of BRD, BRS, Strat, Scholo and the like, there's actually a lot of people that made 60 through soloing, don't know many people and have a lot of trouble forming a group to do anything. <br />
<br />
It's these people that are going to be the problem - what are their options other than start a twink or farm for rare drops ?</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure Battlegrounds has PvE content which becomes unlocked and doable by the victors in the 2hrs or so you control the Batlleground zones. Hence, there is a very real incentive, beyond the usual rewards for pvp, to get involved.<br />
<br />
I am playing pvp in a mmorpg for the first time, and having a blast. The implementation pvp has been handled really well - world defence channels actually mean something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Played a lot of PvE EQ since kunark, always wanted to start a char on PvP but didn't cause those servers were hell holes. Started WoW in december on a PvP server, it has been a blast. No griefing, no corpse camping (unless you're stupid). After grinding to lvl 70 in EQ I wanted something different, and it works. If I were playing WoW on a PvE server I would be thinking of leaving too cause its the same ol grind. Kill tons of bosses gather loot all the time, burn months after months, so your clerics can do a 3 sec CH rotation instead of 2 sec, what an achievement. When you're PvP your gear makes a difference all the time. And you can role play, like it or not. I think we can safely say that WoW is meant as PvP, and it's -not- the PvP you know from EQ. That is the problem with the people losing interest imo.<br />
<br />
Will Blizzard be able to keep the high enders entertained? Time will tell. For now I have 6 more levels to 60. Then I'll level up my baby rogue and it will be fun fun.</div></div><hr />

The overwhelming majority of quests work, the areas are fleshed out and (mostly) itemized well. The problems with the endgame start with itemization from 50+, and with faction being quite useless vs the amount of work they take. <br />
<br />
Most lvl 60 players would be content with the delays in the content patch IF they actually had a couple of people take 2 weeks and re-do itemization in Scholomance/Stratholme and everything past that. It cant be hard to do if the developers had any idea on how to make interesting gear, though so far they have proven only that this isnt the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnarled</div><div class="date">03-09-2005, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The argument about playing an alt or whatever is stupid.  Did you ever take every race/class combination to level 70 in EQ?  I'd assume the answer is no, so that means no one is ever qualified to say EQ is boring?<br />
<br />
If it's boring to get to level 60 once it's probably still boring to do it again.  WoWcensus puts at about 10% of the people at level 51+ range (assuming no one has more than 1 level 51+ character, and that each account averages 2 characters) so it's certainly not as small as people think it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong, or probably wrong...I know i had 5 level 70 characters in EQ and I am sure others had more...wasnt that hard to do, and believe me...EQ was boring...even raiding had gotten boring...<br />
<br />
<br />
I am liking WoW...am not rushing to 60...main toon is currently only lvl56...but I have one toon of each class....half alliance/half horde and I generally rotate between them to try other quests/gameplay...<br />
<br />
Face it, we knew going in that there wasnt going to be a lot of endgame content yet...so I do not in the least feel sorry for people that felt the need to rush to 60...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furyobill</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the biggest issue in WoW today is that therse not enough GROUP REQUIRED instance style encounters per lvl range.  If your lucky thers 2 good places u can group at any given level and as these get boring ppl turn to soloing.  This to me is so not an option ive done places like Deadmines Gnomeregon Scarlett monastary over and over and over just cause they are far supperior in loot xp and the most important part, fun.  I think if Blizzard added more fun encounters outside of instances and perhaps a few more instances alot more ppl would be happy and not rush through the game so fast that the Devs cant keep up with new content.  That is not a huge %age of ppl would be 60 atm with nothin to do.<br />
<br />
I also do agree that Blizz better get crackin on some new 55+ raid dungeons or in a few months the game will surely be dead as more folks reach 60 and realize how boring a game without an end game is.  I ONLY play MMOs to raid and to challenge myself through tough end game progression, as im not through it all yet im happy but it wont be more than a month till im 60 and i intend to keep that pace as i go through the &quot;end&quot; game zones such and will not be terribly longer b4 i can give Onyxia and MC a shot.  <br />
<br />
I do however think that once Battlegrounds are done the end game content should come faster as this and the server issues seem to be sucking up all the development resources at Blizzards disposal.  Blizzard has one of the coolest games ive ever played and if they could only get MORE of it released id be sooooo here for years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cotred</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well.. the only thing i could say is..  blizzard didnt expected wow would be so big...<br />
<br />
too big for what they thought about the services they would need to provide with server structure, game support and massive number of players..  <br />
<br />
we literally outnumbered  blizzard´s  goals..  and now they are running around the clock 24/7 ..          <br />
<br />
the game is great... too great that attracted too many vicious players that we would need  battlegrounds, char transfer options, and the 2 new raid mobs at RELEASE version, as well all the class balances needed... and least but not last: betters servers..<br />
<br />
and since the players numbers still growing it will take some time until they could reach a good overall comunity management for the game.<br />
<br />
who agree me ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guili99</div><div class="date">03-18-2005, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure this is still in subject, but after 2 years of EQ1 and 1 week of Wow, here's my feeling:<br />
<br />
- In EQ1, I played a non-caster (lvl56 rogue with Epic in the end) and to sum up things, it was a pain all in all.<br />
Although I loved the idea of playing a rogue (was poison master too... expensive as hell and completely useless, but fun), the reality was painful both in early and late game: early game, you spend your time waiting for your HP to get back to normal between EACH FIGHT. In the late game, I used to spend like 3 or 4 hours waiting to group, as rogues ended up being the persona-non-grata (sort of) class there.<br />
My guild being small, I finally quit because playing meant waiting more than anything else.<br />
<br />
- In WoW, I sticked to the non-caster stuff and am playing a dwarf warrior. I never NEVER had so much fun with my EQ rogue so far (ok, might be because I'm new but hey, much of Wow stuff are exactly like EQ if you ask me).<br />
The playability is excellent but most of all: the FUN is there all along. Sitting waiting to get your HP back is no longer a bore, as 1) you don't wait long and 2) you have easy ways of getting back HP in early game, even without a priest to heal you. Bacsically, even in solo you chain-kill easily which was something impossible in EQ.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;the warrior being crap-class etc etc&quot; I think not. I'm grouping with ppl my level and I have the feeling of being really efficient.<br />
Besides, skills and talents in Wow are THE good idea and make warriors much fun to play imho.<br />
<br />
To sum up (early game comparision only so far): 3 hours of EQ=30mn of Wow and that only is a major improvement, as you can avoid spending all your RL time playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW seems like a great bridge between tradition MMOs and Hack'n'Slash  Single Player RPGs.  Did you ever play Diablo 2x?  How many Patriarchs/Matriarchs did you have in it?<br />
<br />
Sorry to bump an older thread.<br />
<br />
I do agree that WoW is kind of a bridge between traditional MMO's and games similar to Diablo 2, but for me, Diablo 2 became boring when LoD was released because LoD made the game far too easy.  In patch 1.06, it was extremely hard to level because the only way to effectively boost your experience at 88+ was to run Hell CS+Diablo.  I did a lot of team CS+D runs when levelling with my friends, the end result was garnering #1 amazon, #1 sorc and #1 paladin realmwide on the ladder (hardcore).  <br />
<br />
When LoD was released and the ladder wiped, I saw people at 99 within a day or two.  It didn't require teamwork, you could solo your way on Baal runs.  It was disappointing and boring.<br />
<br />
I really do think the point about community within a game is very well made.  The problem is striking a balance between being able to progress with a small number of people, and requiring too many people.  Right now, I feel EQ requires too many people.  Ideally the raids should give a choice -- one type should be balanced around a quantity of 30-35 people, the other should remain at 54 cap.  Yeah, yeah, this would take some time to implement, but it would allow smaller guilds to progress.  They did pretty well with DoN which allows solo/duo quests with some group quests involved to round it out.<br />
<br />
Getting to 46 in EQ was a huge accomplishment that took me several months of steady playing (back in mid velious), but I'm currently 46 in WoW and it took much less than several months.  I think that Blizzard is leaning too far into the Diablo 2 LoD side and not enough into making levelling supported within a community.  While I feel you should have the option to solo your way to 60, I wish there were more opportunities to get to know the server.  Then again, I am the kind of nutjob who enjoys playing underdog classes (lvl 50 nightshade - Mordred represent), so take this with a grain of salt I guess.  Levelling on WoW doesnt have the pizzazz I wanted, though.  I'm hoping once PvP is refined and new dungeons are released, the endgame will start to look more rosy, but for now I prefer EQ over WoW.</div></div><hr />
