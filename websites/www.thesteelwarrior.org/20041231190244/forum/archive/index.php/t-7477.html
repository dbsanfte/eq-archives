<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasek</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a berserker, and have been suprised by their low DPS output.  Since berserkers are pretty much a clone of warior weapon abilites, and AA (other than the cool tanking ones) I figured this was the best place to post.  Anyway, Im new to melee classes, having played a cleric for the past 4 years. My berserker is fairly well equiped for an unguilded twink, his magelo is Here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=976005). Following a DPS parse average in HoH, on the 2 entrance spawns, over the course of 100 spawns, i average 92 DPS. This was without haste, and without any attack buffs, using a Goldenrod as my weapon, with 252 weapon skill.<br />
<br />
I am without any of the 2hander AA abilites. Does anyone know the expected DPS increase from each of the AA abilities for 2handers? What can be expected from Fero, Punishing Blade, and Frenzy?<br />
<br />
Im rather disapointed at being a so called damage class that parses less than a kunark rogue. Are these AA's going to get me anywhere close to being useful?<br />
<br />
EDIT: He has 41% worn Haste ~ just as another factor. Also, my parse did no incluse proc damage, just straight melee.<br />
Thanks ~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That DPS is about what I would expect for a warrior with that weapon, with no spell haste and no offensive AA's.  With maximum haste and AA's, I am guessing you would probably see about 130 DPS, maybe more with overhaste.  There is nothing wrong with that DPS number, given the quality of your weapon (your BBB will be similar).  Rogues are in a completely different league from classes who use 2 handers, and you should not compare yourself to them.  Eventually, once your berserker has PoTime+ weapons and gear, you will exceed 200 DPS in ideal circumstances, but equivalent rogues will be pushing 400 DPS.</div></div><hr />

I use a Blade of Carnage, and for the most part a Chord Hilted Spike Driver between swapping my offhand for Avatar procs. I have no offensive AA's and have atleast 71% haste all the time. (41% from item and 30% from my ornate gloves.) Usually chanter hasted though.<br />
<br />
I too could probably hit your numbers with your weapon. Seems like sort of a raw deal being considered a DPS class.</div></div><hr />

I think he was more looking for average DPS, not burst for his class/level of play to see if what appeared to be true in fact was.</div></div><hr />

That seems kinda lame. Berserkers are on the knight hp table, but i think that hoping to attain the same kind of hp that knights are these days is a little far fetched. Seems to me like, while close, chain items generally have less hp than plate. Mitigation, at 8 % better than rangers, is....ok i guess. i can spot tank in situations where its needed. BUT THATS NOT WHAT THE CLASS IS FOR. <br />
<br />
Described as a damage class, cloning warior AA's seems a bit....interesting. Wouldnt you think that....maybe....youd clone.....a .....damage classes AA's? Anyway, bullshit asside, there seem to be some GoD weapons that are particularly good and zerker only. looking forward to snagging one and not being a total waste of a group slot.<br />
<br />
Appreciate the info on the 2hander AAs =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think people will agree that the Berserker AA list is atrocious (almost as bad as the Beastlord AA list started out).  I am sure that the GoBerserker community is advocating the addition of more appropriate DPS AA's for their class.  Warriors have a long road of offensive AA's which gradually raise their DPS from terrible to medium.  There is no reason why berserkers should not have a longer/better list of AA's so that they can end up in the right place.</div></div><hr />
