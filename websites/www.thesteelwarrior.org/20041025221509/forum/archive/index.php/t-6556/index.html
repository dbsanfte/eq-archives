<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is something very strange with taunt in phase 3 of time. I have the same problems everytime im in phase 3 taunt hardly ever works. Im not being dilusional either its like I get 1 successful taunt in 15 taunts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Taunt is more successful the higher you are on the aggro list (I'm pretty sure, at least...)  So if you're trying to taunt a mob when you dont have aggro, and your DPS/debuffers continue to rack up the hate at a rate faster than your normal melee/ppm/incite, then your chance of getting a successful taunt is pretty low (inversely proportional to the amount of time the mob has been engaged).<br />
<br />
Maybe due to the time limit your raid is going all-out to the point where the only way to get and maintain aggro would be AETaunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Daabu if you on top of agro list taunt does nothing<br />
I am certain that taunt has not a thing to do with your position on the list prior to taunt.<br />
<br />
Here is the proof. I can come up to non kos mob who someone killing taunt it and it will agro me instatntly if taunt suceeds.<br />
<br />
My question is did they remove taunt cap for level 65 warriors? I forget. I remember a while back no one could taunt mobs that are a few levels above them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Taunt success has nothing to do with your relative position on the hate list.  I'm not familiar with phase 3 time, but if these mobs are red-cons I wouldn't be suprised at all that taunt sucks on them.  Decorin Lieutenants in Tactics (level 68) feel like 1/10 taunt success rate half the time as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm convinced that taunt has a lower success rate in p3 than anywhere else.   I think I'm gonna have to parse to prove it though.    I've not seen any other area with a lower success rate on taunt by &quot;eyeballing&quot; than p3, although it DOES work, it seems to be successful FAR less often than anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Red con mobs are always hard to taunt.  Phase 3 just gets noticed since it has a high concentration of red cons that are actually tauntable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
p3 taunts start to finish (boss taunts not included):<br />
<br />
fail = 74<br />
success = 27<br />
<br />
this is pretty much consistent with the fact that nearly everything is yellow/red con. anyone feel like mashing the taunt button on every single trash mob in p3, and noting what is red/yellow/even cons, go right ahead...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It worked for me 4 or 5 times that I could notice. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Use knights to tank P3,this gives you an hour to relax and watch tv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We use knights to tank P3 as well.    You guys have to remember also that you are on a timer and your raid force is overnuking the crap out of stuff.    For a warrior to even attempt to tank P3 would mean you have to sit there and completly mash your taunt button over and over again.    In P3, your knights can call assist before they even are on the mob.   There is no need for a warrior to try and build agro here and call assist.   There is too much going on and brute force is the best way to destroy this phase.    Just kick back on this phase and let the knights have fun for 1phase out of 5.<br />

<br />
Incidently - 330 taunts?? WTF are you taunting at all. Knights are by far the better choice for MTing phase 3. There's not nearly enough time to complete phase 3 to dick around with a warrior trying to keep agro. Knights shine here, let them have a little fun too.</div></div><hr />

How about because my Guild leader is a Paladin, and including him and the raid leader (paladin # 2) if we have 4 knights at phase 3 its a rarity. So when he assigns us to MT, we do..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">SOE went to a new expansion and all I got were some lousy HP'sLOL<br />
<br />
Any way ... I am suprised that you GL being a pally would assign a warrior to do a job that he would be way better at. Sounds like you have 2 pallies there for sure, it only takes 1 to MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I posted a log here like 6 months ago that showed something like 60 failed tuants in a row in Time Tier3.  It works, but only about 10-20% of the time at most.</div></div><hr />
