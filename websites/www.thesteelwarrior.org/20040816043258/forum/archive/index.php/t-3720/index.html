<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is just my opinion, and maybe i can be convined otherwise... (hopefully without flames)<br />
<br />
agro management paly and SK vs warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this something we can really expect to get fixed?  Hopefully i won't take too much damage for this one but here is my story and rational.<br />
<br />
I do not participate in raids ... definatly not high end raids.  I belong to a small guild and much of the time i am duoing with a shammy.(my GF's) Last night i duel boxed them. I was in PoN and just killing yard trash (both chars are moderately equip'd, no super gear)  I have her hot keys set up to root, then when rooted i slow the mob.  I sick the pet in on the root, and ultimatly i hit the epic dot on her spear. All the time i am wacking away and kicking the mob (one taunt off the bat using a WMBS)  <br />
<br />
This method was working just fine.  Til i got trained by a stalker while i am on a raven.  Me and pet are on raven at about 20% when the stalker joins on the fight.  So i root the stalker and slow him.  Did not touch him with the warrior yet.   Pet switches to the stalker (i assume he got proximity agro because of the root)  I may have epic dotted the mob, honestly not sure.  well, root  breaks with about 3% left on the raven, now the stalker is on the shaman, i finish killing the raven and turn to the stalker, i attack and taunt/kick and disarm ONCE and the stalker turned to me, THEN i rooted and healed the warrior.  <br />
<br />
To me this seems to be accurate.  I had SLOW agro and root agro, plus any agro the pet would generate for the shaman and the mob turned off the shaman to the warrior...  True had i wanted i could have gotten the agro back to the shaman but that means i have to play smart (if i were actually playing just the shaman)  <br />
<br />
I ask now what is the problem with the agro lock/tanking ability.  I agree that something needs to be done to something, and i know the whole NERFING of anytihng sux... but my opinion would be that if you can get an &quot;snap agro lock&quot; chances are, you shouln't want it... i am pretty sure any chanter or shammy can gain an agro lock if they wanted, of course they would be dead shortly there after.  but it seems to me you should have one or the other, the ability to get snap agro lock or the ability to live through a longer fight.  But to have BOTH seems a bit overpowering.  It is of my opinion that the players should have to work together to kill a mob, and this is what i would imagine should be the case... wariors can take a beating, but have a little trouble getting agro... ok this means the shaman has to space out malo and slow, the nukers can't just nuke the snot out of the mob... monks must use FD to control agro, rogues must evade etc.... <br />
<br />
on the flip side, if a char can get snap agro lock... then the rest of the group should have to work their butts (and mana pools) off to make sure that person stays alive... shaman must malo/slow/dot for the dps cleric should have to CH alot (at least more) to keep them alive, and the nukers better nuke the mob to oblivian because that person with snap agro , tho they can keep the mob off you, they are gonna die unless you kill the mob quick..... as in the cleric gonna go oom if you dont' kill it quick and the whole group gonna need to med a little before the next fight.  <br />
<br />
again, i am not a POWER player, i am a casual player, been playing since 99, and played a few classes, highest is my warrior and i do enjoy him... i also hate getting passed up for a paly or SK because of agro lock and snap agro(sorry , i dont' mean to point fingers, but hey we all know what i am talking about anyway)    I do think there should be a trade off, you can either A) take massive damage ,  your group can have mana at the end of the fight, BUT the fight is gonna take a little longer and you have to play smart to control agro, -OR- B) you can gain snap agro lock BUT you cannot take the damage as well, so your healers/slowers need to blow a bit of mana and your support/dd need to go hard and heavy to kill the mob before it kills you, which they can do since you have agro lock.  <br />
<br />
This is just an opinion formed from reading these boards and my own exp.. limited as they are.  I do not advocate &quot;nerfing&quot; i just believe the game should have some challenges... and if youcan get snap agro lock and can take a whooping too... well then that kindof gives the other classes the ability to let loose, and maybe not think as much about what they are doing, or manageing agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya that one situation worked real good for  you , gratz. Imagine now that the same situation exactly happened , but this time you taunt and the mob stays on shaman , you keep whacking taunt again , still on shaman , keep whackin kicking taunting but it wont turn from the shaman , eventually shaman dies , then warrior dies .<br />
<br />
 Taunt is not guarenteed , your at the mercy of the Random Number Generator , sure you got lucky that time and taunted it , but it could just as easily have happened the way i described instead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Let me start by saying that things you can do double boxing really aren't representative of the rest of the game.  Knowing exactly what both characters are going to do and when goes a long way towards making the situation more controlled.  All the same:<br />
<br />
i just believe the game should have some challenges... and if youcan get snap agro lock and can take a whooping too... well then that kindof gives the other classes the ability to let loose, and maybe not think as much about what they are doing, or manageing agro.<br />
<br />
This is not an unusual perspective.  And I won't even tell you you're wrong, but consider the following.  Currently 2 out of 3 tanks have a fairly significant aggro lock early in an encounter.  The 3rd does not.  Does it make sense that 2 should have such an advantage over the third barring a counter balancing advantage of equal significance?  I think we would probably agree it doesn't.  And that counter balancing advantage argueably doesn't exist for the majority of experience group scenarios, at least not to a sufficient degree.<br />
<br />
So we can either reduce the two high aggro tanks aggro generation to a lower level, which seems to be your inclination, or increase the third's to something closer to the other two's.  Now, SoE has recently finished up with a pretty major caster balance program, correct?  And in this they granted the casters a great deal more ability to utilize their mana for longer periods and with greater impact.  If they proceed to reduce the aggro generation of tanks to the same low (read Warrior like) level, what do the casters do with all this new ability they've been given?  They can't use it to maximum effectiveness, given the reduced aggro control. So they get frustrated knowing that their character is being systematically gimped whenever it groups with one of the plate tanks.<br />
<br />
Does this sound like a scenario whereby tanks in general will get more groups?  Or does this sound like a scenario where casters will find ways to utilize their fullest potential without the involvement of plate tanks at all?  Me, knowing how ingenious the human mind can be when it want's to be, expect the latter scenario to be more likely than the former.  Casters won't just hold back more with all plate tanks and learn aggro control.  Instead they'll find ways to bypass the need for tanks altogether.<br />
<br />
And we'll be able to welcome all plate tanks to the LFG queue at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">to both your points <br />
<br />
one yes i am at the mercy of the RNG i also happened to not be using procs.... so yes... i got lucky.. that the first taunt worked. <br />
<br />
and as for the second, i am not saying the SK and PALY should have less ability to hold agro, just that if they do, they gonna get a butt wooping more then the warrior (where as a warrior who cannot hold agro as well, can sit there and get beat on longer) <br />
<br />
going in the direction of: ok, slightly slower yet steady killing for a group with a war MT and quicker kililng with some medding down time for the sk/paly group... <br />
<br />
thanks for the reponses btw, i appreciate the input, i very much see your points and i do agree, i didn't do any extended testing or analysis, it was just an observation.  (in a very limited Scenario)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is safe to say that absolutely EVERYONE agrees that the ability to generate aggro as a knight far exceeds that of the war.  Here is where the arguments start...knights have closed the gap on the pure tanking ability (in terms of hp/ac/mitigation - excluding &quot;defensive&quot;) to such a point that the Warrior is the last alternative in most cases for the &quot;tank&quot; role in a group.<br />
<br />
Some warriors want more hp/ac/mitigation so that the gap between them and knights parallels the &quot;aggro generation&quot; gap that exists.<br />
<br />
Some warriors want more aggro so that the gap between them and knights parallels the &quot;ability to tank well&quot; gap.<br />
<br />
Some warriors feel that doing either of the above will unbalance the end game encounters and, therefore, a nerf is necessary to bring the two in line.<br />
<br />
Some warriors just want some newer cool shit in terms of skills and innate abilities to play with to make them again a unique class capable of a distinctive role besides the end encounter defensive MT.<br />
<br />
FYI, knights, my guild, e.g., has five warriors.  I don't get to be the bad ass defensive MT on raid end encounters.  I don't get to be the first choice for meztanking (you guys do), I am not asked for Brells (you guys are),  I am not the one groups are formed around to counter AE with group heals (you guys are)....so....umm, what exactly is my role again?  Besides making sure my troll ass is shrunk so the rogues don't have to jump around me to get to the ass end of the encounter and do their job?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i agree buon, <br />
<br />
i tend to think the nerf option tho i hate to say it may be the best solution, tho pissing off the entire Paly / SK comunity is doubtfully going to be the way it goes.... again i am not in the end game so maybe it is totally impossible to have this be &quot;truley balanced&quot; .<br />
<br />
maybe i am wrong but the majority of the warriors on this board (who post) seem to be very high end.  I am just bringing the middle of the road opinion(mine anyway)  I greatly appreciate the wisdom from you guys and your exp.  <br />
<br />
this board continues to be a great source of opinions and information and no matter what ends up being the solution (if in fact one occurs) it is great that i can come here and post questions and such and get great, incredibly fast responces. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The problem with your assessment zrod is that the pally and sk currently don't get a significantly worse &quot;butt wooping&quot; than the warrior, but still have the aggro lock.  If you want to let them keep their aggro ability, and keep the warrior where he is now (a mistake in my opinion), the only way to balance the issue is to lower the AC/HP/mitigation/avoidance of the sk and pally, making them once again the paper tanks they were in the Kunark era.  This won't work either because it would anger way too much of the player base, and totally screw up the knights role as raid offtank.  Given that they own the XP group tank role right now, and that such a change certainly wouldnt make a knight any more useless on a raid than all the extra warriors are this might not be a compelling argument for some people (particularly for some of the more frustrated warriors), but it's true nevertheless.  Personally, I'm of the opinion that the game has progressed but the melees have not, and all pure melees need a boost.  Leave knights alone, I like to have strong allies standing next to me in a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Obeareaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have both.  Obeareaun is the Warrior and Thaeorin is my Paladin.  Both are experienced enough to be in the high level game.  They have similar (Class allowing) equipment.  <br />
<br />
My wife and I were discussing the different ways she has to play (she is an upper level DRU and CLE) depending on which is tanking.  It is easier to take aggro from Obeareaun, especially in the event that the caster begins casting before the MoB has been dropped to about 85% health.  The caster needs to also be aware of raid rulings concerning maximum distance, sitting, etc.<br />
<br />
I do agree from playing BOTH classes that Beornegar is correct.  The casting classes have made significant strides in improving their abilities while the tanks have not.  I would say this is correct partially.  The Paladin has gotten significant upgrades from when Thaeorin was started in October of 1999.  The Warrior however has not.  I do not see Warrior improvements really starting until we get our AAs going.  The number of stuns for the Paladin has increased and also the amount of hate put off by those stuns.<br />
<br />
What is the answer?  Well the answer becomes very difficult.  While the Warrior has grown tremendously in his ability to get beaten on, the Paladin has not (talkin hp here and AC).  The Paladin at the same level with similar gear can have up to 500 to 1000 or more hp difference.  Armor class follows similar lines.  The Warrior on the other hand has a much harder time attaining and KEEPING aggro.  I think SoE has been trying to work on this some with the number of weapons they have been putting out there that have increased Hate effects such as stuns, Anger, etc.  That I feel is not a good solution in total.  It is my firm opinion that, from playing both classes, that the only thing needed to really balance Melee and put them in their proper roles is to increase the taunt ability of the WAR.  The Paladin, although less hitpoints in many cases, is the defensive tank.  They should be the secondary tank in most situations (I think Undead would be the sole difference).  The Warrior is a class designed to be able to take damage and run at the forefront of the armies.  They should be able to keep the aggro better and manage it.  The question is not whether or not to balance the melee... they are fine... EXCEPT the Warrior who has been slowly taken from his element.</div></div><hr />

The shaman pet was Taunted actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thanks for that assessment obeareaun, cool to hear from someone with exp with both classes.  <br />
<br />
and thank you  Beornegar  for your explanation i was never overly sure on what the plight of the Sk was in the Kunark era (tho i have heard referance to it quite often) ( did this also apply to paly's? or was it pretty much just the SK?)<br />
<br />
i definatly have a clearer image of the problem, unfortunatly the solution is not quite as clear :( <br />
<br />
thanks for the great input</div></div><hr />
