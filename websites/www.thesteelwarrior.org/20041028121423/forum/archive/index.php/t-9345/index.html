<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zelman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks, I am finally able to get back to playing my warrior (guild has needed my shaman) and I am wondering what I should look at picking up to get myself propperly geared. I would like to hit arround 8k hps with solid AC and a decent weapon or weaponset. I raid about 8 hours a week, have about 12 hours to do whatever else.<br />
<br />
My guild is semi-casual; we are just now getting to Elementasl, we raid about 3 times a week, mostly elemental mini's and some ring events, and we are on a dkp system. Once I finish my GoD flags I will also be raiding some higher end GoD content with the public force here, and I can probably snag an item or two. (Not sure which encounters, but most of their tanks each have a piece or more of murmite armor now)<br />
<br />
I'm not a big LDON fan, but I know I need to at least get some anger3 augs, I can probably get a BoW in the next month or 2 from RZ backflagging. Basically I am looking for some good ideas on how to hit my goals, or some links that I missed when searching, thanks a bunch!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>daw4888</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Elemental warrior armor is nice for hp and AC... i would look into picking some of it up... with a full set u will break  your 8k mark, and have around 1900 ac or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, since you're just getting into the elementals, that opens up a lot of possibilities as far as gear goes.<br />
<br />
Consider this your relatively long term elemental goal, but of course things are going to change.  This is, in fact, exactly the path I would take if I were to start the elementals directly at this point (without any VT access).  Keep in mind, the loot list here seems a bit overwhelming.  However, consider it your long term goal, as in like six months.  Your guild will change dramatically in power now that you're in the elementals, so while this fake magelo may seem a bit over the top, given time it won't be.  <br />

The magelo is designed with all the warrior HP AAs in mind.  I noticed you only have about 100 AAs, but now that you're in the elementals, those AA #'s will skyrocket.  You can churn out massive amounts of AAs in the elementals in very little time.  It's one of the great rewards for getting there.  If you won't have them now, you will eventually.<br />
<br />
Secondly, none of the stuff is augged.  You mentioned you'd probably won't do any more Ldon than deemed necessary outside your Anger3 aug.  Heck, I'm not gonna blame ya.  =P  I would recommend filling up all the five possible 10ac augs slots that you can being how much harder elementals minis hit in comparison to what you're probably previously used to.  Now that most people spend most of their time in OoW now, KT is barren, at least on my server.  Get KT access and farm it up.  Named pop like crazy, and with only 10 people max in the zone, you'll never have a shortage of mobs to pull.  But, heh, augs are augs.  You're going to have a wide selection, especially with the new ones out of OoW, to choose from, so I'll let you pick accordingly.<br />
<br />
Lastly, work on Ikkinz (Ikkinz1 is open to you once you achieve KT).  Ikkinz is going to be extremely hard, but my-oh-my is the work incredibly rewarding.  The Glyphed Prayer Ring, Resonating Earring of Battle, Carved Vrex Totem, and Crafted Wristband of Strife are ALL one groupable obtainable items that come out of Ikkinz.  You're gonna have to put some effort into it of course, but trust me, it's WELL worth the hard work.  The new OoW AAs will make getting by Diabolic Destroyer much easier.  Just remember to keep the healer outside the room. ;)</div></div><hr />
