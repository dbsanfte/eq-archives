<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, I didn't know he ran.  I would never have figured him for a runner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that is awesome...hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If he was running, he would have died shortly anyway.  It's still one of the more useless AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, he starts to run around 4%... Grats though, gives you a domination feeling $$</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see you didnt score a finishing blow on a mob that was being shielded by another mob yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i am boggling over that UI, the font size, and how you can possibly play like that. i think i'd go nuts.<br />
<br />
anyway, grats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>goobayouface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ya, ui is default, had to start using it when melee changes happened and i just don't care enough to fuck with setting up a new one<br />
yes i realize it's still completely fucking worthless, but it owns innate str still<br />
p.s. haass is a hater irl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was in an LDoN with another Warrior who had 420+ AA's and two of them were Finishing Blow / Coupe de Grace ... I was amazed how often it &quot;fired&quot; ... in that situation it worked very well and I didn't consider it to be a waste.<br />
<br />
Of course if you have 420+ AA's I guess there isn't much else to buy anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see you didnt score a finishing blow on a mob that was being shielded by another mob yet. <br />
<br />
Seperate your mobs.  They suffer the same range limitation.  I can't remember the last time i saw a mob shield another.....chardok bank maybe when PoP came out?  I think so.<br />
<br />
Hater?  Maybe, but when people use the ol' &quot;$$&quot; to describe something retarded, I guess I get annoyed.  Hell, when they use it to describe anything for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nice, finishing blow for over 32k, amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">?  Sarcasm?<br />
<br />
Finishing blow will always be more than 32k if it comes from your mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">so much of the h8 haass :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A wise man once said<br />
<br />
Hate heals you should try it some time.<br />
<br />
Or maybe he wasn't wise, but the song sure as hell kicked ass, and that's all that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">thats right on the $$ haass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From what Trondir said, I think you may have missed his point, Haaass.  I think he was hinting that getting a 32k shot on a mob that is being /sheilded by another mob would do 16k to the one you finishing blow on, and 19.2k to the other...far from useless, if used to your advantage.<br />
<br />
Now, if it really works that way, especially in places like LDoN, or Sebilis, where you have LOTS of mobs that /sheild, and have lots in camp at once, quite often, that could be VERY VERY useful.  Imagine having a 100% health mob insta-gibbed by a finishing blow, because he /sheilded another, perhaps 1 mob in 20, if you have 3-4 mobs in camp in a normal ldon, that could easily cut 5 minutes off an adventure.<br />
<br />
Does a /sheild-er take almost 20k when you finish off his buddy? Anyone know this for a fact?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A mob doesnt go into run mode for finishing blow to even go off if theres another mob of the same faction in /shield range, I cant think of any that do anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You'd have to get one to running, and then pull a second one by it as it's running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya, and then the one would have to start shielding the other, and you'd have to score a FB before you just killed it outright.<br />
<br />
Oh, and mobs split damage evenly, they don't do 50/75 like us, it's 50/50 for exploit purposes just like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Podling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Which would still make it a 16k hit on the fresh mob.  Nothing to sneeze at.<br />
<br />
Question, can you score a FB on a feared mob?  I know you can't fear it and get a FB at 100% life, but if the mob is below running level and the only thing stopping him from running is another mob in camp, will fear allow you to get a FB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Which would still make it a 16k hit on the fresh mob. Nothing to sneeze at. <br />
<br />
Go try it. <br />
<br />
I've never seen it happen, I've never heard of it happening.<br />
<br />
THAT would be a screenshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Which would still make it a 16k hit on the fresh mob. Nothing to sneeze at. <br />
<br />
Yea, considering it has a one in a billion chance of happening. <br />
<br />
But by all means, go buy FB for this purpose! If it works, let me be the first to shake your hand IRL.</div></div><hr />
