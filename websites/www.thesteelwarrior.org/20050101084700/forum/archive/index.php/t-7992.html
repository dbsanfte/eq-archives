<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just recently dinged to 51, and was wondering what the general consensus is for beginning AA's? Should I make hitting 65 priority (since AA's are based off level 51 experience, thus could grind quicker at 65) or should I put a percentage of exp into AA's (once I have 51 secured of course)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely 65 all the way IMO then grind out the AA's. They will come much faster then anyways as you will be able to join better groups, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. 65 first, AAs second. Having AAs won't help you get groups in your 50s, and the AAs really will roll in faster at 65. AAs, as I recall, are a set amount of experience per AA, and at 51 you're getting much less experience per mob than you are at 65. Therefore the AAs will come slower for you now than later. If you really want a couple AAs, I'd recommend getting run 3. It saved my life so many times that I really feel it's the only justifiable AAs to get early.</div></div><hr />

However....  since raid exp sucks, i switched exp to AAexp during raids. If you raid semi frequently, you should be able to get 3-6 AA's in by the time you get 65.<br />
<br />
Generally run3 and regen3 are the preferred choices to start with, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't get  run3 as soon as I dinged 51, but I'd sure better have it before 65.  What I've done on my chars is this;  Run3 by lvl 55, Regen3 or Metabo3 by lvl 60.  So when you get ding 65 you can put 90% into AA and get right to work on your Archetype Tab.  If you keep 10% into normal xp you should have a full xp bar around AA 120ish, depending on how often you raid/die inbetween.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, here's a question I never thought about. After you ding 65, do you have an exp bar to fill up incase of deaths or whatnot. ON a related note, after you've filled said xp bar what happens to the xp after it is full, does the xp above cap automaticly go to aa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You still have an experience bar at 65, and it's good to get a buffer in so you don't lose 65. I don't know about what happens when maxxed, though I suspect it's simply wasted experience.</div></div><hr />
