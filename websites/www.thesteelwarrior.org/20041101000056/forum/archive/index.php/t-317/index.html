<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ararkham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone gimme infos about the THO in the Deep ??<br />
<br />
How hard is he hitting (i heard about 500) ? double? quad ?<br />
<br />
i heard he has about 500 khp .<br />
Hard resist ?<br />
<br />
But, most important, i know that he has 2 nasty AoE : <br />
<br />
1 - AoE slow and 100 DD<br />
<br />
2 - AoE that make your caster fizzle all the time ..<br />
<br />
How to avoid that nasty trick ? Does he cast them in a specific order?<br />
<br />
Thanks by advance though :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandolo1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">THO is a typical SoL fight... Long.<br />
<br />
We have dropped him twice now, first with 37ppl and 2nd with 46ppl, and both times our MT's defensive disc has recycled.<br />
<br />
The slow AoE is a pain, but is easily cured with RC (most of our casters are RC1 or RC2).  I'm pretty sure it's magic based, so bring your bards and that will help some.  With 417svM I was resisting about 2/3rds of the slows.<br />
<br />
The fizzle AoE can be avoided by casters quite easily.  The range is pretty large but THO is perma rooted beside a huge obstruction, so any/all shrunk casters can hide from the effects.<br />
<br />
Clearing there is a joke for 20 min, then semi tricky on the mobs just outside his room.  We had four warriors engaged at one time, so make sure you've got enough tanks (or better pullers) to go around.<br />
<br />
But as I said before, this is a 15-20min fight.  The mob is slowable and debuffable, so cleric mana isn't really an issue.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He has both, but they take up the same slot. So if you have one, he can't land the other on you. Greater cure curse will get rid of it. Just make sure your melees have the fizzle and your casters have the slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The stacking issue has been fixed for several months now.  You can have both AEs on you at the same time.<br />
<br />
The AE Slow is NOT a curse.  The only way to remove it is Radiant Cure or a bazillion dispells.<br />
