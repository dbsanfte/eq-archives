<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if the sudden push of aggro from a regular DD proc, not pure hate, is enough to consider a slightly lower dps-on-paper weapon.<br />
<br />
One of the things I have always seen when analyzing weapons is to give little credence to the proc since you can't count on it getting resisted all the time.<br />
<br />
However, resists are perfectly fine for aggro holding.<br />
<br />
Just curious, if given a weapon with inferior DAM + Bonus / DLY, how much consideration should one give to the proc, not so much for the damage, but for the aggro.<br />
<br />
As I gear up, I am trying to gear for max aggro holding, more than max dps *per se* -- obviously dps and aggro go hand in hand, but aren't EXACTLY the same thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a DD proc is still better than no proc at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cervesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're right in that straight DPS isn't going to get or hold aggro for you but......<br />
<br />
A Debuff, Stun, Snare, Slow or HATE proc is going to go ALOT farther than a DD Proc.<br />
<br />
If you're going to sacrifice DPS for a proc, I'd make sure it wasn't a DD proc.</div></div><hr />

I find that I keep aggro better when I use BoC offhand.<br />

Conventional wisdom would say BoC main holds aggro better, I dont see that happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With that said, would you say the ac debuff of the frostbringer would help make up for the frosty's so-so stats?<br />
<br />
My main's are a monk and sk, and I am used to either having to shed aggro or having an easy means of generating it.<br />
<br />
I am trying to choose weapons based on aggro, and I see where you are coming from about straight dd procs not being nearly as good as even a say small debuff or snare or even a 0.0 stun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The rule of thumb used to be, DD procs generated the same aggro as the ammount of damage the proc dealt.  I.E. it was the same as hitting for lets say, 100 damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can't translate 1pt from a dd to 1pt aggro.  It's not close to that from my experience.  DD's are very minor aggro.  They are some, but not much.<br />
<br />
As for the Frosty, it's one of the most loved warrior weapons I know of heh.  It's a worthy buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Landrain, I might have to agree on that oddity. My guild MA has told me once that the other warr in guild with Agnarr sword on main and boc offhand could out taunt his BoC main CHSD offhand combo. Also, MA has a lot more offensive aa than the other warr like ferocity. The way that he told me appears to me that it's not something that happens occasionally due to a lucky streak of procs but rather a consistent occurence. <br />
<br />
As for myself, I have been using Agnarr main and CHSD/Blackout offhand and it seems like i don't have a lot of trouble keeping agro during normal xp groupage. But during MAing, I still always use CHSD/Blackout combo just to be safe, and I am very reluctant to test how efficient it will be if I use Agnarr sword in main when i MA. <br />
<br />
Something that boggles me is that if the agro generated per 1 point of damage (and i am not saying 1 dmg = 1 agro i am just expressing it as an unknown ratio) is the same for every class, then I wouldn't be able to hold agro let's say comparing with a non FD monk with roughly the same equip. I don't compare with rogue is because I don't know when do they evade. Long story short, pure DPS weapon like JSoFF or Agnarr sword seems to work better if put in main and boc offhand, of course it's assuming that u don't have a BF, and that's just based on my limited observation and experience so far. nothing scientific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think you guys misunderstood my statement.   I was saying that a DD generates no more aggro than a regular sword slice for the same ammount of damage.  Don't count on DDs or lifetaps for essentially any more aggro than anything else, UNLESS the lifetap/dd is unresistable.  Unresistable DDs seem to produce significantly more aggro.  Ask anyone that has ever used something like a Gaud MTing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think what is coming out of this discussion for me, is that if the proc doesn't have something else with the damage, ie pure hate, debuff, snare/slow, dot, stun etc, that you shouldn't give special consideration to the proc for guaging the quality of the weapon versus others really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thats exactally what you should be getting, other than the pure dps aspect... which is generally very low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In today's environment the 9/19 of the wavecrasher is pretty lame, but the effect has to create a pretty decent hate.<br />
<br />
Do people use the wavecrasher or is the melee component just too lame?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lots of people use a wavecrasher.  Many will swear by it.  I personally didn't like it's proc rate, and a few others have had the same problem.  But overall it is definately a decent weapon.  9 / 19 does seem lame, but often (especially at lower lvls of the game) warriors have to get weapons with crappy ratios just so they can get the procs to keep taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yeah; hence why even some warriors still swap in the praetor's blade/black bladeof tormenting..etc...while using superior DPS weapons with no proc.<br />
9/19 is lame-o; but when it's your meat and potatoes weapon it's really not too shabby. when and if it procs is another whole arguement in itself. thing never really worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have decided to go with the frosty + hateful yak combo for now, the melee dps is not bad really, and that gives me two procs t hat have extra hate (debuff and stun 0.0) in addition to damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Malric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've been using a Wavecrasher for nearly a year now and it has always done a good job for me. Half the time in xp grps and even on raids it will proc before the slowers even have a chance to try and it seems to stick a lot easier even on raid lvl mobs (aary, ST ancients, random NToV trash) than shammy/chanter slow. It isn't the best dps ever but once it procs a time or 2 I usually dont lose agro very easily at all.<br />

Hell, I am sure they'd still hold their own against many of the new hate proc'ing weapons.   I still wield my willsapper today, I can count on it more than I can count on anything else.....I am loosing faith in my CHSD.</div></div><hr />

 2 of our wars with Agnarr sword mainhand it occasionally(BoC and Hategiver offhand). 1 of em(BoC) says she doesn't notice much of a difference at all.<br />
<br />
 Personally I have a JSoFF and BF. Difference is of course very noticable due to tweaked proc rate. But I can generally hold agro if I mainhand the Jagged Shard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Donvanlot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Speaking of funny aggro.  I recently got a Greatstaff of Thunder and had a 2hb skill of 0.  With many many misses, low dps and no procs I would still taunt better than my 1hs (Curved Claws and Defender's Lightblade...yeah, not aggro weapons but still).<br />

Aggro is so goofy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With the agro changes that went in for slow about a year ago, they nerfed the effectiveness of slow procing weapons to generate hate.  <br />
<br />
Sony lowered the amount of hate slow spells generated because shaman and enchanters were complaining about getting the snot kicked out of them.  This went in at the same time as the &quot;slows are magic based, but can be removed with cure disease&quot; fix went in (Right around the same time as the CT revamp? memory's a little froggy as to when it happened).<br />
<br />
Since then, the willsapper and wavecrasher have lost some of their agro ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I don't think that's why Gaudralek's proc generates aggro. It probably generates aggro because it has a small knockback component (just verified this on Lucy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Since then, the willsapper and wavecrasher have lost some of their agro ability <br />
<br />
The willsapper and Wavecrasher slows were not affected by the patch that made certain slows (chanter and shammy ones) curable by cure disease.  These slows were not altered in any way, shape, or form, so your statement is false.  They still have the aggro ability they always did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A slow can still peel some serious aggro can it not? <br />
<br />
I seem to percieve Shaman and Enchanters occasionally taking aggro in PoP xp groups every now and then, etc.<br />
<br />
A slow (proc'd or cast)  is still up their on the hiearchy of things mobs hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Slow is second only to Stun for hate spells (that aren't pure hate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why do warriors ever loose agro in fight ?<br />
1) DPS<br />
2) DPS<br />
3) DPS<br />
<br />
Low hp agro, and debuffing at inc doesnt count.<br />
<br />
Any weapon with a DD will generate agro. Even if its a low resist nuke.<br />
<br />
Gimme 2x  18/20 with a DD500 that procs like SoD or BBoE.<br />
(no need for a stun, just good old DD, that procs often)<br />
And mobs will stick on me like glue, even VS full burn wizards.<br />
<br />
Thats why BoW has great agro, despite its at most mediocre proc rate.<br />
<br />
A 90  DPS  BF/BoC war will need a lot of procs to agro.<br />
A 150 DPS  BoW war wont need as many procs.<br />
<br />
Avatar + Fero + Thule + CoP + Bard = 2000+ atk<br />
Your DPS is soooo high, that mobs wont notice theres someone else hitting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm not sure slow is second in aggro behind stun.  I think snare is up there pretty high too.  Rangers and SKs that use snare to pull seem to have a pretty easy time holding aggro (yes, I know, the SK snare has a DOT on it too, but the ranger one doesn't).  <br />
<br />
My warrior is my main, but when I play my shammy, I love to see a pally tanking.  I know I can slow on the incoming and almost never get aggro.  With a warrior tanking, unless he has uber taunting weapons, I'm going to catch aggro every time if I slow at the outset.  <br />
<br />
There are only a couple of ways I have found to deal with the shammy aggro problem.  One is to delay the slow for a few seconds, to let the warrior get solid aggro.  That eats into the warrior's HP, and so the cleric's mana, though.  The other way is for the shammy to be equipped to take a few hits.  That works fine .. unless slow doesn't stick.  An unslowed PoP mob hitting on a shammy hurts, a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gerili</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Been my experience running both druid and a shaman, snare and slow seem to be on the same level of aggro.  Only difference is usually the shaman is casting slow right at the beginning of the fight, where as the druid will wait till 80 or 50 to snare.  A druid can still pull aggro very fast on mobs that do not like to be slowed very quickly with a few resists to snare.  Not all mobs are build the same though, some mobs are strictly proximity aggro, while some mobs seem to care more or less about snare or heals.  While I am not sure exactly where dd's are in on the aggro scale, however I do know that dd's are higher in aggro then say a lifetap.  Lifetap's seem very low on the scale when it comes to aggro.  Rain's seem to be fairly low on scale vs a straight dd.  I have nuked at same time I have done a rain, rain did more damage in same period of time, while nuke pulled aggro.  Resisted slow/snare seem to generate more aggro then if they had landed.  DD spells still pull what seems to be the equivielent as if they had landed.  And not all direct damage spells seem to be built the same, I beleive the wizard line generates slightly less aggro then some of the other classes in terms of aggro vs amount of damage dealt.  I do not believe it is all 100% based on amount of damage dealt, but how that damage is dealt.  Also critting with spells which doubles the amount of damage dealt for me (scf3) seems to generate conciderable less aggro then two nukes.  It generates more aggro yes, but less than 2 nukes would have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you parse the 2 setups, you'll probably find the JSoFF main, BoC offhand will do about 15-20 more dps which makes a noticeable difference in keeping aggro.  2 warriors in my guild have the blade of war, one has pretty much all the offensive AA while the other has a few.  War 1 does approx 20 more dps than war 2 and it's not difficult for me to steal aggro from war 2 but I have a bit tougher time taking it from war 1.</div></div><hr />
