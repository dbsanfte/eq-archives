<br />
Ofcourse the best information is at Allakhazam, but with recent changes to illusion faction and with the addition of illusion potions this quest has gotten easier.<br />
<br />
I had done a ton of Old Sebilis killing for loots and I noticed &quot;Your standing with Froglocks of Guk could not possibly get any better&quot; so one night I decided to go con Guk Guards. I, a Rallos Zek Ogre, conned WARMLY, which amazed me pretty much, so I decided to hit the ghoul lord for his scalp. www.eqatlas.com can get you there if you are an Old World n00b like I was. A couple hours netted the scalp and I conned ally without any other help WOOT!<br />
<br />
I have heard that iksar cannot get above AMIABLE due to Cazic and race, so I would suggest getting a potion : Illusion Wood Elf . At max faction this should take you to ally. <br />
<br />
I hit OS with a vengeance, netting myself and a rogue friend the necessary crown. Going back there until my wife gets one for her halfling cleric too. The drop rate of crowns is not so hot, about 1 per 4 hours or so if camping in Juggs, just inside of the one way door to Trak. If you setup shop there, make sure to have you puller clear the room first, then camp inside the door midway through the hall. An occasional roamer from outside will path, as well as a roamer will pop in the room. Bring a talented chanter, fair dps, and an evaccer. We went 60 warrior (me), 60 cleric (wife), 59 enchanter, 52 shaman, 65 rogue (can single pull some mobs, but keep the enchanter ready) , and different evaccer depending on the night, I would say lvl 55 just to make certain snare sticks. SNARE EVERYTHING, btw. <br />
<br />
Also, camping there netted 8 undead dragon sinew (used for spirit wracked cords) over the course of 4 nights. As always, the complete formula for the crown can be found at http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2275 . <br />
<br />
Also got a cobalt bracer last night, so I was pretty frickin' happy. Two different ways to fit in tight spaces is nice.<br />
<br />
FACTION NOTE: After completing the quest, without ghoul lord scalp, but with the illusion wood elf, I was ally.<br />

/beer everyone<br />

{EDIT BELOW}<br />
<br />
Drop rate is apparently not as good as I stated above. We went back and did reets/juggs for about 5 hours each night (which was atleast 15 reets per hour between stationary and wandering juggs) for a total of 7 DAYS to get my wife the crown. We were sick of that stupid camp. 15 per hour x 35 hours = 525 frogs, and that is a low estimate. Just a heads up so you will be ready for the possibility of a hellishly long camp if you don't get luckiy drops.</div></div><hr />
