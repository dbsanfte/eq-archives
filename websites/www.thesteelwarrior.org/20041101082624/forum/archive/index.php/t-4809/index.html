<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">VDD's proc description listed a -90 AC proc.<br />
<br />
Symbol of Planesmasters listed the proc to be about a 3850 DD. I wish!<br />
<br />
Fury of the Chosen had it's stamina regen component removed, and nothing else added (NERF). <br />
<br />
A number of other items that gave stamina were given ultravision, serpent sight, etc.  Making many of them fairly useless...<br />
<br />
There were a few others...<br />
<br />
Patch server is all screwed now for the last hour or so, and now it looks like servers are dropping...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you wore an item only for STA regen and nothing else, then this change didn't make it useless, the item was already useless. Typos in descriptions are annoying but not game breaking. Some people are having true problems though, with 20 hour refresh on discs and whatnot, and that is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since there is no longer a stamina bar (it's called endurance now), items that gave stamina regen have been removed from the game. Since the stamina bar was meaningless anyway, this was not a nerf. If you got a free insta-click buff, count yourself as being ahead.</div></div><hr />
