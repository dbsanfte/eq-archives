<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could have sworn I remembered seeing some in depth posts parsing the effectiveness of the various Time melee effects like Shielding, Combat Effects, Avoidance, etc. but I can't seem to find one anywhere.  My guild is close to making our final push for PoTime access and I'm trying to plan out my Time wishlist.  <br />
<br />
Shielding is sort of a no brainer.  I'll be going for every shielding item I can get my hands on.  Spell Shield sounds nice too, But I remember seeing some dubious returns for things like Strikethrough.  Did our posts on this stuff get lost when the other site was hacked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are very few strikethrough items.  Gloves of Airy Mists (10%), Gauntlet of Disruption (5%), and Timestone Adorned Ring (5%) are the only ones that are even melee usable I can think of offhand (Tigerskin Padded Gloves probably has too but AC is way too low).  The only real choice here is whether you want to replace your Raex with one of the two gloves that have roughly the same stats when you factor in the tradeoff of AC for HPs/resists/strikethrough.  <br />
<br />
Likewise there are only 3 warrior usable spellshield items (not counting the shield because it's not practical).  Prismatic Ring of Resistance (6%), Belt of Temporal Bindings (5%), and Armguard of the Brute (4%) and all those are pretty solid choices as well, though there are belts with more AC/HPs.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Forgot Darkblade of the Warlord has 5% strikethrough too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are still tradeoffs though like whether to take a cloak with shielding or avoidance...  Without indepth info on it I think I'd go for the shielding one but for all I know the avoidance one may be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avoidance has proven difficult to quantify for comparisons.  Shielding is very easy... direct reduction of damage taken from a mob's damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Avoidance appears to provide direct AC.  Whether this AC is equal to normal AC or better is a difficult prospect to assign numbers.<br />
<br />
One of the questions you might want to consider is your position in the tank order.  If you are not near the front of the line for new weapons, then you might want to consider emphasizing Combat Effects to maximize your aggro or enhanced proc-based DPS.  If you are up front, then go for damage absorption such as Shielding and Avoidance.<br />
<br />
Strikethrough is DPS only.  Aggro is by swing, not by damage dealt, so an attack that should not have hit will create no more aggro than one that would have been parried or riposted.  It's groovy for XP groups and parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want Quarm cloak you should plan on having 15% shielding eventually, since incremental gains from shielding is greater the more you have it (4% more shielding at 11% shielding helps more than 4% more shielding at 0%).  If not, RZ cloak probably better... and certainly economical, assuming your guild assumes values to loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4% more shielding at 11% shielding helps more than 4% more shielding at 0%<br />
Huh, wanna explain that again? Assuming DB is 1000:<br />
<br />
0% shielding = 1000<br />
4% shielding = 960<br />
diff in DB=40<br />
<br />
11% shielding = 890<br />
15% shielding = 850<br />
diff in DB=40<br />
<br />
4% extra shielding will prevent the exact same amount of numeric damage no matter what your base shielding % is. Feel free to point out an error in the above numbers though, but thats my understanding of how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he's suggesting that though it is the same actual reduction, the cumulative reduction is more and more significant the more you have. 890 to 850 is much more important than 1000 to 960.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah nod. I guess you could argue that if DI=0, then going from 0 to 4% shielding is a 4% reduction of mob DPS(1000-&gt;960), whereas going from 11% to 15% shielding is a 4.5% reduction in mob DPS(890-&gt;850). <br />
<br />
However, typically DI is not 0, and the damage contributed by DB is only part of the actual average damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So to use Shielding vs Avoidance as an example, there's 4% Shielding on Shroud of Eternity vs Avoidance 10 on Platinum Cloak of War.  We know 4% shielding reduces the DB by 4%.  Do we have any idea what Avoidance 10 does?  Is it a large enough difference that it's measurable in a parse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avoidance 10 seems to add 8ac.<br />
<br />
I have an RZ cloak with a 5 ac aug (making it 45). When I take it off I lose 83ac. When I take off my puresteel mantle (also has 5 ac aug so it's 45 too) I lose 75 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even when DI is not 0, shielding effect still gets greater as you accumulate more.  Suppose a mob hits for 1k-3K.  Take 4% shielidng at 0% and 96%, even if mob hits for max you're looking at 3000 to 2960 versus 2040 to 2000.  It's still 40 damage reduced in both cases but it is a greater reduction as part of the mob's total damage, and this improves the efficiency of heals.<br />
<br />
Also with more shielding the effect of our innate 5% mitigation becomes better.  If a mob's DB is 0 then essentially 5% mitigation is the same thing as taking 5% less damage so the lower you can reduce a mob's DB, the more we get out of our innate mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also with more shielding the effect of our innate 5% mitigation becomes better.

<br />
I assume you meant DI rather than DB here.  If a mob's DB is zero then shielding does absolutely nothing.  0x100%=0x95%...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If DB is 0 then you get 5% damage reduced from your innate mitigation, not shielding.<br />
<br />
So as you get more shielding you actually get more out of your innate mitigation as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gromlok</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both Shielding and Avoidance seem to have good qualities.  What are the preferences of the main tanks that already have some of these items?  My guild is in time but I have none of these items yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only items with conflicting avoidance/shielding stats is on the cloak.  However, if you don't have a clicky stun then you're better off with Symbol of Planesmasters then the range item with 10 avoidance (Globe of Mystical Protection or something?).  I suppose you could always use the Symbol of Planemasters as a clicky but it's kind of wasteful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was wondering about the same thing, how many % would combat effects  +10 increasse the procrate with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edone</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">few parces ive seen (4-6,which is quite meaningless really),show combat effects to add that number in 100th's of procs per min<br />
<br />
like 2.5 procs per min with combat effects 25,would be 2.75 procs per min<br />
<br />
but again,the fact those numbers showed themselves could of been just alot of coinincidence~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, that's a fairly significant jump if that's how it works.</div></div><hr />
