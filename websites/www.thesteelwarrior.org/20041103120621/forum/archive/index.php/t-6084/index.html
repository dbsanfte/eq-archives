How hard is the mob and can it be done with:<br />

62 Druid<br />
61 Pally<br />
60 Rogue<br />
64 Enchanter<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalmoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If that group can handle the normal sand giants in Plane of Storms you can handle him.  They are roughly equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not a hard mob just silly RARE<br />
<br />
I had him spawn one time in probably 12 days total camping (usually 4-5 hour spurts).   It's pretty good exp, can pull all the nobles even around the pole outside, there all lvl 59-61.  But that DAMN SKELETON is too rare (<br />
<br />
I believe everything was 18 minute re spawn.  He will spawn in the only room with a single mob (when going up the stairs its the first room on right).  Its the NE room of the four.<br />
<br />
/cusses at the remains</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think my Pally friend will like this mob.. She has this thing for Undead mobs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wish you the best in killing him.  I was fortunate enough while running to get a piece for the warrior epic in the Dreadlands to receive a tell asking me if I wanted to loot it.  The remains was killed by a duo team of a 65 Necro and 65 Cleric.  Since then my guild has tried in getting another one, and quickly realized he's stupid rare in popping.  Actually have Stormfeather pop more often than this one did.  Loving this weapon ever since then, and believe I am only of a small handful of people with this weapon on my server.  Which isn’t too bad being in a non-raiding everyday guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalmoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have camped the area thrice (mostly for experience not for weapons from him per se).<br />
<br />
Killed him 6 times I think in about 12 hours.  I may have gotten rather streaky but its not something like every 4-5 hours.  He doesn't seem to really be any more rare than any other named with a place holder that I've run across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've think I've killed this guy about 8 times, haven't seen the sword drop.  Problem with him is his loot table is fairly large and he only drops one item a kill.  So even after he spawns its a crap shoot whether or not you get the sword.  One time we got to the camp and started to clear and then Sony decided to bring the server down.  Long story short, I got booted and when the server came up I couldn't get back on.  Remains spawned on server up and an SK!! in my guild had to loot the sword because otherwise it was going to rot.  Man was I pissed....<br />
<br />
He did spawn 3 times in a row one time when we were camping him though, I think he may be a little more rare overall than the rest of the named in the zone, but not by much.  That camp is the best camp in the zone IMO, can reasonably camp 4 drops from there and the mobs give the best exp in the zone too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If this is the guy at the nobles camp in Veksar. Think thats who you are refering to. I have killed him like 4 times all 4 times have seen the same 2 hander drop. The one in my majelo. He is nasty. Quads for 800 ish but is easily slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lochr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Remains has a max hit of 778, and quads as the previous poster said. It has approximately 52K hit points. It has no procs or AoEs. Warrior class mob. In my opinion, the Remains is much tougher then a PoS giant, as it has more hitpoints, and quads, which I don't think giants do. Hits a bit harder too.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have to worry about adds. Your concern should be the druid's mana pool given the mob's hit points. <br />
<br />
CRs are pretty easy. The Remains doesn't see rogue sneak/hide, and doesn't see either invis or ivu (forget which). Some nobles do see invis and ivu. Since it's easy enough to CR (assuming you can find rezzes), I'd say give it a try.<br />
<br />
I've killed the guy 6 times, got the sword once. We saw his neck item 3 times, the 2hs twice. The neck item's really quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have seen a couple drop, and gotten one myself. It makes for a nice offhander and has a pretty decent proc rate.<br />
<br />
Your group should be fine to get it. Although it'll be an exciting fight to be sure...<br />
<br />
*cackle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yuniargo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to have one of those swords for a while and used it in primary with anger 2 augment.  It was really nice to use because of the 15 dmg value, but the proc isn't exactly anywhere close to good aggro IMO, but the anger 2 proc made up for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tlarzoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is this worth camping over Sword of the Bloodsworn?  Plan on augmenting the SotB with anger 3...<br />
<br />
I don't want to waste a lot of time on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is this worth camping over Sword of the Bloodsworn <br />
<br />
Sword agro &gt; Hook agro<br />
Sword ratio &gt; Hook ratio<br />
Sword camp = Hook camp , same thing really, same exp<br />
Sword rarity from mob &lt;better&gt; Hook rarity from mob. <br />
<br />
I've camped both spots and seen Remains one time, I've seen the mage from Droga every time i've camped the area.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The mere fact some peeps stated it's stupid-rare probably means you shouldn't bother with it if you &quot;don't want to waste a lot of time on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He has a large'ish loot table and according to some (myself included) he just doesn't pop that often. I've yet to see him up, although I've only camped that area seriously three times, for about 4-5 hours each time. Other times, on other camps, I've had my druid constantly tracking for him (and yes, the camp was taken and being cleared numerous times) and have never seen him up on track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tlarzoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks, basically what I thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bloodsworn is insanely more common, but i'm glad i lucked out on Hook anyway.<br />
<br />
+250 hate, and when i get the points, I'm gonna add ykesha or other DD onto it for offhand. It'll be a nice lil kick in the pants for the mob :)<br />
<br />
If you got friends with ya in veksar, and if it's relatively empty like it is on Tribunal, can prolly swing thru a few of the camps if ya get bored with waiting for Sythrax.<br />
<br />
A lil variety never hurt.<br />
<br />
Hell, good reason to have it is because nearly every ranger i see has Bloodsworn... annoys the crap outta me. lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually i was looking to perhaps partner the Hook with my Bloodsworn.  I see more idiot Rangers running around with CHOS than I do with Bloodsworns, but yeah in general I agree and would like to be somewhat different than your average Ranger :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tryed to Solo this with druid O_o , got em to 23% before had to jet , nasty mob solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gninjuh Mahster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Easily done with good tank slower and healer. I did him 3 times a few nights ago. his spawn rate was 1 remains per every 2 or 3 PH on a 21 min timer. Got agro weapon second time he dropped.  I just pulled him down to the little safe area by the wall next to zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That group can do him if the druid has trouble with heals go defensive.  he does hit for 778 and fast.  If you could get a slower especially a necro...he is gimp slowed...just lots of HPS.<br />
i have camped him and not seen him pop all day and once saw him pop back to back 4 times.<br />
got the Hooked and the Parryblade from him.<br />
we have gotten all off his loot table and only seen the hooked blade once.<br />
It procs a lot! and usually back to back.   i combine it with the red epic and am quite happy.<br />
<br />
The camp itself is ok exp and decent AA.<br />
we just take him where he spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">He can be solo'd by a 65 necro with charm.  Necro can slow and mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gnawbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I know it sucks to have the same look as every other Tom, Dick and Harry, but the CHoS is better than the Hooked So'Shar for aggro IMO, especially since you'll be offhanding either it appears.<br />
<br />
Your group will own that camp unless you really mess up. RoS is pretty streaky in my experience, but has averaged about once per hour for me, occasionaly spawning as much as three times in a row. <br />
<br />
The other gear he drops is well worth the camp, as the only thing that you can't sell besides the So'Shar is the Tu'Nakk Parryblade, but it at least has that nice hedge trimmer look. :) The neck is still a really good item too. The xp is around Plane of Valor speed too if you can chain pull.<br />
<br />
Btw, its also my opinion that GSoT is a better weapon than CHoS/Bloodsworn combo, but then I'm a bit of a dps freak too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Feysboil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I mainhand the Hooked So'Shar with CHoS in offhand (both un-augmented) and have absolutely no problems maintaining agro in XP groups.  We're not a raiding guild, so I'm sure I'd have a different experience trying to tank high-end content (I tanked for a BoT west wing group the other day and was the lowest person there, and didn't lose aggro).  I still can't compete with the on-demand aggro that knights can generate if they want to, but I typically don't have to worry about that kind of pissing contest - I know before we start if I'm tanking or the knight is.  <br />
<br />
We've been back a few times to try and get another Hooked So'Shar for a guildmate, but only managed to ever see Sythrax one more time, when he dropped the Parryblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">BTW, was fun to dual wield the Hook with Wavecrasher.... same graphic.<br />
<br />
Immediately draws attention when anyone is dual wielding 2 identical looking weapons...</div></div><hr />
