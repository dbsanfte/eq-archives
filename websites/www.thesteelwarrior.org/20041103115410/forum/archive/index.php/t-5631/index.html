<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>overlordbarreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok well I wasn't really sure where to post this so I'm putting it here.  Today GoD came out, and along with it came the casino's.  I was lucky enough to receive a golden ticket but in return I got a dogmor.  Now, dont get me wrong its nice, close to bard speed, but I mean, seriously, I have no use for one.  I want to sell it back but atm I have no clue how much it would sell back for, if at all.  Basically what i want to know, if anyone hears of anyone trying to sell one back, or does so themselves, post here if ye could and lemme know what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if it's like the horses; all you need to do is go to the stables where dogmors are sold in Gunthak and see what the proper NPC will give you for it.</div></div><hr />

Course I am an iksar, so we are teh sexy on those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>overlordbarreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">is there a way to see how much they'll give you for it without actually giving it to them? thats why I dont want to just give the drum to the gnome, I&quot;m afraid he'll just eat it or I&quot;ll get like 2k or some junk and be sol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Federiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Glowing Drums that you can win through the casino are basically the drog equivilent of a Seru horse.  I'm pretty sure you can't sell them.</div></div><hr />
