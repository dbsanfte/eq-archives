<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bugbok</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there should be a skill Called Switch, it takes you and switchs the spot with who evers on top of aggro list, example<br />
<br />
Say enchanter pulled he out right tashed it and slowed it and you hit your switch button puts him at your spot with no aggro and you on top,<br />
<br />
refresh time could be like 45 seconds so it won't be overly used<br />
But would still BE very useful. but give it s 90%  success rate on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure this would be too hard to implement into the current game mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A generally good idea, but...<br />
<br />
This would make all big mob encounters trivial.  Giving a Warrior instant aggro, or virtual instant aggro, every 45 seconds would make it too easy.  <br />
<br />
Donal's BP has a right-click CH.  You can imagine how game breaking a manna-free CH would be.  It would trivialize pretty much every aspect of the game.  Make it boring as hell.  <br />
<br />
Because of this, when a Cleric CHes you with Donal's, you get a buff Icon in your buff list.  Until it fades (15 minutes later i think) you cannot get CHed from it again.  <br />
<br />
I like the idea of a skill that does that, but works on the mob.  Meaning, you use your Switch skill, or whatever you want to call it, and get guaranteed aggro.  But you can't use it on the mob again.  The mob can have a buff icon of a fashion.  <br />
<br />
This is not my idea.  People thought of it because the problem is when the channy gets bonked throwing a slow.  Shammies do too, but they take a beating much better then a robe.</div></div><hr />

sure the Enchanter is still high on aggro with Taunt.<br />
But once the mob is slowed, and you taunted... the enchanter won't be aggroing any more.<br />
So what do we care wether he is on top or at the bottom of the aggro list? :/<br />
<br />
What we need is a reliable way of getting ahead on aggro.<br />
The only thing we have that gets us ahead, is our procs.. and they're not reliable.<br />
<br />
How this could be overpowering however, is on raids, having wizards have their little pet Warriors...<br />
wizard over nukes like hell,<br />
warrior who hasnt done anything at all Switches when wizard gets aggro... voila.<br />
The ultimate concussion for wizards ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, this sounds more like a backup skill than a primary use thing.  It should be used rarely to restablish stability.<br />
<br />
As a side thought: I always thought /shield didn't do what it was intented to do.<br />
<br />
Shielding someone is placing yourself between the danger and the one needing protection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Burninator =&gt; &lt;= Warrior * Enchanter Glassjaw<br />
<br />
<br />
Given the current EQ agro mechanics, /shield as is doesn't really do this.  It just takes some of the damage inflicted away.  However it can if it had an agro list modifier.<br />
<br />
/shield could do what was mentioned.  Swap the target with high agro with their lower agro rank.  Its quick and dirty and still chaotic.  I am not sure it would be that useful.<br />
<br />
/shield could place the Warrior one slot higher on the agro list than the target.  Enchanter Glassjaw can move up and down the agro list but the Warrior will always be higher on the agro list as long as /shield is in effect.  This will no matter how many monsters are in the area they would literially have to get through the Warrior before being able to attack Enchanter Glassjaw.  That is more like really shielding.<br />
<br />
Something I'm not sure if SOE can code is making /shield proxy for Enchanter Glassjaw.  That is make the monster see all of Glassjaw's agro as not coming from Glassjaw but from the Warrior.  Glassjaw is frozen on the agro list.  Any action taken by Glassjaw is instead added to the Warrior's agro ranking.<br />
<br />
Hopefully these ideas help flesh your idea out! ^_^</div></div><hr />

Then for each raid we'd have a need for alot of warriors again, one to be MT and the rest to be human sacrifices that eat deaths so the casters can keep nuking/healing.</div></div><hr />
