<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I picked up a Black Axe of Bloodletting (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70654) the other day.  After I picked it up, I noticed that it's a type 7 aug slot, and not a type 4 slot.<br />
<br />
Are there any other weapons out there with type 7 aug slots vice type 4, or should I /bug this as an itemization problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the velium gemmed line of weapons from GoD tradeskill have all one type 4 and one type 7 slot.<br />
moreover there is one procing aug (lifetap) that goes in slot 7 so ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">More than likely it is a mistake.  When gates first came out and I got my wailing coral staff, it had a type 7 slot on it.  I did tons of feedbacks and they eventually changed it to type 4.<br />
<br />
As far as there being a type 7 lifetap aug, if you are referring to the Muddy Gem of Lifetapping, it's type 4 and 8 now, it was changed.  When I originally got mine it was type 7 but now it's 4/8.<br />
<br />
My advice would be to just hang on to the weapon if you plan on using it, I'd guess that the slot type will be changed.</div></div><hr />
