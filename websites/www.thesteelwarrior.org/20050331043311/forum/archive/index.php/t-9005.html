<br />
Is the Toughness talent not worth the 5 points?  Especially now that the max talent points has dropped to 51.<br />
<br />
At first, I thought a +AC talent would be a must have, but...<br />
<br />
180 AC seems like nothing when top warriors on Thottbot have over 4K.  And this is before max level and raid content armor drops.  I would expect AC values to easily go over 5,000 for raid-tanks.<br />
<br />
If we end up with over 5000 AC, then there are a lot of other talents I would rather spend my points on rather than an extra 180.<br />
<br />
Opinions?<br />

So I'm not sure what to say. Grab your taunt/agro talents, and then focus on defensive talents. Keep in mind talents are still being worked out. Toughness needs a bit of tuning, and I expect it will get some, before release.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, even items are still being balanced, so your armor figures may end up changing.</div></div><hr />

Cant tank if your dead.</div></div><hr />

I originally made this post back when the talent was a base number instead of a percentage.  Now that it is 10%, I agree it is a must have for a tanking warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fully intend on reviving my role as a Warrior for WoW.  But, the Arms/Fury Warrior just looks too tasty.  I know Ill be removing myself from the TANK role, but I think Ill still be effective for instances/PvP with friends etc.  Ive read so many +/- posts on the damned Vault/Blizz boards to see most folks dont know their ass from a hole in the ground.  What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wibble</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if not prot i'd do arms, arms is very effective, not so much for tanking but for utility and its also a good bit of dps w/ specialization and Mighty Stike.  Some warriors swear by Might Strike because its good enough to do so.  but as i said for raid tanking go prot.<br />
<br />
fruy... its a fun stats in my experance, nothing like hitting 4 mobs w/ one swing and criting on 2 of em, but it just dosnt have enough good things, dont gain any abilities other then +dmg +atk speed +dmg +dmg.<br />
<br />
some up: arms for casual play, prot for tanking/raiding</div></div><hr />
