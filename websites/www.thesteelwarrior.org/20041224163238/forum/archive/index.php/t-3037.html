<br />
Where do you spend your AAs?<br />
<br />
I am thinking that our &quot;classic&quot; all devensive AA stance needs considerable revision in light of the 6 person group emphasis in LDoN and as a warrior being able to carry your agro. <br />
<br />
Here is what I think simplest form of the questions: do you conserve healer mana by maxing defensive AA or the threat to mezers and slowers by maxing your agro--IE DPS AAs. <br />
<br />
My impression, so far, after all of 2 65th normal missions is that we need to appoch LDoN with a mix of AA--because mobs don't hit that hard (IE healer mana is already fairly easy to conserve) and even it you have NO defensive AAs, if you keep agro on you, you healer will spend similar or less mana on healing you than you + chain or robe after slow/mez agro. (I have seen min hits of 77 and max about 350 on normal mobs--with ND, and CA and CS 1). <br />
<br />
Considering the lower DPS of LDoN mbos I think that we have to use a more balance approch on AA--becuase while small in a 6 person group warrior DPS is not trivial, and the extra agro it buys us. Any 65/0 warrior probably has enough HP/AC to take well enough..so that surviving does not become the greatest challenge. <br />
<br />
So I will probably be going for Tactical Master...I think for my next AAs..though I am not 100%. Damage is low enough that 1h seems to be a viable option...though now I just need a set up of 1h weapons that are good enough to out DPS my GSoT--and its proc when I finally buy it. (Thinking about it that way, PB may make more sence...even knowing that there may be decient 1h weapons that I can eventually buy, they would probably take enough missions that I could use the AAs earned during to improve 1h DPS...)</div></div><hr />

When alternate advancement was added it was supposed to be a way to further flesh out your character.  Since then the online community has done nothing but try to determine an &quot;optimum upgrade path&quot; so everyone could do the same thing with it.  The truth of the matter is, YOUR optimum upgrade path depends heavily on YOUR play style.  Just like someone who only wields 2H shouldn't get ambidexterity, someone who can't get aggro really has no need for defensive AAs until they can.  While you could break it down to the point of &quot;If you dual-wield and hunt outside LDoN, etc. take upgrade path X-Y-Z&quot; all you're doing is taking the responsibility for other people's choices when there isn't even a right or wrong answer. (Well, ok, there might be a few wrong answers *warcry*)<br />
<br />
The right answer is: completely subjective.<br />
The right answer is: that AA that gives you a warm/fuzzy.<br />
The right answer is: whatever works for YOU.</div></div><hr />
