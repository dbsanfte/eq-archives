We are being listened too lets make the changes count.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chill on the monks Frod. So far the system isn't testing out to be that great for monks just yet.<br />
<br />
DPS increases are suspect for us.<br />
<br />
Openings are completely random, taking the worst elements of procs and twitch gameplay and combining them.<br />
<br />
Utility seems suspect.<br />
<br />
And tweaking our disciplines doesn't seem to be all that excitement building, considering they're messing with our BEST disc and not giving us hope that the other discs will be worth playing with.<br />
<br />
Dodge from behind doesn't seem to be near as useful to monks as a straight mitigation increase will be to warriors.<br />
<br />
And that's just from the people TESTING these things.<br />
<br />
Yeah, they complain. But what happens when the complaints are coming from people actually logging and trying to use these abilities?<br />
<br />
In other words ...<br />
<br />
I'm happy that warriors are excited and happy about the changes coming to their own class (though, I must say, the list I saw of warrior ability names was kind of laughable).<br />
<br />
But monks have a whole separate set of issues, and that's where their frustration stems from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm totally willing to accept that monks have their own issues but they're NOT helping themselves by calling things &quot;nerfs&quot; that arent' implemented yet.<br />
<br />
The one thread about stonestance is the classic example.   I got no problem conceding that monks could use something more exciting than &quot;just openings&quot;, but they're not winning any points jumping to conclusions the way they are.</div></div><hr />

Lets clariify some stuff right fuqen now.<br />
Theres a shit load of reason to be complaining about this shit currently on test.<br />
The whole Idea of opening is BS. If your going to use Opening why even have an Endurance Bar?Openings are far to short, but remeber they don't want to make this a twitch game. MY FUQEN ASS. I might as well coin this now, EverMash... <br />
RNG sucks we know this, you know this, they know this, and yet were being slaved to it YET AGAIN.<br />

<br />
/feedback then.   I disagree that the combination of:  provoke, mitigation bonus, taunt failure message AND openings is &quot;BS&quot;, it's light years from where we were before AND ti's all tuneable.<br />
<br />
Get OFF your ass and test and /feedback and analyze or go masturbate...<br />
<br />
the choice is yours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They gave us most of what we were asking for.  Instant aggro from a distance, increased mitigation, unhooked disciplines.<br />
<br />
The rest of that stuff is just icing on the cake.  They could delete all of the combat abilities except provoke and we still got a pretty good deal in my book.  Focusing on the opening stuff, which is the least important thing we got, is just chronic whining disease kicking in on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SkafflocTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fine I will chime in with a legitimate whine.... I tried out the new setup on test. And for PVE I'm not going to complain. I think having some limited ranged snap aggro (Provoke), and new ways to put the hurt on a mob are great.<br />
<br />
However.... I play on a zek. For PvP the new changes will do nothing to help the state of pure melees in pvp. Warriors (along with rogues and monk) will stay as they are in PvP... gimps.<br />
<br />
The openings will have little to know effect in pvp. No one is going to stand there long enough to let you get an opening.<br />
And yes, I did feedback this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Again /agree Brutul. This is 90% of what we wanted.<br />
<br />
Provoke requires NO OPENING! Please go test it so you understand that. Is it the end all be all of aggro? No , but hell its a damn good tool for warriors. <br />
<br />
Some of the abilities require an opening. Some, not all. If you think the opening time is to short then go feedback it as has been suggested. 1 month ago if Absor had posted we were getting our disc unlocked like they are on test right now , given ranged aggro and our mitigation increased by 5% we would have all been happy campers.<br />
<br />
Well we have it! (On test for now) The other abilities are bonuses that allow us to be unique and give us something to do other than auto attack and yawn. Personally I am excited there are more chances to play my class with precision.<br />
<br />
I understand this is only a start and there will be bugs but lord, think back a month when we were begging for these changes....well they are here! Go test and feedback on them but lord don't whine over them.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT concerning PVP: I have played on a PVP server, I feel for you but Verant/SOE has always stated they will never balance PVP in EQ. Its just not thier main concern :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ahh yes,<br />
<br />
I agree that openings need to be useful in PvP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ah Frodlin, Brutul himself states exactly why the tone is different between monks and warriors:<br />
<br />
&quot;The rest of that stuff is just icing on the cake. They could delete all of the combat abilities except provoke and we still got a pretty good deal in my book. Focusing on the opening stuff, which is the least important thing we got, is just chronic whining disease kicking in on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors are getting the improvements they sought. I think this is awesome.<br />
<br />
Monks on the other hand are only getting the icing on the cake. Brutul is right the could delete all of the combat abilities. And then that'd leave monks with a dodge from behind improvement, that is really a VERY suspect improvement based on the amount of dodging a person actually does.<br />
<br />
So far even with the icing on the cake, it's just a cupcake for monks.<br />
<br />
Hence the complaints. It IS still an internet message board, after all. Where complaining is the norm.<br />
<br />
Anyways, imo, the best thing I've read about from these changes is the mitigation boost. It's simple, and effective, and gets right to the heart of one of the warrior issues.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy to see this being instituted. I hope it works out as well as its being reported on thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not to hyjack the thread too much, but what exactly are the monks looking for? DPS improvement? Better pulling ability? I don't ever read the monk boards, so you're going to have to summarize it for me Wubao.<br />
<br />
  There is no doubt that warriors should NOT be whining about this. They took every type of idea we made and actually implemented SOMETHING along those lines. Something interesting (even if it's twitchy), increased mitigation, aggro at range, unhooked disciplines... All that remains is tuning it right, and we should be freakin' ecstatic that they're even giving us anything like this at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent post.<br />
<br />
Warriors wanted better mitigation<br />
Sony says ok sure, here you go<br />
<br />
Warriors wanted better aggro<br />
Sony says ok sure, here you go<br />
<br />
And they are giving you some dubious amount of utility also, that you admit, doesnt matter a dam bit. The reason? You got what you wanted with the first two points.<br />
<br />
Monks get the same dubious utility. Why do I say it is dubious? Because it is based upon twitch and randomness. This has been covered by many people so I won't go over it again. But this does not give us a role back. Monks have no  role right now other then being a rogue light.<br />
<br />
I hope you can see why monks have very valid complaints with what we have heard right now. So please, lay off the monks are whiners BS. Each class has people that scream blue murder no matter what the changes are, and warriors are no different.<br />
<br />
You want to hear less monk complaints? Lets hear about some added abilities monks will recieve that are not tied to openings.<br />
<br />
Monks want to have their pulling role returned?<br />
<br />
Sony says ok sure, and gives them 100 percent mem wipe useable at will, that has a high endurance cost. They also provide us with a pacify/lull ability that has a low endurance cost.<br />
<br />
It would take something like that to give monks close to bards for pulling. With Mez, and High Sun bards would still be better, but it would be debatable. <br />
<br />
If Sony came out and made it clear that they are going to help monks on the pulling front then you would see a lot more relaxed, and cheerfull monks.  Just like you see the same hopefull warriors right now.<br />
<br />
This is so clear to me I wonder how people cannot see it? Maybe it is because they are already getting what they want and do not give a dam what happens to other classes?<br />
<br />
Ssitth<br />
<br />
P.S. Do not feed me the dodge from behind BS, that will be nice, but does not address the real problems the monk class has.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I also want to go on record and state that the changes warriors are recieving are not only deserved, but over due. I am happy you guys are getting fixed. I just wish I saw the same clear intention for monks. As currently we have nothing to go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;but what exactly are the monks looking for? DPS improvement? Better pulling ability? &quot;<br />
<br />
First and foremost, monks by and large want an actual, recognize role in everquest.<br />
<br />
Not something where once monks say &quot;You know that nerfs our ability to pull&quot; you get five million people jumping and saying &quot;You weren't INTENDED to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nerfing feign splitting is all well and good, IF monks actually have a role to fall back on.<br />
<br />
They don't.<br />
<br />
So monks are looking for, from these enhancements, either DPS improvements to put them very competitive with the rest of the DPS classes ... or pulling role improvements to put them competitive with bards/enchanters/outdoor pullers ... or, simply a new role.<br />
<br />
Right now, the changes for the monks don't seem to address any of that.<br />
<br />
The dps improvements, because of how openings work, are very very low.<br />
<br />
There is no new role offered, yet. Or at least none anyone has been able to figure out. (I will admit if the &quot;throw&quot; works well and can be done on demand, we may actually have a role as a positioning class, but that really depends on how that one ability works).<br />
<br />
And our pulling improvement is being highly scrutinized right now as not being an improvement in that area.<br />
<br />
Warriors can look at the changes, as many have, and go yeah, that mitigation, that's an improvement like we asked for.<br />
<br />
That provoke ... that's an improvement like we asked for.<br />
<br />
Monks look at the changes and see openings for abilities that are laughable.<br />
<br />
Of course Absor would know this if he bothered to stop by &quot;Menstrual&quot; Business as Frodlin so lovingly calls it.<br />
<br />
But you know, he has the INTEGRITY of the game to worry about, and all.<br />
<br />
BTW ... why were servers brought down today Absor? Did it have anything to do with PLAT DUPING in such an integrity filled game?<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, don't misconstrue what I'm saying. I'm NOT complaining here. I am very happy about the changes on the warrior side of things. Someone just asked me about the monk changes, and I answered. I'm not whining. Just answering a question. Try not to jump on me for that. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zoriouz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">NO DOUBT! STHU! lol :P DOnt worry , be happy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bah I think the system is pretty decent, but i am tearing my eye's out with the linked abilities locking one another, and the horrid reuse timers.<br />
<br />
If they reduce the timers, and unlink the abilities i think i'd be sold.  Provoke rocks, i just can;t use it much.  If i used a offensive ability it would be even worse it would be locked for 8 min.  <br />
<br />
As it stands now i can;t even understand why people are somplaining about jump and the endurance bar.  My endurance bar is ALWAYS full because i can;t use any abilities to make it go under 90%.<br />
<br />
system just needs some tweaking . . . . well enough ranting back to test</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ssitth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For warriors it needs tweaking. For monks we have seen nothing that will fix our core problems. I know this is a warrior board, so I will leave it at that.<br />

<br />
<br />
ROFL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kraydak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">To hell with provoke, agro is a fucking SIDESHOW at the moment.  Is provoke nice?  Yes.  Is it useful?  Yes, heck, it would allow many warriors to move away from bows in the range slot.  Will it do anything to *fix* warriors?  Not even close.  Warriors have slid into the same position as monks: we NO LONGER HAVE a role (ok, we are better off than monks in that we can still point to a role and ask for it, I have no clue what should be done for monks, not a one at all).  We used to be the best tanks, then we were the best raid tanks.  Now, nothing.  Oh, we managed to keep up a good front for awhile, one of the more succesful swindles in EQ history.  But the lie has become too large to maintain.  The problems are so freaking much deeper than mere agro.  And the changes in test do *nothing* to adress the real problems.<br />
<br />
To see it in a different manner, lets define N to be the number of max melee rounds you can eat from a mob and survive.  If N is 0, you have no business tanking it because you will get 1 rounded.  If N is 1, then you NEED a CH landing after each and every melee round.  For *some* mobs things change at N=2, but by and large, its the same, you need a CH after every other melee round.  N=3 is the real transition, and N=4 you have entered the xp grind regime where AC and defensive skills actually mean something.  Or to put it differently, a PLed twink magician w/ defense and doge skills of  but 6k hp full buffed and an 11k warrior can both tank a 5.8k max round mob.  And they'll need exactly the same healing rotation.  In raid scenarios, the only difference between tanks that actually applies to healing required is increasing N.  Of course, for an N of 3 or higher you might as well run it as an N of three, because anyone can get scrap a 5 second CH rotation together.  And really only moving N from 0 to 1 will have much effect at the high levels because with todays raid sizes, a CH rotation timed to every mob melee round is close to trivial.<br />
<br />
To hell with knights, the whole tanking picture is FUBAR.  With 1 CH/melee round being easily obtained, all that matter for raid tanking is HP total, and only differences of the order of 30 or 50% (depending on whether you talk about the higher or the lower total) actually have a decent shot of making a difference.  With knights being a mere 1k behind warriors at best, it is impossible for devs to balance mobs to be able to 1 round knights and not warriors.  The expected variation in hp totals due to gear will swamp any reliable gab.<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think anyone on test atm will give us enough &quot;utility&quot; to match knights?  We sure don't have a functional tanking edge.  Doing so would require rebuilding warriors (and monks, and even rogues) from the ground up.  A simple add on like the current opening system doesn't even qualify as a bandaid.<br />
<br />
The damage interval multiplier reduction will also do approximately nothing.  We will still require *more* healing in an xp group situation (taking 4% less damage taken does not begin to compare to a semi-afk SK's lifetap buffs, much less a drunk paladin randomly hitting heals and giggling about it).  And as the above example showed and effective hp difference to actually make warriors better raid tanks has to be at least around 30%.  Four percent just isn't going to cut it (for an 11k tank, it amounts to a 500 hp buff, oh frabjous day), and 30% would require rebalancing all the mobs in EQ and would cause far too many problems (only warriors would be able to tank, which would cause problems of its own).  What we actually need to have happen is something like giving mobs a small (2ish percent) chance of landing a critical melee round agianst non-warriors: auto double attack/dual wield/flurry/rampage/hit/strikethrough and 1.5 times damage.  That would actually reduce knights to N=0 on many mobs WITHOUT completely screwing with game balance in the same way that capping the DI multiplier at 10 would (or allowing 10+ minute /def runs, or anything similar).  And it'd even help warriors in xp groups (non-VT level knights would think twice before tanking Krigers/LDoN assasinate mobs, for example).<br />
<br />
But yes, I do not think that the current changes on test can, even if done perfectly, actually balance anything.  It'll just serve as an excuse to do nothing with the core problems.  Sad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think unhooking disciplines helps us allot in the raid tanking department. Lead off with furious then move to defensive.<br />
<br />
I cant tell you how many times that would have saved me when the chain was fubared early and how much more attractive that makes a tank from a raid standpoint. Just an opnion but I love that change to disciplines, That with the 5% mitigation bonus really makes us standout raid tank wise.<br />
<br />
Maybe this isnt the golden platter some warriors wanted but its enough for me. If you step back and loot and everything a warrior can do now its allot more and the interactions really could be interesting.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Whether we like it or not I dont think SOE has any intent of making us an uber tank that utterly outranks the knights. Sorry I dont think its the vision anymore. For now we are just a tank class of a different flavor. Just an opnion. All of this to me is a result of the Kunark era. Notice Druids complained then they couldnt get groups as a healer or nuker , now they can do both well enough to be choosen, EQ has been levelled so no class is criticla for an exp group anymore.<br />
<br />
Hell I have done POE with no slower. I agree warriors where at one time the only wanted choice for tanks but thats just no longer the vision I see SOE taking as refleceted by thier deicsions.<br />
I honestly think thier goal is three equal but different tank classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">the entire concept of nintendo like &quot;openings&quot; is utter bullshit.<br />
<br />
Knights still need to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
However, Provoke is godlike, and the mitigation changes are a step in the right direction (a step that goes exactly half as far as it needs to).<br />
<br />
The best thing about the new system is how easily modifiable/exandable it is.  The current opening skills are not worth using, period.  But with them in place, it would be easy for the dev's to modify them into usefulness.<br />
<br />
However, with Knight lips working hungrily away on their cocks, (as evidenced by the fact that they have STILL not restored the 15% hp advantage to warriors).... I doubt this.</div></div><hr />

Kraydak, I suggest you actually go use the new abilites before you say they dont do anything to help warriors. I've used them. granted only with a level 25 but I find they help a lot, provoke is a nice ranged agro, headbash, its a nice stun. The increase in mitigation, will help with tanking raid level mobs, which is exactly what its designed to do, making warriors the obivoius choice again for tanking raid level mobs and just to quiet the fears of paladins being nerfed, the 5% does nothing for xp level mobs, where all three plate tanks can enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />

The increase in mitigation, will help with tanking raid level mobs, which is exactly what its designed to do, making warriors the obivoius choice again for tanking raid level mobs and just to quiet the fears of paladins being nerfed, the 5% does nothing for xp level mobs, where all three plate tanks can enjoy the game.  <br />
<br />
Provoke looks very nice!  It really does and I want it alot (freaking passing on stupid range slot items because I love pulling and hence need a bow, and needing to worry about the ghoulish ancille pouch thingy or whatever its name is....).  That doesn't change the fact that it won't actually affect class balance in the same way that having given melees the ability to self bind way back when it might have mattered wouldn't have affected class balance.  It is periphial.  I'm not saying that it wouldn't be a good thing, just that from a *balance* point of view its a fix in search of a problem.<br />
<br />
After all these changes go in, unless something HUGE has been hidden, guilds will still have paladins and SKs tank Quarm (and every other mob in EQ, as it happens).  The numbers just don't allow for anything else.  The difference in damage taken has to be freaking huge as I showed before.  But  constant effects that produce a large enough variation will flat out break the game.<br />
<br />
Exp grind groups will still take pallies and sks over warriors because *they take less healing, even ignoring better agro control, or any actual utility*.  I like toys as much as the next guy, but these changes are mere playthings and that aren't going to cut it any more.  I just want a role in EQ beyond waiting tables in the PoK cafe (the pay stinks, for one thing).  The utility granted by RNG dependant purely combat abilities that (at the the moment) come up about as often as a knight can cast equivalent spells, w/o KEI, bardsong, AAs or FT, isn't going to make up for the fact that in many respects we tank worse than said knights and the number of mobs that we tank better can be counted on the fingers of a festering pile of goo's hand.  I wish I was as excited as you but, if this is all we are getting, I predict a massive general surge is dissapointment ending with a standdown by mid January.  Of course, when we try this again all the knights will say that we were already fixed, and SoE will be able to claim the same. *shrug* I'd love being wrong, but I really, really, really don't think I am.<br />
<br />
Poor monks, getting their hopes up about being pullers again, when everyone has stopped using them, and have no reason to return to them.  You see, every pull in EQ can be done with a non-monk.  We've seen it done. Monks only bring mediocre DPS to the table, and might start bringing acceptable pulling again, so everyone will keep hoping for a bard puller, or an enchanter, or an SK, or any other actually useful class that can do the same pulling job, and more besides.  Maybe monks will be able to compete with them ON PULLS again, but they won't be able to anywhere else.  Joy and rapture.<br />

<br />
Honestly, I think the changes are nice however.  <br />
<br />
This system DOES allow for a hugely noticeable flexibility in melee.<br />
<br />
I don;t approve personally of twitchy gameplay.  <br />
<br />
I play UT2k3, that's about all I can stomach of twitch. <br />
<br />
I'd love to see SoE make all, yes ALL, of the combat abilities available at will with a cost of endurance.<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, provoke is amazing, but once a battle sucks.  Let's us click it till our little arm falls off, or our endurance goes, whichever comes first.<br />
<br />
I think a cost of 1/3rd-ish of the bar to a normal warrior is good. <br />
<br />
With tier 3 gear the number raises to 1/5th.<br />
<br />
EP 1/7th.<br />
<br />
Time + (future expansions, if we EVER see another raiding expansion) 1/10th +<br />
<br />
<br />
That doesn't seem unbalancing to me.  It gives us on par aggro with pally SK, less healing is required for them if they are using their spells of healing or lifetap.  But more if they are using pure aggro spells.  Their utility still gives them grps, and ours (with the combat abilities open at any time) will give us our own.<br />
<br />
This doesn't seem unreasonable to me, it seems perfectly balanced, but for me to test it, I'd have to have a 65 char, which I won't be able to have with the changes on, till the 16th.<br />
<br />
So, untill then, all of this is pointless, other than giving us a little bit clearer picture of just WHAT to pray for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">can someone detail how the disc's, provoke skill and opening abilities intermesh?<br />
<br />
Theres a pool of abilities. In them are our discs, along with some new skills (headbash provoke etc). The discs are on a timer but the others can't be used until you get one of a few opening types (offensive, defensive, special, skill, etc) Some of the abilities are in more than one category. Provoke is like a disc, on a 30second timer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You miss the underlying significance.<br />
<br />
For monks returning to the pulling arena, it's many YEARS of pulling skill versus barely one year of PoP pulling that the other classes have had to do.<br />
<br />
Monks only wanted to be at the table again. We'll let skill figure out the rest.<br />
<br />
Considering most of the other classes spent their early formative EQ levels and years doing OTHER jobs ... the chips will eventually fall in favor of many monks, who find their old slippers are still very comfortable.<br />
<br />
Sharing the pulling role is fine with many monks. What prevented this from being a reality, though, was that monks were limited and the other classes weren't.<br />
<br />
Balance.<br />
<br />
Even playing field.<br />
<br />
Now we can go out and play.<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw ... my mediocre DPS ... doesn't rely on spells like an SK's mediocre DPS. <br />
<br />
Is a great thing in a dungeon.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
EDIT: And yes, it's pretty rare I show enthusiasm for something. This change though, it's worth showing some enthusiasm for. It's a real, palpable, skill change, ENHANCEMENT that will affect my gameplay in EQ in a positive way if it goes live PROPERLY.</div></div><hr />

Utility - we have utility tanks they are called pally's and sk's.  They dont bother utilizing most of these utility abilities.  So why push thier job onto us.

<br />
I'm confused.<br />
<br />
Provoke, and it's higher level upgrades aren't a boost in taunt?<br />
<br />
And the mitigation change isn't a difference in the level of mitigation?<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a joke, we gain agro cause we called some mob an SoB?? Agro from range isnt our job, that's for the utility tank&quot;<br />
<br />
Uhm ... taunting a mob, is basically calling it names too. You wanted a boost in taunt? You got a boost in aggro generation, in the form of a new ability. It's superior to taunt in that it is pure hate added. It is superior to taunt in that it can be used at range.<br />
<br />
Many people complained that they couldn't compete with the utility tanks because they had aggro at will, from a ranged spell.<br />
<br />
Provoke provides the warriors with a comprable skill. Aggro at will, from a ranged skill.<br />
<br />
What's the problem here?<br />
<br />
&quot;This clearly shows that SoE's way of &quot;fixing&quot; warriors was jsut to make them more hybrid like...we never asked for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Many MANY people here asked to be able to tank and aggro LIKE A HYBRID.<br />
<br />
So they went and did that.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">This was not intended a flame, but a different view on your points that you probably don't take into account.  However, it did turn slightly into one, I think.<br />
<br />
All the warrior class needed to restore ballance was 2 things, a boost in taunt and  a SIGNIFICANT difference the level of midigation/hp(aka ability to take the beating once we got the agro).<br />
And what happens after you get that, and then all classes get upgraded yet again?  You fall right back behind the curve that you never really met in the first place.  Warriors pretty much reach bot status continuing the way they were.<br />
<br />
What they did was toss out a long list of stuff to make us think we was getting something when we aint.  And I suppose giving warriors the ability to use a discipline OTHER than Defensive is a &quot;bad thing&quot;?  I suppose creating a system where pure melee can actually receive UPGRADES other than equipment is a bad thing?  I suppose giving warriors the ability to actually generate hate on demand is a bad thing?<br />
<br />
This clearly shows that SoE's way of &quot;fixing&quot; warriors was jsut to make them more hybrid like...  What were you expecting, the ability to solo gods using a form of kick?  They gave warriors abilities to use in addition to normal melee. Instant-use abilities with no &quot;fizzle&quot; check aren't exactly turning you into hybrids.  You aren't casting anything.  They gave you abilities, and they used the spell system to do it.  Technically they're not even doing that, it's more along the lines of the AA system.<br />
<br />
At least hybrid classes get spells to regen their version of endurance and they can cast at will, dont have to depend on random number generatior to toss them an &quot;oppurtunity&quot;.  Disciplines and Provoke...even casters have re-use timers.  Would you feel better if they gave casters three different lines of spells + bard song for you to regen the little amount of Endurance you'll be using?<br />
<br />
And i am assuming since our version of &quot;spells&quot; are being considered skills there is a chance for falure Provoke was made Unresistable, and there are many self-only abilities which have no chance to fail.  No fizzles either.  Enjoy.<br />
<br />
Provoke - This is a joke, we gain agro cause we called some mob an SoB?? Agro from range isnt our job, that's for the utility tank(pally/sk).    Your job and abilities are changing.  And Provoke makes exactly as much sense as a freaking god (supposedly a powerful, all-knowing being) agroing on a Paladin who just cast a spell that has no chance in hell of affecting them.  It's called suspension of belief, and it's a cornerstone of not only games, but fantasy.  If Paladins can do that to a god, then shouting at a mob to get it's attention makes about as much sense.<br />
<br />
DPS - Dps aint our job, we take the beating so others dont, dps is for rogue/monk/mage ect.  If you're not tanking, you better believe your job is DPS.  What do you think the enchanter does when there's a better slower, and no mobs can be mezzed?  They nuke.</div></div><hr />

A few are bugged right now in locking out others. The timers get crossed. Like using spirit of rage will lock you out from using ANYTHING for 10 minutes currently, but it's not intended.<br />

<br />
Well what i was expecting was that SoE would screw this up, and i have to say i was wrong, it's far worse. And no i didnt expect to kick a god to death, but i did HOPE(again never expected SoE to do this) that somehow this would atcually make my class desirable for a MT position over a half-warrior half something else. I know hybrids seem to like it, but that;s cause they where afraid they would lose their current ability to gain push button agro lock at will AND the same(sorry 4% dif is close to meaningless) ability to take the damage.  The rest of this is fluf, nothing more.  Pally's still get the best of both worlds, warriors are still underpowered to do the only job they where ever designed to do.  That was the whole issue before, this new system dont change that.  I wasnt delusional enough to expect that 5 expanstions of slowly advancing hybrids to their current overpowered state would be fixed in a single patch, i never dreamed they would take this aproach.<br />
<br />
Honestly i think this agro lock is BS, NO class should have it, but SoE seems unwilling to change that.  Some say nerf pally's is the answer, but nerf is the WRONG word, more like reset them to a resonable lvl, if you have your heater set at 95 and turn it down to 72 it aint a nerf, it is just moving it to where it should ahve been set in the first place.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Provoke, and it's higher level upgrades aren't a boost in taunt? &lt;--still dont even come close to the amount of agro generated for any of the what is it 8 different stunns pally's can do, festering darkness and some kinda vortex thing sk's can do. And pally/sk dont have 30 sec timers on them, and with kei you can even with out medding between fights cast w/o concern of mana preservation no matter how much ya cast em.  Also if ya do fizzle, you can recast IMEDIATLY btw. And agro from range wasnt really a big issue with me, i felt(and still do) fell that is more approperatly left to casters.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;And the mitigation change isn't a difference in the level of mitigation?&quot;&quot;  &lt;--- 4% isnt much of an upgrade<br />
<br />
<br />
And Kaesorn, please feel free to quote me at any time, but please dont just pick out single lines, quote all that pertain to that topic, you just picked out single lines which made it look like i was saying something totally different than i intended. <br />
<br />
Did you ever stop to think that if you had to upgrade warriors so far to give them a significant difference in hp/midigation create true ballance(extra hp/midigatin as a trade off to all the other stuff pallys/sk's get)  that it would trivilize  certain aspects of the game, that maybe(god forbid i dare say it) that the problem lies with these hybrid classes being overpowered, and that is the issue that should be delt with??</div></div><hr />

It's the level 20 version of the ability. Let's wait and see what the highest level version is like before we go comparing ourselves to paladins again. Would that be so hard? To wait a day or two and see what shakes loose?<br />
<br />
&quot;Also if ya do fizzle, you can recast IMEDIATLY btw.&quot;<br />

<br />
At range or not at range, it's pure added hate. It boosts your ability to generate aggro. It enhances your character in an attempt to level the playing field between warriors and hybrids. What's wrong with that? <br />
<br />
&quot;4% isnt much of an upgrade&quot;<br />
<br />
All a matter of perspective. But bottom line is ... it's an UPGRADE. Now warriors take LESS damage, bar none, undisputably, no contest ... LESS damage than paladins and knights.<br />
<br />
&quot;that it would trivilize certain aspects of the game&quot;<br />

Bad choice for SK spells, Festering darkness is a level 61 spell with a 175 mana cost. Even with KEI 14 mana FT15 and MC3, 32 mana a tic, it's will 5.4 tics in order to replace that mana spent, that 30-36 second to get the spent mana back. If relaying on this spell for aggro the SK will not beable to keep up with the mana cost of this spell if they have to cast more then once ever 30 seconds. The aggro on that spell isn't high enough to let you hold aggro lock casting once every 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
If by &quot;some kinda vortex thing&quot; you mean shadow vortex, They nerf that spell to almost no aggro at all over a year ago back before they added terror spells to game.<br />

It's a sad state of affairs that we now have warriors whose only goal in life is getting someone else nerfed to hell. Personally, I would rather we get upwardly balanced with other classes instead of ripping the guts out of another class. I don't want to see another class get reamed like the monks did.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Buffing up Warrior mitigation, the baseline class where any encounter that does significant melee damage (like 99% of them), is the same as nerfing the other 14.  They might not go back and tune Plane of Time but you can bet that they will remember to have everything hit 4% harder in the expansion.  There was no indication that we're ever supposed to have more than about 10% more HP than Knights (elemental items reflect this trend) and 4% mitigation gives us the advantage we lost due to itemization in Time, and for those who are not there it's a freebie 4% you got (which btw is about the same as the effect of Planar Durability 3).  If anything taking 4% less damage is almost always better than having 4% more HPs for purposes of tanking.  <br />
<br />
The funny thing is that if instead of just giving Warriors 4% more mitigation they made a new AA that's warrior only called Enhanced Planar Durability that gives 1.5% HP per 3 AAs for 3 levels, most of you would probably think it's a great deal.<br />

<br />
Damned if I can figure out whether you are arguing for or against nerfing knights.<br />
<br />
The problem with this is that there are two ways to look at the problem, PvP and PvE (and no, I'm not talking about player vs player combat).  Since the vast, unimaginably dominant bulk of EQ is PvE, that balance is what matters most.  From that perspective, Knights (who can tank anything) are brokenly powerful.  Who *cares* if (and what I've seen to far if vastly insufficient) warriors/monks get balanced from a PvP standpoint?  All it will do is provide us with extra *unused* capacity.  So we can tank better but, you see, we ALREADY could tank everything in the game.  Who freaking cares if we can suddenly tank it any better?  What we need is knights *not* being able to also tank everything in the game and do more on the side (anyone who thinks the opening system is going to provide us with knight level utility... has some serious congnitive issues).  Of course, they could (they aren't at the moment, but we could dream) buff us up to the point where the amount of healing warriors need on mobs drops by a factor of two or so.  With that kind of differential, people might even start asking warriors to tank again, but PvE balance would have been broken badly yet again.  To fix that you could buff up mobs massively, but why take the roundabout route, and all but guarantee breaking huge amounts of stuff when you could just simply nerf knights?  Same end result, but nerfage follows the KISS principle, which the devs have showed themselves in deep, desperate need of respecting.<br />
<br />
While I will confess to not having been vocal about it, I *never* asked for warriors to get buffed because I *never* believed that would actually fix anything.  I always asked for knights to get nerfed (but, since asking for nerfs is not a polite thing to do, I've been quiet about it).  I feel completely justified in complaining about the new system.  If Wubao is happy about the monk changes, more power to him, but I could counter years of monk pulling experience with being out of practice for a full year, and monks still having fewer pulling tools even after the changes.<br />
<br />
While some of you might look at the changes and see the devs paying attention to our woes, I look at them and see the devs having completely missed the point (or being unwilling to adress it).  Those of you who are optimistic might be right, but I'm willing to put my whopping whole 20k plat current bank balance behind my worries and bet that the changes, as they are now, will be recognized as insufficient by mid-January (I'm on Bertox).<br />

Only 3 classes got &quot;left-out&quot; of upgrades since Velious. Vengeance does nothing like what Focus and FT items do. Should we nerf every other class to be like us, or should we be upgraded to match them? Do you honestly think it's right to nerf all the other classes who got advances on par with the expansion?

I most certainly do think so.  You see, I don't think its possible to upgrade warriors or monks enough with changing them into completely different classes (giving them a *full* spellbook, for one thing).  If thats the route that SoE decides to go, then they cannot afford to pull any punches (the opening system really won't suffice as currently done).  PCs are already so powerful compared to the environment that buffing them up more won't affect intraclass balance unless completely new roles are added.  EQ roles are largely a binary can you/can't you question.  Warriors at least already can fulfil their role (tanks) its just that so can other people and they have more besides.  WARRIORS ARE BALANCED WITH RESPECT TO THE ENVIRONMENT (if anything, we are already overpowered in that we don't need to use all our tools to tank, resulting in single tanking raid mobs instead of tank switches for /def purposes).  Its the balance WITH RESPECT TO OTHER CLASSES that needs to be looked at.  They bring everything we do and more to the table.  Buffing warriors will not change the fact that others can compete succesfully with us in our primary role (and in the secondary secondary role of DPS).  Is this really that complicated a concept?  If you agree with me on this, then the simplest fix is a direct nerf, the only other one is a generic buff of the environment which carries its own problems and complications.<br />
<br />
So yeah, nerf knights.  Please.<br />

I noticed.<br />
<br />
The dodge thing is still suspect. Dodge doesn't fire that often normally. So it may or may not be of much use. I have a positive outlook on this however, and am thinking MAYBE, along with the dodge from behind thing, there could be a hidden side-effect, one that actually helps. Monk AC could end up being the same from all angles because of how this change gets coded. Which means it could reduce stuns, due to the fact that max hits from behind, with &quot;from behind AC&quot; being what it is, usually means getting STUNNED. But by changing &quot;from behind AC&quot; to monks by giving them 360 degrees of dodge ... well I'm HOPING it reduces stuns from behind. My ultimate goal. Because that will help pulling.<br />
<br />
The lull thing ... that's awesome. Very awesome. <br />
<br />
The new AA, I'm not sure about.<br />
<br />
It COULD be an SK AA, or a Necro AA. (Meaning they finally get  a hot keyed FD, like they've wanted for awhile).<br />
<br />
So, it may not even be a monk AA yet. I dunno.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm keeping an abnormally positive outlook on things for now.<br />
<br />
A triggered, non-opening related ability that I can use to enhancme my pulling? That's a godsend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Kraydak is correct to an extent, but simply nerfing a class here and there won't balance the game either.  SOE needs to completely revamp how the game works in many major areas including AA, itemization, mana regen, armor mitigation by type rather than just AC and slow all need to be changed for the game to stand a chance of ever being balanced.  No way its going to happen though.  After the changes you will want a warrior tank until a knight can tank a mob and a knight tank until a dps hybrid can tank it.  The system itself is broken not just the classes.</div></div><hr />

No. You are entirely wrong on this point. Warriors single tanking mobs is inevitable.  PoP is just old content that happens to be as far as SOE has been willing to progress.</div></div><hr />

Is it overpowered compared to us pre-patch currently? yes, but the better solution is to help us be better in comparison to knights. Nerfing knights only generates a load of BS. <br />
Just look at monks, they are still pissed, and rightly so, about their mitigation nerf, especially in light of the itemization changes and such since that nerf. Even warriors will now be getting a 5% mitigation INCREASE. Personally, I think the monk mitigation nerf is no longer truly beneficial to anyone, and should be removed from the game.</div></div><hr />

Why bother asking if a warrior quested this skill when you can get a pally and avoid the hassle or the lies. Yesterday I did a very limited study of warriors getting groups over pallys. 5 warriors lfg for over an hour no pallys lfg for more than 5 minutes. One logged in, one got group as I tracked where they went. In one case a pally travelled from bazaar to BB where I was lfg and walked right past me to join a group. This is pure BS that a group would actually wait 10 mins for a Pally instead of getting a war that was in the same zone.<br />
     As far as I'm concerned, if there is some bullshit questing or rare drop crap to get skills to get us even close to them I will quit my account even after 4 plus years. I'm sick of LFG and I am tired of starting groups with people who are uneasy at best about grouping with warriors. I have played over 100 days and the last thing I need is something more to quest for. I have paid my dues. The devs need to realize that there are MUCH more warriors than paladins and having the minority picked over the majority is crap considering we all made a conscious decision to play the character that was deemed to be the superior tank. If, after the patch, the masses agree that the effect of the new warrior is minimal, then I hope that the majority thins to the point of the minority in paying customers. I refuse to pay whatever the fuck amount I'm paying to LFG every night.<br />
         One more thing. Does anyone think we really need another class? With utility spread so thin as it is over the 12 or 13 classes why in the hell would anyone even dream of inventing a new class??? They made it so easy to level up now that yet another overpowered class is the LAST thing we need.<br />
