<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well guys my guild will be moving into Ssraeshza Temple on Friday.  Too bad I'll be at a basketball tournament.  Oh well I have a few questions about it.  First off I'm only level 49 atm so I already know I can't go yet.  However at what level should I expect to get before I'll get to go, I'm asking this because nobody in the guild know's just yet.  <br />
<br />
Also what kinda drops will I be seeing? All I can think of atm are Windspeeder and That Strands of Corrupted Mana thing.  <br />
<br />
Sorry guys this may not mean much to some of you but I was personally fired up when I read we'll be moving in there soon.<br />
<br />
Later all, Akamek</div></div><hr />

&quot;Where will you spend eternity?&quot;<br />

Know it, learn it, hate it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ssra .... haven for tracker bots, and farmers alike.<br />
<br />
Remember those boring raids in HoT, when you sat in one spot for 3 hours pulling mob after mob for a few armor drops .... well ... that was your first taste of a true farm.   In Ssra, you sit in one spot for 8-10 hours, and dont move, for maybe 5 quest peices, and a chance at a rare drop key (we have 11 of each in our guild, and it took us 5 months non stop farming to get em), needed to access 3 of the 5 named mobs worth killing.<br />
<br />
Or you log on your tracker bot, tell your guild Ssra_Named_04 is up, we should come kill it .... to realize, that Local_Ssra_Farm_Guild_01 just killed your mob, and has moved on to the next one in line.<br />
<br />
Ssra means Emp key farming, Ssra means VT shard farming, Ssra also means the next step up the ladder as a raid guild.<br />
<br />
Once you get there, you will hate it, loathe it, and never wanna go back again.<br />
<br />
Do ssra as fast as you can, and get the hell out, or you will all go nutz just like me ....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/shrug , if there is one thing I am grateful to Ssra for, its that it was the zone that finally got me to kick this habit :).<br />
<br />
Honestly whoever designed that thinking it would be fun, needs to have his head examined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your guild is going to start killing the named in ssra then I think you will need to get up to at least 60th before you are of much help.  This is true for most raid targets though as a warrior.  Unless you are 60-65 you aren't gonna tank anything and you wont be doing much dps either.</div></div><hr />
