<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khsutep-karana</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok im trying to figure this out before I go any higher. Its been pretty fun until now but palys SKs and rangers are drivin me nuts.... <br />
<br />
<br />
I like to think im doing a pretty good job.... just over 5k6 HP totally buffed up the wazoo. 1280AC.... and im going to ding level 60 in a few minutes here. <br />
<br />
BUT we have this damn paly come along and whine about how he has 5k6hp and 1k3ac partially buffed... im thinking WTF. Until this jackass comes along im doing a pretty fine job of tanking in POV. What makes it even worse is this paly is a Frenchie. /sigh<br />
<br />
Is it going to even be worth it to level any higher than I am right now? At the moment it seems pointless to try because I could make a paly or sk and tank just as good.... PLUS I would then have no agro problems.... ALSO the LDON &quot;Royal attendant BP of Uberness&quot; (as I saw refered to here on this forum somewhere).... is basically tailored to ManaTanks. WTF is the point - Im getting the impression that I would be of more use as a paly but I have grown to hate the assholes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Any advice at all?</div></div><hr />

No one can answer that question for you.  You have to make that decision for yourself.  If you enjoy playing a warrior than level him up if you don't than move on but the decision is yours to make.</div></div><hr />

it's worth it; although for hunting i pretty much only hunt with guildmates and they know i'm a n00b and we work out great.<br />

Just looked at yoru magelo, I would have thought that as a warrior you would want to go for HP AA first, instead of PP or PB...:)</div></div><hr />

And since there is not that much people on sebilis i assume that there is still many french player on karana</div></div><hr />

ALSO the LDON &quot;Royal attendant BP of Uberness&quot; (as I saw refered to here on this forum somewhere).... is basically tailored to ManaTanks. <br />
<br />
What cares about that bp?  Me, I'm gunning for an ornate one.  Bit less ac, better hp (once you slap a 40 hp aug on it), better effect.  However, if you do want to compare the armors, there's at least one bright side to it from a warrior perspective.  They have to choose from a lot more crap for the type 3 slots.  While we've got a smaller list.  So at least there's some cost to them...it's one area where they don't get casting and melee power handed to 'em on equal amounts to both parent classes.<br />
<br />
Any advice at all?[/B]<br />
<br />
Play what you enjoy.  Me, I love my warrior.  She's cute and effeciently sized and she kicks butt.  She's about your level, 58 right now.  <br />
<br />
Does she have problems?  Yah, getting that initial aggro sort of sucks.  When there's a big train, well, don't have AE taunt yet, so I feel a bit optionless, especially when I'm used to playing an enchanter.  And because I'm a gnome with all initial points into dex and follow Brell instead of Rallos, well, my hp isn't what it could be.  <br />
<br />
But on the opposite side, I've got good aggro weapons (the droga ones), a good 2-h (windblade), backed up with my dex, which is further augmented by a 30 point self dex buff.  My hp is improving with sta augs and the acquisition of more ornate.  And I'm salivating at the thought of Anger III procs on my weapons.  I love defensive, makes tanking nameds a snap.  I'm also prone to exclaiming &quot;go, go gadget gnome!&quot;...I can buff my dex by 30 which stacks with non-garou/ndt dex buffs, buff my str by 50 (55?  cobalt boots +30 from clockwork observer), 40% spell haste, 30% spell haste (the 40% one takes recharging), slow, SoW, snare, and a few other things.<br />
<br />
If there's a knight in the group that's well equipt, I'm willing to let them tank.  I recognize the snap aggro they can attain and, besides that, I do more melee damage.  So letting me clobber from the back is better than letting them pansies do it.  Likewise, it frees me up to assist in CC a bit.  A quick taunt and I can pull a mob off the chanter or cleric, without doing damage to the mob.  And sometimes for fun I crank up my dex, wield my aggro weapons, and let my weapons pull aggro off the knights.  And then they ask if I'm using taunt and I say &quot;no.&quot;  And that surprises them, hehe.  For a tough mob, well, then we can do the old hand off trick, where they build up lots of early aggro and I take it from there.<br />
<br />
When I do tank, I try to do the things a good tank does.  I position the mob nicely, keep pets and the clueless players at it's back.  I use taunt as needed, not mash it.  I do my best to encourage others to play up to my strengths, not my weaknesses.  That means, for instance, nukes from the group, not DoTs, because it's 1 taunt to recover aggro from a nuke, but the next tick of a DoT will take it away again.<br />
<br />
Basically, I rock.  I undo some of the damage done to the warrior reputation by others.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there's a few things I hope they do to improve warriors, but I consider them tweaks more than anything else.<br />
<br />
1.  20 hp augs that go in the same slots as the 20 hp/mana ones, but cost less points.<br />
<br />
2.  A revamp of disciplines:  I want them turned into 0 cost AAs.  That'll seperate their timers, give nice buttons to use to use 'em, and provide a nice window where you can see what they do, which are up, and when you get them, as opposed to the current crappy /discipline.  The downside would be a static reuse time that doesn't decrease as you level.  That hurts defensive/evasive, but since you have both available, having the reuse time be 2x what it is currently at 60 wouldn't be a big deal.  Would increase the diversity of what we can do and add a bit more fun spam.<br />
<br />
3.  Sense Heading removed completely from the game.  If it's going to start at 200, it's pointless to have the skill.  Just make the compass work right all the time, always give us arrows on the map, and add a /heading command.  Then use that sense heading skill slot to give us warriors Intimidate.  Sounds like a useless skill, sure, unless you're familiar with it.  Against pre-55 mobs, it makes solo'ing a bit easier.  Against 56+ mobs, well, they are fear immune, but fear is good aggro.  That's where the skill would really pay off.<br />
<br />
But, anyway, I love my warrior for what she can do.  I enjoy her more than my paladin.  He's useful, but not as much fun.<br />
<br />
And so that's my advice, if you love your warrior, play him to the best of your abilities.  Do what you can to offset your weaknesses.  And since you can't rely on cheesy spells to make up for incompetence, be competent.</div></div><hr />

i heard karana server is quite french; or was that povar?  <br />
<br />
Solusek has quite a bit of Euros.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another funny tidbit is that in the Japanese manual, on the server selection, instead of &quot;Choose the name of your server&quot;, it says, &quot;Choose The Nameless as your server&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda makes you think :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway play the warrior if you like it, as everyone else said. I enjoy the warrior class more than any other class in the game, and i've tried them all. Different people feel the same about their classes - just have fun. It's a game afterall and there's no wrong decision, just wrong reasons for making it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can understand exactly how the thread-starter feels.<br />
<br />
I stopped for 6 mths and now that I am back, I suddenly feel that I am sorely lacking in both the DPS and the tanking departments.<br />
<br />
My best friend plays a 65 Pally, and with CA3/LR5, CS3/ID5, ND3 he does a much better job at tanking than I do, since I currently only have CA3/LR1, CS3/ID0, ND0.<br />
<br />
However, we do have a lot of fun together. Sometimes he'll tank, sometimes I'll tank. Or he'll MT on most grinds and I add-tank on adds.<br />
<br />
I'm a hairs-breath away from 7k hp and 1.4k AC fully buffed (need a lot of eqpt work here hehe), but we all agreed that once I got my LR5, ID5 and ND3, I'll prolly be tanking more than him.<br />
<br />
Just ask yourself what it is that you enjoy about playing a Warrior. Is it because you want to be the main-MT in most situations? Is it because of the plethora of weapons available to you (1H, 2H, Pierce etc)? Is it because you hate to have to wrangle with spells while in battle? Or are you looking for that one, uber class that soars above the rest (doesn't exist IMO)?<br />
<br />
Shrug, if you really feel totally disgruntled about your Warrior, then by all means, start a Pally or SK. But don't be hating if suddenly Pallys or SKs get some nerf or somesuch (of course, then you could play back your Warrior, just that he would be at 60).</div></div><hr />
