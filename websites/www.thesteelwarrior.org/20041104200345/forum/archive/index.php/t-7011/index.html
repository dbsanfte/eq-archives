<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fattyvolump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have quit EQ for about 4 months now but i recently activated my account again and started to play my level 48 warrior, so far i have been abel to get him a Fabled Exe axe but other than that he is almost completely naked so i was wondering if anyone knows of some decent armor i might be abel to loot. Or possibly buy for very cheap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ah, what do you mean by naked?<br />
Generally, go to the bazaar, search by slot/pp you have/AC and your race/religion, and buy the biggest bang for your buck. I'd say buying armor that way is your cheapest bet pre-cultural. You can also look around the merchants near forges in PoK to see if any LDoN smithed armor is there if that would be an upgrade for you (can well be cheaper than crafted/crusty).<br />
If you're already at that AC range (hard to tell what someone means by &quot;naked&quot; any more), then you can look in the bazaar as noted above.<br />
Eventually you can check out the recipes for cultural armor on eqtraders, make friends with a smith, and offer to get all the materials for cultural armor pieces (that's probably the cheapest way to get cultural).<br />
And: start doing lots and lots of LDoN adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattyvolump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I mean naked as in i dont even have newbie armor in most of my equipment slots. And the problem is when i quit i didnt have much money on me so now i still have a very little amount of money. And i do not have LDoN yet so i cannot do the adventures for armor. And i am Agnostic so im not sure what there is for culture but im pretty sure i cant afford it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">check the bazaar for crafted and crustacean, should be cheap.  You should be able to quest crafted yourself at 48 even with a severe gear deficit.<br />
<br />
Pick up some hp jewelery while you are at it - velium fire wedding rings, electrum black sapphire earrings - should be pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm.<br />
I'd still go to the bazaar and search by slot/AC/WAR/pp that you have.<br />
Sadly, although you can quest the non-gem parts of crafted, finding the gems anywhere other than on merchants might be difficult. And that's a problem because the gems will cost you more than the finished armor itself in the bazaar. At least, that's the way it is on my server. Certainly, you'll find LDoN smithed armor on merchants in PoK for less than or about the same as the gem cost of crafted.<br />
An unequipt 48 warrior doesn't have a lot of options for making plat, but plat is what you are going to need. So, what I'd do is go to East K and slaughter every lion and spider you see. Tailors need the silk and smiths and tailors need any Low quality, medium quality and High quality *pelts* (not hides; not ruined pelts--those are vendor trash; the only other hide you have to worry about from lions is a high quality hide, which drops very rarely and only from Highland lions in North K--but it's worth several hundred plat to fletchers). Rockhoppers and silkworms on the Luclin also drop silks and hides which are of interest to smiths, so you can hunt there too.<br />
Once you get a few stacks of silk and various hides, go into trader mode in the bazaar, setting a competitive price for them for your server.<br />
This is not the only way for a 48 warrior to make pp, but it is faily low risk and steady.<br />
If you have or can find a partner or two, you might try camping the grimling cave in Ten. Mountains. That's considerably more dangerous, but you can make some plat doing it. Right outside the cave is also the haunt (spawn point?) of the &quot;grimling runner&quot; who drops a pouch that is the &quot;rare&quot; part of the rallic pack quest. A very marginally equipt 48 war might need some help completing that quest, but if you have a partner or partners at the grimling cave, you all can work that out. <br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
