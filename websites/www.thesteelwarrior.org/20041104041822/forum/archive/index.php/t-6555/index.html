<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zordian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks.. <br />
<br />
Currently using SoD with Anger 3 in Primary.  After reading the SBoD topic.. it got me to wondering if I should give up my Obsidian Scimitar of War with Anger 2 and it's lovely HP stats for a Greatblade of Storms or Copper hammer in order to get better aggro.  I know our primary goal is aggro.. so I thought it was worth asking.  let me know.. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GBoS is probably overall better than the OSoW for aggro, and the stats arent all that different.  Not sure I'd ditch it for CHoS though.  Debuffs aren't as good as stuns for aggro, but they're still good aggro, and OSoW has an increased proc rate.  Tough call on that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GBoS seems like a lot better agro than a CHoS.  I have used both so I would agree with Beornegar on not swapping out a OSoW for a CHoS.  I don't have a OSoW but people who mainhand OSoW don't usually take my agro on raids and I mainhand a GBoS so I think it is a lot more agro based on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taggen_of_Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when MT'ing I would use the SoD and GBoS and use the OSoW as part of your DPS combo, just wipe the ang2 aug offa it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use OSoW primary with a2 aug, and would not replace it with a GBoS with a2 if it were free. The OSoW's innate proc is enough aggro that, when used with incite, will pull aggro after a slow. (I've tested this many time duo with my shammy). It's been parsed that slows are ~700 aggro, incite is 400 aggro... so that leads me to believe the OSoW proc is right around 350ish. The GBoS proc is pretty commonly accepted at around 400 hate, so I think the increased proc rate (and the dead segzy look) make the OSoW just as good as, if not better than, the GBoS. Both procs are enough to pull aggro off pretty much anyone combined with incite, so again, the increased proc rate is nice. The only downside is that since its a debuff, the 30dd portion cannot be crit'ed =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont forget OSoW has a 25percent greater proc rate then most weapons. So that 350 anger is really like 425 or more over time. Also I think it might be more then 350 but there is no way to really tell.<br />
<br />
I mainhand the OSoW with A3 and offhand the BoC with A3, and have WA5....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Teldarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I weild GBoS in main and OSoW in offhand atm, and it seems to work just fine for agro.</div></div><hr />
