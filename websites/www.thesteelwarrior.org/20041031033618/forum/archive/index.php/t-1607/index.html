Comes from revamped Droga, which is only live on stormhammer atm but will probably go to all servers soon.  Very nice aggro weapon, kind of a mini-BBotE, and the stun works up to level 65 so you have a chance to interrupt casters in PoP with it.  Pretty good considering it's droppable and obtainable by one group.  It's in the rallic pack in my megalo profile.  Graphic is the same as a Kriezzen's flame.</div></div><hr />

How hard was the mob that dropped it? Or did you just buy it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually a friend gave it to me.  I know he got it in an exp group though.  Just a random named with a placeholder somewhere in Droga.  <br />
<br />
BTW the new Droga is a nice 55-65 exp zone now.  PoP level exp and quite a few random named with good drops.  Very fun zone, I suggest checking it out when it goes live.</div></div><hr />

Yea, them bastards. They shoulda made the loot suck, and the XP blow. Only then would we be happy.<br />

First of all, you can't compare how one weapon + an EB weapon would hold agro against a non-EB weapon. Obviously if you can get a hate proc weapon the caliber of CHSD or better, you are going to be producing more agro solely by virtue of the EB weapon.<br />
<br />
While this looks to be a very nice weapon and I would love to have one, I would say that this weapon would need to be paired with a very good DPS 1her to equal the amount of agro a GSoT produces. The proc on this weapon is just the proc of the GSoT+75 damage. We all know that the damage portion of the proc helps produce DPS agro so the real agro portion of the proc is the 0 sec stun, which is the same as the GSoT.<br />
<br />
I would venture a guess that this weapon paired with another weapon of similar ratio would produce equal agro to the GSoT so long as both set ups are producing similar DPS.<br />
<br />
In any case I am going to try to score one of these and maybe a Tarantella from Maestro. That should be a pretty stout DPS and agro set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You think this weap n offhand and Split Blade of Destruction in main would fair as a nice combo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think Sword of the Bloodsworn + Split Blade of Destruction would rock for both agro and DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got the Split Blade of Destruction. Can only wait til Droga is revamped on all servers to try and get the Sword of the Bloodsworn. What do you think this weap would sell for by just going off the stats alone. That is if it is still no drop when Droga is Revamped... also anyone know when that is supose to happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's been on $tormhammer for quite a while now, wouldn't think it would too long.</div></div><hr />
