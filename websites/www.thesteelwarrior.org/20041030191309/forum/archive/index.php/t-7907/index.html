<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your friend looks at the item, it will have one of the following:<br />
<br />
Required Level<br />
Recommended Level<br />
None of the above<br />
<br />
If your friend meets or exceeds those criteria, the haste will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>johnyjohnson76</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hatse for all items is the % of haste minus 1 level, 35 for CoF(36%) level 20 for FBSS(21%) etc.<br />
<br />
the lowest haste item i think is around 9% so level 8 would be the lowest you could get worn haste</div></div><hr />

This is false, as far as I know. Because of the way the EQ spell effect engine works, all effects must have an associated 'caster level'. In the case of worn items, this is a static number, attached to the item. The spell 'Haste', then, is calculated on you as if cast upon you by a person of the level attached to the item. The CoF has a caster level of 35, and, because of the way the haste spell is written, it will give you caster level + 1% haste, or 36%, no matter what level you are. The FBSS has a caster level of 20, thus giving 21% haste. A Belt of the Destroyer has a caster level of 40, thus giving 41% haste, at leve 1, or level 65.<br />
<br />
If the effect is not in the red, as on a recommended item, you are getting the full benefit of the item.</div></div><hr />

So at lvl 1 you get 36% haste from a CoF, or is it at lvl 35 you will get the 36% haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>johnyjohnson76</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">35, i think it was sometime around October in 03 they changed it so haste items do not work at level 1 anymore</div></div><hr />

Thnx Arathena, looking forward to the results of your check to settle this once and for all.</div></div><hr />
