<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been thinking of taking my guild there to kill the nameds. A druid form my guild joined a pick up raid there and told me that she was taking rampage damage when they were fighting a named and she had not cast any heals etc on the MT.<br />
<br />
On the next mob they assigned a rampage tank but even then she was still taking hits and it seemed pretty random. Is this something thats anyone experienced before? my understanding was that as long as you assigned a rampage tank and got everyone on the list in the proper order things like this shouldnt happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're right, it shouldn't happen - someone made an error, or didnt set rampage correctly.<br />
<br />
Mobs have two seperate lists, Hate list, and rampage list.<br />
<br />
Often times someone can get on the rampage list from healing prior to engagement of the mob (ie. during the pull) and not know it, and won't say anything about it, then the rampage tank will hit the mob or shoot some arrows and wonder why he isnt on rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One thing you might want to check, see if she's sure it was rampage.  The mini named giants summon multiple &quot;a {something} Storm&quot;, that go after the closest person and do a good bit of damage before disappearing.<br />
<br />
If she had not done anything to that would cause her aggro, then she couldn't be on rampage (unless it was aerampage, which I don't believe any have).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A druid form my guild joined a pick up raid there and told me that she was taking rampage damage when they were fighting a named and she had not cast any heals etc on the MT. <br />
<br />
WHere did your druid friend stand during the pull?<br />
<br />
She might be the 2nd person to enter the Mini's aggro range and thats why she became the rampage target.<br />
<br />
My guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for the info. ill check with her about her position and stuff. i think they may not have been prepared for rampage and so the raid wasnt briefed about how to manage it so thats what may have caused the problems.<br />
<br />
was quite funny though, she said she now understood what it was like to be the subject of rampage and i told her welcome to the world of the rampage tank. not surprisingly she said no thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahomn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild, we have a druid that does the splitting, between harmony, snare (low area agro), etc. Druids are the best puller imho for these camps, they are the best at kiting so if they screw up and pull more than 1, they do what they did all thier lives, and that is kite the mob till the party is ready for the adds. If your druid friend is pulling, they are already high on both lists after MT has engaged, bumping the druid down a notch or two on hate list but still on &quot;proximity Rampage list&quot;. Alot of things do occur.. maybe try to get that druid almost OOR and see what happens.</div></div><hr />
