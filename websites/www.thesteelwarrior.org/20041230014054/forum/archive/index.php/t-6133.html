<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabal</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has all been hashed out b4 but there's a couple you could get.<br />
<br />
HP wise: PD3 and PE (which will boost CA and CS also)<br />
Defensive wise: LR5 <br />
<br />
Personally i went with all the HP ones...then AE taunt...then CA &gt; LR5 and then CS3 am now working on ID5 <br />
<br />
Everyone has thier ideas and opinions.<br />
What you choose to do is ultimately up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it also depends on how you play.  If the healer in your group is normally a druid or shaman, I'd recommend LR5 next since they can't CH you anyway (yeah, I know they have a CH spell, but it's only a partial :p .)  <br />
<br />
If you do a lot of raiding I'd get the hp ones first since the extra hp will be used by cleric heals and it's nice to help survive those AE's (which also ignore defensive discs.)<br />
<br />
Just noticed you don't have PE yet...since this one boosts both hp and defensive abilities, I'd go for it next.  (then decide between LR5 and PD3/GoD hp aa's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zolanoid</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, he asked for our advice, so here's my suggested order:<br />
PE (very good for only 5 aa)<br />
PD3 (lots of HP for the AA cost)<br />
LR5 (for only 10 aa it really seems to let you avoid a lot of hits)<br />
WA3 (spend 12 aa to seriously buff your proc aggro)<br />
Stability2 (another 12 aa for another 200 HP)<br />
PP5 (spend 10 aa to net just over 100 HP + other little stat bonuses)<br />
Rampage (break time: spend 5 aa on some fun; after this it's grueling)<br />
WA5 (18 aa for more uber proc aggro)<br />
max Endurance Regen<br />
Stability5 (300 net HP for your 48 hard earned aa)<br />
max Run Speed<br />
Aggresive3<br />
max HI<br />
Everything else<br />
<br />
Of course I'm assuming you have average HPs, if you are really embarrassed by yours move the HP AAs up some. The biggest advice that I can offer: ignore all offensive AAs: fury6 + flurry6 + double ripost 6 + other junk like that &lt; WA by a long shot. So get at least a few WA early for some huge aggro, and don't worry about any other offensive stuff until you finish WA and every defensive thing out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WA5 costs 30 aa<br />
<br />
<br />
LR5 (for only 10 aa it really seems to let you avoid a lot of hits) <br />
<br />
LR5 costs 15</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest minor hp aa's such as ND3,PE, and PD3 first. Then do Area Taunt, afterwards do CA 3 and LR5. Then CS 3 and ID5. Then do sturdiness and so on.</div></div><hr />
