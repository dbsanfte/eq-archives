<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I have three main items I want to work on:<br />
<br />
*I want to add more hitpoints to my little frog.  <br />
*I want to add more dexterity to my little frog.<br />
*I want to add more stamina to my little frog.  <br />
<br />
Of course, AC is always a a plus.<br />
<br />
I'm really happr with my current weapons, the Honed Blade of the Ykesha...  I've got two of them, and I'm a happy camper.  But would you suggest I switch one of them out for something else?<br />
<br />
It's time i start really working on my warrior.  I've been dinking around with him too long.  I like him a LOT more than my druid.<br />
<br />
My magelo profile is listed below on my name, click away and suggest away if you would.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You would be better off doing two things for your warrior.<br />
<br />
1.  Do not select equipment based on +str<br />
<br />
2.  Look around in here for ideas<br />
<br />
There are many threads all asking the same questions.  Search for these threads.  Also, check out Magelo profiles of people in these threads to get ideas.<br />
<br />
Not trying to be rude, just there are soooooooo many threads on this that they stickied some common suggestions I believe.  The bazaar tool is an excellent feature now that you can search by slot.  EQPRICES.com has a search by slot and stat for equipment as well.<br />
<br />
Your gear is awesome for your level.  Just enjoy the game and take your time upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, and no hard feelings.  <br />
<br />
I'll take yer advice.</div></div><hr />
