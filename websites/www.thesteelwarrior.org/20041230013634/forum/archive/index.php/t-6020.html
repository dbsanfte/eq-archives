<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evariste</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Starting to work on my AA's (defensive paths first) but I want to know whether getting Ambidex along the way will be worth it - my two-handers are GSoT and WMBS but I have a mighty SoD/CHoS combo I'm thinking about slapping some Anger augments on. <br />
<br />
Is it worth picking up Ambidex with these weapons, or should I hold out for two-hand bonuses instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it depends which combo u use the most really. personally i always knew i was going to go 2handers so i havent got ambi yet.<br />
<br />
if you find yourself using the DW combo then get ambi. but the other alternative to consider is use the anger augs on the 2handers and go the PB ferocity route etc etc.<br />
<br />
You may also want to parse the WMBS v the DW combo to see which puts out more dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fully raid buffed GSoT puts out around 115dps on katta banker parses, while CHoS and SoBS combo puts out btw 95 and 100 dps.<br />
<br />
this is without any offensive aa's.<br />
<br />
your 2handers will always put out more dps assuming they have an = or better ratio then the GSoT, unless you have godly 1handers.  on the other hand, tho, the 1handers (especially when you slap extra ldon procs on them), will make you an aggro god.</div></div><hr />

By the time you're done, the next expansion will likely be out so any advice you get now may be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still haven't trained ambidex and Im at like 184 aa or something. I just don't use dual wield that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have ambidex and it seemed like a pretty good improvement in my DW aggro and dps.  Once you finish all your defensive AA, getting ambidex is not a bad way to go if you DW a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still dual wield alot, aggro is just better with my dual wield combo than it is with GSoT.  (no offensive AA's yet).   Because of that, once I get all the defensive done,  I may do the dual wield offensive AA's first, then go back and do the 2h stuff, but most likely I'll mix and match a little of both, since you never know what weapons you might end up using in a given situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's actually a little middle ground. Do ferocity first, it affects both. Also, if you're not an ogre get stalwart endurance. Not being stunned = more chances to attack/proc.<br />
<br />
  Specifically about ambidexerity, wait until you're done with the 100ish defensive AAs and ferocity/SE. WA will probably prove out to be a better aggro investment, and you might have better weapons (DW or 2handed) by then.</div></div><hr />
