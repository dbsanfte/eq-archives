<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I was looking at both weapons on Alla. Now, before anything else, I realize that Blade of War is certainly better for MTing, at least from the agro stand-point, since EB is def &gt; Rune III for agro. But, my main question; is SEWS really all that much worse than a BoW? I mean, ratio is the same, although boW probably deal a bit more damage since it's got greater damage bonus. BoW has more AC, SEWS more HP. SEWS proc is also not bad for defense, since it is a rune after all. <br />
<br />
So, my question is, unless I'm missing something dire from this entire equation, is there really that much difference between the two? Like, is the agro from Rune III so much worse that it becomes near impossible to hold agro (although from people using a BBB, I got the impression this is not the case)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rune 3 agro in negligable at least for raid MT. Cause for xp groups either will do just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am willing to bet that without defensive  SEWS=BoW<br />
<br />
For defensive, well BoW wins because of the EB factor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would guess that if your guild doesn't do Rallos anymore, then SEWS is a decent alternative. It won't be as good as a Blade of War though... that's for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think they're probably pretty close, close enough I doubt you'd notice a difference between the two aggro wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have Voice of Thule you can't easily tell the difference between SEWS and BoW unless you've some hardcore nukers in your guild.<br />
<br />
Without Voice of Thule, it's a little bit lacking.  Rune 3 is okay aggro but it doesn't grab attention like EB so it's got problems early on in the fight.  If a fight drags on long enough the ratio will cover most of the aggro you need.  But then you do have SKs, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Proc are no use early in the fight, considering the probability you have to land one in the 1st 30 sec, it's rather a question of building aggro during a long fight.<br />
For a 1-2mn fight sews is really equivalent to BoW, but for a 5mn+ fight extra aggro from proc start being significant, especialy for your nukers.<br />
<br />
You can MT no problem with a sews, it's very efficient in xp grp and to clean trash mobs.<br />
<br />
Sews is damn rare anyway, at least on my server, there's 15+ BoWs and 3 sews, mudwalker being killed at every repop ... So considering your hybrid might want a sews, that BoW seems a lot more common, and that BoW is better than sews for a war (35 AC &gt; 10 hp , EB &gt;&gt; Rune 3)  it's not a so good option. I also though 2 months ago that my guild would get tons of sews since Monsterous Mudwalker has only 4 loots in his loot table and that sews is not much worse than bow, but it's really too rare, BoW really has a better drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromagnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a SEWS owner, I will try and add some perspective.<br />
<br />
Background:  Our guild is utterly cursed with EB weapon drops.  38 AoW kills, 5 BoC (2 on the first, 2 on the last).  25+ Cursed kills, 0 Bloodfrenzy.  30+ XTC kills, 1 Hategiver.  First 4 RZTW kills netted no BoW.  So when the first SEWS dropped, I jumped at it.  Up until last week it was still the only SEWS on the server (one poofed on a rival guild during a zonecrash), while there were 5+ BoWs.<br />
<br />
Stats:  35AC 185HPS 48/32 vs 50AC 175HPS 45/30 - its a bit of a wash to me.<br />
<br />
Damage:  with 1576ATK (base + SoV) and only PB3 for offense I can generate 100-135DPS from the front, and 130-170DPS from the rear.  I have just recently purchased Fero3/TM3 so I have no conclusive numbers yet.<br />
<br />
Agro:  It seems I have to work a little more to establish agro at the beginning of a fight, unless I use AT.  But as the fight wears on, I find the agro curve feels smoother.  With BoC procs, the agro from EB 'seemed' snappier, but spikier.  With SEWS, I feel more confident as the fight goes on.  It's definitely got an agro-over-time edge.  Once I have solid agro, I almost never lose it.  The rune proc will not pull agro away from another tank unless you get the odd '3 procs in 2 rounds' thing.  <br />
<br />
As the MA/MT on raids, I rarely have a runaway mob problem, with or without VoT.  In XP groups, I only struggle occasionally with agro, usually at the very beginning of the fight.<br />
<br />
Proc Rate:  I parsed one of my more recent logs and came up with the following:<br />
<br />
46070 hits<br />
43477 misses  +<br />
----------------------<br />
89547 swings<br />
2611 procs<br />
<br />
34.2 swings per proc, so lets say 1 in 35 to make it round.<br />
<br />
My survivability is generally slightly higher than other tanks in my guild, which has been noticed by the healers, given that in between any two heals, I mitigate 230-690 damage, depending.<br />
<br />
Synopsis:  I am very happy with my SEWS, although I am a bit of an iconoclast.  It is not a weapon for the lazy warrior, it is not a magic bullet.  As an MT weapon it has its quirks, but does the job nicely to my tastes.  I can farm greens all day too :) .<br />
<br />
Do not save up your DKP for this weapon.  Don't put it on your wishlist.  If you luck into one, awesome, but keep your eye on the BoW.  A BoW is not only more suitable for a warrior, it is far far far more common (13-14 RZ kills on server, 5-6 BoW.  40+ Mud ring kills on server, 3 SEWS).  Let your knights get this weapon.  It keeps them from bidding on BoWs :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use SEWS. Our other 5 MTs use BoW. It seems pretty evident to me that I do not get the same agro lock as they do.<br />
<br />
Typical scenario: doing crap birds in fire, on enrage I turn attack off, and soon after people pushing the agro limit gets summoned(typically a necro or druid). This doesnt seem to happen as often when it is a BoW user tanking.<br />
<br />
That is not to say I am unhappy with the SEWS though, the damage is nice and the rune is very helpful in both exp groups and against lightweight AE mobs(pyronis etc) if you get stuck in ghetto groups with no real healers and have to hope for MGB heals :p<br />
<br />
Its also a nice weapon for me because I am not typically MA'ing or MT'ing, but more into the raid-leading side of things(aka shouting orders :p). I do not have to worry that much about accidental proc agro. And when it happens, the rune III saves 230 hp worth of damage, and I can just turn attack off again and mobs usually turn away fast.<br />
<br />
Also nice to get 230 hp shaved off the occasional riposte damage when you are not tanking. Typically you will have procced again before you take next riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">8 RZ kill got 0 BoW, but saw 2 SEWS dropped in like 4 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've seen only a few SEWSs on my server yet I've seen probably 2 dozen different Blades of War at least... <br />
<br />
Personally I'm going for the Blade of War... just hope the drop rate is good for us once we actually get a chance to kill RZ (competition is fierce on Solusek Ro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think either makes a good choice to get.. some servers have better luck with ones drop rate while another server will have 1-2.<br />
<br />
For instance.. my guild has killed RZ 10 times now, and no BoW's.<br />
We've done Mudring around 9 times.. and 5 SEWS, first 4 mudwalkers dropped a SEWS every time. I'd have to agree that SEWS wont catch aggro as fast early on as some EB weapons, but over time its definately built up alot of aggro. Even with dual wielding EB wars once the fight has gone 1-2 minutes I practically never lose aggro.<br />
<br />
I will definately be upgrading to a BoW if the opportunity presents itself, but a SEWS only just falls behind it in my view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smushu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BoW &gt; SEWS for aggro.<br />
<br />
One example: I have SEWS, buddy has BoW (we have similar stats), we both attack mob concurrently and only used our swords for aggro.  I cannot pull aggro off of him.  It just doesn't seem to happen for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You won't get aggro off the bat unless you are the one MT'ing the mob on inc.<br />
<br />
SEWS is over-time aggro, the more you proc it, and the more damage rune3 absorbs, the more the mob will be pissed at you.<br />
<br />
BoW is 700+ hate each time it goes off, you could be sitting at x_number and have the Warrior with EB weapon proc and skyrocket past you.</div></div><hr />
