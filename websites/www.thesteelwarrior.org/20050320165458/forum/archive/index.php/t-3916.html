Does anyone know why my warrior's atk goes down so severely going from 1hs to 2hs ? 1hs im at 1010 atk unbuffed, and with 2hs epic im at 514 ... =\<br />
<br />
<br />
1hs Skill = 200<br />
2hs Skill = 198</div></div><hr />

Second, the worn effect on one of the swords has 40+ ATK, maybe thats playing some role, but its weird that it goes down so much</div></div><hr />

Odd.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toham</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your level 47 oh well GRATZ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought you had to be 51 to do epic quests. I mean the final turns ins etc. My Cleric was ready for epic pre 50 but I leveled her to 51 just in case as I had heard you couldn't get epic until then. Hers is my first epic for any of my characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yari</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did every turn in from 45, npcs responded and didnt have any issues MQ'ng the various pieces. But yes i turned them in at 47 and recieved the completed scabbard.<br />
<br />
Im not quite sure what you mean about me being 47 tho Toham. My cleric is 65 and had it pretty hard with completing her epic. 11 hours in solb before change,  141 hours in skyfire before they changed it to its current state. With my warrior it was simply a matter of getting the items that could be done on my own completed and MQ'ng the rest. My warrior being level 47 doesnt mean she didnt deserve it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toham</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didnt mean she didnt like a wow because the wing and green scale are so hard to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hardest parts were Hand of Maestro, same reason as sky, and the wingblade. but i did the entire epic in about 3 days real time.</div></div><hr />
