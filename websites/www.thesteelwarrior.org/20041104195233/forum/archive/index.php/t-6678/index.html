<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyrrarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in a bit of a crossroads in regards to my slot item. I recently acquired the Dissertation of Dark War (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20989) and was planning to begin the quest for the Gem of Victory (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20984) . My problem is that I already have a Stonewood Compound Bow  (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19096) for my range slot. <br />
<br />
My question is two-fold....First, is it worth doing the quest to get the gem in the first place and second , if I do the quest, is it worth doing the next step to the Marsinger's Glimmering Gem (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21002). It appears to me that in doing the final step, I gain 5ac and 25hp, however , I lose the Vengence III. Any input would be helpful on the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">5ac 25hp &gt; Vengence III + time spent on the quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not worth the trouble IMO for the minor increase in HP/AC, and the loss of V3, plus having to switch out your bow every time you wanna use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Swapping a bow in and out to pull is a huge pain in the ass.  Unless there was a really large difference stat wise I wouldn't bother with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never used a bow again since the day incite + run5 came out :)<br />
<br />
Doing the quest &amp; reselling the bow might be ok financially.<br />
But its gonna be a pain if u want long range pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yorag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with most of the others, I would keep your bow in the range slot. It really is a pain to switch weapons during a pull, even if you have a good UI for switching items. The bow has regen. as well....same as the Glimmering Gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Contrary opinion here... :p <br />
<br />
Do the quest, sell the bow, and use the plat for other upgrades.  Pulling with incite works most of the time, and keep a cheap bow handy for those rare cases where incite doesn't have the range you need.  <br />
<br />
I've got the 4th gem and the only time I ever switch to a bow is when I need to tag a mob to get on the rampage list.  The other 99.9% of the time I leave the gem in my ranged slot and never think about it.</div></div><hr />
