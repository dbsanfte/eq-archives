<br />
Im thinking of selling the Windblade to buy a Green Draon Scale.  Currently use GoT for most of the fights, and Windblade when I want damage and not MT.  Guild will be doing Char again soon for the remaining warriors for that damn Queen.  Ive got the rest of the stuff, missing Green and Queen.<br />
<br />
Should I sell Windblade to get Greenscale and then get Queen?  Or should I keep windblade and try to camp Sev (bah)?  I only have the GoT, I sold my duel wields after I got it.  Thus Epic will give me nice duel wield, and a nice two hander (plus it looks aws)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have multiple accounts and can run more than one, make a mage and park him in EJ to Sense Sev's pet.<br />
<br />
If not, buy the scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bleh keep the windblade. epics in either form if you have better are a waste of time. go pick up some cheap-mid level 1Hers; hell; 14/24's are going to slow you down to a crawl considering you got a windblade and GoT already.<br />
<br />
IMO you buy a green scale now you are wasting your time and money. camp and loot one is a different story tho :D<br />
<br />
**reasoning behind it is this:<br />
Epics are good weapons; at the point where epics are the best available. I owned a JBoW. Loved the thing. This was at the time when Windblades were selling for 100K or so; GoT was unheard of to sell; and the guild i was in was at the progression where it was pre-EB weapons. if i had the option of owning GoT/Windblade or anything at that level of game the Epics would have been a big downgrade in aggro/dps/time/etc. **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL - I got all 3 and the one that holds best agro is JBoW. Easy.<br />
<br />
The problem is that your epic is a pita to get. Is the pita to get it worth the extra agro? Not imo - it looks cool but thats about it.<br />
<br />
For reference - I paid 15K for my windblade, 15K for my GoT and erm,,, about 70K for my epic MQs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but Epics are status symbols.  They may be crap for gear, but they look kewl = ).<br />
<br />
My point is that the Windblade is for damage mostly.  My GoT is used for aggro and used 98% of the time Im in groups (usually MT).  By doing epic I'll be getting 2 duel wield weapons, and another 2hs (to replace windblade).  <br />
<br />
The question really is . . . Do I really need a slightly better damage weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">try it out of a guild group truelove and get back to me lol :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that is nt the question. If you where talking about a reaver or a savage bladed axe. The epic 2h doesn't even come close to comparing to windblade in damage. And 14/24? Please. The red blade proc is nice when it lands, but I think you will find that GSoT &gt; epic 1hers for agro.<br />
<br />
Windblade is far superior DPS, GSoT is superior agro, if you want 1hers you can get 2 that smoke 14/24 for less than the price of a green scale.<br />
<br />
I have had all but the chardok and poa pieces, no way am I going to bother with the PITA epics are for a downgrade in weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;2 that smoke 14/24 for less than the price of a green scale.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hear this a lot.<br />
<br />
So, say, green scales sell for 35k or thereabouts on my server.<br />
<br />
What 2handers are available for 35k that are gonna outdamage a 14/24 with a 100 point proc?<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to compile a list of sorts, because, I always wondered what weapons people were referring to when they told me this while auctioning for a wingblade for a month solid.<br />
<br />
I couldn't really figure it out.<br />
<br />
Curved Claws, I'm thinking are one of them.<br />
<br />
Exquisite Velium Battlehammer maybe? 12/20 would seem to be on par with 14/24 + proc. But I don't know if it's all that much better.<br />
<br />
Swiftblade of Zek, but that's usually 45 to 50k. So it's more expensive than the green scale.<br />
<br />
In fact a lot of the weapons run more expensive than the greenscale on my server ... split blade of destruction, wind worn handblade, short sword of lightning ... all superior weapons DPS wise to the 14/24. But all more expensive than the green scale.<br />
<br />
The UP no drop mithril edged shortsword would be better, and is certainly cheaper than the green scale.<br />
<br />
Is Ornate Sword of the General less or more DPS?<br />
<br />
Anyways, just trying to get an idea of where the 14/24 with 100 point proc falls in the grand scheme of things when green scales are relatively cheap-ish on your server like they are on mine (35k is cheaper than the 80k or so I see some people say they sell for on their server).<br />
<br />
I dunno. I got my epic because at my level it was one of the best weapons I could get for both aggro and DPS. And I got it to get it. I wanted the swords. <br />
<br />
I just got confused when people would tell me &quot;Oh you can get better in bazaar&quot; and then I'd actually go look in bazaar, and not really see BETTER available for any reasonable price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Green scales go for about that on TT as well, so I will give you a list of better weapons you can buy for 35k.<br />
<br />
Silverfang Club - 10/17 (10k)<br />
Scimitar of the Emerald Dawn - 20/34 (8k)<br />
Tae Ew Longsword - 12/20 (15k)<br />
Tae Ew Mace - 12/20 (15k)<br />
Tae Ew Whip - 12/20 (15k)<br />
Exquisite Velium Battlehammer - 12/20 (8k)<br />
Exquisite Velium Spear - 12/20 (8k)<br />
Curved Claws - 11/18 (15k)<br />
Swiftblade of Zek - 11/18 (25k)<br />
Blackened Acrylia Blade - 14/22 (15k)<br />
Defender's Lightblade - 22/34 (6k)<br />
Falchion of Storms - 12/18 (25k)<br />
Shortblade of Lightning - 13/19 (25k)<br />
<br />
With a 35k limit, you could get one weapon that is FAR superior in DPS and stats + one other that has at least a better ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But what about taunting capacity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This post really intrigues me. I have my epics, and being in a small family type guild, that started bout 10 years ago and has become a real family of folks that I have all met many times, getting better weapons isnt possible, unless I can buy them. And I was always a poor warrior, recently spent 20K on a Heavy Rubicite Girdle and thats the most plat I have ever spent on a single item. Also leaves me with under 2K these days so no new purchases in the near future.<br />
<br />
Now I agree that 14/24 isnt great. Since I started playing in Tier 1 PoP though I almost exclusively use the JBoW, and have really enjoyed it. I managed to obtain my epic through a year and a half of raiding in a 5 guild alliance where epic mobs were some of the toughest things we could do and I was almost always MT, even though my gear was less then others in the alliance. I got all the drops for my epics by tanking the mobs myself and helping to lead the raids run for them, so finally getting my green scale from Sev was a big deal for me. Even more fun was after running around and getting the epics, going to SoNH and doing the frog for a guildie with a group of 5, being played by just 2 of us, and finding the fight easy.<br />
<br />
Now is a GoT worth the price, and since I never even see them for sale not sure what that is on T Marr, and Windblade I have seen for sale a few times in bazaar, from 60-90K. Or should I just keep spending the plat I can earn to upgrade other gear, as the JBoW still seems to be doing the job, most of the time.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't really considered the new CT weapons much. They're still just trickling into the povar economy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The original poster already owns a Greatstaff of Thunder. In reality he has no need for 1h weapons with what he already has. To purchase 1h weapons that will outtaunt or outdamage a GSoT and a Windblade is going to cost a fortune - to the tune of many 100kpp.<br />
<br />
Unless you are ungodly rich, the only way you are going to be upgrading those weapons is to loot upgrades. Unfortunately, epics do not fall into the catagory of upgrades for his current arsenal.</div></div><hr />

I know on my server they are (or were) far cheaper than Windblades.  GoT has better dps than Widebladed and far superior aggro.  WMBS has almost as good dps as Windblade for less money.  Plus it looks much cooler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you go spending any plats on weapons, there are several BIG upgrades you can get for much less. You have decent weapons so worry about those later.<br />
<br />
For starters - the froggy crown and the fish ear need to go in a bag. They are situational, not for every day wearing. I would also replace the orc fang while you are at it. 2x player made 35hp/25mana earrings would be a 60hp upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
A helanic tundra helm would be a huge upgrade in both HP and AC. Wear the froggy crown when you need the resists. Try to get a pair of Valorium rings. Much better overall than 6/65 rings and you will pick up some much needed STA. And finally, I would replace your bow. Nightmarewood compound is nice and pretty cheap these days, but I prefer Darkwood Bow of Suffering - it has decent AC, STA, and HP. What more could you as for?<br />
<br />
Once you get all of that squared away I would try to get a Greatstaff of Thunder.</div></div><hr />

Having said that if you have a GoT and Windy I see no reason to get your epics other then the &quot;I want the Light Sabers&quot;.   I still carry mine and pull em out just to become a little disapointed with em compared to the GoT.  The GoT does about 10 more dps and the Windy about 15 dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone who in the past few months has used the Windblade, War Marshalls, Greatstaff, and now finally epics, I have to say get your epics if you can.  Here is my reasoning:<br />
<br />
Windblade:  Too slow... but I did enjoy the damage it did while I had it. However, it didn't taunt enough for me to be effective.  Was good for when I was just a DoT and not MT, but that wasn't very often and I didn't have the resources to have both the Windblade and an agro setup at the time.  Ditched it to get...<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder:  I was rather surprised by this.  For being a neutered version of the yak proc, it taunted very nicely.  My big issue with this was that the proc did retain the knockback component, and I found mobs being pushed around too much.  This may be a matter of opinion, however, as I am severely anal about mob containment.  It usually falls on my shoulders to make sure mobs stay away from obstructions and accessible, and I just felt I could not do my job with this weapon.  I was almost sad when I did sell it (because again it does taunt nicely), but the person offered me 20k more than what I paid, which I used to buy....<br />
<br />
War Marshalls Bladed Staff:  This weapon was a dream for me, on a DPS standpoint.  As a wood elf, I always envisioned myself using speed over raw power, and this fit in well with that.  Didn't do much for taunt, and so I used it mostly when I wasn't MT (which again isn't often, as there are only two MT's in my guild atm).  I liked it more than the Windblade for when in DoT mode.  The opportunity came up, however,  to sell the staff and put it towards the green scale for my....<br />
<br />
Epics:  A little background to my anecdotal evidence:  I regularly group/raid with a 65 rogue with all these crazy offensive AA's and insane upper-tier weapons (mainhand is 16/19, offhand 14/18, both with procs).  He does some silly DPS, and you can imagine the backstabs.  Normally he ends up tanking as much as I do because of it (the fact that he has more HP than I do and can tank just fine I place in the back of my mind to preserve my sense of self worth ;)). However, once another warrior in the guild got their epics, he told me he only has to evade after pulls, if that.  He since repeated that sentiment about my own performance with the epics.  That in and of itself was total justification for what I paid for the green scale (I won't say what it was... it's in another thread if you want, I'm still sorta embittered by it ;)).<br />
<br />
Is my DPS now less than the first 3 options?  Indeed.  BUT, the DPS of my group has increased because Mr. Rogue can now open up the floodgates and poke away.  He has parsed upwards of 220 dps now against exp mobs, whereas before he had to hold himself down to 150 or so and still tank half the time.  If we are just looking at DPS to taunt, then we are competing at the same level as the rogues, monks, rangers, and wizards of Norrath, and we are not gonna beat them at their own game.  And we can't just look at our solitary performance, we have to look at how our ability enhances the performance of the group, since warriors so very rarely solo.  I try to make my choices to better the total throughput of the group, rather than my personal parses.  Just my 2cp. ;)<br />

<br />
1.  I used GSoT exclusively for about 2 months and it didnt knockback for me.  and according to Lucy its proc doesnt knockback.<br />
<br />
2.  Theoretically, WMBS should be MORE dps than windblade.  we have parses backing up the statement that windblade does more damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I missed it but IMHO the question should not be about the epic but more specfically about the RED epic.  <br />
<br />
The hate generation of the red (I think its -500?) is very useful if you have only a single EB class weapon.  It can also be combined in the offhand with non EB weapons to generate decent agro.  IMHO if you are not close to having an EB weapon in your future you would gain some utility from having the red epic.<br />
<br />
I very rarely dual wield in PoP (unless MT) because of the high instrinsic ripostes from mobs.  I still use the red blade in the off hand when I do though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a lot of high lvl people still using the Red Epic.  I plan on using it, even though the delay is high.  EB weapons are kinda out there atm.  Im not sure when I will be getting one.<br />
<br />
What about the 2 hander epic?  Is that worth anything?  (Aggro or Damage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gear</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT does knockback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two handed epic is rather suprising for agro...enough so that I will not use it on raids where positioning is important and flipping the mob can be painful...if you get a couple of procs in a row it can get suprising agro.  <br />
<br />
However, with the advent of the other 2 handers listed in this thread it really is kinda out of a job; it doesn't have the ratio to hold with the Windblade etc DPS, does not have a strong enough proc (consistently) to warrant use as a MT but does have enough of a proc to prevent it from being used on casual raids as non MT.   It still looks pretty though  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The GSoT does indeed knockback.  It's not as severe as, say, the effect on that Breezeboots range thingie, but it is there, and I noticed it.  It may have factored into my opinion more than others, because like I said, mob movement irks me to no end.<br />
<br />
Also, from what I've read, the Windblade and WMBS parse almost identically.  I haven't done parses myself, I don't have time for that stuff as of late.  I also never claimed that one parsed better than the other.  The thing I like about the WMBS was that I never had those stretches of 10 seconds where I had a round of misses, and I felt like I was standing there picking my nose.  The damage output felt very consistent to me, whereas the Windblade has these peaks and pits throughout a fight that disconcerted me.<br />
<br />
Also, it is true that the epic is all about the red blade and its proc.  I am using red main and blue offhand right now, but I will have no second thoughts about putting the red in offhand as soon as I get a CHSD or BoC (which would be the most likely upgrade).  However, when I am not tanking, I will still most likely put the blue in offhand and my MESS in mainhand.  The added ATK comes in handy when you are there for damage, and the stats are nothing to sneeze at either.  That is, at least, until I get another DPS twohander (probably another WMBS unless I get a nice no-drop jobby).<br />
<br />
As for the JBoW, I tend agree with the poster that said they would not use it when not tanking.  The proc will turn a mob. And if you follow the semi-recent debate on how proc rates tie into weapon delay to its logical conclusion, the JBoW actually has a better chance of proccing per swing, which could possibly happen earlier on in the fight when the MT still hasn't fully asserted his/her position on the hate list.<br />

<br />
#1  low dps, on a lot of mobs in pop if you dont proc in the first 10 sec or get the lucky tuant then someone is DEAD, the epics do not have the punch to pull the mob to you FAST, I find the GoT is far far better at this then epics.<br />
<br />
#2 the proc is resisted on fire resist mobs, yes there are peeps on both sides of the fence on this but what I have seen is the argo from a resisted proc is a hell of a lot less then one that landed.<br />
<br />
    The knock back is small about 1 ft and I have never had a problem with it. On mobs over 50 if the KB moves them out of range they will summon in which case you then have ~20 sec to move the mob anyway you want or he will move back to within range of you.<br />
<br />
  I think epics are good weapons just not in the same class as GoT and Windy.<br />

Our guild is a pleasant, family style bunch, we never have more than 3 or 4 groups on a raid, usually an average level of 60,or 61, and when he didn't have the cleric/pally weapon in his hand this guy was easy.  (The cleric/pally weapon procs one of those divine things that makes him invulnerable for like 3 minutes, which is a major pain in the ass.)  Since I use a windblade and don't dual wield very often, I passed on the 13/20 scythe and let one of our necros grab it (it has lots of INT on it, which made him very happy).</div></div><hr />

I doubt that's any one of them that I'd give up epics for. No way are most of those close to as valuable as the epic. More figures into the weapon choice than dps.<br />
<br />
A few posters have noted the strength of JBoW taunt, and I'd like to echo that. The 2hs epic is fairly weak dps, but the taunt is terrific.<br />

But I think the blue epic deserves more respect than it gets here. 14/24 isn't great, but it's not terrible, and the effect is subtle but real. Yes, there are better off-handers, but the weapon is better than it looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is the original poster does NOT have his epic. He has a superior 2h taunt weapon and a superior 2h DPS weapon. The point of the list was to show the availability of 1h weapons for superior DPS than the epic 1h.<br />
<br />
Given the choice between GSoT + Windblade + any 2 weapons on my list, vs. warrior epic the choice seems pretty simple to me. Better agro and better DPS across the board seems like a no brainer.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the epics are fine weapons for their era, you would be hard pressed to find better tradeable prePoP weapons without spending many 100kpps. Before PoP I planned on getting my warrior his epic. But for the time and effort involved in getting the warrior epic, you could farm enough plats to get GSoT, WMBS, HoH and SBoZ and end up with a far better set up for any situation. The time and effort involved in getting your epics is a high price to pay for a rite of passage or a status symbol.</div></div><hr />

Epics are a weapon you'll grow out of ( esp if you're sub-65 )..yet the other weapons listed will only get better and better for you as you level and aa.<br />
<br />
I got no gripes with the JBoW or it's 1h'ers at all since at the time they were the best available. Even later on when I was set back as an off-tank to gnomb's, zzixx's, truelove's, err, all the other of my old guild's warriors who were either wielding sappers or prismatics/eb weapons ( not even going to go into PoP gear yet )...my poor little lightsabers were three sheets to the wind in a hurricane in usability. somehow shikarii had an insane chance on proc'ing ( 20 a fight wasn't uncommon...go on and hate me lol :D ) yet the hate was swapped back to others who were wielding superior DPS weapons.<br />
<br />
PoP gear was no contest whatsoever. Totally took the jam out of my donut.<br />
<br />
If you want the epics...sure, go do them. I personally feel you'll be taking a major drop in DPS and subsequently your aggro/hate numbers as well if you'e going to sacriffice your superior DPS/aggro producing weapon(s) you own now. If you happen to stumble on to the rest of your epic drops than go that route. Don't go selling off the farm tho in order to have a shiny new tractor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I decided to sell the windblade for the greenscale.  I did all the running around and now Im all set.  Guild raid this Friday for Queen, I dunno if they would stay for a blade for me though (Queen drops only one blade right?)  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I got a Tae Ew War Maul with the leftover cash.  Windblade was really nice weapon for dps, but I rarely ever wasnt MT in exp groups.  In raids, I just needed a good dps weapon and 33/36 isnt too too bad.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly how I feel about the epic weapons, and the blue epic specifically.<br />
<br />
It's part of the package.<br />
<br />
The ATK boost, and the dex boost are there to boost the proc rate on the red blade, however slightly.<br />
<br />
It's a useful weapon and part of the total epic package.<br />
<br />
Yeah, if you can pair your red blade with a cord hilted spike driver or BETTER hate proc, then by all means do so.<br />
<br />
But for me, I was using Exquisite Velium Battlehammer and Frostbringer and Club of the Ice Ocean and Praetor's Blade of Debility pre-epic.<br />
<br />
At that stage of my gear and my level, Red + Blue was the best setup.<br />
<br />
Still is (I'm still level 52, heh, I level slow).<br />
<br />
Blue epic gets trashed a lot, but isn't that bad a weapon at all.</div></div><hr />
