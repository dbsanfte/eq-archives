<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so we had this test today and it sucked. I am in training to be in the intelligence branch and after today I believe the oxymoron of military intelligence.<br />
<br />
The infomation that we were taught was so screwedup on the test we had 4 guys fail. Misplayed word schemes and the such caused so much disbelief no-one thaught they would pass.<br />
<br />
None of the stuff they told us to review was even remotly close to the way the test was run. Just wish they would get their crap together</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rainingvodka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">welcome to the US Military.  be prepared for years of that shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehehe Canadian military and have been for 18 years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rainingvodka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol.  i jumped with some canucks once.  it was fun.  last i heard your airborne corps were all disbanded though?  that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ugle Smashur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Coming up on 14 years, myself.  Get used to it, hehee.  Though, most military tests are multiple guess, they can still be guaranteed to follow no logical pattern.  GL on your training.  <br />
<br />
Army?  USAF?  USMC?  USN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arrliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">USAF here for just over 13 years. The four multiple choice test answers for a single miltary test question are all so similar they confuse you. The majority of the time, all four answers to the question are the same save a word or two. Get used to it... it doesn't get any better until you make rank. Once you make Master Seargent in the AF, you no longer have to test for rank anyway  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It depends who is writing the test.  Most aircrew tests are user friendly.  I've been writing tests for about 3 years and have no complaints.  Then again my office has a check system in place if there are problems with a test question.  We update them on a regular basis as well.  The only questions that we genally have issues with are ones that are not produced on this base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nokatsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Having the material taught not be related to the test is probably good preparation for life in military Intelligence. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Whiteniteslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have 18 years in the Canadian army ( yes we have one ) and have been a explosives and minewarfare expert thru most of my career. I have gone thru some super hard tests before but these ones with the MI are worded so confusing, it just boggles the mind.<br />
<br />
As for the airborne, yes sadly it was disbanded. Kind of the same thing as the Iraqi prison thing but a young Somali kid was killed and the lynching began and the airborne was disbanded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Arrliss - the only people in the Air Force I've found to be more screwed up and confusing than AETC is Finance.  Hell, my troops that go to Keesler to learn Electronics Maintenance are taught System Administration instead.  I have to start from scratch with each one that comes back.  Total waste of 8 months.  /rude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">9 years in the Navy. Like the others said, get used to shit being fucked up on a daily basis. Gets comical after awhile. Just don't let the shit stress you out, to many bald people in the military because they stress to much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I found all military exams to be pathetically easy.   I took the OCB and shattered it was a joke.   But then I am a voracious reader with an excellent vocabulary and had four years of college under my belt and EQ to distract me back then.   Today I am not so sure I would do so well with EQ.  <br />
<br />
Rule of thumb on those tests  :   You think long you think wrong.   Read the  question throughly and go with your first answer.   Do play into self doubt.<br />
<br />
 They test to standards not actual knowledge base 95% of the time.  You know the standards you will pass.</div></div><hr />
