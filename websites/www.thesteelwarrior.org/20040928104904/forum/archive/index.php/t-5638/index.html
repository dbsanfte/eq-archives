<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am the leader of a newly formed 3-4 night raid guild.  I am currently recruiting mostly level 62+ people.<br />
<br />
I am looking at the path to Plane of Time and I have seen some guilds go through Vex Thal and some not that are in Time or knocking on the door.  I know from talking to people in doing recruiting (which if you are into rejection do that before you even have a guild tag under your name:D ) there is an extreme dislike when talking about camping for Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Some questions:<br />
<br />
1. Does Vex Thal make any real difference anymore when looking to progress through the PoP content?  If yes, what specifically.  If no, why specifically.<br />
<br />
2. What is(was) the benefit of Vex Thal and is it the only way to achieve that benefit?  Is there other content that is as effective?<br />
<br />
3. While it is ballsy to even be talking about end game content at my stage of guild creation I believe in having a plan to get there.  Any suggestions on what you believe to be the best path to get there?  A &quot;roadmap&quot; to success if you will.<br />
<br />
Any advice greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not being VT keyed and a member of a guild who is only I would say half keyed(but recently broke in to Time) it really depends.<br />
Bazaar gearing AND lower PoP the way it is now can get you into Eles planes with enough people at the raid if they are smart players and you have the strat down.Only real concern is the MT hps,with bazaar gearing its not possible to get above 6200 [Edit:6200ish unbuffed,but thats going up with the new GoD AAs]or so but that will cut it up to Eles ifyou have good CH rotation.<br />
<br />
VT really is not worth it to do unless people have the time in their free time to camp the shards,wouldnt reccomend making &quot;raid nights&quot; for it.Hit stuff in lower PoP or various mobs in Luclin and Velious that dont require keys till you build up some decent gear and start working on the flag progression mobs.<br />
<br />
If in the free time enough people get VT keyed to do Vt raids thats a bonus.<br />
BTW dont forget they will also all need to be Ssra Emp keyed as well for the Rift that he drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Equirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, in my opnion, Vex Thall serves two purposes, one, it gives your members something long and difficult to work through, and going through vex thall itself tends to be a very tedious experiance that could make or break a guild. <br />
<br />
Other then the training the entire process could give you, I suppose the gear from there is worth the effort, if your guild is willing to put itself through several hours of clearing apple peel trash to get to any substance (i.e. loot), If every member of your guild is willing to work with each other through shard camping and key farmin, then any content in PoP would be a walkover once you develop the appropraite tactics and obtain the appropraite gear(high LdoN point earned armor, Ornate, VT loot) to face them.<br />
<br />
However if you wish to ditch VT and go straight to the PoP apple (Less skin to go through), then nobody's stopping you and if my memory serves, its a path less tedious then the timesink you would have to put into VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there's more loot per unit time spent raiding in VT than anywhere before time, so once you get there, it's worth it.  Also, your CC/offtank crew will definitely get a workout, as 10+ mobs in camp is par for the course.  Also, many of the great focus effects in VT are found only in VT.  However, it certainly takes a looooong time to get everyone keyed up.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it's a tradeoff between gearing your guild faster but with a longer key process beforehand (the VT way) or taking longer to gear your guild with no keying process.  Personally, I recommend VT, but that could be cause I went through it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So far we do have the people that highly desire to help each other get keyed.<br />
<br />
My concern is in 1) recruiting - a lot of people get unhappy when I talk of VT key 2) if VT can be skipped we can use that time XP'ing and raiding content to improve the guild's power quickly.....which begets more recruits.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the comments so far.  It could be I am just getting cold feet too.:o <br />
<br />
Either way, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">VT is a training ground that will help the guild in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We skipped VT, and we're elementally flagged.  As far as MTs, we haven't had a problem, we have 3 over 9k buffed hps.  With the new GoD AAs, I'm sure we'll have a handful more once we catch up on that.  If you're on a server with huge elemental competition, then VT might be a good place for you to go.  Also, for the other reasons stated above.  For the most part, I would say that as the game is now, VT isn't required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont agre with Arative bah n/m that.<br />
<br />
VT is AWESOME if you are the only guild going there.<br />
(For a period of at least 2 3 months).<br />
<br />
Otherwise the timesink required to get there.<br />
Shards/Banes/Keys etc etc etc. Is not worth it.<br />
<br />
You can get 30 loots in 1 day (2 if u are slow).<br />
Loots that for casters can last until Quarm+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've seen and read of new GoD 6-man group items that rival VT loot.  So I should think it's now possible to spend your time in expeditions rather than key farming. <br />
<br />
But VT sure is an easy way to satisfy a whole bunch of members in one fell swoop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">vex thal is thee best zone to accumulate insane amounts of loots for ALL that you'll prob never see the likes of again, ever.<br />
<br />
it's a candystore. <br />
<br />
is it 'needed' these days tho? not really. But if you got the time and incentive you won't regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">there's more loot per unit time spent raiding in VT than anywhere before time<br />
Is this still true if you factor in the total time spent going from zero to Aten?  Shard camps, getting 50+ orbs of luclinite, farming comm2 etc. for everyone, competition for Emp/VT...  all of that considered, might Tier 1-3 POP + LDON pay off just as well per unit time?  (I'm asking as a member of a guild that skipped VT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">that's a rough question; since I never did much LDoN ( were finishing up VT for the most part when LDoN was released ) .. but overall looking through some of my guildies profiles who are now in Time...I haven't seen very many replacements for the non visible worn items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Vex Thal is completely worth your time and effort.<br />
<br />
It makes RZ and above MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
Not only that, VT is an abolutely beautiful zone, which you've just gotta see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Primary question I would ask is - is there a Euro guild doing Vex Thal on your server.  My guild spent months getting keyed, and in the end we got a total of 7 AHR kills over the course of several months, before we gave up.  And we wouldn't have gotten half of those kills if our local Euro guild hadn't finally woken up to the fact that they were crippling their own progression by spending all their time in VT and left - though they now return regularly to gear up their cross-server transfers.<br />
<br />
We are killing Quarm these days, and we probably would have killed him sooner if we hadn't wasted our time on VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">VT is a mixed bag.<br />
<br />
For smaller guilds, Vex Thal is a great place to equip your guild to prepare for PoP encounters as they are, for the most part, designed for large amounts of numbers.  Chances are almost everyone is going to get a piece of loot in a VT raid if you're raiding with 35.<br />
<br />
If you're in a larger guild, the hassle of keying up for Vex Thal may drive you completely insane.  You don't need VT gear to be successful in PoP, and the amount of guilds that have defeated Rallos Zek without a drop of VT gear is growing (albeit slowly, most guilds do VT regardless).  What also tends to be common in large guilds is the average person receives less loot over time.  In a place like VT, this becomes a problem as everyone tries to hold out for Aten loot.<br />
<br />
What you really want to ask yourself is this:<br />
-Do you want wade through the shit filled sewer that is Luclin to smell roses on the other side?  Or do you want to climb that difficult mountain for that awesome feeling of accomplishment that is Planar Progression?<br />
<br />
Ok, my analogies suck.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't get me wrong, I hate VT, the zone sucks ass but for a new guild just starting out, its a good place to learn to work together. You have the keying process, where members can group and get to know each other. VT mobs are fairly easy for level 65's but they can train on them for harder pop mobs, while getting lots of loot for the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Pre-RZ nerf, I'd have said VT is a good training ground to gear up for elementals. 4 days ago, a Korean guild that got dropped onto Maelin server when theirs was shut down just over a month ago, that had never seen Luclin, PoP or LDoN, broke into elementals.<br />
<br />
Raiding with about 80 every night, they went from level 60/0 and velious gear to killing RZtW in a month and a half, without ever setting foot in Ssra. Luclin/PoP were given to them free since their server was shut down, but almost all of them don't have LDoN.<br />
<br />
Fuck VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There are plenty of items in VT that aren't upgraded until PoTime. I mean that seriously, for ac/hp combo VT is just plain kick ass loot. EPs are better for the hp, but VT is insanely better for the ac. There are some clicky effects and focus effects that completely own, as well as some amazing unique items (AHR necklace, AHR gloves). <br />
<br />
  I also agree that it is one hell of a training ground for a guild. It sounds silly and nostalgic, but that's where I grew into tanking. You learn how to split tank with every tank you have, while still mezzing others. You also learn how to fight mobs that just plain suck, like AE silencing ones with another knockback AE. <br />
<br />
That's not to say VT is the only route, or that you'll be crippled without going. It takes some seriously dedicated time to get keyed up. If you're a guild that's dedicated to gearing everyone up, and willing to raid for 8+ hours in a single night, get keyed and have a blast. If you have alot of people that log in for short amounts of time, or people that get burnt out easily, don't even bother. You'll just be contributing to people leaving.<br />
<br />
  One more thing: Key CotH/rez bishes. Place them in good spots as early as you can. You can add mobs to your runs for minimal time, and skip considerable amounts of clearing if you do it right. Don't wait until you're finishing up with VT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As a member of a guild that is now EP and who did VT, obviously I'm gonna recommend it....mostly for the reasons people stated here. The non visible loot (trinkets) are outstanding, and it teaches your guild discipline...VT you can't switch off, or you have a nasty CR to deal with...no GY = pain...<br />
<br />
But as has been said, VT isn't needed, there are guilds on TP trying RZTW without ever bothering with VT...<br />
<br />
to have a real chance in VT, you will need at least 35 ppl keyed, otherwise the clearing just takes too long and repops will get you...the more the merrier tho...we did a VT clear with just 36...went on til 4am heh with a wipe midway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am grateful for your informative replies.<br />
<br />
I consider this a fairly &quot;big&quot; decision from a macro guild perspective.  You all are helping a lot.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Oh, 2 Euro guilds are in VT and 1 for sure maybe even 2 US guilds are in VT.  One of the Euro guilds is basically done though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When i left terris i think the record for most VT clearings was at about 11 or so.<br />
Thats why i found Nayl's post on page one somewhat funny.<br />
To get 7 clearings wouldnt be that bad considered that most guilds never get more opportunities due to upcoming guilds.<br />
<br />
While VT might be boring there are quite a bunch of items that will take a while to replace.<br />
AHR mask will last well into time, although we got lucky and had 2 masks drop in Time phase 3 when we did it the first time.<br />
I wont even mention utility items like ahr gloves, mini ahr mask (invisibility), human illuision head pieces for large races and so on.<br />
<br />
VT is no longer a requirement as more than one guild has proven, but it makes progression way easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Are you a small guild?  If so, VT gear will give you a good edge in POP progression.<br />
<br />
If you're a larger guild you can zerg your way with 72+ to EPs and VT gear won't matter so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Lots of items drop in VT - but its a pain getting keys and raids there take forever. These days, I'd skip the pain in the ass since virtually all elemental loot is better. A bazaar equipped guild can break the planes so its hard to justify the hassle of VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pros of VT:<br />
<br />
- The loot. There's a LOT of it. You walk out of there with 40 or more items a clearing.<br />
<br />
- Haste. From a melee perspective, it's one of the best places in all of EQ to acquire haste. Neck, belt, boots, cloak ALL drop in here. Belt, boots and neck all CAN drop off of trash mobs. <br />
<br />
- The loot. I have to bring this up a third time. It's just a lot of loot per clearing. That helps gear your people up very well, very quickly.<br />
<br />
Cons of VT:<br />
<br />
- Clearing is a pain in the butt. It's like swimming in molasses.<br />
<br />
- Keying up is a pain in the butt. It takes quite a bit of effort to key up a large guild.<br />
<br />
- The loot is inferior to a lot of elemental drops and time drops.<br />
<br />
- The warder thing is kind of stupid. I mean, I know WHY it's there. It's just, a kind of stupid way of achieving that effect.<br />
<br />
So I dunno. It's your call. In the long run, keying up your guild and tackling VT can get you some great gear that helps you complete the next expansion with a bit more margin for error. You don't NEED to get through VT to break into elementals. But I gotta say ... waiting for a shim choker or a Mith Maar belt to drop can get damn annoying when I consider how EACH and every VT clearing my guild has walked out of there with 3 to 4 haste items. Not to mention the 4 pairs of emp boots we got while KEYING up for VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">For keying for VT, what all is required.<br />
<br />
I know 10 shards from various places in luclin, usually solo, small groupable.<br />
<br />
Then 1 luclinite per person.<br />
<br />
I personaly dont consider the shards to be much of an issue.  The luclinite, a larger issue of dedicated scouting.  What else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">First things first: You'll need to be able to kill the Emperor.  For this you need:<br />
<br />
1) Bane weapons for all your melees (tanks, arguably, can ignore this as they'll likely be using their aggro weapons in spite of not doing actual damage).  Corrupted Shissar (bane) weapons are made by combining a Shissar weapon (drops off Elite Shissars in Ssra) with a Greenish Metal (rarely drops off named skeletons in the mines of Ssra... bring a PBAE crew and pack a lunch, heh).  The combine can be done in a normal forge and is no-fail.<br />
<br />
2) Key to the Emperor's room.  This requires a Taskmaster Pouch (off taskmasters ans wardens in the basement of Ssra), an Idol (from Comm1 in Ssra), a Ring (from Comm2 in Ssra), and an Insignia (from Generals and Advisors up on the 3rd floor of Ssra... bring a raid force and spend an evening there, you'll get ~20 per trip).  Combine the three items in the Taskmaster Pouch and voila: key to the Emp.<br />
<br />
Once you have a decent force with Emp keys, your guild can actually take a little breather.  Check the Emp regularly to see if he's up, and kill him when you can, but in between you can spend some time killing PoP Tier 1 bosses, Luclin bosses (for decent loot plus Orbs of Luclinite, which you'll need later), or returning to Velious to farm some decent drops (NToV, AoW, Sleepers, etc.).  Meanwhile your members can spend some time in groups farming shards for so-so xps, and get to know each other and help each other out.<br />
<br />
Each member will need:<br />
<br />
1) 10 shards from various parts of Luclin (some soloable, the rest one-groupable).<br />
<br />
2) A Glowing Orb of Luclinite.  Many bosses in Luclin drop these, and these bosses will always drop one orb per kill.  Orbs also drop from some named mobs in Ssra, so have your members tracking pops while they're farming their Emp key pieces.<br />
<br />
3) A Planar Rift, which results from killing the Emperor.  Each Emp kill will net the guild 36 Rifts, so you'll probably have to hit him a few times to get your guild outfitted, depending on your size.<br />
<br />
4) An Unadorned Scepter of Shadows.  This is a mini-quest in Akheva Ruins whereby the person will need to give an Essence Emerald (Necros make these with their Sacrifice spell) and a Wisp Stone (mage summoned) to an NPC.<br />
<br />
Combine the 10 shards in the scepter and it will create a 2-slot container.  Put the Orb and Rift in the container and hit combine.  Voila!  Your key to Vex Thal.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it a lot of work?  Hell yes.  My guild is finishing up with Velious currently, and we're actively preparing ourselves for VT.  We started shard hunting about 3 or 4 months ago, well before we were capable of defeating the Emperor... before we were in NToV in fact.  Our guild leader posts a message to the guild each month stating what our current objectives are, and each month he raises the number of shards that he expects most members to have collected.  It's now at the point where probably 50% of our 93 person guild has 8-10 shards, most of these people have their orbs, and our Emp key collection is growing steadily.<br />
<br />
We decided to take this steady approach to VT keying instead of the usual &quot;This month is VT month!  If you're not in Ssra while online, you will be guildremoved!&quot; method.  It has resulted in far less pressure on our members (although some do find the process overwhelming, heh), and it allows us to accomplish other goals at the same time, such as beating 99% of Velious and making our first brave attempts at Tier 1 bosses.  Some would look at us and say that we have no focus, but I would argue that our goal is just different than most... we want to see VT (and beyond), but we don't want to be overbearing to our members in our quest to get there.<br />
<br />
Will VT be worth it?  My opinion is yes.  The sense of accomplishment at having beaten an entire expansion will be well worth it to me.  If your goal is reaching Time as fast as you can, then you should probably skip it, but if you're just looking for challenging and rewarding experiences then I'd guess that VT should be on the list of things to do.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">just seeing aten's b00bies makes it well worth the pain of a VT key<br />
there ain't no better in EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">VT is a great place. I can still call otm to it because it's a wonderful place to equip recruits (Mainly off the first few bosses), and even some of the later items, you can use up untill time. If your skipping VT and heading straight to EP's, your gonna have some trouble, skipping content gives you trouble. I personally use Cloak of Icy shadows, Belt of Mastery, And Crimson Mask for myself from VT.<br />
<br />
don't miss out !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well, one thing mentioned here brought up a small benefit of the shard camping.  I am getting to know my guildees better.  When I MA, run the raid and am GL - well, I don't chit chat too much with anyone.  The shard camps provide those quiet moments so we can shoot the shit.  Granted, we usually run out of things to talk about....LOL.<br />
<br />
My plan, at this time, is to take the steady VT route.  I will have a suggested night a week to shard camp.  I will probably do the shard quota idea as I like it.  I was a part of a get keyed to VT in a month guild.....the guild exploded and had a mass exodus of people which hurt them for a couple months which was directly attributable to the forced campings.<br />
<br />
As usual, the combined opinions here on TSW are effective in exploring a topic enough to help make better decisions.<br />
<br />
I thank you all for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">VT rules and if you plan ahead it really isnt that big of an effort to get your guild keyed up for it.  I would start off the guild doing luclin and lower PoP named and camping emp keys and VT shards in single groups when raids arent going on.  It might take a few months to do this, but it is a low stress way to get everyone keyed up for VT and emp.<br />
<br />
Pesonally I think that the difficulty of getting the VT key is overstated.  I personally got all my shards in about 1 week of solid work and I helped perhaps 5-10 other guildmates get most of their shards in that same week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Agris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">also, emp/VT keys dont take THAT long, we keyed up 55 people in about 1.5 months and had roughly 70 at 2 months. <br />
<br />
Dont forget the entire time you're keying up, you can still do ToV and low end PoP. No need to pigeonhole yourselves.<br />
<br />
It really serves as not only a good basis for a guild to jump off of, but also as a &quot;stress test&quot; for a new guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just did a Full VT clearing last night, It does bring a smile to my face to watch guildies I have been with for a long time, get to loot an Item that they really been wishing for.<br />
