<br />
Couple of thoughts for you:<br />
<br />
1) Although we haven't talked very much about it, the team has been working very hard on the Melee changes. Expect something in mid-December (we'll announce it and discuss it in the upcoming chat) that far exceeds what people are expecting. The bottom line is our major goal was to completely revise the way melee combat is done in EQ. You can look forward to the Melee types becoming much more interactive and able to do a whole lot more cool things during combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see what they do.<br />

Don't know how accurate this is since like I said someone just &quot;said they heard&quot; that.  guessing ala WoW?  Again I might be wrong and that might just be peeps guessing and such.</div></div><hr />
