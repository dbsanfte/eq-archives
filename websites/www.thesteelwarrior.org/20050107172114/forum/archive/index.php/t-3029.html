I am can't verify that though. This also appears to be a step below a higher lvl armor that costs around 1500pts.piece, but has 110 HPs on the BP...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These pieces became visible to me yesterday. All parts have recommended Level 65, are wearable by all plate classes and have three augmentation slots (Type 1, 2 and 3). Price for each one is 760 points. They are obtained by adventuring in Miragul's Menagerie. <br />

And yea, if they had a clue, those would be RNG PAL SHD CLR, and Warriors have another set with the HP converted to mana and the int/wis converted to STA.<br />

<br />
Change all the +int/wis to +stm and the stuff will at least give a nod to class balance, forcing the knights to choose between mana and hp, instead of having the mana be a give me and all 4 (or 5 if you count clerics) choosing +stm as their type 1 buff. <br />

<br />
slap in some sta/hp/regen/ac augs as you adventure and your set. till elemental<br />
<br />
heck the first set at 150 points each from mm will get you through lodn till you can get this set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how they decided to deal with the ALL plate classes ISSUE ...<br />
<br />
Augmentations.<br />
<br />
NOW you can take their base PLATE CLASS BP and TAILOR it to your actual class. (Well after you sink more time into the game, /snicker).<br />
<br />
So an SK can put say, FT, some mana and some extra AC on it with a slot 1, slot 2 and slot 3 aug.<br />
<br />
A WARRIOR can put HPs, HPs and Vengance ... or HPs, STA, Aura of Battle.<br />
<br />
Soooooo, once you're DONE, the two classes have taken their BP in different directions, and tailored it more to their own needs.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm sure a lot of the hybrids actually welcome a chance to get to the FT cap on some relatively USEFUL gear that they don't have to compete with casters for.<br />
<br />
Or some other hybrid friendly Slot 3 augmentation (like Guard or something like that).<br />
<br />
And all you have to do is grind out a couple thousand more adventure points!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matthias</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hybrids should have to put mana on it, it shouldn't just come with..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a pretty good armorset with the ability to be quite extensively upgraded through augmentations.  The catch?   You must sell your soul and live in LDoN to be able to afford all the proper augmentations to properly tailor this armor set to your class.  For those of us with somewhat of a schedule, I say fuck it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to my previous post, I keep to myself how stupid the availability of decent greaves are to warriors in the game who don't worship Rallos Wankerboy, but those greaves look mighty attractive if you ask me.  With the ability to be upgraded via three different augmentation slots, they could surpass anything buyable or even droppable until the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I just take a look at the stats and this is what I see:<br />
<br />
<br />
44ac = good for all plate classes<br />
<br />
8sta = good for all plate classes<br />
<br />
8cha = good for bards<br />
<br />
5wis/int = good for knights and bard<br />
<br />
70hp = good for all plate classes<br />
<br />
65mana = good for knights and bard<br />
<br />
resists = Good for all<br />
<br />
So, from the same piece of gear, knights and bards get more innate bonuses (I dont care about augments), if it should have been fair for all plate classes, it should have been 44ac 8sta 70hp resists. So, knights and bards can put mana, FT, whatever, warriors can put HP/sta, Vengeance/ Auras, or whatever.<br />
But then again, they make plate armor for all the plate classes and they screw warriors more than anyone else... at least, thats how I see it, and I wonder... why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think you guys are getting a little too far a head of your selves, more classes use mana then dont. we're the only plate class that doesnt. in all fairness, putting mana on it helps the majority. i do agree how ever that the base stats out right blow on most of this stuff, such as charisma, which is on every other piece while really only useble for 1 class under special situations. i can deal with the int/wis on a few of these pieces, as i said before, more plate classes use mana than dont. i guess what this boils down to is this set wasnt made with higher lvl warriors i mind.</div></div><hr />

Guess what ?  Bullshit <br />
<br />
I pay 1500 points for Ac63 hp75<br />
A pal/sk pays 1500 points for  Ac63 hp75 mana75<br />
<br />
Dont you see something actually WRONG there ?<br />
Oh no you dont, well let me enlighten you<br />
<br />
THIS SHIT IS SUPPOSED TO BE NEAR ORNATE LVL.<br />
THIS SHIT IS EVEN NOT WARRIOR FRIENDLY.<br />
<br />
Lets took a look back to EQ history ....<br />
Kunark Armor : I had More HP/AC<br />
Velious Armor : I had More HP/AC<br />
SoL Armor : No class Armor<br />
PoP Ornate : I had more HP/AC<br />
PoP Elemental : I had more HP/AC<br />
<br />
At least when a fucking pal/sk/cleric/bard looted ornate/elemental<br />
I knew i would get a small hp bonus. Caus its all about HP.<br />
Now i dont even get that HP bonus.<br />
<br />
And dont give me the &quot;hey u can custumise it&quot;.... Guess what ?<br />
 <br />
Warrior Going full HP i end up with 150hp<br />
Pal/SK/Cler/Bard Going full HP end up with 150hp/75mana<br />
<br />
So for the &quot;same price&quot; they get 75 free mana ?<br />
<br />
HELLLOOO REALITY CHECK<br />
<br />
What ever happens, however you choose to &quot;Customise&quot; it.<br />
They get 75 free mana !<br />
<br />
Well thats racism, and i'm starting to believe SoE hates us <br />
even more than the KKK hates non WASP.<br />
<br />
You CAN NOT FUCKING MIX mana classes &amp; non mana classes.<br />
<br />
Wanna make custom mods ?<br />
60hp -40 mana<br />
40hp 25 mana<br />
20hp 50 mana<br />
<br />
OR make some warrior only HP mods !<br />
<br />
That way you can really customise.<br />
<br />
ATM a SK can have the same HP as a warrior and 75 FREE MANA.<br />
Thats FUCKING WRONG.<br />
<br />
They should get a total a lot greater than our HP number.<br />
But HP should NOT BE EQUAL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I see WRONG there is I pay 1500 points for an AC 29 PIECE OF SHIT BP that ALSO has mana on it and weighs too damn much.<br />
<br />
Don't cry to me about that nonsense. Not until ALL OF YOUR ARMOR IS ALSO TAGGED DRUID/BEASTLORD and has the AC of wet paper towels (not even the 2-ply bounty paper towels).<br />
<br />
I'll ignore the comment about fellatio. You're a warrior, you've been hit on the head far too many times.<br />

Basically, an AA that changed that mana on your armor to hp at a certain ratio (20% of all mana changed to hp at first level...maybe up to 50 or 70% of all mana changed to hp).  Only affects equipment +mana.  Then there'd be little issue with making all/all or plate class/all armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazak</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like that idea.  I'm an sk, but in general I'm very sympathetic to these issues about all/all and all plate class armor.  The argument seems clear, hybrids get more benefit from these pieces than warriors do.  Making it possible for warriors to shift the mana to hp seems like a great way to at least partially balance this.  Hell, maybe it could turn the mana in ac and hp buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Superchum, what you are saying about leather is EXACTLY what pisses most of us off about these all plate pieces of crap: it benefits the &quot;lower AC&quot; and mana using classes more than us. Thats what sucks so hard about multi-class itemization.<br />
<br />
Now if they would give us pure melees a HP/Mana exchange rate, like say Warriors 1:1, Monks 0.8:1 and rogues 0.6 or 0.7:1 it might not stick in our throats so badly, and it wouldn't feel like 95% of the game is geared to the casting classes... and I disagree that this should be an AA, it should be innate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But someone jumped all on my shit for merely pointing out that as a warrior, in LDoN, you at LEAST have the option of CUSTOMIZING your LDoN armor to be more beneficial to your melee needs.<br />
<br />
You don't get that option in the other expansions.</div></div><hr />

IMO there should be 3 types of plate armor - High HP/ High AC, high HP/low mana, high mana/low HP. This would give each class an option that would be best suited to their class and it would also help restore the slight stats advantage pure melees are supposed to have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the 1500 point  armour particularlly the 1500 point legs and the known augments, I'm a bit worried.<br />
<br />
Given the current known all/all augmentations.  From a warrior point of view it is possible for them to have the same hp as elemental legs but 20 ac less.    Or one could have slightly more ac then the warrior elemental legs but 40 less hp.  However that's at the expense of 4500 - 6000 points to get one gear slot.  So if these legs would have one more augment slot they would be equivilant to the Warrior Elementals.  Ok fine.  Problem as others have pointed out, is that the Knights can then get the equivilant for the warrior Elemental and we can't get better then they.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we will see some Warrior only augments or augments that give deterimental effects to others.  But right now I'm 'reasonably' confident that SOE will do something about this given the fact that it really is creating a disparagy that hasn't been seen since Lustrous Russet was put in the game.  And we know how that turned out :)</div></div><hr />

You really think the 0.5 - 1 hp per sta we get more is gonna make a visible difference whatsoever considering it caps at 305?

Or we could just slap on every stat and let everyone use it and call it balanced! If you want, go look on Allakhazam's or something and compare the class specific armor before Sony got lazy. <br />

<br />
No, in all seriousness, I can SEE the point.  You want class specific armor.  You act like there isn't such a thing in the game any more.  When in fact, there were two different sets of class specific armor in PoP.  We can all agree that LoY wasn't exactly a full-fledged expansion, and bank space and armor dyes are about all that came out of that (and frogs).  Now, less than a week into PoP, was the Ornate and Elemental armor completely discovered?<br />
<br />
Get YOUR head out of YOUR ass.  Even the class specific armor there is now drops as Plate, Leather, or Cloth.  Are you pissed you are sharing the Elemental and Ornate molds with the other plate classes?  Or are you mad the bard and the cleric are having more fun than you still?<br />
<br />
So your armor has +mana on it.  That doesn't make you a WORSE tank, does it?</div></div><hr />

You have entirely missed the point.  This is not about ease of gathering gear, this is about balance. Since the release of NTOV all/all items warriors have been greatly concerned about game balance.  The reason we have been concerned is because our sole benefit to groups and raids is our ability to take damage.  When you give that identical benefit to other classes that have additional benefits like group taps, group heals, buffs, FDs and increased agro control, it unbalances the classes. <br />
<br />
SoE stated that it intends to look into class balance.  SoE also stated that LDON was not, however, about class balance.<br />
<br />
Well, no shit Sherlock.  Not only did they NOT balance the classes with this expansion, but they significantly fucked balance up even more.  The exact same gear that warriors will wear is the gear that every other plate class will wear, with the same exact stats and benefits.  The exact same augmentations that warriors want are the augmentations that every other tank class will have, with the exact same stats and benefits.<br />
<br />
In fact, the only difference is that the same gear has ADDITIONAL useful benefits for those other classes that do nothing at all for a warrior.  Its laziness on Sony's part and its unhelpful. <br />
<br />
I could care fucking less if SoE has warriors searching high and fucking low for our gear, killing ourselves for years, and wracking up 103289490201890198 points.  I DO care that SoE has made superior plate armor that is IDENTICAL for all classes.  Because when I'm toting around 6k unbuffed in my slick new LDON threads (yeah, I'm uber, bow down), I'm just pleased as a peach that every other tank class will also be toting around 6k unbuffed...and that extra 100mana and 10 wisdom/int to help them with their group taps, group heals, stuns, DD's....</div></div><hr />

i'm pretty sure, this was done for the same reason druids were given a mini CH. speaking outside the warrior box to show the bigger picture which effects everyone, when your trying to get a group together i doubt there always a cleric sitting around some where with LFG up, likewise i doubt there will always be a shammy lfg. usually a decent druid can heal a decent tank in an exp group and do a pretty good job of it, and when i cant find a shammy, i know i can always try to find a chanter or even a beastlord. so on the same note, if a group cant find a warrior they should be able to find some other kind of tank. but there will always be a class that is better at doing some thing than another other classes that can do similar. bards can mez, but we all know a chanter is better at it. clerics will always heal better, shammies will have better slows (and less agro doing it), and warriors will tank better, but your options shouldn't be limited because 1 class is the best at doing it.<br />
<br />
i understand the point, but all i'm hearing is a gimmie gimmie, i should be better than you attitude. until you hit the end game, there will always be a pally or a SK better off than a warrior that isnt decked out in elemental/time loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game balance problems stem from the structure of the classes themselves.  We have a class structure that is too rigidly defined.  You select &quot;Warrior&quot; or &quot;Shadowknight&quot; on the first screen you see, and you are stuck with what that entails.<br />
<br />
New games coming out have a much more intertwined and subtle structure to the classes.  There should be a limited number of classes (warrior, priest, caster) with many more sub-classes.  After chosing a class, and as you level and skills become available, you should be able to chose one at the expense of not chosing another (ability to cast spells vs. ability to take damage, for example).  This is where you get sub-classes.  Tweaking the skills would make balancing the classes quite a bit easier.<br />
<br />
Without a more complex class system, it is very difficult for Sony to balance the classes.  You can't exactly take spells away form the knights.  And you can't exactly allow tanks to cast spells.  Every change you make has an effect on the otehr 14 classes.<br />
<br />
I still don't quite understand what it is you want.  I see why you are angry about the current plate, if not for reasons of utility to non-warrior classes, but because I think it is retarded for a Cleric, Warrior, and Bard to all be wearing identical armor.  It just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is that Warriors are not better tanks, except in raiding situations where Defensive is needed.  Find me a non-tank class that would prefer a 7khp 1200ac warrior versus a 7khp 1200ac paladin/shadowknight for tanking?<br />
<br />
The point is that warriors are *not* preferred for tanking, generally, except in situations that specifically require Defensive.<br />
<br />
The price for Knights having spells should have been that they were not as able to take the punishment of a warrior.  Groups could think about good aggro control versus healer mana, and make their decision accordingly.<br />
<br />
With this LDoN armor, the choice becomes much easier: Why have a warrior, when a knight can take the damage *and* maintain aggro through mezzing, slows, nukes, dots, etc.?  It's a no brainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but there will always be a class that is better at doing some thing than another other classes that can do similar. bards can mez, but we all know a chanter is better at it. clerics will always heal better, shammies will have better slows (and less agro doing it), and warriors will tank better, <br />
<br />
No, this response makes clear that you don't understand the point. A cleric will always be better at healing, yes, because their healing spells are superior, faster, more versatile. <br />
<br />
But why is a warrior a superior tank?  Well, I guess it must be our ability to take damage, mitigate damage and avoid being hit.  Except that Knights get the same HP mitigation and avoidance AA and one gets almost soloable lifetaps and one gets almost soloable heals.  And now they have the same HP and same AC on their gear. <br />
<br />
There IS no difference that makes a warrior a better tank.  In fact, with our 50% chance to taunt, versus a knights ability to chain-cast agro spells, I'd say we are at a distinct disadvantage.<br />
<br />
Listen, I hate class boards where the class just bitches.  But I'm telling you that you are buying into the SoE drivel that &quot;warriors are better tanks&quot; without actually looking at the facts.  But, hey, that's okay.  We need more players who buy into that rumor because that is how I get pick-up groups. :p <br />
<br />
And, yeah, Danca, it may not be easy for SoE to balance the melee classes.  But I'll tell you one way that they can totally fuck it up: decreasing the AC/HP gap with identical plate gear.</div></div><hr />

This is really the key to the discussion. A couple of years ago, it was a lot harder for a pally/SK to get any where near the HP/AC a warrior with similar gear had. Class specific armor from Kunark, to Velious, and to Ornate/Elem gave warriors an advantage in AC/HP. It was not a huge difference, but still there was still an advantage.<br />
<br />
Now with LDoN, the slim advantage in gear is going away, and it's not just on the top of the line uber gear, it's available to anyone with enough time to grind away a couple thousand LDoN adventure points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you been LFG too long lately?  I think you've lost your mind.  You thinking that warriors suck out loud has led others, without educated opinions, to think the same thing, and to not pick you for a group.<br />
<br />
I have no problem finding groups, and I have no problem tanking in damn near every situation.<br />
<br />
Maybe you need to stop worrying about your ability and worry about your fun level.  If you really think knights are more fun to play (which is really what it comes down to in the end) then go play a Knight.  Me?  Personally?  I have fun with a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
Examples of tanking differences (according to eqrankings.com, among the highest HP): <br />
Sharkon - Erudite Shadowknight - 7623 HP (link (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24425))<br />
Heebee - Half-Elf Paladin - 7657 HP (link (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=559134))<br />
Tanamar - Dark Elf Warrior - 8824 HP (link (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264107))<br />
<br />
Warriors without an advantage?  Looks like a 1200 HP advantage to me, at the extreme &quot;end game&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what, big freaking deal. If it makes clerics work harder for groups, all for the better. I'm tired of those sorry pampered babies. Not like they'll even notice that group #1 doesn't offer them a position because they'll have like 3 other offers.<br />
<br />
Level 61 clerics with 10 aa and 0 flags can join elemental guilds on some servers. But when looking at warrior or even druid requirements for the same guild it's usually 65 with a fair ammount of flags and around 90-120 AA<br />
<br />
I mean seriously I've seen the worst clerics join up with some of the best guilds on my server just because their class is so group/raid friendly that they just can't get enough even with 7+ solid clerics.</div></div><hr />

Danca<br />
Would you prefer they want the warrior? There should be NO preference!<br />
Wrong.  There should be a different preference!  Warriors should clearly be better in HP/AC, it is after all what our class does.  Knights are obviously more versatile with agro with their spells.  So the question each group should ask themselves, as Poosha already really eloquently put it, is &quot;good aggro control versus healer mana, and make their decision accordingly.&quot; <br />
<br />
I think you've lost your mind. <br />
Thanks for that elucidating comment.  I think you are ignorant so now we both have our varied opinions. <br />
<br />
Of course I love playing a warrior.  Its challenging and it can be frustrating. Of course I've had fun playing her for going on 4 years now.  But that doesn't mean I'll go with the flow when I witness Sony completely eradicate the armor balance between us and Knights.  We don't have spells, we don't get highest aggro, we lose our mitigation/avoidance superiority...Jesus, give us something here.</div></div><hr />

You're right Danca, there should be no preference.  But, seeing as how now both pally and warr have 7khp and 1200 ac, PLUS the pallys have perfect agro control...  How exactly would you now remove this obvious advantage from the pally, which obviously makes them the preferred choice ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
How it should have been done:-<br />
<br />
The base armour would have AC as described above, but no stats.  No HP, no mana, no STA, nothing; but lots of augmentation slots, with maybe four free augmentations when you buy a top end piece.<br />
<br />
That way, a cleric wearing that armour might enhance it with a load of +mana, maybe some +WIS, some focus effects, and a few hp.  A knight might go for hp, mana, maybe some INT/WIS/STA, and some flowing thought or vengeance, while the warrior can go straight AC, HP, and vengeance.<br />
<br />
Bards might put some CHA and hp on it and a bit of flowing thought, I don't really know; to me, bards are just half elves with pony tails and silly coloured armour who do a load of stuff and don't talk much.<br />
<br />
The point of the exercise is that people don't have to pay points for shit they won't use, and people who'll use lots of different stuff on the armour have to make compromises.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point wasn't that warriors aren't *currently* preferred (although some warriors do find cause to complain, and perhaps for them the reasons are justified), my point was that *in the future* (i.e. once many warriors/knights get their hands on this new armor) the balance will be seriously in the favour of the knights.<br />
<br />
I currently have very little trouble finding a group, mostly due to the fact that I'm decently equipped for someone at &quot;my stage&quot; of the game (pre-NToV), plus I have many friends who choose to group with me both for my tanking and my company (queue heartwarming background music).  :)<br />
<br />
I'm not going to do anything silly like strip down my warrior and start a paladin, nor am I going to stop playing EQ, but that doesn't mean I can't help clarify the point that a new game feature may very well throw off the delicate balance between the various tank classes.<br />
<br />
Heck, I wouldn't be at all surprised if (as was hinted at earlier) clerics and bards are chosen to tank if they're sporting a full suit of this new armor.  Not in the most dangerous locations, sure, but certainly for spots where damage mitigation isn't crucial.  Break out the bandaids, boys and girls, we're on heals! :D<br />
<br />
(And no, I don't subscribe to the notion that clerics and druids are terribly out of balance with each other... I'll choose either, and sometimes both, depending on where I want the group to go)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cardinal</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well LoDN will just accentuate the clear end game issue about Warrior / knight balance.  In the endgame guilds who have been in Time for a long while,  Knights are now effectively equaling warrior HP/AC, in some cases exceeding (due to the ability to actually use a shield and a 1H'r).  The innate warrior edge in HP/Ac effectively disappears as everyone gears up in Time all/all plate gear.  Now LoDN brings a new leveling field to the not-so-endgame crowd.  The all/all plate class armors filter down for the masses.  Pally/SK rejoice...  the warrior class has met the ultimate in marginalization!<br />
<br />
So what are we left with?  Warriors still have an edge in pure melee skills.  So if you ignore spell usage, a warrior is more DPS. However, I will presume, for the sake of argument, that the knight in comparison will have spells scribed in their spellbook, so exactly how much is an edge in pure melee dps alone worth?  <br />
So Warriors have some mitigation skill that knights lack, but defense caps are the same, and the combat tables sure seem awful similar..... (tell me clerics of the world, given equally geared axp'd warrior/knights which would you rather heal?)<br />
<br />
Add the fact that the knight has predictable aggro ability, self heal (heal or tap), a host of other useful abilities..... ( FD'ing for the SK, cleansing, ghetto res's etc for the pally to name but a few) where does that leave the warrior?  <br />
<br />
Back to the golden 3 min of glory....  we get to hit defensive and live versus the toughest bosses where a knight class will wilt.... way cool for tanking Tallon Zek in Time, but of questionable usefulness in the normal playtime most average warriors see. . .<br />
<br />
Grats Sony, in the search of a means to wring out the last penny from the EQ lifespan, you manage to secure the backseat status of one class in favor of two others. Game balance is, and has been, out the window for ages. No reason to worry about it for now ;)<br />

This kills me.  And when we start doin the HP/AC compare (which really bugs me) it turns out cause of agro lock that the pallie is usually a better choice (which really hurts me after 4 years of bustin my butt to be the best warr I can).  And yes my friends this has happened 3x in the last week.<br />
<br />
It was bad enough on raids not having a real job (we all know 1-2 *maybe* 3-4 rock star warrs in each guild usually get the nod for the big show) on raids but to have folks even think about relegating a warr from MA in exp groups is just criminal.  I mean come on....WE CANT DO ANYTHING ELSE (yuch dps, yuch agro, yuch utility abilities)!!!   <br />
<br />
And then to have our best armor have wis/int and mana on it as a general design is just another slap.  Not to mention that other classes can now add EB like effects to their weapons.<br />
<br />
Folks if you are a paladin about to mouth back about this just sit back for a sec and put on our shoes.  Its just plain SAD that we are getting to such a state of parity.  On the other hand I know how much it would suck for a pallie/sk to never get the nod as tank in an exp group (yup Kunark I was there) but there has to be some sort of better balance to be had.  Some of my best friends are Paladins so I know the kind of pain you guys used to have (once upon a time there was joke that Paladins had become extinct).<br />
<br />
LDON while fun as hell isn't going to remain that way once the general masses (not just the PoT folks) have parity from this cookie cutter armor &amp; procs for everyone approach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a simple solution to this. Rather than have the Adventure merchants sell a completed piece of armor - have them sell an armor mold/pattern a la elemental/ornate. This would allow for class specific armor types that would address the balance issues that generic armor introduces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrong. There should be a different preference! Warriors should clearly be better in HP/AC, it is after all what our class does. Knights are obviously more versatile with agro with their spells. So the question each group should ask themselves, as Poosha already really eloquently put it, is &quot;good aggro control versus healer mana, and make their decision accordingly.&quot;<br />
If warriors have more HP and AC, but we have no way to maintain aggro, which is what the knights do so well, what the hell kind of use are we in most situations? How do we benefit (as an over-the-top example) from having 20K HP and 5000 AC if we can't get the mob to hit us and be interested in us rather than in the knights?<br />
<br />
No...although having more HP and AC is always nice, we don't need more HP and AC nearly as much as we need better taunt and aggro control, and a better innate mitigation multiplier than the knight classes. That way, we're able to do what we need to do: keep the mob's attention, while at the same time being more efficient for clerics and their brethren to heal us.<br />
<br />
If we had those three things (taunt, aggro, mitigation), then the fact that our armor has the same 100 HP as the knights' won't matter so much, because we'll know that our 100 HP will be working more like 125 HP's when the combat formulas are applied. Picking the SK for tanking over the warrior shouldn't be about aggro, it should be about accepting more mana for healing against better DPS due to their spells. Picking a paladin for tanking over a warrior should not be about aggro, it should be about better mana conservation when healing the tank against lower DPS than the warrior.<br />
<br />
Of course, this would require tweaking a lot more than just warriors, but then, and only then, will there truly be a choice between knights and warriors as tanks. Until then, it's just lip service, and arguing over some suit of armor's stats isn't helping us much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A warrior without aggro is useless.  I think everyone here understands this, and this topic has been brought up in many other forums.<br />
<br />
This topic is regarding plate armor purchasable from vendors in the newest EQ expansion.<br />
<br />
Nothing has been done to provide Warriors with a way to hold aggro better (nothing that knights couldn't also do, anyway).  But knights have received a huge boost to their ability to avoid and mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
PoP, better than any expansion I played before, helped to bring something of a balance between warriors and knights by forcing groups to decide whether aggro or healing were more important for their success.  LDoN, in one swell foop, has set the wheels in motion to completely destroy that balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And while we are at it think of it this way. All that mana on those suits of armor mitigate the fact that the cleric is healing the knight more. That knight can heal himself more effeciently saving that &quot;extra&quot; mana, so the difference between tanks is mute. Now if you think of it that way, the argument is null and it obviously benefits the knights alot more then us.</div></div><hr />

yes there might be a few knights that opt to add the same effects to the armor that you do, BUT most of tehm (if they aren't stupid) will add things that will be more useful to them...<br />
i.e... FT, regen.... while 90% of the warriors will add the HP/AC/ATK items.<br />
to me that is a hard choice for the knights to make.<br />
<br />
and for this stuff about well everyone else gets this to, makes you sound like spoiled lil brats that don't want to share.<br />
seems to me that everyone that plays now only wants to take the easy way of doing things; by this i mean they don'twant to take the time to learn how to play their class and only want things handed to them.<br />
<br />
like someone said if this is the buyable stuff what will drop on raids? <br />
<br />
is the way i see it, this armor is to help those people that aren't in &quot;uber&quot; raiding guilds have a chance to compete with the players that are. will also allow them a bit of a easier time getting into them guilds later on if they want to. both players work hard for the things they get.<br />
<br />
the ones that complain about not being MT in a group, unless you all forgot warriors do get other disc's besides /def, warriors also get the opposite of that, one that increases their DPS.<br />
<br />
for the 1hd + shield coment, hey you like the idea of useing a 1hder and shield then go ahead and do.</div></div><hr />

Its not what if, its actual, no one is worrying about it either, just concerned that in terms of bang for buck warriors are getting shafted, we spend the same amount of adventure points to receive a LOT less in return.<br />
<br />

to me that is a hard choice for the knights to make.<br />
<br />
That choice is made easier for them by a deeper mana pool available, which mitigates the requirement for FT, regen i.e. effects that arnt going to facilitate their role as the MT in XP groups, Ill be very surprised if Knights dont go for the same type of augments Warriors would choose, what you DONT need to choose are int, wis stat increases and mana increases because you get those 3 boosted over and above the stats we need, therefore the gap between the benefit we receive from the same equipment as you is widened even further.<br />
<br />
 this stuff about well everyone else gets this to, makes you sound like spoiled lil brats that don't want to share.<br />
<br />
What most of us are asking for is buyable armour tailored to a specific class rather than a one item fits all, which is lazy and rushed itemisation, similar to any turn in armour such as elemental, ornate, SS, Thurg etc etc etc.. Or do you consider that a spoiled brat approach?<br />
<br />
seems to me that everyone that plays now only wants to take the easy way of doing things; by this i mean they don'twant to take the time to learn how to play their class and only want things handed to them.<br />
<br />
That is a generic and sweeping comment that does not seem germane to the topic being discussed, care to elaborate how that statement relates to the debate at hand?  Seems to me you want to receive better equipment as us for the same amount of time and effort invested.<br />
<br />
 someone said if this is the buyable stuff what will drop on raids?<br />
<br />
Well that remains to be seen.<br />
<br />

I totally agree.<br />
<br />

<br />
You do of course have a comprehensive understanding of the down side of our offensive discs and their reuse time?  What, whats that I hear? Is it a pin dropping 2 miles away?<br />

In order to share you have to actually have something in the first place.  As it is, we basically get the pally/sk scraps.<br />

I'm confused.  Are you saying because warrs do not want wis/int/mana on our gear makes us &quot;lil brats&quot;?  If not please clarify?<br />
<br />
the ones that complain about not being MT in a group, unless you all forgot warriors do get other disc's besides /def, warriors also get the opposite of that, one that increases their DPS. <br />
<br />
You can't run precise or aggressive discs (the only tangible offensive ones I can think of with a decent enough re-cycle time)non-stop..the reasons being rather obvious (basically you are LOCKED into them for 3 mins at a pop...if circumstances change in those 3 mins you can't tank worth a darn...not exactly LDON friendly).<br />
<br />
<br />
seems to me that everyone that plays now only wants to take the easy way of doing things; by this i mean they don'twant to take the time to learn how to play their class and only want things handed to them. <br />
<br />
I'm confused here as well.  Are you asserting that the warrs on this board don't know how to play their class?  If not who is &quot;everyone&quot;?  What specifically is &quot;everyone&quot; being asking to be &quot;handed&quot; to them?  By &quot;handed&quot; do you mean requesting proper itemization, more agro etc?  Please clarify.<br />
<br />
=============<br />
From another post (which was clearly written):<br />
<br />
Nothing has been done to provide Warriors with a way to hold aggro better (nothing that knights couldn't also do, anyway). <br />
<br />
Actually if I understand correctly they have given us the opportunity to double up our EB procs (where if you wielded 2 EB weapons before you can now add a +300 Anger mod to both theoretically giving 4 EB style procs in play).  Conversely other classes can now add an Anger proc to their weapons as well...so I suppose we maintain our &quot;EB proc lead of + procs ;-)&quot;</div></div><hr />

true i do wish they had more peices with sta on them, i know with my kinght class toons i will be putting FT and regen type augs on them along with a dex or mana aug, and with my warrior will be putting hp effecting things.<br />
ft and regen type items means more mana for spells, and less down time.<br />
and yo uall know why on the hp things for the warrior.<br />
<br />
and the handed easy comment was this, people before LDoN, can't say about LDoN yet cause is to soon to tell, looked for the easiest way to gain things, ie. exp, gear, spells.. <br />
i wasn't inferring that people here don't know how to play their class. was sayign that with a lil bit more work a warrior can mt just fine in a group, just have to make a lil bit of comp at frist to work around RNG on procs.<br />
<br />
i might have put that comment in the wrong place, am new to the board so please be patient.<br />
<br />
the what ifs sentance was tied into the yes there might be sentance.<br />
<br />
read what i posted with a opened mind, without being touchy about what was said. in no way was i tring to flame anyone, but was tring to get everyone to see that, this is what is put in the game, so make do with it as best you can. and i do play both a warrior and a SK, can't stand playing a pally. there are a few items on my sk that have no int but have wis on them, but i have to use them cause it is the best i can get atm. would like you all to take a min sometime and look at the major plate pieces out there and see just how many have sta, int, and wis on them and how many have sta, and wis. for a sk wis is just as useless to them as it is to you.<br />
<br />
i was probly out of line for saying the share comment, but that is something that gets to me. people that complain about items and say oh it shoudl just have the things on it that better suit our class, not just here but on other boards to, when the items is set up for all plate classes or all classes. i know it is something that will always happen, but gets old after a bit.<br />
<br />
and for the offensive disc, it was ment for those that don't play a warrior and come here to see hey yeah warriors do get somethign other then /deff and have can do something other then /deff one raid boss mobs. it was to say hey warriors are useless in exp groups. in LDoN is alot of off tanking for CC, so warriors can stack better, and yes i know so can kinghts to. on one mob there are ways to improve the second warriors dps if they aren't the mt. <br />
<br />
to clarify something , i play both a high lvl sk and a high lvl warrior, and i do see that warriors need improvements, but i also see that with sup par gear o nthe warrior he has more hp and ac then the nicely geared sk does. a fix to the agro is one thing to be improved but have posted my idea on that one in a diff thread here.<br />
<br />
and the 1hder and shield comment is this, for the most part what i have seen is that the nice 1hdrs that i would use with a shield (most sk's, can't say about pallies, perffer a 2hder cause of aa's) can also be used by warriors along with the same shields. so if you like the idea of more ac with a shield then by all means go ahead and use the shield if yo uwant to.<br />
<br />
look at this armor this way, for most warriors if they get this armor they will add hp type things.<br />
most knights might add one or 2 but not the full 3 so you will still have a hp lead.<br />
<br />
i think i covered all the points brought up if i missed one i am sorry and will try to explain myself</div></div><hr />

<br />
My feedback message will sound like this:<br />
<br />
LDoN. In order to get a more balanced plate armor award from the adventure merchants, warriors should get different armor sets.<br />
<br />
These armor sets should be stripped from WIS, INT en Mana. To compensate this, the armor should have an increase in the traditional melee stats like AC, HP, STA, AGI and DEX. <br />
<br />
In the design process it should also be taken into account that warriors, unlike the other plate classes, didn't receive spell upgrades. Therefore the armor upgrade shouldn't be an exchange of stats (e.g. 6 DEX for 6 WIS) only.<br />
<br />
Why break with a tradition?<br />

I have yet to hear anyone say that warriors flat out, straight up, CAN'T TANK. We can tank alright, but the other classes have to know their class for the group to succeed.<br />
<br />
While we are putting proccing  procs in our weapons to hopefully give us more reliable aggro, knights are further closing the gap in the AC/HP gap, which is at a minimum, right now.</div></div><hr />

For the record, my boyfriend is a 65 SK with approximately the same number of AA that I have.  He has about 700HP less than I have raid buffed.  He sure as fuck won't be upgrading with Regen and FT.  SK's have numerous LT dots that completely negate the need for Regen.  With C5 they have no real need whatsoever for FT since they have both mana taps and a small mana pool.  <br />
<br />
Maybe for you the Knight class difference in HP/AC is huge.  That, sir, would be because you are picking all the wrong fucking upgrades.

You STILL get exp. (Good exp no less)<br />

You accumulate points and you get to buy stuff you could never have unless you farmed PP to buy in the bazaar ALL THE TIME.<br />

There may be some complaints regarding LDON (I havent found any) but LDoN being a time sink isn't one of them.<br />

Not only that but if you are casual, check out the Miragul's armor. It is a huge increase to Vindi and below guilds and you can get two pieces of armor in the time it takes to get one Royal Attendant. It is only 15 adventures. You can get two pieces a month if you play 1.5-2.0 hours a day.<br />

Where is the time sink? I'm wondering that too.  With the old time sinks, you had to wait hours or days, even sitting on your ass killing mobs that gave you little to no exp for your level, or compete with other guilds to get named spawns.<br />
<br />
Now, you can get a dungeon pretty much whenever you want (no real competition), you're fighting mobs which give nice exp for your level, you're actually moving around and fighting through a dungeon, you're getting drops and sometimes a basic augment, and in addition to all that you're getting points which you can save towards nice armor (which class gets a better deal out of this is another argument) without spending 100+k for a full set.<br />
<br />
If this is a time sink...I much prefer this form of time sink to every other form done before.  At least this time you can get something other than the one item your working towards.<br />

Oh, and btw Dator...you get about 51 points per successful adventure at 65, not 22 or so.  I got 32 points for an adventure on my beastlord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know people always get down on SOE customer service, but the lack of warrior items shouldn't be a difficult fix.  Who do we contact about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;There may be some complaints regarding LDON (I havent found any)&quot;<br />
<br />
While I have begrudgingly come around on this expansion, and now really enjoy it, I will relate some valid complaints that do exist:<br />
<br />
1- The downtime is now far longer than pre-LDoN. This is just a byproduct of the way the system is setup. You take anywhere from 20 seconds if you're lucky, to an hour or more to GET a group setup. Then you take another half hour to get to your zone. A lot of the time people go AFK during this 30 minutes to handle their RR needs or whatever, so they can clear up at least 90 minutes. THEN the adventure starts. And in 90 minutes or less it ends. THEN you start the process all over again, as usually someone has to go or whatever. Rarely I get the same group of friends for two straight adventures.<br />
<br />
The complaint? Compared to the old way of grinding XP, this way has a lot of extra downtime where you're not doing anything.<br />
<br />
I've adjusted my playstyle, in that many times I'll just do an adventure and be done for the night. That's good, as it's cut down on my playtimes, but I'm sure some people are frustrated.<br />
<br />
2- The point system. A lot of people are annoyed that they have to grind 1492 points at a SPECIFIC camp just to unlock the items. This really frustrates some people who have trouble getting adventures at some camps. I know in my current group of friends there's issues because two of us want adventures at Tak, one wants adventures at Mistmoore, I want adventures in Rujarkian, and still another wants Guk. So we're always at odds on where to go. We've started to just roll for it. But it's frustrating to think that I have over 300 points and still NO points towards Rujarkian which has the item I want.<br />
<br />
3- The best augments can't go on your REGULAR items. A lot of people have beef with the fact that they're not even going to bother getting something like an Aura of Battle augment because their Vex Thal item which would totally rock with it can only accept type 1 augments. And the LDoN items that would take that AoB augment wouldn't be an upgrade to the VT item. So some people are stuck. And some people are less than thrilled with the fact that they already have maxxed STA and the +6 STA augment does them no good, and that's really the only augment they've seen &quot;drop&quot; that they would remotely bother with.<br />
<br />
4- Melees are getting a little squeezed with a lot of the augments that are dropping. A good example is I and my rogue friend have lost the roll on that +6 STA augment (I know I'm nowhere near maxxed STA, so that's still a great augment for me) ... which isn't a complaint. But we're losing the rolls to enchanters, wizards and mages. They say well they need more HPs too. BUT, then the very next adventure an INT augment drops, and they roll on that one too. It's frustrating. I was so frustrated with it that I finally broke down and rolled on a Wis augment and later WON a CHA augment, because I TRADESKILL too. :P<br />
<br />
None of these complaints are game-breaking. And the expansion as a whole is a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
But there are still some gameplay issues, kinks if you will, that need working out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">banguk</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look.<br />
I see the whole argument. I agree (level 51 warrior main).<br />
What it comes down to is this...<br />
<br />
Even if there was warrior only armor it doesnt matter.<br />
Thats right... doesnt matter.<br />
<br />
How can warrior only armor help if the warrior cant get aggro.<br />
At level 51 I cant get aggro off a paly or an SK for more then 1/2 a second unless they turn off their DPS and from what I see it gets worse as levels go up.<br />
<br />
Paly cant stun and SK cant tap. If I am supposed to be a meat shield and the group is supposed to be pumping DPS because LDoN is all about time limits how can i do my job with a knight in the group? I cant get aggro.... cant hold it once i get it...<br />
Warrior need something.... maybe a use for all this mana on our gear.... give us a &quot;spell&quot; that uses mana and all it does is generate aggro. With the AC / HP differnce shrinking daily between the plate classes something has to be done to make warriors viable in non-raid situations. <br />
<br />
Come on people... the AC/hp thing isn't the issue.... who cares if a SK has as many hp/ac as you if you could pull aggro off him and keep it off. Thats what it comes down to. If you had a group where warrior had 6k hp and 1200 ac unbuffed and SK had 1300 ac ac and 7k hp but the SK couldnt get aggro would anyone be complaining? I say no.... the warrior mitigation would make up for that difference. Now reverse that... 1300 ac 7k hp warrior cant get aggro off a 1200 ac 6k hp SK/paly something is WRONG. Warriors are supposed to be the best tanks... BUT they cant tank unless they can hold aggro. Instead of wanting better armor I feel that we need WAY better aggro control.<br />
<br />
Like I said... give us a &quot;spell&quot; or &quot;skill&quot; (NOT AN AA THAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR (unless its at level 51)) that allows us to hold aggro as well as an SKs taps and a palys chain stuns and also lets us use all this mana and int/wis that SoE insists on giving us.<br />
<br />
Would that be unbalancing? As far as knights are concerned maybe in thier opinion, but in reality? I dont think so. What is the point of having all this wonderful gear if you never get hit?<br />
<br />
Come on poeple im only level 51 and I have figured this out why havent you seen it. HP / AC are useless if you never get aggro.<br />
<br />
You could have 2k AC and 10k hp unbuffed and with aggro the way it is any poorly equipped SK/paly can keep aggro off you without even trying. Why whine about the gear that is never gonna help you anyways because you are never gonna get hit to begin with.<br />
<br />
The issue SoE needs to deal with is the warriors POOR aggro generating ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of points worth noting; this all started in PoP.<br />
<br />
-Quite honestly, even PoP elemental warrior class armor offers virtually no hp advantage over knight armor. At most 10 hp on most pieces. I was shocked to learn that even leather armor only has 20 hp less on it than ours.....<br />
<br />
-Allmost every god in pop drops a cleric/druid/shaman item.  Plenty of weapons and focus items drop too. Warrior aggro weapons are virtually nonexistant.<br />
<br />
-The ability to add procs and augs to weapons in LDoN is both a blessing and curse to us. It is nice that we can add aggro procs, but basically all other meleeing classes are free to add on shedloads of dmg, vengeance and DD augs......Holding aggro is gonna be fun with a rogue backstabbing with a 19 damage piercer.<br />
<br />
-As for the LDON Lego armor, I 'll admit I don't like it and it reeks of laziness. But whichever way you look at it, warriors allways will have an hp advantage; We get more hp per sta, higher hp boosts per lvl up and a little more hp from our AA. The real problem is that as we get to hp figures of 10k buffed with 200 hp on some pieces of armor, the advantage of 1k hp isn t the massive gap it used to be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fix class balance? I doubt they will now; Our lack of aggro on tap is to preserve the &quot;challenge&quot; on raids. <br />
<br />
All they have stated is they are looking at ways to improve melee dps. Bring it on; I ll just work on offensive AA s, hope I have DKP for a SEWS (Hope I get to get it over a knight heehee) and sell myself as DPS to pickup groups :p At least I won't be a monk........<br />

any SK, that knows anything at all, knows to throw a few FD's in to lower themselves on the hate list when a warrior is the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, if a warrior is grouped with a pally or shadowknight, and the warrior is MA, then the knight should not cast their huge aggro spells.  The stuns and +hate spells do not add to their dps, from what I understand, so if one is using them then they don't know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting thought game: Armor conflicts in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Look at the high-point-cost armor pieces for each of the various sets.  They're arranged as Plate, Chain, Leather, and Cloth.<br />
<br />
Plate (war/pal/shd/clr/brd): Three classes that compete for a single group spot.  Not much sense having both a warrior and a knight, unless you're fighting undead and want the knight for dps.  Clerics and bards do not conflict, as they fill separate roles.<br />
<br />
Chain (rng/rog/shm): No conflict.  The two dps classes &quot;stack&quot; with each other, essentially, as groups could benefit from having both a ranger and a rogue.  The shaman is a separate role entirely.<br />
<br />
Leather (mnk/bst/dru): No conflict.  All three classes fill separate roles.<br />
<br />
Cloth (wiz/mag/enc/nec): No real conflict.  Some could contend that wizards and mages compete for group spots, although since they both offer dps, there's no reason not to take both.<br />
<br />
Isn't that weird?  There are certain classes that compete to fill a single group spot (Cleric / Druid / Shaman healing, Monk / Bard pulling, Enchanter / Shaman slowing, Enchanter / Bard crowd control, Warrior / Paladin / Shadowknight tanking), but of those &quot;conflict&quot; classes, only the tanks have identical armor sets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding aggro generation (not that it's on-topic, but has been brought up): Yes, we can add aggro procs to our existing aggro weapons, which should help somewhat with hate generation.  Here's the thing, though... the parses I've seen indicate that the added procs happen ~5% as often as our regular procs; meaning they'll help over the long run, sure, but are no solution to getting solid aggro from the get-go.  Meanwhile, Pallies and Shadowknights are free to add DPS procs (or whatever type they want) to their weapons as their aggro generation is as solid as they need it to be.<br />
<br />
Don't even get me started on offensive disciplines.  I don't know any warrior who uses them unless they're *damn* sure they won't be needing Defensive for the next 30-60 minutes.  I've only used them during raids when the mob was getting very low and it was clear that the MA would stay up long enough to finish the fight... figure it's a good time to kick up the dps a little.<br />
<br />
Ah, and if you look closely, you'll notice that the really good 1-handed weapons (ratio 1:1 or better) are knight-only.  On Alla's, I can only see 5 weapons that are 1:1 or better for a warrior... three from Time, one from Earth, and one is a quest from killing the four elemental bosses.  Paladins and Shadowknights each have 18 (one is even from Grimling Forest :D).  Do not try to tell me that I can pick up a shield and still do my job.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason warriors are concerned, you see, is that while Warrior is one of the &quot;parent&quot; classes of both Paladins and Shadowknights, these two are poised to nearly equal their parent in defense, while already being superior in offense.  The children are usurping the parent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleen</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two thoughts/notions/observations:<br />
<br />
1) Granted, I'm a lot lower on the food chain than many (most?) of those posting here, but as a lvl 45 Warrior (with a chum at the same level in my guild) I have not had one success with my regular group in LDoN (45 WAR, 48 SHD, 47 SHM and me 45 WAR or DRU) - we just do not have the DPS. When we take our 30's group (PAL/PAL/CLR/ROG/DRU/MAG) we rip thru the mobs in MM - the Pally procs are devastating at that level and the cleric is barely healing anyone. My chum the 45 WAR is seriously considering dropping his WAR in favor of levelling up his PAL - his LDoN experience(s) are that depressing for him. Food for thought.<br />
<br />
2) As an active tradeskiller, it's funny to note (well, sad really) that the 10 new smithed armors (5 chain, 5 plate) that have become available in LDoN (Chain BP is 24 and plate is only 27 so don't get too excited ;) ) actually &gt;&gt;are&lt;&lt; class focused. They are all plate/chain class items, but the stats attached to them are somewhat appropriate to class (to my way of thinking):<br />
<br />
Gothic (from MMC) has STR, STA, SVM (WAR) <br />
Sandblasted from Tak has WIS and SVF (CLR/PAL/SHM/RNG)<br />
Calcified from Ruj has AGI and SVD (ROG?)<br />
Deep Cavern from Deepest Guk has DEX and SVP (ROG?)<br />
and Frosted from Miragul's has INT and SVC (BRD/SHD) <br />
<br />
Ok, it gets kinda dicey with rogues wanting AGI or DEX gear, but the point is that &gt;&gt;someone&lt;&lt; was thinking about class stuff with these armors at least. Can't speak to the rubes making the AP armors tho...</div></div><hr />
