<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the situation as it stands is I'm contemplating returning after being gone for 2 years.  <br />
<br />
That said, I left at about the beginning of Luclin so I am level 60 with practically no AAs<br />
<br />
What I would like is some advice as to how best to gear up with what I might be able to purchase in the Bazaar.  I've made a few purchases, but I am sooo ignorant about what is available today.<br />
<br />
If my Magelo doesn't show up after I post this, I'll re-edit with a link to it.<br />
<br />
Equipment aside, where best should I go for getting exp these days?  <br />
<br />
Also, is the old addage &quot;levels&gt;all&quot; pretty much the standard still?<br />
<br />
I worry since as a dark elf warrior (also agnostic so unfortunately that takes away from a lot of good cultural armor) my stamina is naturally low.  Should I worry about getting mitigation and avoidance AAs?  Would setting my exp bar and AA bar at certain percentages work better?  Should I just go full out levels and then full out AAs?<br />
<br />
If I stay, ideally, my goal is to follow my old guild into the PoP expansions, and maybe do some LDoN adventuring for fun (went on my first one last night. . .I really liked it! :) )<br />
<br />
Given my current level, HP, and AC, I know its not feasible now.  But a point into the best route would be immensely helpful.  Thanks for any help you can give!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some ideas:<br />
<br />
1- Replace the Willsapper with a Copper Hammer of Striking. Not much of an upgrade, but eh, it's an option. If you want to keep the sapper, it works just fine.<br />
<br />
2- Replace Belt of Contention with Soulscream Belt. More haste.<br />
<br />
3- Bag the Fennin Ro Bracer, keep it around cause it's always useful to have around. But get a HP bracer in its stead. There are quite a few options out there, just shop around.<br />
<br />
4- Same deal with the gobby skull earring. Bag it. Keep it around, cause it's useful. But replace it with a Mosquito Leg Earring or something like that. Maybe consider Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement if you've got the plat. Good hit point upgrade.<br />
<br />
5- Consider replacing the velious quested armors with ornate.<br />
<br />
None of that is really pressing though. I mean you can be pretty effective with the gear you currently have. Make sure you get your SKILL TOMES, and redo your disciplines, AND get your INCITE skill. That'll be the biggest boost you can get. Moreso than any gear. After that I'd focus on replacing the bracer and the earring before anything else, since they currently have zero hit points in their slot.<br />
<br />
&quot;where best should I go for getting exp these days? &quot;<br />
<br />
The short answer: Plane of Valor till you can zone into Bastion of Thunder. After that BoT.<br />
<br />
OR ... LDoN. LDoN can be a lot more fun than PoP. But PoP XP is still pretty brisk.<br />
<br />
Regarding levels vs. AA ... that's all on you there. It changes with your situation. If you need levels to catch up to your old guild for instance, then get the levels. If not, then get some AAs, as they'll help you tank better. It's really dependent on where you are at in the game, so there is no right or wrong route to direct you too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, and they are very, very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reamer</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also something to look at is the LDoN Armors, You buy In the camps the 2 top Plates for level 65s are in teh Everfrost theam the lesser more Liek ornate, and North ro the best plate You can get from LDoN, with its Augments You can Make the North ro Plate better then ornate, But keep In mind if you are geared to do the High risk missions in LDoN drops are also better from the named you may encounter on them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't worry about your weapons for now, they will get you by just fine. Top priority whould be getting a better haste item and a bloodmetal earring or two and then start working on your armor.  Especially boots and bracers.  <br />
<br />
You could go for ornate, and leveling in PoP is probably the fastest experience, but considering your gear, I'd live in LDoN if I were you.  The normal mobs are a lot more forgiving than stuff in PoP if your gear is subpar, and you can save up for royal attendant armor and get exp at the same time.  By the time you save points for a set of Tak armor, you will be 65 with a decent amount of AA and up to speed to raid with your guild.  Be sure to go on any PoP flagging raids your guild does even if you're not ready to raid full time, it is much harder to get caught up if you miss the first round of flagging (assuming your guild isn't in the elementals/time already).<br />
<br />
I'd go to 65 and then do AA if I were you, but keep in mind that your gear will hinder you if you want to do places like BoT or Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Royal Attendant I assume is the LDoN armor?<br />
<br />
Whats Tak armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Takish Hiz, the home of the sand elves. The LDoN adventures you obtain from North Ro. Tak for short. The plate mail armors available from &quot;Tak&quot; are the Royal Attendant armor.<br />
<br />
So, it's sort of all the same.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, the camp thing seems way more confusing than it really is. In the LIBRARY forum of Steel Warrior you should be able to find a thread archived that links the Item Database for LDoN camps, along with prices and augments and slots and everything. Spend some time there getting familiar with the camps and the armors and stuff and you'll begin to see the pattern. <br />
<br />
Anyways, LDoN armors as said above can be made very very good. So if you've got a hankering to put some time in, then the LDoN stuff could provide you with good upgrades too.</div></div><hr />
