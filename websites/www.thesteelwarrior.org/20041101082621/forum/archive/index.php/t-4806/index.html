<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The procc sucks lasts for like 2 ticks tops, and i never noticed that it did anything. However the unknown factor of the item makes it a good seller atm. So sell fast and high if i were you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh I got one a while back<br />
<br />
made an instant bee-line for the bazaar where it was promptly sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I reckon its f'n awesome.  I won one of these a few weeks back and that night became 55k richer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So granted, the proc sucks, but what about overall stats with a potential aggro augment.  Would it be worth holding onto for that reason?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>HamkChai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not really... 13 19 ratio isnt that great, 75hp at 1st glance is nice, but copper hammer already has 65hp isnt?<br />
<br />
moreover, if i can aug it so that i REMOVE the proc, it is better, lol<br />
<br />
the proc takes up ur buff slot, and my buff slot is sacred at raid :p <br />
<br />
like other ppl said, if u've got a good price for selling it, sell it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OK, so basically 13/19 isn't that nice of a ratio?  It is better than the 13/20 on the CHoS right?  I know I get 75 raw hp plus another 10 stamina on top of that plus the saves, which mine are pretty low at the moment.  I basically don't have much else to throw in my offhand.  I know a SotBS is a good replacement for it, but if I were to sell it, what would you suggest I replace it with or should I hold out and see if I get lucky enough to get a GBoS or CHSP on some of our upcoming raids and try and sell it then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Griglon, you have to remember that most of the warriors here are hard-core elemental-and-better types.  So what they say sucks, only sucks because they are far beyond it.<br />
<br />
When you don't want aggro, there isn't a thing wrong with the weapon.  For MTage, however, it is &quot;almost good.&quot;<br />
<br />
We here on SteelWarrior are a bunch o' optimizers.  I know I don't get lewt often, so when I do, I wait until it is the best thing I can reasonably get.  The concensus here is that the CHoS and SotB are a very effective aggro-producing weapon pair.  So, I'd prolly begin with those weapons as a baseline and upgrade from there.<br />
<br />
The perceived problem with your hammer is that it generates no additional aggro.  You can add an anger augment of course, but you could also up your effectiveness by adding the same augmentation to the CHoS or SotB.  We are so dependent on procs for aggro that there isn't much room for individuality where weapons are concerned.  Are you prepared to put the fruit of 23 LDoN wins into a weapon that isn't the best you can reasonably obtain? <br />
<br />
So, I'd sell it, especially if you can get the nutty amounts mentioned above.   Stick it out there for a silly amount and see if it sells. Reduce it a little evrey day.  If it doesn't sell, I'd trade it even for a CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I appreciate the perspective that not everyone here is elemental and VT geared for everything.  I am one of those people.  I am not a 7 day a week player either.  I play maybe 2 to 3 times a week so when I am on I try and make the best of my time.  I am not the MT of my guild, but I am the ST more often than not.  9 times out of 10 due to my light playing schedule most everything on a raid goes to our MT on DKP unless he already has that item or something better.<br />
<br />
I already have the CHoS in my mainhand with an Anger 3 augment on it.  That is why I have the ornate hammer in my offhand.  I can get a Bloodsworn with a couple guildies, that isn't a problem.  I just figured looking at the &quot;overall&quot; stats minus the proc so to speak, it is a pretty dang good weapon with or without the aggro proc on it.  <br />
<br />
I know I could turn around and sell it for an insane amount of plat.  Most of the ones I see in the Bazaar are sitting around 70k+.  Yeah, I could get some pretty good upgrades with that, but I don't like being a Bazaar rat buying and selling for some of my gear.  In my mind, it takes away from going out and killing for what I want.  Granted, some things I may need to buy, but I can do that when the time comes.<br />
<br />
Thanks Ahz, I'll consider everyone's opinions and see what happens.  Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I gave up on trying to win everything when I realized that I required 3 or 4 support people to get exp, much less to win a nice drop. :-P<br />
<br />
That being said, most of what I have is from raids, not the bazaar.  Being a warrior, I don't make money fast :-D  But if I DID have money, I'd buy stuffs.  My mask and Kizrak's bracer were both quested in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
CHoS with Anger Aug must be fun.  <br />
<br />
If you are an LDoNanaut, consider the off-hand in my magelo (Malevolent Dirk of Destruction).  Augmented to 16/19, it doesn't suck at all, and without Anger it is a superb non-aggro weapon.  The sword from Guk would probably be a better choice, but not many of my friends want to go there.  Until you can get the dirk or sword, you'd do fine with the hammer you have.  Just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
Of course, I intend to Anger mine, because I must - I am an optimizer :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks man, I appreciate the advice.  And yes, I am a LDoNanaut.  I do most of my AA grinding in there now a days since it is easier to put together a group to go do adv then it is to put together big or small raids for the possibility of something dropping somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">WTF?!?!? 13/19 isnt that good? i was well into lvl 50 before i got a horn of hasagra (13/20) and i paid plenty of DKP for it. i still remember camping the ledge in seb almost 2 years ago hoping a lammy would drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Zynth, it isn't so much of whether or not 13 19 is good, but rather what is the best reasonably attainable weapon for the task at hand, which is taunting and damage.<br />
<br />
Griglon has the means to do better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Zynth, SSoY used to be uber. 8/24. 2 years ago, it already wasn't that good.<br />
<br />
Kinda works the same way with a 13/19 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Microxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess this weapon might be considered not worth it depending on where you fight from these posts. <br />
<br />
This is my curent offhand weapon, and I like it so far. I have yet to have it reflect in a LoDN, but when I MT in Kael events, this was reflecting spells like crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it's not a terrible weapon for someone not in a high end raiding guild but there are better choices.  I was using this on my beastlord soloing in Acrylia and Nurga; the duration is 3 ticks and it procs about 2 times per minutes with 200+ dex but the actual success rate of reflecting a spell doesn't seem anywhere near the 15% it should be.  I don't have the parser loaded at the moment but from what I remember, I reflected 3 spells out of 55x spells casted on me during a session soloing in AC - 2 cleric nukes and a root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was not saying that this is a bad weapon, just that the price on the weapon is crazy right now and you can get a much better aggro weapon for much cheaper. So it does not make sense to me, to keep the weapon when you can sell it and buy a aggro weap and possibly some new armor with the cash you make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Originally posted by Derrict <br />

<br />
In 55 spells, with the reflect icon up half the time, you'd only expect to reflect 4 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would put this weapon in the same class as a Split Blade of Destruction. Both are pretty nice weapons, but you are still better served with CHoS+SotB. Not only are the procs much better suited for a warriors primary purpose, but the insane prices those weapons fetch will get you some pretty nice upgrades in the process.</div></div><hr />
