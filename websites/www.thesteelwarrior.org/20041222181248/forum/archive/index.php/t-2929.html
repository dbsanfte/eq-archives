<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is truth mixed with sarcasm and satire below:<br />
<br />
Changes:<br />
<br />
1. Remove complete heal for clerics.  Give them fast low mana spells that heal for more to make them uber healers with greater mana flexibility for healing than they get with CH rotations.  This also makes warriors more viable tanks because clerics, like all classes are lazy and would prefer healing a warrior than a knight if this tool was taken away.<br />
<br />
2.  Remove slow from all but bards.  This would also give warriors a better role because warriors would be best to heal with slow gone.  Don't retune encounters for removal of slow... just make the game hard and interesting again.<br />
<br />
3.  Remove buffs of haste on players.  Allow pets to still be hasted.  Make the only haste a player can get be from bards or items.  Allow different kinds of item haste to stack.  Tune melee damage accordingly by having a haste item that works for everyone and then a class specific haste item that only works on that class.  This will allow better differentiation between the melee classes in DPS.<br />
<br />
4.  Remove all disciplines.  They were silly and continue to be silly.  Defensive/Evasive epitomizes the problem.<br />
<br />
5.  Currently, all raw AC = 1.6 AC on a warrior.  Increase this to 1.8.<br />
<br />
6.  To make up for loss of slow on mobs and haste on players for shaman and enchanters and beastlords, beef up shaman DoTs and debuffs, enchanters debuffs and ability more easily mez, and beastlords pet DPS.<br />
<br />
7.  Make shadowknights and paladins fight better on a mount than on the ground.  They are knights, make them be knights!  The extra DPS would be enjoyed by them, but the clumsiness of fighting on a horse would make it more work.<br />
<br />
8.  Allow rogues to walk on walls.<br />
<br />
9.  Increase the reuse time on nukes to force a greater variety of nukes to be used.<br />
<br />
10.  Retune raid exp so that it is roughly equal to the experience you would receive in an experience group per hour (definitely not per kill).<br />
<br />
11.  Add a plane that requires that you have a Vex Thal key to enter.  Make the plane contain about 100 trash mobs, 2 mini mobs, and Aten Ha Ra so it is possible to actually get loot off of her without doing a long boring raid.<br />
<br />
12.  Increase pure melee's resistances to all magics.  By not using magics, they should be innately better able to withstand the magics.<br />
<br />
13.  Give monks and warriors a natural spellshield equivalent to twice their level.<br />
<br />
14.  Make pets provide greater DPS.  (This is done through the fact that only pets can be hasted now as mentioned earlier.)<br />
<br />
More to come later....  (Back to work)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Memoving Haste and slows would make the shaman class almost totally pointless.<br />
<br />
Bards are already a powerful, well rounded class. I don't see the point in giving them a monopoly on slows.<br />
<br />
That said, since you aren't being terribly serious, I think you are right on on the skills that have really broken the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Remove complete heal for clerics. Give them fast low mana spells that heal for more to make them uber healers with greater mana flexibility for healing than they get with CH rotations. This also makes warriors more viable tanks because clerics, like all classes are lazy and would prefer healing a warrior than a knight if this tool was taken away.<br />
<br />
Come again? How would this make warriors more desiable? Without compleate healing the higher hp totals of a warrior are usless agianst anything that can deal more damage than your total hps ( I.E. damn near everything in an exp group and all raids )<br />
<br />
2. Remove slow from all but bards. This would also give warriors a better role because warriors would be best to heal with slow gone. Don't retune encounters for removal of slow... just make the game hard and interesting again.<br />
<br />
Er, the game won't work without slow.<br />
<br />
3. Remove buffs of haste on players. Allow pets to still be hasted. Make the only haste a player can get be from bards or items. Allow different kinds of item haste to stack. Tune melee damage accordingly by having a haste item that works for everyone and then a class specific haste item that only works on that class.

<br />
5. Currently, all raw AC = 1.6 AC on a warrior. Increase this to 1.8.<br />
<br />
So gimp melee classes more, and give more ac to warriors who will suck compleatly now.<br />
<br />
6. To make up for loss of slow on mobs and haste on players for shaman and enchanters and beastlords, beef up shaman DoTs and debuffs, enchanters debuffs and ability more easily mez, and beastlords pet DPS.<br />

<br />
8. Allow rogues to walk on walls.<br />
<br />
9. Increase the reuse time on nukes to force a greater variety of nukes to be used.<br />
<br />
Now thats just silly.<br />
<br />
10. Retune raid exp so that it is roughly equal to the experience you would receive in an experience group per hour (definitely not per kill).<br />
<br />
11. Add a plane that requires that you have a Vex Thal key to enter. Make the plane contain about 100 trash mobs, 2 mini mobs, and Aten Ha Ra so it is possible to actually get loot off of her without doing a long boring raid.<br />
<br />
Heh you would have to raid for exp if your changes went live, or solo if you had manna and ranged dps~<br />
<br />
12. Increase pure melee's resistances to all magics. By not using magics, they should be innately better able to withstand the magics.<br />
<br />
13. Give monks and warriors a natural spellshield equivalent to twice their level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uber: immune to magic at level 50, something that hardly helps in most grinding spots, and would be wildly overpowering in all others.<br />
<br />
<br />
14. Make pets provide greater DPS. (This is done through the fact that only pets can be hasted now as mentioned earlier.)<br />
<br />
Pets would be gimped by your changes, not helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking before I posted all this what things have changed the way the game is played more than any other:<br />
<br />
Complete Heal<br />
<br />
Slow<br />
<br />
Discipline Defensive (Evasive)<br />
<br />
Haste<br />
<br />
Decreasing differences between classes in ways that make hybrids shine<br />
<br />
Spells being added through updates and expansions while pure melee get no upgrades<br />
<br />
These are the things that have all combined to make EQ a hard place to live in.  For experience groups I am often happiest now in a group with a Cleric, and all DPS melee or me as the only melee.  This is because it plays to my strengths.  Warriors are less desireable than ever as a class, and the list I made was to create a discussion not of how to balance US, but to balance the game in general.  Most of what I said was not serious, but to drive discussion.  It looks like this thread is on its way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Hulanta <br />
If you removed the slows, increased warrior AC by making the multiplied 1.8 instead of 1.6, and got rid of CH, would that make knights more wanted?  <br />
<br />
1.6 to 1.8 is like, nothing. Even more so at lower levels or agianst mobs with weak atk.<br />
<br />
It would take a total of 500 raw AC to see a 100 AC change.</div></div><hr />

It caps the importance of hitpoints in tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay -- my worn AC is about 1100 after it is altered by the multiplier.  So I guess it is about 700 AC raw.  When I multiply 700 AC by 1.8 instead, I get 1260 AC.<br />
<br />
700*1.6=1120<br />
700*1.8=1260<br />
<br />
That is a nifty 140 AC extra which would have me break 2000 AC.  I don't see a 0.2 increase to the multiplier as insignificant.<br />
<br />
The other thing that could be done is to make the multipliers on the other classes decrease as well to further increase the gap between tanks, and others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course one wonders if the original sin was putting a &quot;complete&quot; heal into the game at all.<br />
<br />
As much as &quot;/disc defensive&quot; hampers Warriors, Complete Healing hampers Clerics.  Its hard to justify giving Clerics other things since they supposedly heal well.  Meanwhile Druids and Shamans (and Paladins!!) get to expand their skills to make up for their lack of raw healing power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree completely.<br />
<br />
SOE took the easy/lazy way out.   They should've simply stood their ground and said &quot;Yep, cleric is the primary healer, druids and shamans can heal but they're not primary healers, you want CH, play a cleric&quot;.    Giving druids and shamans the ability to be primary healers in experience groups was a huge error, along the same line as making the difference in tankability between warriors and others so mariginal was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree, for once, Frodlin.<br />
<br />
I believe giving druids and shamans partial complete heal was a necessary change. Before the partial cheal, clerics were absolutely needed in any experience group, you couldn't go wit ha shaman or druid and hope to make a good go of it. <br />
<br />
Clerics being only ONE of 13 classes, yet always taking a spot in every 6 player group, means they're disproportionately in demand compated to the other classes. The change made the game a lot less annoying.<br />
<br />
One thing I will state is that upgrading shaman and druid healing opened the door for justifying the significant increase in paladin healing capabilities. Along with shamans and druids, their healing capabilities are increased on the order of 3 to 5 times between levels 55 to 65. <br />
<br />
I ask you, where has ANYTHING been improved for pure melee anywhere near along those same lines?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any rate, even YOUR example is a less than double for  upgrade, not even close to the 3 to 5 times that I'm asking. And it isn't even in the same level range as I've asked where a comparative upgrade has been made for pure melee. Nor is it even in the same era of the game. In short, that response was crap.<br />
<br />
Such capabilities upgrade does not exist for pure melee, and you know it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I partially agree with Eradani's comments except - every guild I know farms spells like crazy when a new expansion comes out with duplicates ending up on bazaar mules. With very few exceptions casters have a more than adequate spellbook within a couple of weeks of a new expansion.<br />
<br />
Since Knight weapons, particularly 2Hdrs, are widely available we have situations like Windblade selling for 15kpp in the Bazaar while people still ask for 250kpp for a BoC.<br />
<br />
The result of all of this is well-armed Knights with nearly full spellbooks and a pile of class advantages turning their noses up at offtank slots in experiance groups and going for the big enchillada, MT, while claiming that of course they should be the prefered MT's - that's only fair!<br />
<br />
I disagree that the other priest classes should approach a Cleric's ability to heal and that other tank classes should approach the ability of a Warrior to MT. Clerics and Warriors have only one role in a group. Many of them chose their class precisely because they were needed. Unless there is a shortage that prevents people from raiding or grouping then they should not only be best at their role, but needed. Groups that don't have a Cleric and a Warrior should perform worse as a result or need to exp in much easier/low experiance rate zones.<br />
<br />
Those classes that have been most vocal about mobs hitting too hard, summoning, needing to be slowed, and requiring /defensive are not concerned about the game so much as wanting to entirely eliminate the need for the Warrior class.<br />
<br />
You want to see a little more balance and more fun? Have most of the flag mobs in PoP have and EB weapon in their loot table or let Kick and Slam always do a stun so Warriors aren't absolutely dependent of EB weapons. Cut down on the heavy repostes or make 2H EB weapons as widely available as Rogue 12+ DMG weapons. Let vendors sell Swollen Fungusbeast Glands for 1pp.<br />
<br />
We don't need /defensive eliminated - it's about all that gives #3, 4, 5, and 6 Warriors a chance to MT on raids as its is.<br />
<br />
We don't need Slow eliminated. As things are now, I can slow most exp mobs in PoEarth with a ToD - it's one of the only meaningful advantages I have over a Knight.<br />
<br />
I see three actual tiers in EQ, zones and mobs for: top raiding guilds, up and coming guilds, and experiance zones that should also contain upgrades for the casual player. LDoN is going to be a huge boon for players that are not raiding (or at least for some classes).<br />
<br />
The game isn't that far from what it should be, but no class should ever be faced with the kind of neglect recieved by Knights in the Kunark era and Warriors now.<br />

<br />
While I agree that it would have been better for warriors if they had left CH alone, I find it totally retarded that a cleric's most efficient heal is a level 39 spell.  When they realised how powerful it had become they should have capped it at whatever a reasonably geared level 39 warrior would have with level 39 buffs.  Then they should have introduced better heals at later levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Complete Heal is a funny spell.<br />
<br />
yeah it does a CH ( ie 7500 hp) for 400 mana, but it is slow casting 10 sec.<br />
<br />
To me it is the &quot;BASE HEAL&quot; other heals beyond it should be for specialized, group, fast, over time...<br />
druids/shamn get CH's same mana and casting time, lesser hps. I really think shaman got dorked over on their capped heal, compred to druids who just have  everything given to them.<br />
<br />
I dont see that it is wrong, I do think that there should be  CH2, CH3.. at 55 and 65 that does 8500 hps and 10,000 hps for same mana/cast time<br />
<br />
clerics have a wide variety of healing tactics, Raids however lock them into CH, just like Defensive locks us in. timeing  of CH chains is all about the casting time, and DPS.<br />
<br />
Clerics get stuck in a CH chain not because that is their most efficient or best heal, but because of the MT-MoB encounter arrangement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clerics get stuck in a CH chain not because that is their most efficient or best heal, but because of the MT-MoB encounter arrangement.<br />
<br />
On the contrary. CH is used because of its efficiency.<br />
<br />
CH = 7500/400 = 18.8 Hp/Mana<br />
SL =  2750/600 = 4.6 Hp/Mana<br />
SR = 1450/400 = 3.6 Hp/Mana<br />
<br />
Even with mad AA/Focus/Mods etc etc etc etc etc...<br />
That would DOUBLE all other heal efficiency ....<br />
CH will be 2 times better.....<br />
<br />
CH = 7500/10 = 750hp/sec<br />
SL = 2750/3.4 =808hp/sec<br />
SR = 1450/1.8 = 805hp/sec<br />
<br />
SL/SR do have a better healing percentage. <br />
You could push them to 1000hp/sec with focus/aa/buffs.<br />
Still they cant compete with CH efficiency. <br />
They cost 2 to 3 times more with full AA/Focuses/Buffs.<br />
<br />
To heal 7000hp/sec :<br />
CH = 400mana/sec<br />
SL = 1000mana/sec (using MP &amp; Focus &amp; BoR)  (2 SL / second)<br />
SR = 1100mana/sec (using MP &amp; Focus)  (3.5 SR / second)<br />
<br />
To heal 1000hp/sec<br />
CH = 60 mana/sec (1 CH per 7 second)<br />
SL = 150 mana/sec (using MP &amp; Focus &amp; BoR)  (1 SL per 3 second)<br />
SR = 180 mana/sec (using MP &amp; Focus) (1 SR per 2 second)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is today, imagine when there were no focus no FT no nothing.<br />
No lvl61/65 efficent heals. CH is gamebreaking and insane.<br />
<br />
CH will always remain the core of raiding unless <br />
- AE Stun / AE Silence<br />
- A 10hp/mana heal is implemented (like 5k for 5 seconds 500 mana)<br />
<br />
CH is so fucking efficient, thinking of using any other spell to keep a tank alive....<br />
Is just SHEER STUPIDITY, there is no xp mob that can drop a tank under 11 seconds.<br />
<br />
As for raid mobs ... just get enought clerics to chain cast (7 or 8)<br />
And you can pump 6000+hp/sec healing for 260 mana/sec.<br />
<br />
The only advantage of SL/SR rotation would be that a failed heal (fizzle).<br />
Will not instant kill the tank since you are counting in Per Second Interval.<br />
Not 2 second intervals like with CH.</div></div><hr />
