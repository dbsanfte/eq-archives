<br />
This ability will give you an increased chance to execute a double riposte 15, 35, 50 percent of the time. <br />
<br />
It says increased chance, that would lead to believe we allready have an innate chance to do a double attack on a riposte. And where there's a double attack there's a chance for triple and flurries.<br />
Anyone have any proof to confirm or deny this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoE has a habit of phrasing everything in a way to give the player more questions than answers and totally confusing  us at the same time.<br />
<br />
You're reading too much into it, technically the chance will increase from a 0% chance to a 15% chance on your first train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;increased&quot;  I think thats just SoE/VI being careless again.  I went through about 20 fights and at lvl 61 and couldnt' find any back to back ripostes comming from the same attack.  Once it looked like I riposted both attacks from a double but its kinda hard to tell.  In any case, I dont' think we have it untill we get the AA so &quot;increased&quot; is just them being stuipid.<br />
<br />
This is from a bored faction group in Kael... i don't know why i turned off autoattack but it shows some things i didn't know about.<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:19 2003] You crush Legionnaire Whiteaxe for 29 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:19 2003] You try to crush Legionnaire Whiteaxe, but miss!<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:20 2003] Soandso tells the group, 'wonder how many more nights i gotta spend here to get from dub back to ally with CoV :\'<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:20 2003] Auto attack is off.<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:20 2003] You slash Legionnaire Whiteaxe for 12 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:20 2003] You slash Legionnaire Whiteaxe for 53 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:21 2003] Legionnaire Whiteaxe says 'You will not evade me Krunt!'<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:21 2003] You have been summoned!<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:24 2003] Legionnaire Whiteaxe tries to hit YOU, but misses!<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:24 2003] Legionnaire Whiteaxe hits YOU for 110 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:24 2003] You try to crush Legionnaire Whiteaxe, but Legionnaire Whiteaxe parries!<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:24 2003] Legionnaire Whiteaxe tries to bash YOU, but YOU riposte!<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:25 2003] Auto attack is on.<br />
[Tue Apr 22 17:32:25 2003] You try to slash Legionnaire Whiteaxe, but Legionnaire Whiteaxe parries!<br />
<br />
So you can see that 1) You sometimes keep attacking after autoattack is off.  Maybe just untill the end of that round.  2) you do your riposte Swing before you riposte according to the log and 3) you can miss a riposte (after learnign about #2 I went through and saw my attacks miss, parried, and dodged all right before i riposted.  Lastly, no matter how hard I looked, I never saw a riposte get riposted.  And because my sample size was over 10,000 lines of combat I don't think it is possible.<br />
<br />
One last thing i noticed.  Sometimes i riposted with my secondary.... don't realy know why or what that means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">answer to Loosscru 1) you stop attacking when u set auto attack off, but with lag , u may see more attacks before server is aware you stopped / u are aware of last attacks. same thing, when laggy it takes time to start attacking : it is time needed to let server know u attack , and to let you know result of attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">double riposte if i understand the term simply means you get to  riposte with 2 hits instead of one. you wont back to back riposte since a riposte needs a swing from the mob to fire in the first place.<br />
<br />
everyone i seen comment has said they regret getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone commented to me that double rip was broken and I kind of agree.  The skill is certainly not worth the aa spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as I have currently run out of other AA to buy (will be doing shield AA, fear resistance, and hastened instigation I guess next) I am currently in the process of maxxing out Double riposte.<br />
<br />
I will do some parsing when its maxxed if I have time and come up with a % of swings riposted and % of ripostes that double riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">repost is a free attack and nothing can stop it not even enrage, but you can miss.<br />
<br />
/dis furious to test it on a hobo him 0 me 4 only his real attacks made me repost.<br />
<br />
i expected some kind of super spam repost to infinity squared link death<br />
<br />
all repost hits come befor the repost message.<br />
<br />
ducking is the only way to imidently stop attacking and reposts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nyxs</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, I think I have done a double riposte once at level 41. <br />
