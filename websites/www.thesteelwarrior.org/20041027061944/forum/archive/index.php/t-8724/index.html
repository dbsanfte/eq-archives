<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigdung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After 2 years of playing I finally saw the Ancient Cyclops up and got the ring. My question is, is it worth it for a 65 warrior with Run3 to get these boots??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After 2 years of playing I finally saw the Ancient Cyclops up and got the ring. My question is, is it worth it for a 65 warrior with Run3 to get these boots??<br />
<br />
As a clicky, I would say yes.  For the run enhancement, I would say no.  Run3 works indoors and isn't something you have to refresh.  Besides, Run5 is totally worth the points :)<br />
I get the impression you're considering selling the MQ, or doing it for an alt or something...I'd probably take that route tbh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh. on the way back from guk last night i decided to see if i could make AC pop. it worked =) killed him for the ring. quick plowed through a few shadowmen, grabbed 3250gold from the bank and spent five hours in RM killing every a_drake that popped in the hill giant plateau area.<br />
<br />
turn in guy pops and starts running at bard speed. alt + tab over to the druid. snare. gate. alt + tab back to me, turn in items. and he promptly eats them and gives me the message about how he's only accepting the ring, 3250gold, and a shadowed rapier for the journeyman's boots.<br />
<br />
then i beat him to death in case he'd drop anything i had just given him. he didn't.<br />
<br />
/report rexiant<br />
/petition<br />
/cross fingers on getting a good GM<br />
<br />
for anyone out there who has ever had this happen, any suggestions on a way to do this where it WON'T bug out on me in the 1 / 1,000,000 chance a GM says, &quot;here's the ring back.&quot;?<br />
<br />
any particular order you need to hand the items to him in? give him everything then hit trade? one thing at a time? anything else we're all just supposed to automatically know when doing this quest? maybe he didn't like being snared? (was NOT in group with my druid). <br />
<br />
whole thing pisses me off. i don't want them enough to end up writing my own bad camp horror story about them and get KS'd a few times when i DO get him to pop. they're not worth the cost of a MQ for me either. but doing this quest by myself + 1 snare cast and some tracking from a friend's toon i bot would have been nice. i remember being a full on noob back when RoK came out. i thought Jboots were the coolest thing ever.<br />
<br />
so anyway. any suggestions? something i could have done wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quest walkthrough says to hail him first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep. hailing him was the only way to make him stop walking (which i did). even snared he won't stop until hailed from within a certain range. also forgot to mention i conned amiable to him.<br />
<br />
/slam head on desk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You're sure that you handed him the right type of shadowed weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep. 'a shadowed rapier'. as a nice side note my ring of the ancients was refunded by a GM, so i can do the tun in over again. now i just need to try to figure out what went wrong so i can avoid it this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigdung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I decided to do the turn in. Got the Boots no problems. I just hailed the little fella and gave him the goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gm refunded my ring while i was at work. got the turn in today, and it worked. /boggle<br />
<br />
slightly faster than run3 plus the MQ sells for squat anyway. plus an outdoor instaclick buff space for...um...all those times i fight dispelling mobs...outside...erm....</div></div><hr />
