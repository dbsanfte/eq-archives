That should bring u to about 57-58 and then u should go to PoV until 62 when u can get into BoT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quincent</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN, I think, is the way to go til around 55 or 56! Around 55 or 56 is when the normal xp in LDoN groups starts sucking hardcore. After that, do PoP content til 65... once 65, then anything is there to do. ;)<br />
<br />
I leveled from around 46 to 55 in roughly 2 weeks of hardcore exping in LDoNs. Though, somtimes it can be hard to get one going around those levels (especially depending on what server yer on), it's well worth it cuz you can get pretty cool augmentations from them (rarely).<br />
<br />
Just my opinion from experience. Gluck ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I had a long session, I would go to the Dreadlands &amp; bring a good bow and some long-range arrows &amp; lots of food &amp; drink.<br />
If you're in a very good group/get a couple of levels, you can try Karnor's.<br />
If I just had a couple hours to play at a time, I'd do an LDoN. The LDoN will be the better loot.<br />
If you have a group of friends you regularly group with, you have more options. If you're lfg, you have to go where the people are. Certainly they are doing LDoNs; not sure there are as many folks still doing DL.<br />
PoJ entrance is good exp, marginal loot. Always groups fighting there, too. Sometimes can be hard to get a group there if you just show up and shout 46 War lfg, though, because a lot of 46 warriors aren't geared well enough to tank there, and just sort of sponge.<br />
Mostly I'd start finding some really good players who need a tank for their group. Lots of people will talk about which zones give you best exp, but the fact is that playing with good players is exponentially the biggest ZEM in the game. Conversely, playing with poor players will make your troll exp penalty look completely trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">try to get 46 and move into POP zones, or do LDONs...that way you acquire points while you are gaining xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oarlabok Battle'Bane</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the DL or KC till 46, if you can 2-box a healer or find one to help you a bit you cab solo the OT till 46 easy. I took my warrior from 41 to 46 in 2 hours with my 40 druid lol, but the zouts in PoJ are good till about 48 or 49 not 50-53. I found that the easiest way to get to 58-60 is to get to the Main Hall in PoJ. The best way to do it is to start the group your self. Find your self a cleric and then get a shaman or enchanter and the rest of the group will fall into place. After that try to get flagged for PoV and BoT, then you will be set till 65.</div></div><hr />

Easy single pulls, zones close by, easy access to buffers in PoK/nexus all made this a solid spot to exp in. Good for soloing, smalll group of 2-4, or full group stuff.</div></div><hr />
