I don't really see it that way because I kill mobs at a decent speed, but then I've never been much of a min-maxer anyways. <br />
Still that left me a little curious if I could get a massive damage boost by getting a slow 40something DPS weapon? I'm skilled in arms with 5 cruelty right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its the instant attacks that end up gimpier--mostly mortal strike. You may get weaker crits, but more of them (since you swing more). So the crits are about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">crit damage: really you'll even out over time with a fast 2h over a slow 2h, but a few lucky crits with a slow 2h in a duel are tasty.<br />
<br />
the more important reason to use a slow 2h is for instant attacks like Mortal Strike and Slam.</div></div><hr />

So I guess I am fine then? :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errr<br />
<br />
I use MS 2 or 3 times per mob, and the crit bonus on it ends up being about 100 damage less if I switch to a faster 2h.  <br />
<br />
If you're not MS'ing that much, then maybe not.  It's not a fuckin huge deal, don't sweat it.</div></div><hr />

mobs I group against I'm more worried about agro than being the primary damage dealer<br />
elite I switch sword/Shield anyways O,o<br />
<br />
<br />
no I said you're gimping yourself. there's a difference. and it gets more profound later.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slower weapons will not just hit harder because of weapon damage, but because of the bonus from attack power.<br />
<br />
Plus they make for neat crits.</div></div><hr />

for critts, it doesnt matter, critts you do x% so thats x% damage bonus no matter the speed.<br />
For attack power it doesnt matter either, attack power is calculated in dps.<br />
<br />
It does however matter when you use Overpower, MS or Slam; extra attacks based on weapon damage. The more damage (thus slower) your weapon is, the better these instant attacks do for the rage they cost.<br />
<br />
When using &quot;on next attack&quot; abilities like heroic strike however, fast is better as it costs you less rage. Rage that you could have gotten by not using a special on that attack.<br />
<br />
Fast weapons do create more dodges, critts etc, thus more overpowers, flurries and wounds. These are all based on weapon damage however so therefore it does not matter. <br />
<br />
When tanking, a fast weapon will give you more often the opportunity to use revenge for good agro.<br />
<br />
Enrage benefits more from a slow weapon as it lasts for x strikes and your weapon speed does not influence the number of enrage activations unlike flurry.<br />
<br />
You can however take all the good things and none of the bad ones. Use fast weapons (DW if you want) for your main attack to genereta as much dodges and critts as possible. Swich to a slow weapon when these abilities like enrage or flurry are activated or when you want to do an extra attack based on weapon damage.</div></div><hr />

a fast weapon has less critical power than a slow weapon<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
a weapon, 100-150, delay 2.50 will have less powerful crits than a 100-150, delay 3.50.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is what I've just been told.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmane</div><div class="date">03-24-2005, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crit % is based on dmg only. Weapon speed only effects the speed at which your crits come since you hit faster or slower giving you more or less chances to hit that magic % to crit.</div></div><hr />

Close, but not quite.<br />
<br />
If you have 2 weapons, that are both 25 dps, but one of them is slower, that weapon must have a higher hit range.  (Makes sense, right?  In order for that weapon to match the DPS of the faster weapon, it has to hit harder when it hits).  That means the slower the weapon, generally, the bigger the crits it's going to generate.<br />
<br />
In your example, they will both crit for exactly the same amount.  The differnece is that the first weapon is a lot more powerful than the second (50 dps vs 35 dps).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, no they won't.  The slower weapon will have a higher average damage per swing, even though it's overall dps may be less.<br />
<br />
Attack is applied in a linear fashion throughout whatever weapon speed.  Lets take an example of 50 dps for attack power.<br />
<br />
A 1 delay weapon will add 50 per swing<br />
A 2 delay weapon will add 100 per swing<br />
A 4 delay weapon wil add 200 pre swing.<br />
<br />
Because of this, slower weapons not only pull more damage per hit due to the way their dps functions, but they get ever more of a boost from the way attack functions.   Needless to say, this is irreliavant in a straight up dps comparison, but when you factor in instants, the harder hitting weapon comes out ahead.<br />
<br />
Now, in his example I couldn't say what would be better overall because I'm too lazy to crunch numbers, but if you have 2 equal dps weapons, the slower one is better for both damage and attack power distribution reasons.</div></div><hr />
