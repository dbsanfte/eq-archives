<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gartogg</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it looks like I might be getting a BoC, which will obviously go in my mainhand, but I haven't been duelwielding in over 6 months so my next best 1hander is a honed blade of the ykesha.<br />
<br />
Now I am assuming that the BoC in mainhand is enough to hold aggro better than I ever have before (currently using a GSoT) but was wondering which of the following would be the best offhander, or if someone else has a suggestion that is droppable and under or around 60k, type doesn't matter all skills are maxed.<br />
<br />
Horn of Hsagra<br />
13/20<br />
35AC<br />
10Sta<br />
75Hp<br />
<br />
Fleshgrinder<br />
12/19<br />
75hp<br />
proc 160dd<br />
<br />
Wind-worn Handblade<br />
12/18<br />
10AC<br />
8Sta<br />
8Str<br />
40Hp<br />
proc 60dd<br />
<br />
Shortblade of Lightning<br />
13/19<br />
10Str<br />
5Sta<br />
60Hp<br />
<br />
I fight mostly in Tier one (after the patch we'll probably do tier2, we've just been lazy and never tried to get flagged) and am the highest tank in a small guild if that matters.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious though, how do you plan to come by this BoC?  Might give me other ideas on other no drop attainable weapons that would be better suited to maintaining agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if the BoC is enough to keep consistent aggro I'd go with horn  on off hand for the large stats (hp,AC) even if the ratio may not be as good as some of the others, I'd sacrifice the very slight dps increas for the stats the horn gives.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mongoz</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with the FG in offhand for aggro, shortblade for dps(like it matters for us tanks).  Also the best aggro combo I've seen to date is Greatblade of Storms(mainhand), BoC(offhand). I can constantly pull aggro off any combination of weapons atm, I even had to switch to the Honorable longsword on raids so that way I stopped pulling aggro off the proc's alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gartogg</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoD would be nice, but for some insane reason they are more expensive than BoC on my server.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advise guess i've narrowed it to the Horn of hsagra and a Fleshgrinder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fleshgrinder is a DPS weapon.<br />
<br />
I sometimes pop The Horn Of Hsagra in offhand when lacking certain buffs and i fights where debuffing is an issue the 35 ac hp and Sta is great ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing you're buying, tho, so I'm gonna go with others and say use a HoH.  The extra hp will be nice, and if you're in a small guild that's not post-NToV, you shouldn't have any problem whatsoever with aggro on using the BoC alone.</div></div><hr />
