His endurance gets drain so fast if i  have Dark embrace or Death shroud running at the same time.  I have endurance reduction 10++ on but of them in two slots each and cant tell the differance. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I think that the endurance pull should be increased incremently each level or every 5 levels.  It sucks when I cant use my DEF power and my Damage Shield at the same time because of my endurance drain</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I am using the reflex power tree(scrapper) and it burns down endurance like nothing ive seen on any of my other characters, should i waste the enhancement slots on these powers and plug em with endurance reduction? and also i am wondering if the reduction is by a percent or number...&quot;<br />
<br />
I have a dark melee/super reflexes scrapper that's almost as high as my main (scrapper is 15 going on 16 ... main is finally getting close to dinging 19).<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten focused senses yet. Though I will be at 18 I think. At 16, I'm LEANING towards stealth (a nice defense bonus as well).<br />
<br />
BUT ANYWAYS, back to your questions ...<br />
<br />
For Focused Fighting I use 4 slots on it. 2 for END reduction, and 2 for defense bonus. They help, a lot. The only time I get low on END is when I fight even cons non-stop for more than 5 minutes at a time.<br />
<br />
Having a second toggle up at the same time, I believe I will have the same end restrictions you're facing.<br />
<br />
So, I'd lean towards getting DO enhancers in there, and work on SO's when you finally make the level as their effects are more powerful. And, I'd work on managing your toggles and not leaving them up all the time. (I have some lower level friends I group with a lot, and they're finally catching up to me ... but when I do missions with them and its their missions, I just don't use my defense toggle at all since the mobs don't hit me as hard).<br />
<br />
OH ... and in regards to your last question ... it's a percentage. At least if that's the question I THINK you're asking. All enhancements boost the power by a percentage. The exact numbers are in the strat guide, I think. And on some website, the name and link I can't remember right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While having it on is not really noticable, you start sticking on other toggles and it does make a differance. My blaster has Leadership/Manuvers and running that and sprint really hammers my recovery. Turn off sprint and manuvers becomes much easier to live with.</div></div><hr />

I figured id have to turn them off and on all the time damn micro management! ah well :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This means taking 2 powers from the fitness power pool prior.<br />
<br />
Stamina will help you dramatically.<br />
<br />
I am personally worried it will get nerfed it is so good.  However, 3 slots to get a benefit is a helluva sacrifice for a useful power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why do you need 3 slots in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why do you need 3 slots in it?<br />
<br />
endurance seems so far to have a cap at 100; and the dark armor line of scrappers have insane amounts of endurance drain; hence 3 slots with 1 dmg/2 end reduction hopefully is a godsend towards endurance preservation.<br />
<br />
i'm hoping though that DO augments help solve this; but stamina for the scrapper seems like an almost manditory spec field; and any amount of end reduction will benefit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wrote like a dumbass.  I will attempt to clarify.<br />
<br />
Stamina is in the fitness power pool.<br />
<br />
Stamina is the last of the 4 powers in the pool.<br />
<br />
All the power pools bottom most power &quot;open up&quot; when you have met the following criteria:<br />
<br />
1. You are 20th level<br />
2. You have taken 2 of the 3 previous powers.<br />
<br />
So in Fitness power pool the powers are:<br />
<br />
Swift<br />
Leaping (forget the exact name)<br />
Health<br />
Stamina<br />
<br />
In order to get &quot;stamina&quot; you must be level 20 AND have taken 2 powers out of the first 3 listed (swift, leaping, and health).<br />
<br />
I hope I made it clear now.  So to get the killer kick ass stamina regen you need to &quot;waste&quot; (IMO) 2 powers instead of getting more useful powers.<br />
<br />
Got it?  Or clear as mud?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think waste is a very strong word there. <br />
<br />
Run gives you an increase in...run speed (duh) which makes it a bit easier to live with sprint off (and you can toss an encahncement into to increase run speed that never turns off).<br />
<br />
Health is better HP regen. This being TSW, I think that is enough said. <br />
<br />
And then Stamina is clarity (or really FT) CoH style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm. Not sure what effects actually lengthen duration of build up (which is all Focus Chi really is, heh).<br />
<br />
BUT, you can do it the other way. You can get Recharge Reduction, which shortens the time between uses.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And hasten to reduce recharge time even further.</div></div><hr />
