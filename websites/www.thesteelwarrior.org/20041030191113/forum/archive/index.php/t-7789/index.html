2 nameds can drop it, both are near the zone in. Nameds in water seem more common than most of the other elemental zones as well.<br />

It is a very situational weapon. I personally love mine for tanking (atm, I often use it for boss fights opening with furious and going stonewall/defensive/evasive, or using it for short fights such as vxed/tipt with a pet)<br />
<br />
Atm, I'm 2nd on the list for a BoW, and I fully intended to keep it for furious swapping to BoW for defensive.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is a very situational weapon. Is it trash though? Absolutely not. <br />
<br />
Good luck in your hunting/camping for on, Froggerx. I enjoy mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's good for getting big crits.. that's about it.  That's just my opinion tho :P</div></div><hr />

OK, being nitpicky, the Plankton Laced Greatsword edges out the Windblade in practice. The is mainly because the Windblade apllies DB more often in comparison to overcome the DB and better &quot;strait-up&quot; ratio that the planton is given. On first look, the plankton looks ungodly good, but due to the way DB scales with delay, the windblade comes out ahead.<br />
<br />
Here's your base figures in DPS based on (DMG+DB)/DLY. (Your current weapon included for comparison.) The higher the better. DB figured for level 65.<br />
 <br />
 Name - BaseDPS<br />
 Plankton Laced Greatsword (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25986) - 2.123<br />
 Windblade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25979) - 2.159<br />
 Dathor Great Hammer (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=8137) - 1.705<br />
<br />
The windblade edges out ahead ever so slightly, but I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. If you can't get a windblade and wanna camp something, go for the Plankton. If you have the cash, go for the windblade. A windblade will be a huge upgrade for you.<br />

You don't need a parse to run these numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Drops fairly often it seems.A lot of our knights have it for assist...low aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Low agro high damage weapon, and it's AMAZING for fights like Doomshade in Umbral Plains where you can /disc Furious and watch his 10 or so attacks a second turn around and whap him in the face for large hits... as for DPS, have you figured in the riposte mod? I realize that you don't riposte all THAT much... but a riposte is an extra hit, and comes at about the same rate on both weapons... soooo 1 riposte on a Plankton &gt; 1 riposte on a Windblade... as for the parse mentioned above, was that taken from a tank or a non tank?<br />
<br />
As a sidenote, most tanks wouldn't bother to use this when tanking... but I have a feeling if you stuck anger 3 on it and had a good group (I wouldn't use it to start) you wouldn't have a lot of problems. Just my speculation though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Would just need it for dps when i'm not tanking, dathor hammer I feel like passing to an alt or mule. When a hybrid needs to tank a mob that has like an aggro reducer proc (vz/tz in tactics) I hate stealing aggro with my damn EB weaps and my other weapons being not that great or worth using for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's definately a common drop from the mobs that drop it, just a matter of gettign a grp to water to spawn em, though i've seen em up several times after a guild has raided water. And it's really a horrible weapon for tanking or DPS, it's very limited, it's great for dueling and using with furious, that's about all I ever use mine for, well I admit I break it out when I fellstrike to try for some eye candy too =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You should take a3 off of that bbb and use it as a dps weap when you aren't tanking.  If you do like it to much, just run a couple group raid on Auliffe in BoT, GSot4w is a pretty common drop and also better dps by nice margin.</div></div><hr />

doomshade flurries, flurry goes through furious, you dont riposte a flurried attack. and when youre using furious a mob isnt slowed/crippled so likely to flurry a decent amount. this weapon is TERRIBLE for fights like doomshade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well then... stack on 300-400 points worth of Damage Shield (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7794) and furious, no matter if he hits you or gets riposted he's gonna be one hurt puppy :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well... so it won't riposte the flurries, that was my bad. It still isn't a TERRIBLE weapon for Doomshade... I couldn't find my weapon once and tanked him with a Weighted Polearm (or wahtever that nutty PoJ drop is). As for Semp's DS idea... wow... um. Wow. I'll have to try that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">its always good to have a high dmg weapon in the bag for your riposte disc. if you MT alot, you should have this or the wacky hammer from UP. Plankton is great as ramp tank as well.<br />
<br />
i always felt the great hammer was better for furious since its delay gives a huge damage bonus.</div></div><hr />

yes, it still is a terrible weapon, the dps on it is absolute ass. and im not sure if anyone can even prove that furious gives more aggro than fortitude. riposte is a defensive function that i wouldnt be suprised if no aggro was gained off of it. also ive never noticed the slightest difference in aggro between furious and fortitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like to see people pull it out because they never pull aggro with it hehe. :)</div></div><hr />

jk, but I did lose it to our 5th assist *cheers* for 9k hp tanks expecting a weapon to make their lives better.</div></div><hr />

you made the damn rules so dont complain when they screw you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i agree ... if joe somebody decides to save his points for something and then buys it .... you cant be upset about it.  Just think of all those times that you got all that nice gear when he didnt.<br />
<br />
and yeah .... a BoWar will make a 9k tanks life better ... guildees should be friends, and friends dont say mean shit like that.  shame on you and your fucked up attitude ... 9k is plenty of hps to do lots of stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">heh, it was a joke - ranger didn't get it, and I wasn't seriously mad that he got our first one (infact i'm happy we finally got one) but ...Everyone else passed, I thought he shoulda too~</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure the person that looted the BoW would be happy to see his Guild Leader giving him so much support.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for your guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My guild just disbanded but on our last RZ kill the BoW went to an 8k tank with about 60 AA's, and he deserved every bit of it. Nobody was bitter, he had the DKP and deserved it. I guess that we had 4 BoW's drop in 5 RZ kills made it a little easier for us, but people will always be upset when they lose out on an item like a BoW I guess.</div></div><hr />
