<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sjsell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 56 warrior not in a guild but do have a 65 druid that I can 2 box with.  Any advice on his equipment?  I don't have a lot of money to spend so I'm mostly looking for droppable items I can 2 box for or duo with a 64 chanter with my druid for.  Thanks for any advice that anyone can give me.</div></div><hr />

Feet: I dont know if you can wear the kingly boots, they are a hp upgrade.  You could also get the steelslave bladed boots from LDoN.<br />
Wrists: Kizraks if you can get them from the south area in BoT.  Also could go for the chardok quest for the 100hp arm/wrist quest.<br />
<br />
Those are the ones that just scream out to me.</div></div><hr />

With your sta as high as it is, you can afford to lose a bit and still reach your max(255) with buffs.  Personally, I'd pick a couple of the above items trade some of that sta for more ac and raw hp.  Hell, you could afford to lose 19 raw stamina and still buff to your level 65 pre-aa max.</div></div><hr />
