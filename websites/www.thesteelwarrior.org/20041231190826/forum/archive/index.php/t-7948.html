I just finished his general 6 (sta3, run3 he is a DE), and just got ND1.  I was just wondering if I should finish ND then the Def ones or just get CS/CA now then ND and then work on the pther ones.<br />
<br />
Right now he only really tanks mobs in PoI/LDoN and VL when I am soloing so just trying to get your input on which would be the best route.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lately the trend seems to be towards defensive AA's first for avoiding the potential damage, but I went all hp's first and am not really hurting too bad so far. <br />
<br />
I guess it all depends on if you have a healer or not. I actually prefer to solo without Virtue type buffs since it takes longer to regen the hp's after a fight. Healing Will is 1k every few pulls and seems to do the trick. If I'm just barely surviving with raid buffs, when they fade I need to head back to PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the ND advice was for dealing with AEs that were fairly common in places like ToV and mid and high level raids. Since only one tank can tank a mob a time, unless you knew that you were going to be MT, HP were the order of the day for helping reduce the pressure on the healers when dealing with the AEs.<br />
<br />
Now those AEs seem to much rarer (or really, people spend less time playing in them) so the damage reducing ones make more sence--and I think LDoN adds to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats really important is:<br />
<br />
- You want all of these abilities eventually.  Each individually doesn't do a hell of alot, but when you have all your tanking AAs you are a better tank than when you didnt.  Whether you buy CS1 or ND1 now isn't going to make enough of a difference to really matter.<br />
<br />
- Luclin AAs give better return on investment than PoP AAs.  regardless of whether you think avoidance AAs, mitigation AAs or HP AAs are going to serve you better finish off ND/CS/CA+PE before you start working on LR/ID/PD<br />
<br />
- In your mad rush to get all your tanking AAs don't forget to pickup Area Taunt when you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe.<br />
Loaded question.<br />
There really isnt a wrong way to go as long as ye working on defensive/HP AA.<br />
<br />
This is more of a personal preference thing.<br />
Ye going to get a lot of different opinions.<br />
<br />
I went CA1, CS1, ND1, etc etc for the best improvement in the shortest time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the ac is lacking then ca cs.<br />
<br />
eand of the line though all are good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all.  I have a magelo for him http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=944990 His AC isnt that great so I am thinking I will work on CA/CS then finish off ND.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes id say CA/CS is prob the way to go. <br />
<br />
you should also try andy work on getting rid of all those no ac/hp items though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been trying as I can find the cash to do so, but my play times are so far off my guild's its hard to find groups when I am on.  I can go solo in OS, but w/ the nerf to the gem drops from bugs it just isnt really worth it anymore =\.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to farm sol ro for plate upgrades but the stuff never drops when I go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the hammered earring really have neg 15 AC? If so, ouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah it does, but the offset in the HP boost is why I wore it and then gave it to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You didn't ask for equipment advice, so I won't really give you any - or at least much.<br />
<br />
The -15AC earring has to go. IF you intend to 2-box or solo (I'd advise not trying to solo) the Warrior, I'd strongly suggest getting a ToD and maybe an Embalmers Skinning Knife. Other than that you seem to be on track but with 1/3rd of your slots needing upgrades.<br />
<br />
I think the Fabled YKesha is a particulary good choice for grouping - Grats. You might concider main handing a CHoS or SotB (better looking) or even the Troll re-manufactured Yak.<br />
