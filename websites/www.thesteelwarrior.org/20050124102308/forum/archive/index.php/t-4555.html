<br />
I'm looking for potentially easy places to get upgrades, by easy I mean 6-24 lvl 65 person attainable. <br />
<br />
I am on the road to aquiring a second Anger3 proc, but have no idea what if anything I should put it on. What would you guys suggest for equipment upgrades and what weapon to slap an anger on? I'm running out of ideas here lol.<br />
<br />
 Stuff  (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=282713)<br />
<br />
Edit: I am revisiting this to see about getting a fresh perspective on what upgrades I should seek out. Keep in mind that I am not in an uber guild, but I am able to rally up small raids.<br />
<br />
I have been/am farming the acidic mass in CT for acid bracers, but I don't really know what else I should go for.<br />
<br />
I am trying to get myself into some Seru gear, but even with only 10 people on the raid, I can't seem to win any rolls lol.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, a BoC with Anger augment has been said to be good, look around and see if someone have some experience with that combo.<br />
<br />
As for armor, well, try and buy some Ornate Armor molds (or hunt for them) and get some Raex armor on you - Bracers, boots and Gauntlets are the cheapest ones I think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already have ornate in all of the slots I don't have better. I don't care about platinum, I can find ways around that... just anything that might be an improvement for me to get pre-elemental as I am still missing Mith Marr.</div></div><hr />
