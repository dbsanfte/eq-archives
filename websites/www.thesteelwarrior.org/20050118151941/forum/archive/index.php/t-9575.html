<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DISCLAIMER: I fully acknowledge that some of my numbers may be off a little bit (how often one flurries, the hate generated by different weapons, etc).  I'm just posting this as a &quot;food for thought&quot; topic, and encourage people to correct/disagree/flame/sendCookies.<br />
<br />
So, with all that said, some quick number crunching:<br />
<br />
Hate per swing for MSC = 73+(44*1.4) = 134.6 per swing, (delay 33) <br />
<br />
Hate per swing for  BBB = 42+(15*1.4) = 63 per swing, (delay 31) <br />
<br />
(using Dmg+(DmgBonus*Mod1/Mod2) formula)<br />
<br />
Imagine that you have augged both with the same exact aug (and remember both have the same proc/procrate).<br />
<br />
This means that the BBB alone is producing less than half the hate as the MSC.  Imagine you were even able to dual wield the BBB's -- melee'wise, you're still doing less hate per second.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, your offhand will produce more procs.  If we had an offhand Anger proc, then of course dual wielding anger weapons would own, but we don't...so let's just assume that the pure hate per stunproc is the same as an anger3 proc (you don't have to agree with me here, the endresult is still sound)....<br />
<br />
So, you have an extra 2.5 procs per minute at 600 hate per proc (1.5 from WA5 and builtin proc, 1.0 from aug)...that's 1500hate per minute extra that you're making.<br />
<br />
Now consider how often you flurry a minute (I haven't done parsing, so I'm just going to guess here and say 3x per minute when you have the new OOW AA).  3 Flurries per minute = 6 melee rounds a minute = 71.6 hate per swing * 6 swings = 429 hate...so we're looking at roughly 1k more hate in procs.<br />
<br />
Consider that your offhand is only swinging about 50-60% of the time.  That's less hate per swing.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
- MSC does 135 hate per swing<br />
- BBB does 63 hate per swing, but if you were dual wielding weapons of similar dmg/dly you're looking at 100 hate per swing.<br />
- Including flurries, MSC generates about 500 hate per minute more.<br />
- Off hand proccing generates about 1500 hate per minute.<br />
<br />
Conclusion, in order for MSC to produce the same amount of hate as dual wielding hate weapons of BBB calibre, one would need to make up that 1000 hate with a 35hate bonus per swing.  That amounts to 28 swings in a minute (not including flurry).  With a 30dly weapon you have 18 rounds (unhasted).  You double/triple attack enough to make up that hate.  Take into consideration haste/EoA and you're looking at VERY similar numbers, if not numbers that will indeed perform better than dual wielding.<br />
<br />
In other words -- unless my numbers are severely off (which is possible), MSC *will* produce JUST AS MUCH HATE over a course of a minute as Tacvi-grade hate weapons.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well while the stats help  the fact is your not always tanking, and If I need to be at my UTMost defensive in stats I will use 1h and Shield-<br />
<br />
In other circumstances I prefer doing over 300DPS (friend Parsed this over an hour even though a short parse I feel I know its numbers quite well now) Its was doing an average of 320 DPS with shammy group alacrity haste.  At times it would spike as high as 400 DPS and go as low as 280 DPS.  I'd prefer this to any dual combo out there right now just because I like the diversity of contributing in other ways when I dont have to tank and still being able to do the job when I need to.  Against the most insane mobs that have the highest output out there sure a Brutish blade and a SHIELD would be the way to go, but as for now I've basically given up on the dual wield weapons i've seen in Omens, and we're not going back to Tacvi to farm items that h ave focus's going up to level 68 only just to get a few weapons when Omens has better items out there and focus's extending to level 70.  I have a feeling guilds just will skip Tacvi because its overpowered and the loot sometimes just isnt worth it, (2 items) , when in Omens MPG Trials / Riftseekers / Anguish is there with 3 Items per mob of higher calibur in the whole scheme of things.<br />
<br />
The mobs we were fighting were in a Dranik City Sewer expedition if you were wondering, so high con blue's to a level 70 mainly if that makes a difference.  Considering my dual combo of Darkblade/1.5 was doing barely over 200dps on the same mobs high, most of the times between 150-180.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well ya, your comparing your 1 proc to his 5 procs,  if he has any symbol of the planesmaster or call of fire.<br />
<br />
I augged Ykesha and with clicky planes master so I come up with a whole 3 procs and it helps a ton, even before I augged I could draw aggro decently, around 50% higher efficiency aggro than wielding a darkblade with a shield for example if I can relate it to anything of comparison off the top of my head.  After augging it up and adding my self buff its become quite the contender though.<br />
<br />
Aggro is a complicated issue, and I just go by my gut feeling most of the time, thats how I have always been when choosing what I feel is high aggro and what I feel isnt and the trade off between High DPS low proc aggro weapons (which wont work for a tank alone) and Lower DPS High aggro 1handers(which do work for a tank). <br />
<br />
This is the first opportunity since Blade of War (back when Blade of War came out it was pretty high DPS in relation to other war usable weapons) that warriors have come out with a 2hander thats got a class specific proc on it, actually this is the first class specific war 2hander in along time now that I think of it that has BOTH DPS and High Aggro generation.  It has both of the things that allow you to tank and also put out DPS.  In different situations dual wield will definetly aggro this, this is how it works, sometimes you get unlucky and you  -miss miss miss- and if you dont proc to make up for that series of misses and a slow lands or whatever and you dont have your 600 aggro incite  or AoE taunt up, than yes your going to mess up.  With a dual wield combo your LESS likely to mess up because you more options of procs with a dual combo, however, you also dont get the lucky boosts that 2handers get when you flurry for maximum damage and than proc and lock aggro for certain even off an immediate slow you dont need anything to assist you most of the time with our 600 incite aggro and a weapon that puts out high DPS.  Monks get aggro all the time using that 71/31 staff from Txevu just by stepping up and hitting the thing as do zerkers, ratio does determine aggro factor.  <br />
<br />
When it comes down to it the question most are thinking is, &quot;Is this a viable tanking weapon, and can it compete with a dual wield combo of Darkblade etc.&quot; and the answer i'm giving from experience with it, is 'Yes' it is, and if augmented properly, (like you dont put a 75 lifetap or a 150 Ruj DD on it) and put some form of aggro stun or pure hate on it, than its more than able to do the job.</div></div><hr />

You will get more aggro with MSC vs Epic/JoS<br />

You will get more aggro with MSC vs BBB/AnythingInGOD.<br />

<br />
I dont think that aggro is the  point of refence here though for raid tanking.  The hp and ac lost on the MSC is significant enough to shy away from it towards a dual weild combo.  The differnce in aggro between the MSC and a dual weild combo isnt going to make or break your ability to hold aggro on a raid, therefore it becomes  a somewhat inconsequential factor when comparing the two options for main tanking on a raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fooba that was the whole point of looking at the swing/dps aggro on the blade.<br />
<br />
Yes 4 procs is greater than two ... but what they are trying to hash out is whether or not 2 procs + massive dps aggro &gt; 4 procs (2 of which are offhanded) with lesser dps aggro.<br />
<br />
Looking at BBB + Epic 1.5 with 3 anger3's to go in both weapons: Considering fully half of the total proc aggro nn BBB/Epic1.5 comes from the Anger proc alone, how hard would it be for the MSC to make up the lost aggro from missing the 2 anger3's offhand?<br />
<br />
Anger hate/min= 3300<br />
Anger3 hate/min= 3600<br />
<br />
The anger proc is clearly the workhorse in the combo, producing almost as much hate by itself as the other3 anger3's put together.<br />
<br />
Proc aggro/min from MSC= 3300+1800= 5100<br />
Proc aggro/min from DW combo= 3300+3600= 6900<br />
IE: is the dps aggro on the weapon worth 1800 hate per minute?<br />
<br />
From what the poster has proposed so far, it doesnt seem all that unlikely that perhaps MSC will win out over BBB + any other GoD tanking weapon.  DBoTWL is an entirely different beast with it's proc mod ... and since dps aggro is rather speculative as it is, my guess is it makes it much harder to estimate.<br />
<br />
In either case... the lost proc aggro seems to be counterbalanced by the superior dps aggro ... which in and of itself is a huge perk.  Ie: there is no real way to lose out on that aggro due to piss-poor luck ... it's always there even if your procs arent forthcomming.  Now if only this thing had 500hps, 100ac and 10% shielding ... then it'd be worth dumping any previous weapons for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think at this stage of the game, if you are in guild able to obtain MSC, aggro isnt an issue (unless you are newly taged or twink). If you havent any of DBoW, FB, BBoB - then yes, MSC is very good choice for you, but if you have any of those wepz - no point to switch to MSC.<br />
<br />
DBoW, FW, BBoB + good offhander are good enough aggro to not care about it. With DBoW + epic I cant remember when i lost aggro on mob that I supposed to tank. If you have good aggro wepz and you still cant hold aggro, some wizard or necro overaggro you, its not your aggro problem, its wiz/necro are morons.<br />
<br />
And all these talks, like &quot;I have XXX hate, and there is XXX+1 - means I have to get item that generates XXX+1 !!!&quot; --- if XXX works good enough, what point to make all these calculations, prove yourself something, dream about something... like kidd before xmass. <br />
<br />
MSC is very nice weapon, with good aggro, with good DPS... get it if you want, or if you havent another aggro weapons, or if you are big 2h fan, or for Furi disc... i'd get it too, for free, as a toy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not possible to have &quot;too much&quot; agro. The more agro you generate the more damge the other 5 people in the group can do to the mob without being summoned. <br />
<br />
Basically each equivilent of one point of damage of hate you do to the mob that lets everyone else also do that one point of damage.<br />
<br />
Right now with 3 wizards I have to use their spell &quot;spark of fire&quot; (1300ish damage fast)  because when I use &quot;thundaka&quot; (3100ish damage slower) I spike and take agro. I am cutting my wizard theoreticaly damage by 100dps (300dps total) becasue my warrior does not have unlimited agro.<br />
<br />
So for every 1 dps extra you do at a cost to the equivilent of 1 hate per second less you reduce the damage dealers in your group by 1 dps each.<br />
<br />
So yur 1 dps extra reduces yur group dps by 4 (assuming 4 damage dealers) so a total of 3dps group loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior need absloluty every last ounce of agro they can do and you never take dps over agro (unless yur dps is causeing more agro then you are losing in proc or whatever agro).<br />
<br />
I'v taken a very hard look at single groupable agro weapons in OoW and dont see anything that will make be better then my OSoW/BoC combo.... yet...  <br />
<br />
That being said my agro is good enough to do RS trash at least 1/2 the time heh...   Getting a few more spells for my cleric and its exp time in RS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With any of the above combo's the &quot;more aggro = more dps&quot; rule doesnt really apply.  I cannot really see any dps cranking it up that far (intelligently) overaggroing any of the afformentioned weapon combo's ... and chances are that IF they are ... they will certainly outaggro anything presently available.  They're all godly and all work wonderfully well.<br />
<br />
My guess is that MSC is 100% more group friendly while DW setup is about 20-25% more raid friendly due to the stats/effects.</div></div><hr />

Our main tank has no problems whatsoever keeping aggro on raid mobs, so why take a marginal amount of more aggro over more ac/hp? Either way she is not going to lose aggro during the raid, but in one way she does lose hp/ac.<br />
So yea MSC is awesome for gorups and normal everday shit, but dw still wins main tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Despite my pathetic weapon combo (2 DBlade in 10 months of farming).<br />
I do not have real problems if the warriors with real agro weapons are carefull.<br />
<br />
DBlade proc mod = gimpified with the arrival of WA5 &amp; CE (mods are additive not multiplicative).<br />
Epic + 1xA3 + WE5 + CE19 = 2 x (1+0.5+0.19) = 3.38<br />
DBlade + A3 + WE5 + CE19 = 2 x (1+0.5+0.19+0.3) =  3.98<br />
It is indeed 0.6PPM more than the Epic , but its not 30% More as people tend to think.<br />
Torrin showed us it got nerfed after his 12ppm parses with C30.<br />
<br />
ATM With Epic+2A3 &amp; Jos (no augment), i hold agro well enough on all MPG/GoD bosses.<br />
67ac 505hp vs 55ac 370hp now i do agree the difference is rather small.<br />
<br />
135hp out of 15K+ isnt that much, but EQ works with small upgrades, and those<br />
135hp might just be the difference between 14.9% (DI check) and 15.1% (No DI check).<br />
<br />
I use http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69043 99.99% of the time.<br />
And i absolutely totally love it, both the agro (enough in xp &amp; raids) and the DPS (fantastic).<br />
<br />
The day i'll get a shield (0/9 in MPG Trials, 0/3 in MPG Raid, never saw a GoD shield drop)<br />
I will use Epic+Shield for tanking duty.<br />
<br />
MSC &amp; Blade of War = Most polyvalent weapon, with godly agro, INSANE dps, great tanking.<br />
BF+Aegis was better than BoW for tanking, just like Epic+Shield is better than MSC.<br />
<br />
Come one be honest, have you ever lost agro exept to &quot;ooops forgot to switch weapons&quot;<br />
warriors in the last monts , after getting the good old usual 10-15 sec head start ?<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, i dream of MSC every day :)<br />
<br />
But speaking from personnal experience, as someone with shitty weapons and zero luck.<br />
I can assure you Epic+Any offhander will produce enough agro to keep a boss on you<br />
and provide you with better stats than MSC.<br />
<br />
However no weapon known so far will produce MSC DPS or have its polyvalence.<br />
(Having a 65/35 i know how 73/33 is gonna feel)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No -- but I have lost aggro due to a wizard not changing his damage output due to a tank with better aggro than me dying and me stepping up, or due to a ranger going for maximum DPS (melee + casting his level 69 DDs as soon as they refresh).<br />
<br />
Granted, I am not using a DBoW, but there are still people who can't control their aggro (or rather, think that if they have to control their aggro, the tank isnt doing good enough).  More aggro is always better on raids when you are tanking.  Always.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong (I may be) but, didn't we conclude that miss agro = hit agro?  For the most part people now use a formula to determine agro per swing (not agro per hit)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone really does overaggro (ignoring memblur/deaggro abilities of course) 99% of the time they could've lose some aggro if they wanted to, but didn't do so because they're lazy, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.<br />
<br />
However, aggro does matter in groups.  In the long run (raids), Warriors always have aggro.  But in 30second - 1 minute normal group fights, I find myself still hurting for aggro time to time.</div></div><hr />

Still wont use it over epic/jos epic/shield when MTing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think this thing trumps epic + shield and epic + JoS ... unless you really really really need the 200hp and 3% shielding from a tanking perspective ... and it should blow them out of the water for aggro  :p.  Will Epic + JoS give you enough aggro to let everyone cut loose on boss mobs at your level of the game?<br />
<br />
You should also have about 30% or so less ripostes even with maxxed slippury attacks.</div></div><hr />

It's a nice agro combo, but, uhh, I wouldn't say it's the best thing since sliced bread.  If Celestias is telling us that the MSC is keeping right up with Darkblade+Epic users, then the MSC is going to blow away the Epic+JoS combo.<br />
<br />
I use an auged Blade of War (we both use SotP clicky) and I keep right up with this said warrior.  Even the wizards in my guild have said the same.</div></div><hr />

Epic/Jos are &quot;enough&quot; to keep the mob focused on me.<br />
And 12ac 135hp 3% Shielding are worth to my eyes the dps loss (as a MT).<br />

After using MSC a bit longer i can only say &quot;A fuckton of Agro, Two fuckton of DPS&quot;</div></div><hr />

But he didnt have CE29 or SoPM clicky :)<br />

So he was around : 3.6 (Dblade)+ 3 (Dblade Aug)+ 3 (Epics Aug)  = 10ish PPM<br />
I was around : 3.6 (MSC) + 3.6 (MSC Aug) + 1.5 (SoPM) = 8-9ish PPM<br />
<br />
I dont think it could compete with BBB/Thunderclap full effect + clicky.<br />
<br />
But the war i farmed signets with, had a hard time keeping agro, not to say<br />
he was actually loosing it when the RNG didnt do him favors.<br />
<br />
I'm eager to see what would BBB/Thunderclap with CE &amp; Clicky can produce.<br />
While most  CE gear on OOW is not tank oriented, some could be a viable alternative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You mean other than the massive increase in DPS?  I'm pretty happy with the aggro on DBotW + EoE but I'd use MSC about 95% of the time if I had it for the extra DPS.  For bosses I'd switch to DB/EoE for the beginning of the fight and then swap in a shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd probably get a bigger increase if you rerolled as a berserker, if the dps difference is really that important to you.<br />
<br />
Edit:  MSC seems like the Vanazir of OOW.  It's a 2hander with high damage output that has aggro comparable to the best weapons around, or at least close enough to create debate... but likely has something vastly better shortly beyond it in the game's progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In this case the dps and swing aggro seems to be so vastly superior that it balances out the lack of offhand procs and even the proc mod on the DBoTWL.  The only drawback, then, would be having lesser ac, hps, and effects from the weapons.  The only times these would really matter much at all are in raid-type situations.<br />
<br />
So yeah ... MSC would be worth having around for any warriors with DBoW FB and BBB.  It's roughly equal aggro for an extra 100+ dps.  It's 100% more group friendly than the duel wield combos ... and my guess is only marginally &quot;less friendly&quot; for raid situations.<br />
<br />
It's silly to try and negate the value of an extra 100dps in single-groupable situations when the weapons have roughly equivalent aggro.  Especially in this day in age with the MPG trials requireing phenominal single-group dps to win.<br />
<br />
I do agree, though ... it would be curious to see what 1hander weaponry is just around the corner.  I wouldnt be surprised, however, if this weapon is the 2nd best to come out of the expansion (excluding the epic 2.0).</div></div><hr />

I know when I'm tanking something, I don't really relax until I see at least an anger proc, a few anger 3 procs, or a pestilence shock proc.<br />
<br />
Add slippery attacks 5 and you've negated any benefit of switching to a 2 hander, except for increased dps. (Which really isn't our job anyway, though it's nice for exp groups I guess..)  <br />
<br />
Add shield block and use a shield to tank, and you significantly decreased the usefulness of a 2 hander.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DPS is always good, and were at the point now that another 100hp's or 50ac really means very little, it doesnt matter if I have 15,500 or 15,600 hp's when that 9600hp CH lands. And I seriously doubt having 2900ac is much better than 2850. A large gain in dps on the other hand, is quite valuable and quite an upgrade.<br />
<br />
I cant even remember the last time I had real issues with agro on a mob that didnt memblur, mez or charm. I doubt using a MSC would change that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe i'm thinking out of the box, but i can think of a few reasons to use this over duel wielding, granted that none of them are for being the MT. <br />
<br />
the real value in this weapon would be that it generates a lot of DPS while still keeping you high on the agro list. how is that important? not very much so if your the MT, but if you were maybe 3rd or 4th down the tanking order, your probably not going to see much action unless the MT bites it. if the MT survived the entire fight, the only thing you contributed was DPS and maybe an extra sence of security for the rest of the raid. in almost every situation where you're not tanking, that extra 30-50AC or 100-200 hp arent very important. <br />
but perhaps you're needed to offtank, in which case you really wont need to be at your tanking prime, and the main objective is probably to kill the add(s) as fast as possible. again, the extra AC/HP wont me missed over increased DPS, espically vs the trash that many raid targets either summon, or have standing right under them (Feratha for example) that usually only hit slightly harder than a normal exp mob. <br />
and also, i'm pretty sure there arent many people that will agrue that obtaining 1 raid quality weapon is easier than 2 weapons. it's easier to have lets say, one of the undergeared tanks DPS/agro boosted up with 1 upgrade than by playing musical chairs with all the other 1handers floating around, let alone prying them away from Random_ranger_with_too_much_DKP_001.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Nth tank who cares about AC/HP anyway? You're not tanking so dps is the way to go!<br />
<br />
Exp groups is a different story too, since dps is important for exp per hour and it's about sustained damage, not about maximizing short time damage... so MSC is great tool for those.<br />

<br />
example.   while tanking the CBQ i do not use anything but my regular arggo setup.  im doing almost no dps at all, but i am holding the arggo against the entire raid who are doing  insane dps compared to my hits for 4-20..  using  the darkblade and the epic 1.5<br />
<br />
potential damage plus ratio plus arggo procs plus your incite line, seems to be the key for holding arggo excluding range factor and a few other things dealing with arggo that occur before the mob is fully engaged.<br />
<br />
with the slippery attacks aa fully trained i do not see why a warrior would want anything but as many arggo procs he can lay his/her hands on.   there is also the stat balance.  you get more hp and ac and shielding from 2 weapons then you do from one.<br />
<br />
so in my opinion as nice as the msc is. it is the BoW version 2  very nice but to me a dps weapon.  excellent for people who do not have access to the darkblade or the BBB.</div></div><hr />

The weapon is insanely powerful in that it takes a proc which, in all honesty, blows away ANYTHING we've ever seen before, and even adds a proc-mod to it!  <br />
<br />
While I have never used either weapon, I have not read on these boards that even the BBoB is even a substantial upgrade over the Darkblade.  As far as I can tell, the dps is awesome, the stats are fantastic, but even its agro generation seems pretty similar.  Even the Bloodfrenzy was a massive upgrade over the Blade of Carnage.  <br />
<br />
Points being, I doubt we'll be seeing many weapons from here on out that are substantially more powerful than the Darkblade, at least not for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the same argument a lot of us had for the Blade of War.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, wasn't there a discussion almost identical to this one when the first Blade of War was discovered?  It was pretty much agreed upon that a Bloodfrenzy/BoC combo generated more agro than a Blade of War, but...<br />
<br />
1)  Blade of War was a lot more common than a Bloodfrenzy<br />
2)  The Blade of War generated a shitton more dps<br />
3)  The agro on it was solid enough to use in just about any situation<br />
<br />
Seems like a mirror image of what this thread is leading to.  The MSC is easier to acquire (not saying it's easy though) than getting to Tacvi, and a lot more common than a Darkblade probably.  Any warrior using an MSC should be more than capable of achieving a &quot;functional&quot; level of agro generation.<br />
<br />
But hell, what do I know anyways?  =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The arguements are similar Eriatha, but like Zotha pointed out, there are some differences that are no longer factors. The BoW had 2 main advantages 1) minimized riposte damage and 2) quicker agro from the insane agro DPS difference. Those advantages were basically the arguements for using 2h vs. dual weild for a long time. Since then, with the retuning of riposte on most mobs, the advent of better than 1:1 one-handers, proc augments, CE gear, and WA5 has largely made those 2h advantages irrelevant. With 4/5 procs and the vastly increased ratio of end game primary weapons, initial agro is basically trivial. Nothing is better for grabbing quick agro than early procs, and with current proc rates for end game tanks, the chances for an early or several early procs is much more likely than not.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that the MSC is a great weapon, but I can't see many tanks giving up end game one-handers for this on a full time tanking basis. No question, this is by far the best non-tanking weapon yet in that the DPS is insane and the agro is workable, but when tanking, the AC/HP and proc agro advantage that top end dual weilding affords just can't be beat. Of course, if you don't have a DB/BBoB/1.5 then this is certainly a good replacement particularly if getting one of those weapons and a good mate for it is not on the horizon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BoWars were especially good in EP fights which required this back in the day ... as well as starting off aggro in major boss fights before they un-linked discs.<br />
<br />
Now with WA5 and additional ldon augments the benefits of a high dps 2hander + aggro procs for tanking are pretty much obsolete.  The benefits are still there, but not nearly as strong.</div></div><hr />

Not that it was a very good test, since we only tested it on maybe 15 mobs, but i was pretty impresses with the msc. It was about same as what i had, he won almoust half of the mobs and i won abit more than half, i would think from before that my combo would be quite better than his for aggro, but in practice it looked like it was pretty equal, but then again this test was way to short and not right set up, since he was pulling most of the time. Want to try and test it on an exterminator, would be easier to see then.</div></div><hr />
