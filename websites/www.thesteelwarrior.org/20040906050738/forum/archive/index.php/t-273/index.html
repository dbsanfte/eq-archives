<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was following allakhazam's description, and ran into a problem here.  I tried like it said, to slowly move forward to turn in the yakmen meat, as his aggro range was smaller than trade range.  Well, as I moved forward, I got attacked, and still was out of range for trade.  Since he was aggro, I couldn't open a trade window.  So I backed off, then I ran towards him and opened a trade window before he could aggro.  Gave him all the meats, and he gave the &quot;I don't need this item&quot; line, and gave one back.<br />
<br />
I then tried talking to the gnome, but he wouldn't reply, then gave him a meat, and he also returned it.  I asked the serverwide channel, and was told to kill bloodmaw.  So I did, but the gnome still won't respond or accept the meats.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm wondering if anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, I would really appreciate it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finally got it to work this way: I would run up and try to open a trade window before he attacked.  If I could do that, I would try to press trade, once again, before he attacks.  If he attacks before you hit trade, he'll just give it back.  So I did one meat at a time, finally did it 4 times and he despawned.  I assume a lull or charm would make this 100x easier, but I didn't have either available =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, that piece confused me for a while myself, i aggro'd him the first time, have to force feed him the stuff before he attacks, but the eyepatch is definatly worth all the trouble, 25 hours camping stormfeather and never regretted it once :D 20% Free Haste! :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dwarf &gt; Halfings... why? I got the entire eyepatch in less than 20 hours (even if I include breaks).  It's the dwarven luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think I spent more time on the Direwolf stalker than I did on Stormfeather.<br />
<br />
Annoys me that I had to camp it with a druid and just log the warrior on to loot.<br />
<br />
For stormfeather just turn your speakers up, alt tab out and browse your favorite steel warrior forum.  Click back into EQ when you hear flapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OMG!!!!  I spent 45 minuts this morning trying to get Bloodmaw to take my meat (so to speak)!!!  Thank you for this thread, I can't wait to try this out when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks again Hussar.  Your idea worked beautifully for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Glad it helped =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What I did:<br />
<br />
Grabbed a guild enchanter and brought her to Bloodmaw's cave.  She charmed him, and I handed in the meats.  After the turn-in, he depopped, and the gnome repopped with a new name.  This new gnome will give you the piece of map you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Druids also work for charming Bloodmaw.  At least, that's how I did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh can't find an enchanter on TT?  heh you just had to go to Nexus and grab one of them KEI_bots and pay them 200pp to go charm the bear; granted they own any other spell but KEI :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Camped the SF yesterday from 11am til midnight, not a sniff of him.  God its boring!</div></div><hr />
