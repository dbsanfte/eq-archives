Anyone got any suggestions for upgrades? I can really only obtain 1 groupable items or augs. I think my first step is to head to MPG and pick up that 20ac aug. AAs are my top priority but if I can get gear also it would be nice.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 55hp aug at OI is another upgrade, and you mentioned the 20AC one at BH.<br />
<br />
And just EXPing in the zone you will most likely end up with a Maze Runners mask (debateable upgrade for you, you would lose a decent amount of AC) and a Maze Runners Ring. (See my Magelo for stats)<br />
<br />
Other than that, I would reccommend some LDoN augs to help fill out those empty aug slots. Would help with your Charm stats too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of ac augs out there sprinkled throughout lower GoD and up into upper OoW single groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forget LDoN augs. Go to RSS and you can get AC and HP augs which are all better than their LDoN counterparts in a fraction of the time.<br />
<br />
That being said, your gear is pretty good for a non-raider, but you really need some augs.<br />
As others have said, I'd start in MPG and pick up maybe a neck and legs off DEK, as well as a 20AC aug and 55hp aug from Blind Hunter and Odiumate.<br />
<br />
From there, you have two options which will net you some nice stuff.<br />
<br />
First, since you need aa, I would go to riftseekers and start exping in camps like Researcher (70hp non-lore aug for ring/finger) and Riftseeker (25AC non-lore aug for 4 more slots). Other drops here that are upgrades would be Celestial Lorica (chest), as well a belt, ring, and shoulder.<br />
<br />
Then I would do the GoD trials and KT. Here you can pick up the following:<br />
2x 20AC augs<br />
Glyphed Prayer Ring<br />
Resonating Earring of Battle<br />
Carved Vrex Totem<br />
Crafted Wristband of Strife (slightly worse stats than your bracers, but 46 haste so is a personal thing)<br />
Bracer of the Heartstriker<br />
<br />
Finally, once you got some nice stuff (or maybe before, I haven't tried yet personally so don't know the difficulty), go to the MPG trials. There is a drop there for every non-visible slot which as well as 2 weapons which are upgrades to everything you can get with a single group outside the trials.<br />
<br />
That should keep you busy for quite some time and net you some considerable upgrades.<br />
<br />
Also, not to derail, but I would love to give advice for him to go after 20AC augs from Riftseekers, but I have no idea where in there they drop. Is anyone willing to give directions to that camp?</div></div><hr />
