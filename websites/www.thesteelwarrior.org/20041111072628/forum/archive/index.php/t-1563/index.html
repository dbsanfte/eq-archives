<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My situation:<br />
<br />
- Casual guild, I rarely MT or Raid these days.<br />
- Always have a Cleric and Shaman to group with.<br />
- Wield Shadowheart (11,17 pierce) and Primal 1H (13,20 avatar)<br />
- I've chosen to do Offensive AA first, thinking I can more quickly fill in the defensive later, given my increased dps.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to decide between continueing to save for Ambidexterity, or go for Tactical Mastery 1, then Ferocity 1, then..?  Any nutballs out there like me that are committed to Offensive AA first?  Any insight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you already have CF3 you might start working on flurry, or maybe ferocity or tactical mastery.  If I were you I would try to avoid AAs like ambidex, that only increases your dps while dual wielding.   If a few weeks from now you get a kick ass two handed weapon all those points that you put into ambidex will be wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Sulvar completely.  Flurry is a good one (I'd do it first), and fero is good also.  I'd avoid ambidex like he said, but if you do get a 2hander I'd get PB simply because the difference is huge, whereas from what I've read ambidex isn't quite as big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Really doubt a nice 2H is in my near future..  Plus, how could I ever give up Avatar in exp grinds? !?<br />
<br />
I wish there was just a little more hard data around, I've done a buttload of thread parsing here and elsewhere, with not much data to show for it. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Who said you have to give up avatar?  Only takes a little swapping to keep avatar up =p  Even so, ambidex doesn't help a huge amount, for the amount of aa you have to spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can't go wrong with AE taunt.   If you get a crap load of adds, a nice AE taunt will help you to train as many mobs away so that your cleric can get out. =)<br />
<br />
Thats just me personally.  If you want offensive, do flurry then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>arzul grimwyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dont know where ya hunt or whatnot but in the  planes i use only 2hs &lt;windblwd or war marshall's&gt; i did some off. aa cf 3 flurry and PB,PB is chance of extra atk with 2hs which sends flurry off.<br />
I have done quads of flurries and the added DPS in nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have 11 AA to spend now.  Already have AE Taunt as stated earlier.  About Flurry, I thought it was consensus that its wasted AA?  Hasn't it parsed at like a 3 percent chance at Flurry 3?  Resulting to something insane like 1 flurry per hour of grinding?<br />
<br />
Appreciate the advice, really wanting people who've spent the offensive AA to weigh in on their perception.  Thank you!</div></div><hr />
