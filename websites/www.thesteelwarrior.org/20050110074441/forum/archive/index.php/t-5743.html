<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really starting to think Knights are hit too hard.  The Ikkinz trials are simply not Knight tankable unless you have at least 2 clerics, and even that is iffy.  I have 11K CH go off on me today with one cleric CHing nonstop and a shaman casting Tnarg at every opportunity, while /defensive.  I'm sorry but there is no Knight in this game right now that can possibly survive that kind of abuse with a standard group (1 cleric, possibly 1 other healer).  Yes you can bring two clerics (or even 3), to keep a Knight alive, but why?  You lose potential DPS or slower, which makes these already difficult fights even longer and further increasing chance of failure.  A Paladin can heal?  But why not get a Druid or a Cleric?  SK for DPS?  Why not a Rogue or a Wizard?  SK to pull?  Not when you're dealing with rooms of 6 packed casters that makes Monks cry.<br />
<br />
I mean, I don't think Knights need to be boosted, not at all, but it makes me wonder where they will be in this expansion.  Maybe after the 1 group trial zones they can go back to their normal things, but right now a Knight can't tank in Ikkinz and certainly plenty of other classes are better than Knights in any other aspect.  Warrior certainly has a very solid lock from Tipt and up in the 1 group settings, and I suspect this trend will continue.  If we have mobs for one group that's defensive only tankable, I don't see why it wouldn't continue that way in the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Already several posts about this over at PoN.<br />
<br />
 Speaking as a person who has yet to set foot in GoD -<br />
<br />
  IIRC, some stuff just was never tankable by Knights until well after gearing up with stuff from that expansion. AoW comes to mind. Now, this stuff is 1 group rather than raid - I get that. Problem is, all through EQ history there's been places where certain classes just get the shaft. (Places like PoJ trials, where melees are pretty much bottlenecked if you're pre-PoP geared, as one example)<br />
<br />
 If this is designed for Warriors solely to MT, AND if there's 1-group trial content past it designed solely for Knights to MT, then an argument can be made that it's balanced. If it's NOT balanced, then they need to retune. It's a bit early yet to throw in the towel for Knights, IMHO, until we see more of the progression than what people have unlocked in 8 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And even then, that's just the Ikkinz trials.  There's no reason to believe it's somehow going to get easier after.</div></div><hr />

Therefore it may be one of the only examples in all of group content where the Warrior survival advantage isn't easily matched by Knights.<br />
<br />
Players might not be even be ready for this trial and the content beyond until they have mastered and farmed the previous content - best PoTime gear, best GoD augs, etc.<br />
<br />
This really is a looking-glass version of Arch Overseers proving Knights could MT everything in PoTime and (IMO) SoE finally realizing a 382HP innate Warrior advantage and Defensive (which turned out NOT to be required) was pretty lame compensation for no spellbook.<br />
<br />
Knights CAN'T MT everything??!!! OMG!!! Decided not near the twilight of an expansion with all of it's loot in use, but 2 weeks into it. And instead of 500HP's for 45 AA and a 2% melee mitigation advantage some Paldins claim they need Defensive.<br />
<br />
Give it to them SoE.<br />
<br />
And since a Cleric (much less two) shouldn't be required in group content either, give Paladins CH. And Mana Burn. Yeah, 82% of a Warrior's DPS is unacceptable - Mana Burn, yeah. Fire = gud......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't buy that.  Our healing pattern was cleric casting CH on every possible moment, and Shaman casting Tnarg on every possible moment.  There's no way your 2 healers could've healed any more than ours.  I was defensive and although only had Virtue + Focus I doubt any Time SK can have significantly more HP than what I had there and certainly mitigation won't come close.  There were several CHs at under 20% including one for 11K.  Any Paladin/SK would have been dead for sure in any of these circumstances.  Even if the Knight wasn't meleeing the whole time (to reduce riposte, but would prolong this fight even longer than it needs to be), I just don't see this happening unless you have extreme luck with the hits for 2 minutes or you had a charmed hasted pet so you can drop the named in 60 seconds, or if you somehow aggro kited the named.<br />
<br />
I looked at the profiles of SKs from your guild via EQRanking and not a single one of them have more HP or AC than I do.  I didn't imagine those 9k heals that hit me at under 20% and certainly not the 11K heal.  I tanked them 6 times today and they'd destroy anyone without defensive even with same HP/AC given 1 cleric + 1 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swobu</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe why would I lie about that?<br />
Fact is that a Raging Fury SK DID tank Ikkinz first named and survied - I also know that Darkwind (also from AB server) has used a SK as tank on that specific named several times also.<br />
It can be done. Believe it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I simply don't see where your SK comes up with the the HP, AC, or the healing out of thin air to survive a Pixtt Whatever with what you have described because I have the exact same group makeup as you healing-wise.  There's either something you didn't tell me (runes, charmed pets) or you managed to go 2 minutes without having any round that dropped me, a Warrior with defensive and better HP/AC to 2K HPs.  <br />
<br />
If you're talking about Diabolic Destroyer, maybe that's doable.  Does she hit harder than a Pixtt?  But anyway, tanking isn't really the important part of that encounter...<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh yeah, the SK boards are saying they can kite the named, and if that's what you did, you kited the named, and most certainly did not tank them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see why a Knight wouldn't be able to tank the named with a Cleric Shaman,so long as the shaman was able to time his heals to hit the knight when he is at around half and buy the cheal enoguh time to hit,or both the Cleric and Shaman could just chain fast heals,if its a knight tanking aggro shouldn't be an issue....<br />
<br />
Hell you could use Group cheal with a knight there and cut 3 secodns off heal time with the right focus...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think its more interesting to know what lies behind these trials. <br />
<br />
If it after a bunch of trials, comes down to a bunch of raid encounters, then I dont think it is a problem if warriors are a better tank on a couple of trials leading up to the main content.<br />
<br />
Also if these trials can be done with hybrids employing &quot;alternative&quot; tactics like kiting etc, then its not an issue either imo.<br />
<br />
However, if it turns out there is required single group trials that are actually _impossible_ without a warrior then yeah they might need to make some minor changes.<br />
<br />
But its still waaay too early to judge that IMO. There are lots of things that have been thought of as &quot;impossible&quot; until someone came up with the right plan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the moment, no, they probably cant tank much and alot of groups are warrior reliant, but later after some GoD upgrades I imagine paladins and sks will be capable of tanking trials and such.<br />
<br />
I remember reading a while back of knights tanking Rallos and Quarm, you can bet your bobbysocks that knight had farmed the hell out of Time prior to getting a shot at tanking them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It IS impossible without a cleric, why not without a warrior!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need Knights to be at 15K HPs to reliably tank some of those stuff due to lack of defensive.  And even if that happens, that just means a Knight with endgame GoD loot can tank in a tier 3 zone (Ikkinz), which is like saying a PoTime Paladin can tank Lord Mithaniel Marr, which is pretty pointless.  <br />
<br />
There certainly isn't any upgrade you can obtain on the way to Ikkinz that will let a Knight tank the said encounters reliably.  I have heard trial 2 &amp; 3 are less reliant on raw tanking power, but certainly 1 is not something a Knight can reliably tank straight up in a traditional 1 cleric group.  BTW kiting does work for all these mobs, but if you're going to kite, why get a Knight?  Ikkinz is pretty cramped and the named certainly don't get snared so it's not like you can build up an amazing amount of aggro that easily (actually Warrior might even be better, because Incite is instant given the limited space to work with).</div></div><hr />

<br />
dunno if i'd go that far, but certainly healing aa + focus + spell haste + supernal light can pump out a hella lotta healing power &amp; you can tailor casting it to dps spikes due to very short cast time which might make it a better choice for high dps low hp mobs in certain cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really just 'certain cases'. While running people through ikkinz trials this weekend guild clerics weren't using it on anyone but charmed pets. DI, BOV and chain SL's worked a lot better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is bov all that useful really ? seems like it would be gone in like 8-10 hits against something hitting that hard &amp; sounds like prolly no time to recast midfight so I kinda wonder if its all that supah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gallerus I think the point here is not about mana efficiency but about squezing out maximimum healage pr second. <br />
<br />
Chaining SLs at 2.4 sec cast(+2.5 sec refresh) with 35-40% healing focus is more HPs healed pr sec than chaining CHs. And it is also nicer with a steady string of heals than a big one every 12.5 sec or so. And it allow crits heals to have better effect.<br />
<br />
Also another point: I was randomly clicking around on the top 20 SK serverwide on eqrankings, and alot of them are lacking in both +shielding and +avoidance mods compared to warriors. <br />
<br />
It seems alot of them have made the deliberate choice to forego shielding and avoidance mods, in favor of casting focuses. But if they want to tank the bleeding edge, they better make appropriate gear choices for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The unfair advantage that Knights had over us in PoP doesn't justify in any way, shape, or form an unfair advantage for us over them by requiring a disc in a 6 man group.<br />
<br />
That trial needs to be adjusted somehow, either by lowering the mob DPS to the point where a druid can heal a defensive warrior or a cleric can heal a non defensive paladin... OR... making the mob stunnable so that Paladins can use their inherent tanking skillset to prevent melee damage, but hell I don't know what to do with SK's in that instance, but they need to be able to tank them too.<br />

Nothing is more bullshit than intentionally making 2 entire classes  unable to perform their primary function or functions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, which is why I mentioned using sl in cases like this would be better than ch in the 1st place...I was just saying that I cant imagine ch is dead in single groups (i.e. never to be used again) due to its healpower/mana ratio is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've been over this a thousand times.  Sure, your &quot;Primary Function&quot; may be the same, but unlike you, Warriors do not have an entire laundry list of overpowered spells as &quot;Secondary Functions&quot; to fall back on.<br />

I cant agree with that druid part of your point. IMO Hard=Good and Trivial=Bad.<br />
<br />
If a single druid was &quot;good&quot; enough healing, then those trials would indeed by trivial with a cleric healer, where is the fun in that?<br />
<br />
IMO these trials need to be tuned so that they can be tanked by warrior with healing X, or by Pal/SK with healing power X+1 additional non-cleric healer.<br />
<br />
So if:<br />
Warrior+Cleric can do a trial, then it should be tuned so that Hybrid tank(Pal/SK)+Cleric+non-cleric healer/(Shaman/Druid/Paladin) can do it too.<br />
<br />
I dont think it is unfair that for any given configuration to make it so that if you go with a hybrid tank you require one more &quot;light&quot; healer(pal/shm/dru), to make up for the differences in tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

Thats what i was getting at :P You can't use it all that often. More than once group members (including me) have died even WITH chain sl + backup heals. <br />
<br />
On some of the named you'd be hardpressed to even use ch on a defensive/stonewalled warrior - let alone an sk or paladin.</div></div><hr />

Sir Frodlin. Hehehe<br />
<br />
I do agree, a Paladin chain stuning and an SK chain lifetapping (?), spearing, and using Harm Touch without fighting with huge damage shields is one alternative.<br />
<br />
No they shouldn't be incapable of doing it, but it should cost them mana and not being able to fight (to reduce repostes).<br />
<br />
Since hard-hitting mobs are and ought to be a Warrior's strong suit we ought to need Defensive to do it but be able to fight and add some DPS.<br />

Were you aware that because of these trials Paladins have begun a chant of &quot;we need a defensive type skill&quot; that has been picking up steam at monumental proportions?

Don't you fucking DARE call me a &quot;turncoat&quot; for seeing that there is indeed a problem which CAN be addressed EXTREMELY poorly and can threaten the very god damned raid tanking role that we have AND should have and pointing out that if CAN AND SHOULD  be addressed correctly to avoid a rather egregious error based on shortsightedness.</div></div><hr />

If you made this trial doable with one cleric and a pally tanking you make them doable by non-elemental warriors and a cleric healing with defensive.  THAT is COMPLETELY unacceptable.  <br />

<br />
Here's my concern.   Many paladins, time geared ones, feel that they cannot adequately tank these trials, and feel that because of /disc defensive, warriors have an unfair tanking advantage.  In response, they feel that they need some alteration to their defensive skillset, as the mobs are unstunnable, and they feel that they're at a disadvantage.  <br />
<br />
I'm of the belief that for the first time in a HELL of a ling time, the tanking world is finally balanced properly, but upon hearing reports like this, I'm deeply concerned, because I want my Paladin and SK friends to not feel inadequate or not able to perform a primary function of their class.   <br />

<br />
because I want my Paladin and SK friends to not feel inadequate or not able to perform a primary function of their class.<br />
<br />
Boo Fucking Hoo.  Every class has times when they are unable to perform their &quot;primary function.&quot;  You went entire expansions playing second fiddle on your &quot;primary function&quot; to Knights.  Now one pops up where Knights claim they can't tank and they scream bloody fucking kunark murder not even two weeks in.<br />
<br />
Here's a free hint, just for you, Frodlin:  Those &quot;Primary Function&quot; Knight Tanks couldn't tank the high-end mobs in PoP until they were already well-geared at the high end.  Exp groups, yeah, but Ikkinz is not an experience group zone.  Ikkinz is a trial zone.  They are treating these 6-man tests of potime+ raid-level skill as if they should be pojustice-level pickup-group style cakewalks. That they expect to blaze through this high-end caliber shit from the get-go is a flaw of their own reasoning, not a fault of the game design.<br />
<br />
I have yet to face a mob in GoD that prevents the knight from excelling in any of their 50 different secondary roles.<br />
<br />
If a knight absolutely has to always be the star of every fucking show, they can bring an extra cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree, changing the trials would be bad. They are SUPPOSED to be hard. How long did it take the top guilds to get in to Tier 3 PoP? How long did it take to get in to the EPs? Why should any guild be in tier 3 GoD in 2 weeks???<br />
<br />
I think part of the problem is that many guilds have been completely decimating every encounter in the game (outside LDoN, but those are not bad if you do them) for so long that they expected to steamroll GoD and it's not happening. My guild has been in Time for over 8 months now, and I feel we are slightly undergeared for GoD as it is. Doesn't it seem like there MIGHT be a reason that augs better than all but the top LDoN raid augs are dropping from the low tiers of GoD?<br />
<br />
As it stands, Time knights are perfectly capable of tanking up to Kod'Taz with very little GoD farming. With a few more weeks of farming the new augs and some better equipment choices, knights will be more suited for tier 2 tanking, but warriors will always be the better choice due to /defensive, which is as it should be. Warriors give up an entire spellbook of utility, basically for their disciplines. I am not surprised nor disappointed that knights are having a hard time tanking heavy hitting named this early in an expansion.<br />
<br />
To any knights that are whining for a defensive type upgrade - welcome back to Norrath, how was it being overpowered for the last year?</div></div><hr />

The only mistake they made, Frodlin is having these as single group events.<br />
<br />
If you made this trial doable with one cleric and a pally tanking you make them doable by non-elemental warriors and a cleric healing with defensive.  THAT is COMPLETELY unacceptable.  <br />
<br />
The trials cannot nor should they be changed from their current incarnation.  <br />
<br />
Brodda, usually I have the highest respect for what you post, but do you believe that regardless of however perfect play someone applies, some content should be blocked off because of gear barrier?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they were to make a change I would say they should completely remove defensive/evasive and give warriors a permanent boost in such a way as to retain the warrior/knight balance.  <br />
<br />
Until then, they need to understand that these are raid progression trials.  Our standard group is two clerics for these anyways.  And our pallies don't have too much problems tanking with two clerics.  <br />
<br />
All anyone needs to remember is that these are raid progression trials.  They are not exp groups.  The loot is very good and allowing anyone to complete them with just any old defensive warrior would be a mistake.<br />
<br />
Pallies are still exceptional exp tanks, they are still exceptional add tanks, they are still quite valuable to any raiding guild or exp group.  Their abilities being compromised in a couple of trials is not a big deal.  I can think of amny other classes who are compromised far more in these trials than pallies.  Namely dps classes and the other priests.</div></div><hr />

REZ! Having 2 rez classes is bordering on necessity. If you already have a cleric+druid/shaman, then it makes sense to add a pally/necro for additional rez duty.<br />
<br />
SKs present a little more of a problem, but I can tell you that HT+LT on a low HP heavy hitter is teh win. Manaburn is even getting a little bit of its usefulness back when you have a 2k single group hitter that has to die right now.<br />
<br />
Lastly, changing the trials so that they can be done non-defensive with a single healer would make them doable with any 8.5k warrior and 2 clerics. For the level of the content and reward we are talking about, it is ludicrous to even insinuate that a warrior at that level tank these mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what you're saying, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that since you have a secondary ability to do DPS, that if there were a mob that had like 10khp that procced a 10khp proc with a -500 resist adjust on the main tank on every swing requiring a Paladin using /disc sanctification that you'd be ok with it if it were a trial?   I mean so what if you couldn't tank it, it's a trial for god's sake, and you have DPS to fall back on right? <br />
<br />
Incidentally, I'm not talking about people fresh out of NToV, I'm talking about 10-11khp knights out of time.   Since prior to the trials there doesnt' appear to be a whole lot of type 8 augments or time gear upgrades, exactly how would you expect them to &quot;gear up&quot; for this trial?   This is SINGLE GROUP content, and as such, it should be doable by a single group.  Now if it turns out that a reasonably equipped Paladin (EP+) can tank the trials using 2 clerics, then I may be ok with it.</div></div><hr />

YES.  OMG yes.  This game is about progression.  Some of the best expansions I can remember had the greatest inflation in gear.  Take velious.  HoT armor and Kael armor quests were amazing upgrades.  You farmed that and then went on to even greater things.  PoP was the same way to an extent.  Gear up in elementals to farm time.  Luclin didn't do all that much.  Pretty much the entire expansion could have been beaten right off except for key quests.<br />
<br />
However, people without time equipment or even elemental gear will be able to make it to kodtaz.  And in there they can find some very significant equipment upgrades in small groups.  Of course you may have to mini raid much of it.  But it has been a while since I have seen an area where non-raid people can expect great upgrades.  (on the order of 125hp-145hp items)  It isn't quite Halls of Testing but it is pretty close.<br />
<br />
I prefer the expansion where you gear up to kill the mean nasty stuff and get even better gear.  I HOPE that I run into stuff that completely smashes my guild even with perfect play until we get better geared.

If you don't know that I'm a rogue...<br />
<br />
See, I'm in an even worse situation than these knights, friend.  I have 1 primary function and 2 secondaries: DPS, then Scouting &amp; CR.<br />
<br />
I get sacrificed from my primary role so groups have more healing / tanking / crowd control / utility.  I don't even get considered for CR (Ikkinz doesn't respawn) or Scouting (hello eq-toolbox and holgresh beads), so your argument is moot.<br />
<br />
This is why I have a problem with Knight whining in GoD.  I have to weasel my way into Ikkinz trials non-prime-time when the core classes aren't online.  These fuckers actually are wanted for them, and get to go, but whine that they aren't the guy tanking.  Fuck them.  If they don't want the utility slot, I'll take it in a heartbeat.<br />

I don't know, maybe they can let the warrior tank for a little, then gear up in qvic or uqua or txevu to ungodly levels, then go back and tank whateverthefucktheywant?  I don't recall knights throwing a shitfit the first few weeks that Fennin Ro was untankable by anything but a Warrior in /disc defensive, but I could be wrong.  It has been two years, after all.<br />

<br />
The paladins in my guild who tanked them (which is the same guild as Thep) died many many times using 2 clerics. In fact the pet ended up finishing 2 of the 3 mini bosses because both paladins died durring the fight. I beleive one of the paladins died over 10 times durring that short expedition. That is no way to win. I tried several tines using a cleric/druid and it just wasnt enough healing keep me up. <br />
<br />
As a note, the only reason why we tend to use 2 clerics more often is because we have 1 active druid, so more often than not for 2 healer groups we pair up clerics. Shaman can do it, it just makes it slighty harder.<br />
<br />
The warriors live easily with cleric/druid/warrior combo's. Even had a few groups win with a cleric/sham/war combo. Paladins need not apply for those groups. If you require 2 clerics to tank in a 6 man group, then it isnt tuned properly or Paladins need a defensive skill/spell/ability. <br />
<br />
My obvious response is that there's a rather dramtic gulf between not being able to do something and realizing that you need to tailor your group to compensate, but this doesn't seem to fall in line with the interchangeability aspect.  <br />
<br />
Now I dont' want to get you into hot water with your guildmates, but I would really like to know if Drayron is succumbing to overreaction, or if this is a real issue.</div></div><hr />

Oh - I can agree and live with that.  What would annoy me is if to experience this expansion, you were 'required' to have beaten the previous expansion.  If, on the other hand, it was possible to get the gear necessary to beat those items without farming time but just farming the new expansion that is something I agree with.<br />
<br />
For example - to farm armor in HoT, you did not need gear out of VP, but gear out of KD arena was fine.  To farm VT, you did not need to have cleared NToV, but just farming Ssra a little was fine.  To do well in PoP, farming Tower bosses in BoT and a little lower end PoP loot tied you over pretty well - if to experience GoD you'd be required to have farmed timed I would be a little annoyed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 2.4 + 2.5 = 5 seconds per SL, with focus etc it figures out to be 4K HP per 5 seconds (actually not that high, just being generous) versus ~9k with maxed AA every 12.5 seconds for CH.  You're looking at 800 DPS healed (not counting crits) on SL and 720 DPS healed with CH.  SL isn't as good as you think.  If you can be killed while CHing you can get killed chain SL either and the fight is of nontrivial length to have one cleric blast SLs.  If you assume the cleric uses 400 mana per SL (a 600 mana spell), 8K mana pool gets you 20 which is only 100 seconds before you're OOM.  SL can heal a lot more versus CH if you get crits at the right time but that's not something you can count on.<br />
<br />
Vie is of no significance on these mobs unless you have two clerics.  If you have two clerics you can easily CH a tank too.  You can do it with one + one shaman, barely.<br />
<br />
On a final note, Pixtts are stunnable (at least that's what our monk said).  However, since they're level 68, you're probably better off bringing a monk with SoT to stun them than counting on Divine Stun to save you.<br />
<br />
I don't agree Rogues are inferior to Knights on these.  DPS is a form of damage prevention, and any way I can kill a Pixtt faster I will take it.  Knights do nothing to decrease the length of the fight against a Pixtt, certainly nothing other classes can't offer.  I'm not saying they need to be upgraded or whatever, but I really don't see much going for them right now in these trials.</div></div><hr />

I couldnt' disagree more with that statment.  Named mobs as some panacaea of difficulty which required a pseudo-raid level force to beat are an invention of Luclin and are BAD for EQ.    <br />
<br />
Named mobs shouldn't be overwhelmingly powerful, and in a SIX person environment shouldn't require time gear unless they and all that follows them are type 8 aug droppers, then it'd be fine, but it shouldn't be because they're &quot;named&quot; but because they're &quot;gatekeepers&quot; and again, I DO have a problem with setting the boundary at time level gear, and not EP level gear for non-warriors, yet a warrior in LDoN gear could do them.<br />
<br />
As I said, if it's just a matter of haviong 2 clerics, ok I can live with that.  If it's a matter of &quot;impossible&quot; then it's wrong.   To set the standard of ability at two COMPLETELY different areas of success between two classes, then I have a problem with it.</div></div><hr />

Stop the theorizing, go look for a topic to debate that actually has 2 sides. Give Knights defensive then you have to give warriors an enormous spellbook and nearly endless mana pool.

Dray is a damn good player.  But he doesn't really see the big picture a lot of times.  This is a SMALL part of the expansion.  I was in a group with our best geared warrior and two clerics.  We died 4 times to the last mini-named.  <br />
<br />
In fact the pally group finished the three trials BEFORE the group I was in and we started at the same time.  Sure it was only by a few minutes but they did finish first.<br />
<br />
Again, these are not progression trials for one group.  They are one group progression trials for a raid.  Finishing these trials does not open up and one group content.  It opens up raid content.</div></div><hr />

These are not one group exp zones, they are raid trials that lead to raid content. The gear that is dropping in these trials is better than tier 1-3 Time loot due to the addition of END and some new or very rare caster foci as well as similar HP/mana. The simple fact that the augments switch from the typical type 7 to Time level type 8 should tell you something. People who do not even have a piece of gear that a type 8 augment will fit on, have no business being able to beat the trials that they drop in with any tank, much less a knight tanking.<br />
<br />
I am pretty proud of my warrior, stats-wise he has similar HP/AC to an EP level knight and can tank as well while defensive as an early Time level knight. Named even the Tipt and Vxed trials are not even an option, he gets smoked, just like a 10k knight would without 2 healers. There is no way in hell an LDoN or VT equiped warrior would be able to tank the tier 2 trials, they would have a hard time doing the tier 1 trials!<br />
<br />
More accurately, just to get by you need very well equiped EP warriors or very well equiped Time knights. 9khp just doesn't cut it on mobs that quad 1800+ when you only have 1/2 healers. Hell, 12k is barely enough and requires a little luck without defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People don't get that this isn't a situation you adapt.  You simply cannot straight up tank a Pixtt Whatever as a Knight with a 1 cleric + 1 shaman group.  I tanked 3 Pixtts in Trial 1 and even with defensive they managed to kill me twice with chain healing (and I highly doubt chain SL would've worked given their HPs... they're 2 minute fights at least without charm).  It is certain death for a Knight who lacks defensive seeing defensive drops Pixtt's damage to about 500-1300 (I have shielding) which is a ton of damage mitigated.  <br />
<br />
1 Cleric + 1 Druid might be able to do it (but I see these groups far less common than 1 cleric + 1 shaman), and maybe the point is that we can't stick with traditional groups but 1 cleric + 1 other healers has always been deemed as enough.  Well it simply isn't anymore if you want a Knight to tank.  Pixtt do 1000 DPS easily while disced and if you're running Cleric + Shaman, a Knight can have 50K HP and I'm willing to put money that the Pixtt will eventually win assuming you don't actually get to heal for 15K on a crit CH, simply because she will put out more DPS than what your healers can heal at max efficiency.  <br />
<br />
I don't think Knights should be able to tank Pixtts with a standard healing group (1 cleric + other) but the one group trials does seem to hit them pretty hard.  Yes there are raid content after but given the current trend of how hard mobs hit, I wouldn't be surprised if even yard trash would require defensive to tank when the raid zones come.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't easy keeping the pally alive, but get this, while he was tanking, the paladin was able to heal the rampage tank (my bard buddy) all by himself.  <br />
<br />
I don't know how tough Ikkinz is, but that boss at the end of Tipt is no slouch.  These trials aren't easy for anyone, and if people are making it through them with knights tanking a week after the expansion is released, even if it's sloppy and requires special group makeup, I don't see a problem.  Having a back-up resser can save tons of time if the cleric pulls aggro as someone else mentioned.  In my view of EQ, if you are tanking something hard, a warrior should be your first choice to do it.  If a knight can do it but takes special group considerations and maybe a little luck (these things are far from a guaranteed win even with a warrior tanking) then things are balanced pretty damn well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I keep saying this in /gu but when pop came out the power level of the mobs compared to players seemed extraoridnary,it seemed as though no one outside of VT equipped people would be able to beat poj trials and beyond.Its simply a matter of developing new skills and adjusting your style of play.By the end of PoP nothing in the expansion was terribly difficult anymore and could be tanked with a variety of classes.<br />
<br />
Shamans tank Fennin Ro now,when PoP first came out it was thought that he would be immpossible to defeat because of his DPS and AE Ramp.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Crying for nerfs/upgrades a week into an expansion knowing full well how old expansion have gone is a little premature.What about the warriors in some of our time guilds lesser equipped? I know that a 10 k tank with mostly EP armor doesn't mitigate nearly as well as me with only 1k HP more,I see it in my own guild.It just means that perhaps we need to farm a bit more and adjust our style of play (which has got pretty lax in the last few months as we started to become overgeared for pop) and we will win.<br />
<br />
<br />
The challenege is good,the encounters are fun to learn so far outside of a few random bugs,and I don't really think its time that discussions on who or what to nerf start up.</div></div><hr />

Didn't read the entire post, but if CH isn't fast enough, why are they using it? On encounters like this, our Clerics spam Supernal Light as opposed to CH. Much faster cast, and I believe (not confirmed) that with healing aa/focus items, it heals more Hp/second on average, than Complete Heal does. It just makes alot more sense to me, and probably most Clerics, too.<br />

With a DI safety net, and Divine Arbitration, a Knight can still tank these no problem, if a Warrior can.</div></div><hr />

However, I've died MANY times when trying to tank them, bring a warrior and bam NP.<br />
<br />
If this wasnt a single group encounter, I would totally understand the reason why Knights would be such a liability, because you CHOOSE to use a Knight to tank, having 1/12 people In a warrior, is somewhat close to most guild composistiions. However my guild, and most guilds just flat out done have enough warriors to do them.<br />
<br />
People who say &quot;well this is start of exspantion pack&quot; of course stuff is gunna be hard, you have to farm stuff, XP, etc...<br />
<br />
Farm What? YES 100 more HP and 50 more AC from augments.. I CAN DO IT NOW...<br />
<br />
Not. There arnt any real things to farm in GoD until you Get to these trials..... No tanking AA's no HP AA's, no drastic gear upgrades<br />
<br />
Most of the mobs have incredible DI/DB ratios, with DB being like 200-600 and DI being 80+. This means the things that Knights can get (Shielding) has a very Minimal effect on damage tanking, while defensive has a HUGE effect.<br />
<br />
This is PERFECTLY acceptable for multible group encounters, however in a single group encounter (even if it is raid related, it is a single group encounter) It makes it so Knights doing their Primary Role is too much of a risk to do it RELIABLY.<br />
<br />
Re: Knights getting defensive - Knights in General do not want defensive or defensive like abilities, we are questioning our role in these single group encounters, and while we can definatly see roles for ourself in them, hell personally I love having a warrior in expeditions, performing CC, spot heals, etc etc, I'm content with that role in a multible group encounter, however when you take it down to 6 people, we need to beable to perform our Primary roles, reliablity, and we've seen that Warriors have gotten many well deserved and needed upgrades, and wondering where to go, we see it as an option to try to solve what we feel are content problems, however in general we'd MUCH rather have the content be changed. We do not want to make it more gimpy, or less challenging, we want to beable to not be a liablity to a SINGLE group by doing our PRIMARY job.</div></div><hr />

We didn't charm (and heard you can't do it anyway)and those seem to take around 2 minute to kill with a respectable DPS group (war/monk/bard/cleric/wiz/shaman).  Seems like a cleric would've ran out of mana first, and certainly if we have less DPS (say had someone not a rogue instead of the wizard).<br />
<br />
Besides SL uncrit doesn't heal for more than about 4K.  It can't be that much more healed over time.  4k/5 seconds is 800 DPS with SL compare to 720 DPS if assume CH is 9k (and it gets close to that often enough).  Although SL probably will heal more max more often, I've found that CH disturbingly heals at its max efficiency most of the time on Pixtt.</div></div><hr />

The argument that there isn't any upgrades to that point is wrong.<br />
<br />
There are alot of Tanks going into these things with 12k+ HP ,we have one partiuclar paladin with 11k and 9% sheilding and 20 avoidance who can tank better than most wars non defensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is obvious that the encounters have been designed to be challenging primarily for people that farmed Ldon Raids...the majoirty of these complaints and the suggestion that there isn't any upgrades available prior to ikkinz are being made by people who have not farmed Ldon Raids extensively,for the guidls that have these trials are not terribly difficult at all.<br />

<br />
I'm assuming these are rough numbers. If you take those rough numbers and look at them, you will see that mob has a DI of 91 (raw DI) and a DB of 463. Max non warrior hit would be 2291 (assuming the same shielding mods). Max hit on a defensive warrior would be 1373. That is almost exactly the average 40% less damage for using defensive.  I'm going to take those numbers with a grain of salt since Phantorn didn't display much confidence in them, but if they are close they illustrate the problem. <br />
<br />
To compare to a 10k defensive warrior with a cleric healing him(who is taking 40% less damage) a knight would need (100/60) * 10k, or 16k hp and 2 clerics backing him up to tank equally well.</div></div><hr />

No it wouldn't.  It isn't nearly as large of a difference as you make out.  These mobs don't hit for max all that often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's something like 500-1319 with defensive and 11% shielding.<br />
<br />
And until you actually tanked one of them don't say they don't hit for max that often.  Yes of course it's not hitting for 1319 50% of the time because that'd just be impossible.  Doesn't change the fact that defensive drops its damage significantly.<br />

Going to try these trials with SL tonight since everyone swears that it's the magic solution.  I just don't see SL suddenly providing the heals over CH, but who knows.</div></div><hr />

I have logs.  I have looked at logs.  Defensive will probably shave off 20% dps IF that.  It does help stop spikes though.  <br />
<br />
Yes, the random number generator will rear its ugly head more often as a knight without the safety of defensive, but they are not crippled and can tank well enough to finish the trials.<br />

<br />
No, no, no, no, no.<br />
<br />
That is the whole purpose behind Defensive; to give Warriors a significant advantage over other tanking classes. While I don't think these shouldn't be Knight tankable (one group events SHOULD be), I also don't advocate removing the Warriors advantage over other tank classes. That's just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
To sum it up: We SHOULD be the superior tank when it comes to events like this, however, Knights should be able to tank -- at a disadvantage. (Lack of Defensive. Increased risk.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have not farmed Ldon Raids then you have skipped content.;and are now dong content designed with the assumption that you have in fact famred Ldon Raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Had the content been designed for guilds that have not done Much ldon if at all,the group of Top End Ldon guilds would be well beyond the content they are at currently.<br />
<br />
My guild has not farmed Ldon,We did only a handful of raids,but we realize that because of our choosing to skip content the conisquences of that choice are now becomine apperent.<br />
<br />
So we are met with a greater challenge then perhaps a guild that has partkaken in ldon raids extensively.None the less with some adjusting of tactics we have found some success in Kod'Taz trials and we are learning how to adapt to our lower level of gear.<br />
<br />
You can psot numbers all day about the mobs DPS.We had a Beastlord Tank the Typt Boss,and then the next day get owned by a mob in barindu in a group.The mobs so far seem to have fairly low attack,AC makes a big difference.But they still spike and you have  to be reay for that,one of the Pixxt in Ikkinz can put out  more than 6k in a round with max hits and a proc on you even while defensive and an SL won't heal that damage unless its a crit,another good round after that and your at the point where SL won't outheal the DPS the mob is putting out and you grab your ankles and hope DI goes off.<br />
<br />
At the same time you can go through the fight with the mob hitting low enough or missing enough that you cna actually chain cheal.Its all random,Mobs there seem kinda like TZ in time where you get the big spieks or you get really cosntant fluid hits and its easy to heal.This is a godo expansion for showing the worth of your individual clerics,It gives them a chance to step up and offers a little more strategy to their class,The fact that we as tanks end up suffering for this expermintation can suck somedays but that is how you learn.<br />
<br />
If knights can't tank this stuff even with the best ehaling mthods,then its because these knights are not geared well enough either becase A) Their guild has not been in time long enough or B) They famred time and ignored Ldon and are now finding that they are not as functinal in every situation as they were with the cream of the crop in gear in an expansion over a year old.</div></div><hr />

and backup heals.  As a warrior I wont set foot in god trials without a backup healer, guild group only.<br />
<br />
And if a warrior needs backup heals, then its no diff for knights.<br />

These encounters where not designed with EP level people in mind, that is plainly obvious since type 8 augs drop. These encounters where designed with Time in mind as well as LDoN.<br />
<br />
There is a HUGE difference between a knight that farmed Time and one that farmed LDoN extensively. Take a look at the difference for yourself. Here are a pair of magelos, all the same exact equipment.<br />
<br />
I chose the gear so that all major spell foci are represented, worn ATK and worn mana regen are maxed. The first one assumes only light LDoN farming, enough to fill up with the 40hp augs - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=939201<br />
<br />
The second assumes that the guild hit LDoN raids hard and often, beating all of the Time level raids repeatedly - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=939201&amp;alt=177434<br />
<br />
The difference? 370hp and 127ac. Doesn't sound like much does it? Now ask yourself how many gear upgrades it would take you to get that kind of increase in power. It would take 6 pieces of gear with an average of over 50hp and 15ac increase on each item. That's 6 pretty significant upgrades or to put it in to a little better perspective - 6 upgrades that are similar in magnitude as going from EP to Time armor is. This of course is assuming that the lesser pally is decked in Time gear. Put in a pally that is half Time, half EP and the difference is even greater.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that the top knights are tanking the Kod'Taz trials, I know at least knights in my guild are capable. Spend a few more months farming Time and lower GoD for augs, maybe that will help since that is what the content was apparently designed for.</div></div><hr />

No it would not.  Applying the defensive bonus to all the hits would only cut the damage by about 10-20% max.</div></div><hr />

How many times do you have to do 4 - 6 hour trials before you just wanna say no, i wont go there no more. Ive lost count of how many Vxxed Tipt and Ikkinz trials ive tanked especially in ikkinz as in the view of most people knights simply dont have the tanking ability 99% of the time. <br />
<br />
Me tanking also takes away a flag from someone else who could use it, altho you can swap people in for the mountains.<br />

Problem is, if you make it too easy, it becomes trivial, if its too hard you need power groups to get through em. <br />

If you look at what you need for Ikkinz #1, Time lvl War( the rare knight), cleric, 2nd priest class, enchanter, puller class, only leaves 1 more for dps and who's gunna pick a knight? <br />
<br />
The funny thing Ikkinz 1 is very hard, ikkinz 2 is easier and ikkinz 3 is a cakewalk</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your guildmates will because they need you on the other side. These aren't pickup groups.  If you can't get a group to do these trials then you need to find a new guild.<br />
<br />
And it's already been established that knights can and do tank these trials, so I don't buy the assumption that you can only be dps.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: btw Wandor, that's the biggest loot whore paladin I've ever seen. I don't know of any paladins that have every slot filled with time loot, much less have those augments too. Negative DKP, here I come! Maybe because your guild hasn't been in Time for 9 months? Here is an actual magelo from our top paladin - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=559134. It's all about how long you have been farming Time/LDoN.<br />

For guilds that have done the LDoN progression and farmed the crap out of Time, their knights are tanking just fine. You guys just beat Quarm a couple weeks ago, how can you have possibly geared up to beat the next step in the progression? Has your guild repeatedly beat the Time level LDoN raids? If not, then you are undergeared for the next step. Our paladins, not including Heebee, average over 7700hp and 2022ac and they have been able to tank fine.<br />
<br />
Of course a defensive warrior can tank better, BUT THAT'S THE POINT! That is the trade off you make for getting heals, buffs, stuns, agro lock, rez, root, LoH, and any other spells I might have missed.<br />
<br />
Ever think its not the game thats the problem, but perhaps the player?WHAT??!?!? You mean some people might have to progress through the game and not get a free pass to the best loot in the game? HERETIC! ;)</div></div><hr />

It shouldnt be you near full time gear for these to do your primary group role if your a Knight ([tank], and yes we have aother stuff that i am PERFECTLY happy with in a multi group situation) However if your any other class you can do your roll passibly with combination of Elemental/LDoN/Time Gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knights should'nt have to be the 6th man we have to get through, they should be able to tank these trials and not be a person we only flag cause they are a guildmate or the person we have just to fill a spot.<br />
<br />
Knights can and do tank these yes, but in a perfect group not all pallies with time gear can tank ikkinz named succesfully where as in a little less rounded groups warriors of equal or lesser gear can do it much easier. <br />
<br />
Im by no means a top class tank gear wise, when GoD went live warriors in my guild have 1500hp on me and pallies have equal hp and 200+ ac on me yet in not perfect groups i did and contunue to do it easy. <br />
<br />
I never said knights can only be dps, i said if you were looking for a 6th spot in a group with previous 5 not being a dps class, would you choose a pally over a wiz/ranger/rogue/mage?<br />
<br />
If its just for flagging purposes group make up doesnt matter as long as you get the flag, if its to go named hunting and you dont wanna be there an extra hour, youll go dps.<br />
<br />
The solution to this? i don't know, im sure many people have their own ideas, i'd suggest waiting a few weeks and then see what happens, mobs are being retuned all the time.<br />

I have logs. I have looked at logs. Defensive will probably shave off 20% dps IF that. It does help stop spikes though.<br />
<br />
Applying the defensive bonus to all the hits would only cut the damage by about 10-20% max.<br />
<br />
If we use those numbers that Phantron gave for min and max hit and then assume your numbers for % of hits for max and min are correct, we can get a rough (very rough) idea of what the average mitigation savings is. <br />
<br />
DI=91<br />
DB=463<br />
<br />
I'll take the average of &quot;30-40%&quot; and go with 35%. Subtracting the 3% max hits, that leave 62% of the hits to be distributed roughly equally amongst the other 18 values (0.62/18) which gives ~3.4% chance of being hit for any of those value. <br />

<br />
The first set of parens holds the damage output for that interval times the percentage of hits for that DI *100. If you look at DI=1, you will see that 509*35=17815. Warrior listed first, knight second.<br />
<br />
The second set of parens holds the total damage taken, adding from top to bottom using variable+ logic, warrior listed first, knight second.<br />
<br />
79512 total damage is 30% less damage than 113044. That's a requirement of 43% more healing for the knight.<br />
<br />
That's the numbers. Take them with a grain of salt because they are rough, but they should be fairly ballpark. Take from it what you will. But defensive does NOT cut damage &quot;by about 10-20% max&quot; against a mob with that DB and that DI that hits for min 35% of the time. To cut damage by only &quot;10-20% max&quot; you have to get hit for minimum 75% of the time (for 20%) and get hit for minimum OVER 95% of the time (for 10%). Good luck with that!<br />
<br />
EDIT: I also wanted to point out that average savings isn't even the issue. Teh percentage of savings when damage output is highest is the difference in relative tanking power. Since that number is 40% less, a knight would require 1.66 times the healing power of a warrior to tank the same content, assuming there is no danger of being 1 rounded. If there is that danger, then the knight now needs up to 1.66 times the hp AND more healing to survive the same content.<br />
<br />
Do you think your monk could tank a mob that averages 1000 DPS? What if the mob attacked once every 20 seconds and did 1000 DPS?  That would mean the mob averages 20k damage per combat round. Average DPS isn't a very good yardstick for measuring survivability.</div></div><hr />

Warriors really don't appreciate how good defensive is for encounters like this.  It doesn't matter as much when you an army of clerics behind you to CH you every round, but in an environment where healing power is limited, it does matter a lot.<br />
<br />
I have many 9K heals and 1 11K heal tanking these while disced.  A Knight will mostly certainly die on the 11K heal, and most likely would've died on the 9K heals as well.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
                       Have seen both tank and sure the knight had some luck to live thru the encounter but thats kinda logic, warriors are supposed to have the edge in tanking. That was with cleric + shaman spotting btw on both setup.<br />
<br />
                       The only thing that made me laugh in the thread is the poster that posted the magelo of a time equiped paladin and then a ldon equiped paladin. I Don't know about you but for one almost no guild farmed ldon ( we did and completed all raids) and for 2 the knights certainly didn't get 3 or 4 70hp augment + god know what else. Warriors got the hp before others mostly along with shielding. That ldon setup with like 10 raid augment isn't really realist for 95% + of the knights.<br />
<br />
                 edit:  With a spotter, casting supernal light is a waste of mana, ch work much better as far as efficiency/aggro/healing power is concerned. Unless naturally your tank can't live 10second between ch while getting spots. The only case I would have the cleric in my group use SL to heal the tank would be a flurrying mob.

Sure it does.  This content is post-plane of time post LDoN.  Only the very top end people are making it through these.  If warriors are able to make it through with somewhat worse equipment than paladins, that's just fine in my book.

If someone, because of a situation outside of their control (Design/Encounter/Balance) feels inadequate to perform a task, a task which, were it any other class would require something like an ancient spell to complete, a bane weapon, etc, yet are the only people required to realistically attain a certain set of gear (an unauged Ifir Rogue who can use evade is capable without any special alterations to playstyle to contribute to this event, just as a half-naked mage, wizard, etc), then they *feel bad* about their role.   I dont' like playing a game where one large group of people feel bad about their role.<br />

This has been for RAIDS, yes this for raid progression, but its still single group encounters, (not to mention many of the tradeoffs (for good reason) have been removed for warriors, defensive provides a HUGE boost, as Graal has said its not about the average DPS that defensive reduces its about the huke spike it re duces...<br />
<br />
Being hit between 500 and 1500 is a WORLD of difference between 500 and 2500 in a single group encounter<br />
<br />
Ok lets say the boss's were really hard for warriors to taunt, and w/o an SK buff, and two clerics (to lessen their ag gro) you stand a very very good chance of loosing, yes sometimes you can win if healers really watch their aggro, you get a good serious of procs (RNG) wouldnt you feel that its lame?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For arguments sake, lets say SoE tones down the raw DPS the MT has to take on those encounters so a knight can tank them realiably.  What is the warrior going to gain in return for losing his class-defined advantage?  To be balanced, there needs to be a tradeoff.  What I see most knights suggesting is &quot;nerf DPS without any gains for the warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not a huge fan of defensive, but its the only ability we have that knights cannot do better.  That 5% mitigation bone during the melee upgrade patch doesn't save our healers any mana.</div></div><hr />

Single group raid? Bullshit. This is single group content with maximum players allowed to participate enforced at 1 group. When you can figure out how to bring 3 groups along then we'll call it raid content, ok?<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights can certainly (as has been pointed out on this thread) tank this stuff, if you make tradeoffs. &quot; <br />
<br />
Tradeoffs like having half of the group as dedicated healers, with a minimum of 2 clerics in the group? Or did you mean tradeoffs like having to wait an extra 10 seconds before the shaman can slow? Oh wait...that was the tradeoff that groups using a warrior as MT had to live with that was unbalanced. When warriors can produce an average of 6950 numerical hate per minute from procs and incite, I don't think there is alot in the way of tradeoffs to be made. Btw, that's equivalent to a stun every 4 seconds in terms of aggro.<br />

&quot;They can also win these trials, not being the main tank, which is a tradeoff.&quot; <br />
<br />
Performing what group role, pray tell? Group jester? DPS? Whoopty fuck, I can root!<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is this an issue, again, exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because 2 entire classes cannot perform their primary singe group function to any degree of satisfaction at all.</div></div><hr />

I am probably the last person who should be posting on this topic, but one of my RL friends (a bard) beat the Tipt trial last night with a paladin tanking and a cleric and druid healing.  It wasn't easy keeping the pally alive, but get this, while he was tanking, the paladin was able to heal the rampage tank (my bard buddy) all by himself.<br />
<br />
You guys should read the whole thread yah? Why no one here is even mentioning that group with knight/shamie/cleric already have 3 healers because knights can heal. OMG that must be new one! (anyone who says knights are shity healers dies. especially knights with 7k mana and ft15 as Wandor's guildie has) They also have LoH and bunch of other utility stuff that you and I cant coment on. So ya if it doesnt work for them to be just warrior for this encounter you can adjust your strategy and win and omg like 5 ppl stated that knights on their server kicked ass through these trials.</div></div><hr />

So you didn't heal so well, but I'm guessing you did about 8k damage in 1 second at the beginning of the fight there eh? and snared and FD split mobs on the way to the boss?  Just your HT is 60-70 dps in a fight this long.  So if you can't tank well, you can play both a good DPS member on the last fight and the puller on the way to him.  This doesn't sound like a disaster for you to me.</div></div><hr />

Sure as long as it comes with an equivalent mana tap.  As soon as you take defensive away then you just made knights the hands down best tanks for this kind of thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have content that now requires a warrior to do. Whats wrong with adding a paladin to a group, or a SK?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah they have to be number 1 at all things, I disagree with you Frodlin. They may not be having fun but if those encounters were designed specificly for warriors then why are you trying to fix them?.<br />
<br />
We spent so much time in the dumps because almost all tankable non raid content went to knights, and now we have a justification for being a part of the group and your handing it away.<br />
<br />
Foul on you sir. <br />
<br />
It has only been a week since release, The encounters as they stand are fine, they dont ened to be fixed or adjusted for the three tank classes.  We have defensive for a reason, that reason has a purpose in Gates now, It helps US survive.<br />
<br />
Why cut away at our class defining skill so your sand in pussy time level friends can take warrior tank spots?<br />
Foul on you again.  If they cant win then they are not doing soemthing right, Maybe  they should change up group strat.<br />
<br />
Now on the last issue you brought up.<br />
if you want dev's to put endurance draining affects by monsters in the game, Then I want a endurance regening spell put in.  It's unfair to nerf our abilities which has a slow regen as it is, Only to cripple our class by not being able to disc, So that your time buddies again with sand in their pussies can get ahead.<br />
<br />
I want equality. If your a time level knight you have FT15, and prolly VoQ + Nine = 54 mana regen standing. per tic. Our endurance bar is around 20 endurance a tic while fighting. <br />
Unless we are given some more items to help bring our pool regeneration up, Then by no means should mobs have a way to suck endurance from us. That will only help cripple our class.<br />
<br />
I can agree that hey they for a change arent top dog in xp groups anymore IN A BRAND NEW EXPANSION. But um thems the brakes, And as I do respect you for the hard work you have done for our class, in one fell topic you want to cripple our abilities so that knights can tank time+ raid-esque mobs in trials for a expansion one week old. <br />
<br />
Why is the only question I can utter. Why?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kadah,  <br />
<br />
Actually I dont' want to disable anything or undo anything.  I want *one* type of encounter to be made more fair.  This isn't referring to every mob, every raid mob, or hell, ANY raid mob.  This is referring to a VERY limited area where any reasonable person would agree that a 1-2 complete tier difference in guild advancement exists between two classes, and how to correct that.   That's all.   <br />
<br />
When two classes who perform a similar primary function have in order to succeed a full 1-2 tiers worth of advancement difference JUST TO PERFORM, there's a problem.   To make it so that equality in advancement to perform exists, an End/Mana drain on the bosses seems pretty damn fair, and it STILL favors warriors in both mit and aggro control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A bit of background...<br />
<br />
My guild has been in time pretty much since it was feasable, over 30+  quarm kills to their credit etc.<br />
<br />
I however only recently joined, yet due to pretty much most stage 1-4 time gear rotting i gained a lot of hp fast.<br />
<br />
Including tribute and GoD aa's i stand at 8600 unbuffed or 11k raid buffed and found that..<br />
<br />
I got creamed, took us  4 attempts to kill the 1st boss, this was with 2 clerics, myself, chanter, monk and bard.  Not the ideal group but good enough, the rest of the group was far better geared than i btw.<br />
<br />
Even with 2 clerics and chain DI we found that they couldnt guarantee to keep a riposte/def warrior up so how the feck are pallies/sk's meant to cope ?<br />
<br />
Because of the charm nerf, repopped roamers, and the &quot;try again&quot; timer that makes actually getting enough groups together to push through the trials, how are guilds meant to progress at more than a crawl?<br />
<br />
Its not like you can park peeps outside the trials to buff unless you wanna make groups stay outside and clear the 3 temples.   Another gripe is why make it so fecking hard to get to the bloody dungeon? BDA runs or run and die/rogue drags are taking the piss.<br />
<br />
Tad drunk but ill try and make a coherant statement to finish...<br />
<br />
The trials are (now at least) are too hard for sk/pal to tank imho for which i think they should feel aggrieved at, i did not expect SoE to make required content of the expansion a form of melee rebalance.<br />
<br />
And yes, i sat LFG for hours at a time cos no bugger wanted a warrior except during raids but i dont think our fellow tanks should have to spend the next 3 years in time to be able to do the job that they should be able to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaboo</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights are the preferred single-group tank for 99% of all known content.  Along comes 1% that warriors are better equipped to handle and they don't want to give up even that 1% to anyone.<br />
<br />
Publically, knights will say there are 3 tanking classes that can do the job.  Privately, they are saying as long as they are top dog on 100% of group content, it's all good.  Knights &gt;are&lt; getting through these trials with solid healing.  I don't see a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thinng from previous expansions that are analagous to this are maybe the PoJ trials and to a lesser extent the PoS minis. I don't recall PoJ trials requiring a fully VT/Ssra equipped tank to beat. They didn't require much in the way of gear at all, unless the group was a freshly dinged level 61 group. There was a progression path within the context of that expansion to enable the player with average equipment to move on, namely levelling. There is no analagous progression path here. Originally, those same trials were horribly broken in that knights were by far the preferred tank for them, but of course that is no longer the case due to some needed changes that have gone in. I also don't recall PoS minis requiring a fully VT/Ssra equipped warrior to tank them. A warrior in cultural and HoT quest mix could do the job just fine, and that was unquestionably designed specifically as raid level content. <br />
<br />
To require not just complete content consumption of the previous expansion, but also complete farming(!!!), before being able to effectively do your job to any degree in the new expansion AT ALL, is a very large departure from previous expansions. If that same situation was true for all classes, it would just be piss poor expansion design. If it is only true for specific classes, it is unbalanced. I'd like to see you argue differently.<br />
<br />
Way back when guilds first started getting in to the EPs, people said the mobs hit too hard to be hunted for exp. Anyone remember the FoH update when they go in to PoFire and how field2 was described? A few months later, field2 has exp groups farming trade supplies.<br />
<br />
I don't recall anyone saying that plane of valor was too hard to tank effectively or that CoD was too difficult. No one complained that ravens in PoN were untankable by a level 60 tank with average gear. This expansion was billed as being content for &quot;levels 55 through 65&quot;. How many zones are level 55 tanks of ANY class going to be tanking in this expansion? Gear restrictions should not be that strict for single group content of the initial zones of an expansion.<br />
<br />
Why is it so hard to understand that you have to have a certain level of gear to tank this shit? If your knights don't have 7.5k hp and 2.1k ac, then they are undergeared.<br />
<br />
Again, this wouldn't be nearly the issue (not a class balance issue at least) if the gear requirements for warriors wasn't orders of magnitude lower. Elemental equipped warriors (who have never beaten an elemental god) can tank this stuff about as well as (or better than) knights who have been farming time extensively. I'll bet that the knight probably does a noticeably better job on the trash tanking on the way to the named (and he should with that level of gear differential) but that doesn't change the fact that beating the named at the end is the deciding factor for success or failure of the event. There are knights with over 11k hp and above 2.5k AC complaining that they cannot tank these named with 2 clerics backing them up. When I hear that sort of thing I realise that I wasted my money buying the expansion because my fully buffed 8900 hp and 1750 AC aint gonna get the job done within the next 6 months, most likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The level of complaining about 1 mob in 1 instanced zone is a little more than overboard imo.<br />
<br />
If you wanna feel sorry for someone feel sorry for your clerics / chanters / shaman who are all gonna have to do these trials a billion times to get everyone through.<br />

<br />
If it isnt acceptable that only one tank class can tank these mobs why is it acceptable that only one priest class can heal them?  Maybe its simply the wrong board for it, and we let other people rant about this sorta stuff, but seems as wrong to need a warrior to tank it as it is wrong to need a cleric to heal it.<br />
<br />
Personally Im inclined to think its still to early to run around demanding a rebalance.  Like when LDoN first came out it was hard to get people to consider doing a hard adventure with a druid as only healer, its still harder, but it can be done.  When PoP first came out mobs hit so hard that for the first month warriors were in high demand for XP groups until everyone adjusted to the higher DPS and then knights would be tanking, and then 3 months later rangers were tanking.</div></div><hr />

Thats the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
One simple fix is changing the DB / DI of these mobs. A di of 200 on a 1600 - 2k mob is absurd.  That would lower the effect of warrior innate mitigation, as well as increase the rewards for those tanks with +shielding, which in GoD, is a very useless effect.</div></div><hr />

I find that perfectly acceptable. That its hard for knights in time gear but not for warriors.<br />
Thats why we have defensive. Thats why we are the best tanking class, We can absorb more punishment then knights and thats the way IT SHOULD BE.<br />
<br />
Thats the way IT WAS till Luclin and the warrior downfall in POP.<br />
Get over it. the designers did something RIGHT for a change in making defensive actully work and not be worth jack shit like it is on elemental gods etc.<br />

Unless the method of determining damage has been changed, it isn't possible for DI=200 on a mob who's hits range from 1600-2000HP.<br />
<br />
If a mob's maximum hit is 2000HP and DI=200, then the minimum hit would have to be in the negative numbers.<br />
<br />
Max Hit = DB + (20*DI)<br />
2000 = DB + 4000<br />
DB = 2000 - 4000<br />
DB = -2000<br />
<br />
Min Hit = DB + DI<br />
Min Hit = -1800<br />
<br />
Using made up numbers (forgive me Bruutal) which are more likely than your made up numbers eheh<br />
<br />
Min Hit = 600<br />
Max Hit = 2000<br />
<br />
2000 = DB + (20*DI)<br />
2000 = 600 - DI + (20*DI)<br />
1400 = -DI + (20*DI)<br />
1400 = 19*DI<br />
DI=73.7<br />
<br />
DB = 600 - 73.7<br />
DB = 526<br />
<br />
While the damage may be very spiky (600-2000), the max hit for a Paladin is 2000 and for a Warrior 1926 when applying the Warrior -1 DI mitigation adjustment.<br />
<br />
Your DI = 200 number is a lot more exciting since it suggests a Warriors max hit would only be 1800HP's but it's not supported by the math.<br />
<br />
On TSW we are encouraged to parse rather than cook up a batch of numbers that support our position.<br />

<br />
Adjust it so the max hit on warrior under defensive is about the same, however the max hit undisced is less, Overall this wont have too much effect on ability to heal disced war (beacuse the spike is the same, average DPS will be a little higher but not by too much) however the undisced spike wouldnt be abnormally high for a single group encounter<br />
<br />
Final Outcome: About Same (Slightly Harder) For disc to tank<br />
A little bit easier to tank w/o disc<br />
Shielding has more of an affect on tanking...<br />
<br />
It does sligthly make AC less valuable because you arnt quite as worried about making sure your AC mitigates a huge spike but it sitll would have a very large effect</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Once again, speaking from outside the GoD box ATM.<br />
<br />
  Historically in EQ, Warriors have been the first choice for tanking raid level content not specifically tailored for Knights. This has been because the content was tuned around Warrior tanking abilities (i.e. discs)<br />
<br />
 Historically in EQ, Knights have not been able to tank the toughest raid level content in a given expansion until said expansions have been progressed through. Examples include the aforementioned AoW and Quarm.<br />
<br />
 Here are some facts we know so far:<br />
<br />
 1) Warriors and Knights have both tanked this one encounter successfully.<br />
<br />
 2) Warriors and Knights have both failed this one encounter, especially if they are not fully geared for it.<br />
<br />
 3) It is currently easier for a Warrior to tank this one encounter.<br />
<br />
 4) This expansion is less than two weeks old.<br />
<br />
 5) No guild has progressed really significantly past this roadblock and are not at the 'gear farming' stage of the content that we know of whereby the top members of each class have mulitple loots of post-this encounter quality, and most members have loots of post-this encounter quality.<br />
<br />
 6) No one likes to feel inadequate at what is considered their primary role.<br />
<br />
  I sympathize with your frustration. It sucks to be of a level to consume the content and not be able, whether through gear, blind luck, or what have you, to tank this encounter. However, given that history shows Knights tank 'boss mobs' typically later in expansion life, the newness of the content, and especially considering that the first many times through content involve failure, I (and many other people, not just Warriors) don't see a compelling need to retune this single encounter yet. <br />
<br />
 From the outside looking in, this is clearly a new form of timesink being implemented by Sony to increase the 'shelf-life' of the content. At some point, it's a given that it will become the PoJ trials of GoD: Doable, but requiring either great skill/gear and/or changes to group formation to deal with the mob. (Whereas PoJ trials demand high DPS, this trial seems to demand high healing.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Knights that have single tanked Trial 1 are hiding the facts in some way.  Unless you have 2 clerics or at least cleric + druid, there's just no way you can come up with the healing necessary to outlast one of the Pixtts barring extreme cases of luck.  You either had 3 monks chain stunning it with Staff of Transcendence and WA5, or they aggro kited it since stuff used to not summon,  or they got Rallos Zek to come down to help under the disguise of a charmed hasted dual wielding pet.  Of course the latter two are no longer possible (though the first still is... WA5 + SoT is huge mitigation on the random named.  I have been saved by Time Rend on these encounters)<br />
<br />
I have 9500 HP unbuffed and Pixtts give me a hard time while disced.  There's simply no way I can see how a 7500 unbuffed HP Knight can pull this off without significantly more healing (My group was 1 cleric + 1 shaman).  <br />
<br />
Trial 2 seems a bit more forgiving on tanking than Trial 1, but you still need a Warrior to get through the Rav Interceptor at the door I'd think.  He hits a little bit less (450-1900?) than a Pixtt but still not easy to deal with.  Though I guess you can just swap a Warrior in to get rid of the Rav Interceptor, and a Knight can take over the rest of the way if necessary.  SK/Pal might even be preferable to Warrior on the boss... as an offtank.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, as for this expansion being new.  There is no upgrade on the way to Ikkinz that is better than Time.  These trials themselves only drop 165 HP items (which aren't anything to scoff at of course).  The few 15/20 AC or 25/35 HP augment you pick up off in Tipt/Ferubi/Kod'taz isn't going to turn your Knight into a tanking machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uthuk</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it curious that people whine that a knight might need 2 healers instead of 1 for a warrior to have about the same failure ratio.<br />
<br />
Especially sinse the expansion is all of 10 days old.<br />
<br />
A Knight is not insta failure and a warrior is not insta win. <br />
With unlucky /ran a warrior dies even with 2 healers against these named mobs. It's the same as boss mobs on raids, it's all about the dmg spikes and these things can easily dish out some serious spikes.<br />
<br />
Start whineing in a month or two if there is a serious imbalance but to whine within the first couple days of the expansion because you don't have read a spoiler or adapted to a new environment is just wrong. <br />
Godmode can be enabled in many other games, no need for it to exists in eq.<br />
<br />
Phantron: <br />
Hiding facts? Maybe he was adapting to the environment some? Even with summoning backing off at times saves some dps taken and can be enough to survive for the heals to land.<br />
Everyone does not have to have equal chance in straight up melee/healing. So what if a Knight might need a second healer to be able to straight up melee/tank a boss? It's in the description, a warrior absorbs dmg best of all classes so of course he is/should be best at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, Phantron, we have folks who say Paladins have tanked it. No one is arguing that. Whether or not it takes additional healing power above and beyond a Warrior isn't germane, given that virtually every boss level encounter prior to this one has taken initially more healing power for a Knight tank vs. a Warrior tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have 9500 HP unbuffed and Pixtts give me a hard time while disced. There's simply no way I can see how a 7500 unbuffed HP Knight can pull this off without significantly more healing (My group was 1 cleric + 1 shaman).  <br />
<br />
 And I agree. However, I simply can't fathom a Time Knight being an unbuffed 2k HP behind a Time Warrior. Now, if you're arguing an EP Knight versus a Time Warrior - well, I wouldn't expect a VT geared Knight to tank Quarm without a lot of extra healing compared to a EP Warrior.<br />
<br />
Oh, as for this expansion being new. There is no upgrade on the way to Ikkinz that is better than Time. These trials themselves only drop 165 HP items (which aren't anything to scoff at of course). The few 15/20 AC or 25/35 HP augment you pick up off in Tipt/Ferubi/Kod'taz isn't going to turn your Knight into a tanking machine. <br />
<br />
 Every bit helps. Especially if you're not fully Time geared to begin with, and I have a feeling that many of the failures of all three tank classes are those who aren't fully Time geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggro kiting is not the same as tanking.  Also with the way Ikkinz is structured I really doubt you can easily manuever around to avoid a melee round during a bad round unless you planned to do that from the start.  The space is pretty limited and the amount of space you need to run to avoid a melee round would probably put you out of CH range for sure, possibly Remedy/Light range as well.<br />
<br />
Having more healer is fine.  I never said if a Warrior can do it with this kind of healing you must only have that much too.  I don't have a problem with that, though it seems odd needing 2 clerics when you only get 6 people.  I have tanked the named enough times and their DPS is very consistent.  A Knight with the stats and healing described by some of the people would be consistently dead if the fight actually lasted any reasonable amount of time (say, more than 30 seconds), barring extreme cases of luck or some other form of damage prevention not mentioned (Rune, Time Rend, etc).  <br />
<br />
Right now the difference between top Warrior and top Knight  seems to be around 1K... that looks appropriate to me... especially if they stop making Aura of Crusader stack.  I think trial 1 can use some retuning.  Having to have extra healing or swap out a Warrior for the 3 Pixtts just seems to be unfair.  I don't know... making Trample a bit easier to resist for one would be a good start.  Having it land on you nonstop with 430 MR when it saves at MR-150 is pretty annoying, and also here it hurts the Knights even more because their MR is lower.</div></div><hr />

Same thing goes for that irritaitng Chaos Claws proc, christ, I realize its chromatic but the resist rates are just shit for their required save.<br />

edit - I would also like to add that is it just me? or has everyone else noticed the Kyv and Noc mobs have increadibly higher DPS rate than the rest of the mobs due to these procs?

You guys are standing here essentially feeding ammunition to the growing &quot;give knights defensive&quot; movement unknowingly.   The discipline of Defensive has historically *never* ever ever been needed in single group content, and becauseof that has been removed from balance considerations because it has been primarily a raid tool. <br />
<br />
Won't be too long now that you'll have to come up with valid reasons for exclusivity of burst defensive capabilities which will effect the ENTIRETY of gameplay and I'm gonna be really pissed cause you people are completely unwilling to look at an OBVIOUSLY out of kilter situation and give an INCH.<br />

<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
To be honest I rarely think about Paladins and just worry about myself.  It is very hard for myself to tank some regular GoD exp mobs...but I don't use defensive to do it most of the time (8800 HPS buffed 1550ish AC), it just doesnt make sense too.  If I can tank them..aka regular GoD exp mobs.. with a good group then a PoT Paladin certainly can.<br />
<br />
I haven't tanked the harder mobs mentioned here yet.  To be honest I think its highly doubtful I can even w/ 2 clerics even with defensive.  So again the &quot;non PoT warr w/def &gt; PoT Paladin&quot; dog just wont hunt.  I think with def I can somewhat be on par (in that both of us will need support + cleric support to tank).  /shrug I'll let you know when I try it.<br />
<br />
I see non-PoT warr  with def being somewhat at parity with a paladin POT...not being more powerful.  W/O def (which is the majority of the time) I'm not even in the same ball park.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really good at a number of things, topmost among those is trend identification and prediction of events based on the identification of trends.   <br />
<br />
I'm really crappy at a number of things, like grace and withholding attacks.<br />
<br />
I can see the connection here that there's a problem, PARTICULARLY now that Enchanters have been nerfed. <br />
<br />
Back when we were rightfully arguing for on-demand aggro, people opposed to seeing it happen suggested things such as mob rooting, aggro leapfrogging, and other crazy shit.   Our response was twofold.   First, was &quot;why should I require others to jump through hoops to let me do my job?  They're going to simply decide that it's too much hassle and take the knight&quot;   This was 100% true.  The second aspect was that using a warrior tanking in many groups was &quot;too risky&quot; for others.<br />
<br />
Well, let's say you're a DPS person who now that Enchanters can't carry the DPS for the entire group, and you're one of 2-3 DPS types in a group, perhpas a wizard or rogue.   Now, let me ask, why would a DPS type be inclined to take someone who's surviviability is so volatile and reliant upon the RNG (the one that was insufficient for aggro mind you) vs someone who is significantly safer?   The answer is they wouldn't.<br />
<br />
No one is saying that knights should tank these BETTER than warriors, or even EQUALLY.    Were my concept of an endurance/mana drain on the mobs, the warrior would still have BOTH a survivability AND an aggro advantage (due to gear setups that focus on aggro and significantly higher proc rates from WA), and this is FINE by me, warriors SHOULD be better, but warriors should NOT be an order of magnitude better, SO MUCH SO that the tanking requirements equate to 2 tiers of guild advancement.  That is way TOO much.   While this opens raid level content, it does not necessarily make it raid content.  It is still SINGLE GROUP content, and while I want it to remain challenging and having certain tiers of gear required, I don't want it to have ENTIRE TIERS of standard difference based on class, and the only realistic way of acheiving this is to simply disable disciplines when tanking the bosses.   The only VALID way to do this without giving knights an unreasonable advantage is to disable casting as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, mathematically it most certainly will.   Let's take you for instance.   You have 8800hp buffed, indicating that you're not in Time, and either just broke the Eplanes, or have had bad luck in drops of molds.<br />
<br />
You go against a mob that has a DB of 400 and a DI of 80.   It will hit you MAXIMUM for 1200 while under defensive.   That means that the MAX round of melee is 4800 assuming quads.   You can survive 7 simultaneous hits prior to dying.   This is *regardless* of AC.  Assuming you wore 0AC gear with lots of HP, or craptacular early PoP low AC/High HP gear.<br />
<br />
A Knight NO MATTER WHAT GEAR will get hit for a maximum of 2000 on the same mob.    This is a difference of 3 hits, regardless of AC.    You are ALWAYS a better tank than a knight while using /disc defensive, so long as you have a reasonable pool of hitpoints.   The difference is DRAMATIC.<br />
<br />
The difference happens to be completely justified when tanking raid level content, but NOT on single group content, because anyone reasonable non-tank will go &quot;Gee, do I go with the warrior who will survive or do I risk the hours + CR with the knight who has to get lucky to survive?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are quite correct I am a Luclin/pre RZTW warr.  I am humbly holding myself up as an example of a moderately equipped warr that you are claiming to be unbalnced in single group encounters of GoD.<br />
<br />
Your numbers while quite impressive bely a fact: against a mob boss such as Phant described (quad 1300-1400) there is no way a non PoT warr/non ellie equipped warr can hold up with a single cleric even with defensive.  It just isn't going to happen...I kinda equate this in my mind to AoW-lite like damage.   My hps...even with def don't mean much against that output...I'll need 2 clerics.<br />
<br />
So the non plane of time warr and the plane of time paladin are equal here: we both get owned without a support group of healers.<br />
<br />
In a regular GoD exp group I can hold up without def.  A plane of time paladin can also hold up.<br />
<br />
So I see the following scenarios:<br />
<br />
1. Regular GoD exp: same (we can do it with 1 group)<br />
2. GoD mini boss: same (we both get owned w/o multiple clerics)<br />
 <br />
Sorry to be so emphatic about this; defensive is not a panacea for lacking top of the line gear.  A moderately equipped warr still has very concrete limitations with def.  Those limitations are not far off a hyper equipped paladin.<br />
<br />
If you want to extend your argument to ellie equipped warrs to plane of time equipped paladins I bow out...I dont have the exp to comment on that.  You may have a point that ellie equipped warrs with def have an advantage over time paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's what I seriously think should be done:<br />
<br />
Premise:<br />
<br />
1. There are three tanking classes in EQ, each should be able to perform their primary function in a 6-person limited group setting.<br />
<br />
2. When one is perceived as unable to perform this task without special considerations and luck, then there's an issue which needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
This was my EXACT premise for why warriors needed help with aggro.   <br />
<br />
Currently, there's an issue where 6 person content, because of the nature of /disc defensive, causes the standards in gear/guild advancement to be of a vast difference between the tank classes, where one has a gulf of difference in survivability based not on skill level, gear, level or anything else, but solely based on class.   Where one tank has a reasonable survivability, and the other relies on luck and special efforts to survive.  This encourages others to go with the &quot;safe&quot; alternative, limiting the advancement opportunities for the other 2.<br />
<br />
At issue is the use of /disc defensive in a 6-person environment.   One cannot change the encounters so that it's difficult yet reasonably doable for a non-defensive tank and trivial for a defensive one, or it would in essence become trivial, i.e. too easy.<br />
<br />
The only way to balance the &quot;fairness&quot; aspect is to remove /disc defensive from this SPECIFIC set of encounters.   The best ways to acheive this are as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Have the mobs proc an endurance drain on their target.   This would disable all disciplines.<br />
<br />
1a. The issue with this is it would also remove incite.   This would give Knights a pretty major advantage in terms of aggro generation.  <br />
<br />
2. Have the mobs ALSO proc a manadrain to remove the advantage in aggro that Knights would have, leaving the three tank classes with their melee and whatever &quot;opening move&quot; they chose, be it a stun, a darkness, or an incite or whatnot.    <br />
<br />
The net result would be that the single group encounters can then be tuned to maintain a specific level of difficulty and gear requirements without giving an unfair advantage to one over another or different levels of gear requirements.   Challenge would be maintained as it doesn't reflect triviality in any way, since the mobs could be challenging to non disciplined tanks but the footing would be more equal, each class having a benefit over the other based on core skills:<br />
<br />
1. Warriors would enjoy a mitigation and DPS advantage as well as an aggro advantage, only it would be smaller.   If the proc landed on a successful hit, then /disc furious would still be quite beneficial.<br />
<br />
2. Shadowknights would cause a MAJOR amount of damage early on int he fight, thereby shortening the duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
3. Paladins could delay the onset of the manadrain for a few seconds by using /disc sanctification, allowing themselves to cast temporarily, as well as aiding in their own survival at a crucial time using Lay Hands.<br />
<br />
The thing is, it would be significantly more appropriately balanced between the three tanking classes.   I said many times during my pleas for warrior changes that I didn't want to see the dynamic changing to warrior domination because that's not fair, and I meant it.  This is an example of putting one's money where their mouth is.  The current incarnation of the bosses on these trials is not fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we're gonna be the same fucking tanks, then we might as well be the same class.  Removing the toys and leaving people with X hp and Y AC doesn't make balance.  It makes equality, and I'm not for equality when we should be superior to all other thanks.</div></div><hr />

The reason this is appropriate for these specific boss encounters in a 6-man exp group setting is precisely because they're relatively limited, and that way you don't have to do global class based changes, which would be considerably worse for the game.</div></div><hr />

I've seen the &quot;3 tanking classes&quot; argument used to imply that each tanking class should be able to tank 100% of group content.  However, there are &quot;3 healing classes&quot; that are not interchangable for group content.  For example, an EP geared shaman cannot heal an EP geared tank on a LDoN hard adventure.  Priest are not interchangeable for 100% of all content.  Here's another example: chanters, bards, and necro's can all mez MOBs, but they are not interchangeable. Balance does not mean classes are interchangeable at the group level.<br />
<br />
I can understand that knights are used to being the &quot;star&quot; tank in a group.  I was back in Kunark, but like warriors had to do, they need to find other roles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The purpose of a trial should be to separate those ready for the next stage from those that aren't. The next stage for many Warriors is being on the MT list and for Paladins being Add Tanks/off tanks. That's what is wrong with this trial. The mobs aren't adds, some of them are bosses. Frankly some Paladins aren't as well equipped to MT boss mobs as Warriors, yet they are fully prepared to tank adds.<br />
<br />
The fix isn't IMO for the trial to shut down capabilities and not measure readiness. The fix is to replace the boss mobs with mobs that are a lot more like mini-named.<br />
<br />
The real test is can your group move from place to place in this environment, pull, kill mobs, take care of adds, etc. without wiping.<br />
<br />
A Hard LDoN Slaughter 100 type mission is much more appropriate for not requiring disciplines or specific classes than a Hard LDoN Assassinate type mission.<br />
<br />
Testing real MT capability vs. a boss mob isn't needed in these trials.<br />

<br />
I still fail to see why our 2 hybrid classes have to be able to tank everything that we can, single group setting or not.  Clearly we differ in that opinion, and as such, trying to convince each other of our side is fruitless at best.  I don't feel that knights need to be able to tank everything in the game.  We have a purpose, and that is to tank things.  That's it, that's all we do.  Knights have a spellbook.  In return, they give up a minor amount of tanking ability, equal to a few mobs per expansion, and you're telling me that's unbalanced.<br />

Alright, if you really believe that, then I guess we're done talking about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BB,<br />
<br />
I realize we disagree on this but you know as well as I do that Knight a and warrior B can be wearing IDENTICAL GEAR, yet the warrior can survive and the Paladin cannot.<br />
<br />
However, there are &quot;3 healing classes&quot; that are not interchangable for group content. For example, an EP geared shaman cannot heal an EP geared tank on a LDoN hard adventure. Priest are not interchangeable for 100% of all content. <br />
<br />
Priests serve completely different roles than plate tanks though.   Shamans for instance while they &quot;heal&quot; it is not their primary function, they bring something else important and of significant value to the group.   Druids not as much so but they are not DPS slouches and in a healing/DPS role provide a significant amount more DPS/mana than clerics do.   <br />
<br />
Tanking isn't nearly the same.   There is no valuable secondary role for Paladins, and the SK DPS difference from warriors is *tiny* with the exception of their one burst DPS ability.   In other words, they UNLIKE priests don't being additional value to the group, JUST AS warriors didn't bring enough additional value to groups when their best method of generating aggro was to ask the pope to pray on their behalf.<br />
<br />
In other words, Knights are a LOT less multifaceted than priests.  <br />
<br />
Mezzing is a completely different beast altogether, since mezzing for the most part is for necros a TINY FRACTION of their role, and for bards, they bring enough additional to the table to justify their lack.  If necros and bards were primarily mezzers and it wasn't just an ability which added value to their portfolio then you'd have a valid point, but they're not, they're seriously multifaceted.  Knights aren't, they're primarily tanks.<br />
<br />
Can you name ANY single group content prior to this point where a discipline made such an impact in success or failure?</div></div><hr />

That idea actaully has alot of merit.<br />
<br />
I guess my concern is:<br />
<br />
Given all tank classes have strata from an equipment basis:<br />
<br />
strata 1: plane of time<br />
strata 2: ellie<br />
strata 3: non ellie<br />
<br />
You have stated that strata 1 paladins != strata 1-3 warriors because of defensive.  <br />
<br />
That indeed strata 2-3 warrs can do things that strata 1 paladins can not.   Sir I submit still that this still a falsehood for strata 3 warrs...we will die even with defensive.  When you are both dead there is great equality.<br />
<br />
I also submit that it is possible that strata 2 warrs, ellie equipped, *may* be able to what a strata 1 paladin can not; this may require a correction.  The question is whether or not if this is true if it is a large enough issue to tune that 1 particular encounter.  <br />
<br />
My concern is you will be artificially &quot;weeding&quot; out a small set of warrs to appease paladins for this 1 encounter (the &quot;hey if I cant do they shouldnt be able to as well&quot; mentaility).  So we will not only have class balance in the future but encounter balance based on class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frod, you are under the illusion that because these trials are 6 people max, every class should be entitled to do every encounter in these adventures using whichever role they choose.  You can bring an SK or Paladin on an mission AND a warrior!!!!!  SKs have DPS, are able to pull (well, somewhat), can tank trash mobs / offtank should something bad happen.  Can an SK tank the named mob, the apex of that zone?  You say yes, I say no.  Just like I can take a ranger to tank in Bastion of Thunder's DeepSouth group...and he can do fine...put him up against Kunabr or whatever the named is that spawns there, and he wont cut it.<br />
<br />
Same thing here.  You can take a knight to tank in these adventures.  You probably wont win.  You may not get any loot.  Suck it up.  I have had to play DPS in enough encounters to know that EVERYONE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME!  Sometimes, my paladin off tanks.  Sometimes he heals.  Sometimes my druid nukes.  Sometimes she heals.  Sometime's she kites.  Sometimes my bard pulls/hastes/increases spell damage.  Sometimes he slows/messes/sings mana song.<br />
<br />
SK's are not a tank class.  They are a hybrid.  That's what the Vision(tm) says.  They are part warrior, part necromancer.  Paladins are part warrior, part cleric.  The fact that there is a disparity NOW that is creating an uproar shows that sony had dropped the ball in the past.  An SK should not be equivalent to a warrior in tanking, be it raid encounters OR group encounters.  Period.</div></div><hr />

I actually agree with your premise almost completely, but I tend to draw the line at 6-man content, UNLESS what knights bring has sufficent value to justify their presence in the group.   I dont' believe that the contents of their spellbooks currently has that value.  Well, SK's would actually make great ancillary party members on these trials, but not Paladins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That should do it.<br />
<br />
Seriously, whats the big deal? I havent had a GoD group yet without a paladin or SK in it. Backup res is pretty damn important, not to mention waves, cures, roots, stuns...I can keep going you know. I have zero sympathy for paladins or sk's who complain they cant tank. I have news for you genius's - you aren't supposed to be *the* tank. Thats my job, thanks. You're supposed to be the red headed step-child that can take a few licks should I happen to go down.<br />
<br />
Now, I know what you're thinking - &quot;SO ONLY WARRIORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO TANK??!?!&quot;. No, junior. Warriors should be far and away the top of the VIP list. Whenever someone says 'we need a tank' it should be immediately followed by 'What warriors are lfg?'. If theres none available, then yeah get a knight. Since when is it such a travesty that groups have to pick and chose? Build to their strengths? Grow some balls, take your hits and figure out a way to keep your hybrid ass alive. It ain't my problem you decided to get a heal focus so you don't have shielding, bug someone else.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a small number of paladins who own. I mean truly, they wreck shop when they're in a group. They don't complain about not being able to tank, they do what a paladin is MEANT TO DO. They heal, buff, cure, stun...they play second fiddle to my defensive, but they do it so damn well that the entire group is better for it. You guys are great. When you've got a smart paladin and a smart warrior working together in a group, theres really not a whole lot that you can't do. I just wish you could show these other guys where the real power of a paladin is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladins can heal better than shamen.  Paladins can res if the cleric dies on a bad pull.  Paladins can offtank.  Have I mentioned paladins can heal, and do a damn good job of it?<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can pull (does the pet pull method work on these?  I haven't done research yet, but I'd imagine it could).  Shadowknights can contribute more dps than a warrior, a paladin, or a bard -- and a shadowknight can still off tank these mobs.  Shadowknights can HT the big named mob for burst damage at the end.  Shadowknights can give me voice to improve my ability to hold aggro (and thus let the wizard nuke more, the rogue not have to evade, the healers not have to worry about drawing aggro off me.  but mainly, can let the wizard nuke harder).<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights have a group role in these zones.  It may not be tanking the 2k hitting mob at the end of the adventure, but they still have a role in these missions, and will still get groups.  They're not in top demand any more, but tough; necros, wizards, mages, druids, warriors, we've all gone through it.  They're not #1 on the priority list, but they still have room in the group.  What exactly is the problem?</div></div><hr />

While it may seem that way, Paladins can't heal very well vs. the environment, and there's no way in hell a Pally can heal better than a shaman.  They can certainly heal better than we can, but their healing doesnt' cut it vs. the environment.<br />

Paladins' greatest strength is keeping really crappy players from killing themselves.   If you have a talented group, they really don't do a whole lot.   The rezzing is an important aspect, I agree, but it doesn't really make them have a viable secondary role.</div></div><hr />

Okay, let me rephrase: if we were looking for a backup healer, we would take a paladin over a shaman, hands down.  If we needed a slower AND a backup healer, okay, shaman it is...but for the role of secondary healer,  i'd take a paladin.  Lots would, I would venture to say...(at least, i'm speaking from pre-GoD experience.  I havent experimented with group makeups for GoD trials yet)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I will readily agree that the value of a 2nd resser has increased exponentially in GoD, I'm trying to figure out what skillset the Paladin brings that makes them a real viable choice in these trials as a member compared to say... ANY other class.   I mean... seriously.   Waves don't have that much real value in trials, their healing has become woefully inadequate in relation to the environment.   I'd bring 2 clerics and a rogue before bringing a cleric/druid/paladin unless the druid/paladin needed the flags, and I'm SURE that being offerred a mercy group isn't much fun.   I'd have my 2nd healer, my 2nd resser, much better group heals, a person to give me DI while the other is healing, etc.   There is REAL value to a 2nd cleric.   There is REAL value to adding a necro.  They can res as well but not only that, as a 2nd resser they're even more reliable because of FD.<br />
<br />
Offtanking isn't an issue when you're fighting one mob at a time for the most part.   I mean forgive me but I'm not seeing a whole lot of real value here for Paladins, and if the GREATEST sin in this whole thing is that you and I gotta give up a disc on a limited basis and make it fair for the other 2 tanks, then it's something that every one of us warriors can easily live with.   It's a HELL of a lot less sacrifice than being pretty much inadequate to do anything but being given a mercy group or a &quot;hold your breath and hope we keep him alive&quot; group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The content that was unlocked by PoJ trials is irrelevant to the fact that the preference for paladins in those trials was fucked up. I thought the complaints at the time were completely valid. I thought the balancing for the trials was completely bogus, giving DPS classes a big preference and the more rounded, utility classs the shaft. I thought warriors and shamans particularly got the shaft from the trials, especially after they made slow pointless.<br />
<br />
Paladins have a myriad of other abilitis to fall back on besides tanking. Warriors in groups bring nothing but tanking. Any warrior who's along just for dps is only there because they couldn't find anything better.<br />
<br />
Just as warriors don't get invited to groups as dps very often, paladins don't get invited to groups as secondary healer or root casting class. We get groups primarily as a tank. People do not make a group and say &quot;we need a warrior, and a cleric, and a slower, some dps...and OH, throw in some utility please&quot;. Groups look for specific roles that need to be filled. Offtank might be a very valid role, but most groups prefer not to have 2 tanks. <br />
<br />
Warriors can at least do respectable DPS with full AAs and good gear, relative to the other classes at that same level of gear and AAs. There is no amount of gear and AAs that makes a paladin respectable as a primary healer relative to other classes at the same level of gear and AAs. <br />
<br />
What role would a group bring along a paladin to fill other than tank?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even outside of GoD, if the paladin isn't the tank or there is little reason to believe he might be needed to offtank, then this is simply idiotic, to be blunt. Even if you already had a shaman, adding another shaman is going to give a group more than adding a non tanking paladin in terms of both healing (by orders of magnitude) and DPS. The exception is if you dont' have a rezzer in the group the paladin adds that ability, but that has nothing to do with healing.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, if there is no CC in the group or there is some percieved need for an offtank, the paladin is hands down the better choice than a second shaman...but if the paladin isn't going to tank, it's a no brainer.</div></div><hr />

I realize you and I are on diferent sides of this issue.<br />
<br />
When I one grouped named Sand Giant, Rumblecrush, V'Dynn, BoT named, PoV named, HoH named, etc. I often had to used Defensive. For several years Warriors have MT'd harder hitting mobs in groups and in raids precisely because of Defensive.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is theoretricly possible for a Paladin to MT one of several mini-named single-group mobs in PoEarth and PoFire and ya know what? Its' also possible for Paladins to get through this without Defensive too.<br />
<br />
So in your eagerness to get SoE to figure out how to drain endurance, a feature they would never use again once they made the effort to dig it out (wink) - you tell me:<br />
<br />
If a Knight can successfully group MT every mob in the game and heal, Res, Buf, Root, stun and cure are a better choice to MT in your goup if a Druid or Shaman are the main healer....<br />
<br />
why would you ever want to have a Warrior in your group? Couldn't find a Paladin?<br />
<br />
No, because Warriors are better able to MT hard-hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
And when hunting these one group hard hitting mobs what class was the main healer? Cleric. Yep the tank you want in a group vs a hard hitting mob is a Warrior and you want a Cleric healing him.<br />

Whoopty fuck, you were able to tank single group content that was designed to be raid level content because of defensive.

I've brought along paladins for utility tons of times. In fact, everytime I group with a knight is for utility. Thats the thing you don't get...Why do you need a specialized role in every group? Why if i say 'A paladin can heal' do you assume that means your job is to heal? A paladins job isn't to heal..but he can do it. It's not to res, but he can do it.

Here's the thing.   These encounters are for the most part, pretty limited in their extent.   I think we can all (except maybe BB) agree that Exp group tanking is better balanced than it's ever been, the only thing at real issue are the bosses of these trials.   I group with one specific paladin because he's a phenominal player, but they're rare, and I'd group with him regardless what class he played (except if he were a gnome).   The thing is I don't EVER seek out a generic &quot;a Paladin&quot; in an exp group unless there's a valid reason to, what Graal is arguing here, and me to some degree is that when there aren't enough valid reasons to seek them (there currently ARE valid reasons to seek a SK) then they have significantly less value than others, and no one likes to think of themselves as having lower value than others for reasons beyond their control.</div></div><hr />

He's arguing principles, taking cheap shots at his gear is a pretty low tactic.   He's right on the money on the principles for the most part.   I don't think I ever saw him go &quot;I have 6200hp unbuffed and I should be able to do this&quot;.  The totality of his posts have been &quot;An equally equipped knight and warrior should have similar levels of survivability in single group content&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you need a specialized role in every group<br />
<br />
A class doesn't need a specialized role, they need one that they can perform adequately enough to fill a percieved need. A beastlord slow is often good enough for a group to pick them specifically for that role. Bard mez is often good enough for them to be chosen specifically for that role. When those choices are made, they are usually asked to join the group because of that 1 role that needs to be filled while taking into account their other abilities. <br />
<br />
Those other abilities ARE used to determine if the value that class adds to the group is enough. Those secondary abilities can be very compelling arguments for taking one class over another, with the assumption that both classes can fill the primary role adequately. Often those ancillary benefits ARE the deciding factor for which of those classes will get the nod, such as a group picking a BST for mana regen instead of taking a ranger. If a group needs a slower, the choice of slower to pick (assuming you had 1 from each class standing in front of you) is going to be determined largely by what secondary abilities the slower has, assuming their slow is good enough to fill the slowing role.  If bard slow is not enough, a bard won't be chosen as slower for the group because of his mana regen. The group will get a shaman.<br />
<br />
Paladins will not get a group as a healer. Paladins will not get a group as ghetto CC. Paladins WILL get groups as a TANK that can do those things. IF there is a perception that a paladin MIGHT be needed to offtank, then that percieved added safety factor ALONG WITH those secondary skills might be enough to get him a group. The secondary skills alone, will not.</div></div><hr />

Get a Paladin in your group if the main healer is a Druid or Shaman. Get a Paladin if you will blow the spawn if the Cleric dies and you can't get him ressed. Get him if you know there are going to be a lot of adds.<br />
<br />
Get a Warrior if the mob hits hard.<br />

It's pretty simple.<br />

Edit - Going to use Brianna as an example (she is the non time geared warrior i use in all my examples, because we have a near set group set up all the time)<br />

Barraind is a Time geared Paladin (the current #1 in hp, ac, umr, aa on tribunal).<br />

Brianna is a barely Elemental equipped warrior (like 37th overall hp/ac).<br />

Brianna tanks, Barraind's job is to root mobs, tank kyv's when brianna dies on the pull, and stun pooka/noc when they break charm.<br />

What in my spellbook makes me an adequate choice for a tank over a worse geared warrior in any of these trials?<br />
<br />
Warriors constantly complain that disc's arent a match to a paladins spellbook for tanking...<br />
<br />
What do I have in my spellbook that is anywhere near as effective total as furious+def/eva on the 2nameds? Lets not even consider the fact that you have def/eva able to use for more than just the bosses (furious / fort as well, though only a few uses total)<br />

edit - yes, I have tanked these to a win. I shouldnt need double the healing than a worse equipped (by a large degree) Warrior needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no valuable secondary role for Paladins, and the SK DPS difference from warriors is *tiny* with the exception of their one burst DPS ability. In other words, they UNLIKE priests don't being additional value to the group, JUST AS warriors didn't bring enough additional value to groups when their best method of generating aggro was to ask the pope to pray on their behalf. What game are you playing??? I think that you are vastly underestimating the power and utility of the many knight spells and skills that have already been mentioned here.<br />
<br />
You are ALWAYS a better tank than a knight while using /disc defensive, so long as you have a reasonable pool of hitpoints. No shit. That's the way it's SUPPOSED to be. Always has been, why should it be different now?<br />
<br />
I know what the problem is between this expansion and previous one. There really is not much difference really, early on, top end warriors are the ONLY tanks able to take the abuse of boss mobs. The big difference between this expansion and previous expansions is that there has been so little raid content introduced since PoP that many guilds have been decimating any content they come up against for so long, they have forgotten what it was like to come up against content that just lays over when you get to it.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but guilds that would have been considered tier 2 or 3 before PoP have now caught up to the top guilds. This creates 2 problems. First of all, their is a gear problem. Contrary to the generalizations being thrown around, all Time guilds are not equal. Beating Quarm does not elevate your guild to AL status. I guarantee that there is a VAST difference between the traditional top guilds and the Johnny-come-lately Time guilds. The very speed at which guilds progress through raid content once the trail has been blazed is indicative of the amount of gear they lack due to the amount of time they spend on content. Look at how long the first guilds in the EPs spend farming the EPs before entering Time. Not only is the time spent considerably longer, but often it is time spent without any competition for spawns, 100% of the loot goes to 1 guild as opposed to the loot being split by 2 or 3 or more guilds.<br />
<br />
While there are quite a lot of guilds bunched up at the top, their very inequality leaves &quot;top end&quot; guilds illequiped for the challenges that come with being the first to face new content. Like I have already mentioned repeatedly, just because your guild beat Quarm 2 weeks ago does not mean your guild is gear for the progression presented by GoD. Basically, the Afterlifes (Quarm dead 7/16/03), Township Rebellions (7/16/03) , and Dark Horizons (7/26/03) of EQ are progressing while the Shadows of Dooms (2/8/04), Silent Tempests (2/3/04), and Severeds (2/16/04) are having a hard time. 7 months of Time farming makes a HUGE difference. (This is not a knock to those guilds, but it is ridiculous to think that a guild that beat Quarm this month is anywhere near the same power as a guild that beat Quarm 7 months ago.)<br />
<br />
4-6 months from now when the newer Time guilds have had a chance to gear up, this discussion will be moot. I equate this with people complaining that their just got in to VT guild can't beat RZtWL 3 weeks in to PoP. Sounds pretty rediculous when you put it that way doesn't it?<br />
<br />
The second problem is one that is new to may people. While guilds that have recently come in to the top tier of raid level content are beating some pretty impressive mobs, they have never had to learn the encounters the hard way. Sure, everyone is going to say that THEIR guild doesn't use spoilers and ALWAYS learns encounters for themselves. I call bullshit. There is no way that your guild would have beat Xegony on the third try if the guilds before you hadn't spend weeks and dozens of attempt to figure out how the encounter worked. The fact is, that regardless of whether you actively seek out spoiler info, once content has been beaten the spoilers make their way in to the mainstream and you are bound to at least know what to expect when ou get there. It is the nature of the game and it is as it always has been. If you feel your guild has ascended to the elite ranks, welcome to the world of beating your head on content for weeks on end until you finally figure out how to beat the new challenges of a new expansion. A lot harder when you don't have a spoiler huh?</div></div><hr />

There always has been the basis of eq: Healing and Taking damage. Thats healers and tanks. If you pick a worse tank (paladin) you need more healers (2 clerics). Why is that wrong?

<br />
First things first: no, there is not a lot of reason to say &quot;we need a necro&quot; or &quot;we need a magician&quot;, there instead a good reason to say &quot;we need DPS&quot;. There is also not the same situation with DPS classes. You do not have choose between 2 DPS classes, you can choose them BOTH. You cannot have 2 tanks tank the same mob at the same time, barring rampage. You CAN have 2 seperate characters doing DPS to a mob at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;There always has been the basis of eq: Healing and Taking damage. Thats healers and tanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Close. Healing, tanking, DPS. Can we keep the tank alive for the length of time it takes us to kill the mob with our DPS. DPS stacks. Healing stacks. Tanking does not stack. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you pick a worse tank (paladin) you need more healers (2 clerics). Why is that wrong? Thinking of it this way, it makes sense. On the outside though when you see &quot;you need 2 clerics!&quot; it doesnt make sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, you may not gain by adding more healers. I don't know from first hand experience, but if the hp of these mobs is low enough, adding more healers (and reducing your DPS) might actually hurt more than it helps. There is a break even point in there, but I don't know what it is. Just something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />

 If the whole of the trial was that one fight with that mob, maybe (note the word maybe) nothing other than the fact that you ARE better geared.<br />

Let's be realistic, a life-threatening charmbreak to compensate for failed taunt + incite is very rarely going to happen more often than once every 15 mins.  You do know that charm has an 8 minute max with focus right? In GoD EVERY charm break is lifethreatening to the chanter. That pretty much invalidates your entire statement since charm break is guaranteed to happen at least twice per 16 minutes, many time more than that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that said, some things need to be understood here before we can continue.<br />
<br />
(1) The expansion has been out for less than one month.<br />
<br />
(2) Because of (1), mudflation has not even begun to seep into and through the classes. <br />
<br />
(3) Over time, as tactics are refined and these trials are better understood, more AA's are gained, and better loot is earned through the raids, the trials will become doable by non-prime groups.<br />
<br />
There is no other option. To make them easy at THIS point in time destroys the longevity of the expansion. It's simple game theory. It's been employed through every single expansion. It will never go away in Everquest.<br />
<br />
If you're having trouble tanking the trial as a Warrior and losing more often than winning - SHOULD a Paladin/Shadowknight be able to tank the same expedition with similar success? Assuming that the difficulty of the expeditions is intended (as I noted these are Time+ encounters that drop Tier 3-4 loot for 6 people) the answer is an obvious, 'of course not.' Not yet.<br />
<br />
The idea is to cycle people through these trials so that you can start some raiding. You only need 1 person fully flagged (although the flag system is totally bugged atm in Kod) to start raids. Once you have at least 1 person flagged, you start raiding and start taking in some of that Time+ loot that is currently dropping in raids. You beef up equipment-wise and in conjunction you are AAing up during non-raid/off times. Eventually you'll be beating down the Ikk trials and pushing more and more people through until you're done. Again, simple game theory.<br />
<br />
You can be angry all you want that you can no longer tank everything in the game without two healers but that won't change the facts I laid out in this post. You're a secondary tank to Warriors, not a primary tank. When you accumulate enough gear/AA and knowledge through failure, you will be able to tank the expeditions better than a warrior. Then we will start the whining. Just like every expansion. See you in 6 months.</div></div><hr />

&quot;So what you're actually doing here is arguing about something that you have no experience with? And the people you're arguing about it with do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Come off it. We already have Wandor in the thread, we don't need 2 of him. The reasons I don't have direct experience is partly because I have been unable to convice my guildmates (few of whom are doing these trials) to bring me along on the occassions I've had time for it. I'm willing to at least TRY to tank this stuff, but other people are less willing to give me that opportunity. I think my absense of direct experience with these trials may not make my opinion as irrelevant as you think. <br />
<br />
Direct experience has no bearing on the logic I put forward. Incorrect data WILL, but the data is being provided by multiple different sources, like anecdotal data in terms of survivability and hard data in terms of monster  damage models. I don't need direct experience to develop a syllogism, assuming the data isn't flawed. Do you dispute the data presented by Phantron and Brodda? The data that is in dispute is exactly what additional resource requirements are needed to keep a paladin/SK alive and what the survivability difference is between warriors and knights. There are subjective discussions about what level of gear is appropriate to have as a minimum boundary. There are subjective discussions about additional resources should be required to succeed with a paladin/SK as tank. There are subjective discussions about how large of difference there should be between chance of success using a warrior versus a knight. I would say those subjective subjects make up the majority of this discussion. I don't see where my input is not just as valid as anyone else's ESPECIALLY when talking about things do NOT require direct experience of the event in question.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it. Versus maybe a dozen mobs in 1 group trials (which are designed for a raiding guild), a warrior has a clear and distinct advantage over a paladin. Somebody sound the alarm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those trials may have been designed for a raiding guild, but that is not the same as saying they were designed for a guild at X level of progression if you are using a warrior as tank and X+2 level of progression if you are using a knight as tank, but only if you in addition to having a clear gear superiority ALSO require a more stringent healer contingent in the group.<br />
<br />
Somebody has already sounded the alarm. We are one step ahead of you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Three trials, which require PoTime gear, which requires a raiding guild. You can't get through in the EXACT PLACE of a warrior in 3 trials.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they required the same level of gear for a warrior as they do for a paladin it wouldn't be nearly the issue it is now. Even if with the same level of gear, knights could tank with the same chance of success with the concession of a stronger healing contigent, that would be closer to balanced. Requiring both greater gear by at least 1 tier and greater healing is NOT balanced. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they required the same level of gear for a warrior as they do for a paladin it wouldn't be nearly the issue it is now. Even if with the same level of gear, knights could tank with the same chance of success with the concession of a stronger healing contigent, that would be closer to balanced. Requiring both greater gear by at least 1 tier and greater healing is NOT balanced.It has always been like this when there is new content, why should this expansion be any different.<br />
<br />
Your arguement would hold a lot more relevance if you had the gear required and still couldn't do it. Top end knights are tanking trial named, there is no debating that. If you can't do it, then either your healers aren't doing their job, or you are undergeared.</div></div><hr />

I don't have any need to virutally compare my penis against anyone else's. So the answer is no. <br />

<br />
The point is that it appears so far that the chances for survival for a paladin tanking with better gear and with better healing support is too low relative to a warrior's chance of survival. If that chance of success is too low, the population at large will decide that warriors are effectively required.<br />
<br />
EDIT: change that - If that chance of success is percieved to be too low, the population at large will decide that warriors are effectively required.</div></div><hr />

However, warriors with an order of magnitude lower gear are NOT tanking the Kod'Taz trials. It takes full EP/early Time warriors or full Time geared knights. If warriors with 7khp unbuffed where tanking these mobs, your claim would be valid. Since they're not, it would stand to reason that a pally at that level won't be able to tank them either.</div></div><hr />

Theres also a not of reason to say 'we need a necro' or 'we need a magician' or even 'we need a monk' anymore, either. That goes with not being the best at something <br />
<br />
Yes but when you say we need a DPS class, you arnt horribly picky at what one, you might slant towards a necro if you want backup res, or monk if you want better pulling etc etc, but you arnt going to be like lets wait 30 minutes and hope for a wizard it will dramatically increase oru chances of sucess...</div></div><hr />

 Frodlin, I respect what you've brought to Warriors as much as anyone, but this is bullshit.<br />
<br />
 VT Tanks are NOT tanking this stuff. And as regards to the whole &quot;Levels of advancement lower&quot; argument, name me an expansion with progressive high end content where the roadblock mobs were as tankable by Knights within the first month as by Warriors  WITHOUT more healing power.<br />
<br />
 None.<br />
<br />
 Not one.<br />
<br />
 Zero.<br />

 No, but stating that Paladins cannot win the lottery when Paladins have clearly won the lottery prior is bullshit and distortion, Graal.</div></div><hr />

Should I get 5 of my friends and have us whip our VT gear out of the bank and do one?   I guarantee we could, fairly easily.<br />
<br />
The other issue is kind of a bad example for making your point, since the only other 6 person gateway content in the history of EQ was *better* tanked by knights than warriors on the FIRST DAY of release and remained like that until almost the end of the expansion, and required no special healing in group makeup to compensate.<br />
<br />
History isn't on your side.</div></div><hr />

Im in VT gear. it was skin of my teeth to do it, But I can and have. <br />
Im newly into elemental and so far have one elemental drop in my face item.<br />
<br />
I buff to about 9k hp so who knows. all I know defensive is the only reason I have survived tanking through the two I have done.<br />

<br />
I think you have tanked Tipt and Vxed then. Not the Ikkinz trials. These trials are not even remotly similar. The named in Ikkinz trials make the Tipt named look like a punk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VT warriors are NOT tanking Ikkinz. It takes a decked EP or Time warrior to tank Ikkinz, why shouldn't it take a decked Time knight to do the same??? We are barely 2 weeks in to the expansion, knights should NOT be taking the toughest mobs we have come across yet, but they are. It takes a top end knight, but they are doing it nonetheless. Does anyone REALLY believe that knights would have even been considered to tank AD, Bert, RD, or even MB 10 days in to PoP? I think not.</div></div><hr />
