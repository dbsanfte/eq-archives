<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think this idea has been tossed around before...<br />
<br />
Why not give warriors the ability to summon?  Refresh time of 1 minute, with boss-type mobs flagged immune.  Cleric getting the beat down?  &quot;You will not evade me, a_moss_snake!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well 'cause:<br />
<br />
A: The mob would run right back over ot that person that overaggroed<br />
<br />
B: It would be exploited to hell and back.<br />
<br />
C: It sounds to much like a mage power.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would think of it more of the way a mob summons PC's. It would be nice if a mob gated to be able to summons him back in the same way that he would summons u ....I like the idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've wished I could do that many times on raids when something is pushed up a wall and I can't get it down. <br />
<br />
If it was implemented it should have the &quot;C'mere!&quot; sound effect like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I see no problem with this other then that people would exploit it ... use wizzy eye to get target of a mob in aroom full of guards then tank aquires target and /summon :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With a properly small range for use in positioning mobs, it'd be fine. If there were some serious constraints, such as the mob had to have just cast a gate spell or something, it'd be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah as long as it has a range, would love to see this in game as a new toy for wars, but it's nice to dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It would have to have a small range.  Also, it would be harder to exploit if it still aggro'd all mobs around the one summoned (as if you had just pulled the mob regularly).  It'd be a great tool for positioning.  Especially when you have those morons who either are afk, or just not paying attention, and when you try to move it, it just switches to them.<br />
<br />
If they made the range very small (maybe a bit larger than aetaunt range), then added an aggro component to it, it would help greatly with the aggro issues at the beginning of a fight.  Make it like CoH where it can't be used if you are too close to them (too close being somewhere along the lines of /shield range), that way it won't over power during fights.  Just use it to pull the mob off of the puller, or to just pull the mob yourself, get the burst of aggro at the beginning.  Then since it would be right at you, you wouldn't be able to use it again for more aggro, so warriors still wouldn't have knight like aggro.<br />
<br />
There still are problems with it that would be exploitable, so I doubt this would go in, either with or without the aggro.  But it'd definately be nice if it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't think it would be difficult to iron out exploits:<br />
<br />
-  Make it so that the warrior must be on the target's hate list to successfully summon.  For example, a warrior could not summon an unengaged mob since he would not have agro.<br />
<br />
-  Flag any mob that can be knockbacked with a paladin / cleric stun spell as &quot;summonable&quot;.  If stunning classes can already position mobs, letting warriors do it to the same mobs would not be exploitable... if anything, it would merely be spreading the &quot;positioning&quot; ability to another class.  Stunners would have the ability to &quot;push&quot; mobs away, warriors would have the ability to &quot;pull&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
-  Make the effect radius larger than /shield, but less than a common healing spell.  IE --- something reasonable.<br />
<br />
That right there eliminates any exploits with regards to pulling &amp; positioning.  Any ability can be exploited if it isn't properly tuned... that's why we have these things called *patches*.  If you think the idea is silly, that is a valid stance... but whether or not it could be exploitable prior to tuning is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
In general, I think it would be a great skill to add to the game.  Warriors could use a unique ability.  Monks have feign death, mend, disciplines.  Rogues have evade, stealth, lockpicking, pickpocketing, and disciplines.  Warriors have /shield and disciplines.  Summoning is already coded to a degree in the game.  Tons of level 51+ NPC's can already do it, regardless of their class.  If you want a roleplaying reason for it, shouldn't warriors have the ability to prevent an opponent from disengaging before a conflict has been decided?  Warriors would simply be calling their opponent back into the fray, instead of letting them pick on more vulnerable targets.<br />
<br />
I don't really like the idea of a +agro effect added on to it.  Warriors have always been lacking in terms of generating snap agro, and changing that might not be a good idea.  Instead, maybe &quot;stun&quot; the summoned mob for a nominal period, say 3 seconds.  This would give the warrior time to get in at least a few swings, and perhaps a bash/kick and taunt.  Or maybe let a summon make an attempt at taunt.  So if the shaman draws agro on a slow resist, the warrior taunts unsuccessfully, when the warrior summons the mob another taunt attempt is immediately rolled, without having to wait for the button to refresh.<br />
<br />
I think it would be tons of fun to see warriors summoning mobs off clerics.  &quot;You will not evade me!&quot;  It wouldn't step on the toes of knights, and would help to make warriors more viable tanks in PoP experience groups.  It's raid impact would be nil as ubermobs are unstunnable, so they would also be unsummonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is a really smart, sensible idea, assuming there are practical limitations on lvl, range (distance), re-use time, frenzy-agro from the summoned mob, etc. Is there any kind of &quot;official&quot; EQ MB where gm's/dev's read? I doubt we'd ever see anything like this, but for the amount of time it would take to repost this thread there, it's worth trying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually an ability that let you move the mob just like the bard mez songs (negative Knockback) could be great :)<br />
<br />
Or something with a short reuse time (like taunt) that pull a little the target, and root it for 1 - 1,5 seconds. THAT would be a nice ability for positionning :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The only way something like this would be implemented is if a range restriction was put on it and it could only be used when a mob is in line of sight.<br />
<br />
I don't see this happening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Meface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just a thought isn't summoning a spell. Hence Warrior = No Magic.<br />
It simply would not fit into the story. Nice idea for a mage or another class maybe, <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gerili</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally I have never liked the summoning ability, seems more of a cheap way to try to prevent people from soloing, which didn't work either.  Prevented it somewhat, but certainly didn't stop it. From a role playing perspective I don't really see the justification of being able to summon mobs, and would create a chain effect of other classes whining to get this.<br />
<br />
Actually an ability that let you move the mob just like the bard mez songs (negative Knockback) could be great <br />
<br />
This however sounds like a reasonable suggestion.  Would help drastically for mob positioning, while not having a great balance issue.  There are already multiple things that create push on mobs, I don't see anything wrong with something to create a &quot;pull&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Maybe change the name from summons. I can see where summons might be thought of as magic but a warrior being able to grab a mob by the BP and spin his ass to fight like a real mob....that would be perfectly within the story line and not the same as taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the &quot;have to be on the mob's hate list&quot; restriction, combined with a reasonable range would prevent exploiting this.<br />
<br />
As for summoning not being in line with the warrior class... just call it something else then.  I can easily see a message along the lines of Tuscan drags a_moss_snake_01 across the ground being in line with warriors and their skill set.<br />
<br />
It could be along the lines of AE Taunt AA.... make it cost about the same as that, and have the same refresh times.  It would be useful, but not overpowered.</div></div><hr />
