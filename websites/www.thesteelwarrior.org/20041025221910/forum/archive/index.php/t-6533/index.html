what happend to plan old paladin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Imo, it's just semantics to justify their asking for defensive.  Of course, I could refer to myself as a godless knight all I want, but that doesn't mean I get a nice spell book.  Or maybe insane rogue to get dps?  Advanced manaless battle cleric?  /shrug, semantics means nothing.  They are paladins, we are warriors.  However, all other hybrids got a dodge disc, so I wouldn't mind them getting one of those (NOT a riposte disc though).  But meh, I'm not in the mood to debate it.</div></div><hr />

Or it could be that warriors have to argue and communicate with a bunch of pretentious jackasses such as yourself who actually believe they are more intelligent as they play a class that casts spells in a videogame.  And if some are stupid enough to believe that, I am sure they are stupid enough to believe they are holy warriors (hence the idiotic posts in the class balancing forum lately at PON).

Holy warriors? .. taunt (check), double attack (check) disarm (check) riposte (check) parry( check) able to pretty much all weapon types (check) bash (check) 252 defense (check) &quot;holy&quot; spells (check) <br />
so .. out of that whole list where do we fall warriors? we are more like warriors than nearly every other class save rangers who are a druid/warrior hybrid where as we are a cleric/warrior hybrid... <br />

<br />
Double Attack, like monks and rogues and berserkers. Disarm, like monks, and rogues. Riposte like monks, rogues and berserkers. Parry like rogues and berserkers. All weapon types, except that when the class was originally created they could not use piercing weapons like warriors and rogues could. It wasn't until 2hand piercers went live that paladins were actually included on piercing weapons. And 252 defense? Yup, monks have that too.<br />

<br />
That list is incomplete.  You fall under &quot;Hybrid&quot;.  The way many pallys seem to be phrasing this &quot;Holy Warrior&quot; bullshit is that they should be just as much warrior as warriors are, plus the Holy part.  Therein lies the pally greed, idiocy, selfishness.  What you are, is part warrior, part cleric, with a dash of knight, and a pinch of uniqueness.  You are not a 95% warrior and 75% cleric rolled into one.  Or at least you shouldn't be.  Do all pallys act so pathetic?  No, definately not.  However there are quite a few who do, and use the &quot;Holy Warrior&quot; idea as an excuse.</div></div><hr />

I've used the word &quot;holy warrior&quot; so many times, right?<br />

Hell, I even have issues with &quot;hybrid&quot; since the actual definition of hybrid and what most people call hybrids now is nothing near the same (and hasnt been since velious)</div></div><hr />

Warriors don't have greed/selfishness tattooed on their foreheads. They are just defending one of the very fewunique things that they have left, and not willing to give it up without compensation. Our defensive precludes the ability to have and use a spellbook, and knights are trying to have their cake and eat it too by having their spellbook, AND defensive.

<br />
Actually you're not looking for compensation. Short of wanting the combination of both knight spellbooks anyhow. <br />
<br />
We're not asking for YOUR defensive. We're asking for a mitigating ability that would allow us SOME kind of survival. 25% is NOT 45%. Never has been, and never will be. So stop saying YOUR abilities because it would only be PART of an ability. Hmmm like druid CH is PART of cleric CH. It's not THE ability, only a part of it.<br />

<br />
Wrong argument. If that were the case, warriors would have had defensive since day 1. This was not the case. <br />
<br />
Again, we're not talking about knights with a 45% defensive. We're talking about PART of the ability. Until you're willing to stop counting one as the other (which it isn't since half will never equal 1) you're foaming at the mouth for no valid reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights are trying to get a free upgrade, and are stopping at nothing to try and get it.<br />
<br />
Free upgrade? Oh you mean like incite? or the unlinking of your discs? If that's your definition of free upgrade then yes. That statement isn't even arguing the validity of the need for knight mitigation, It's just a tit for tat argument.<br />

You remind me of a communist.... railing against and screaming at the people that have what you want, saying that you have every right to have what they have, whether that's actually true or not. <br />

<br />
tara dont be a dumbass, 25% or 45%, if it allows you to live where it was warrior only, its bullshit, alive in eather case is just as effective imo, i dont care what the fuck you rename it, or what flowery crap you put around its name, but dont bullshit us, most of you will keep up to get what you want, like a bunch of kidnappers, and when we give you a bone you will want more, and you will keep crying untill it has the power you want, your taking away our last unique ability and its wrong, plz die  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Prove it. Oh wait, you can't, you're just spouting off bullshit. Again.<br />
<br />
We're not asking for YOUR defensive. We're asking for a mitigating ability that would allow us SOME kind of survival. 25% is NOT 45%. Never has been, and never will be.<br />
<br />
No shit, Sherlock. You're attempting to paint me into saying something that I'm not. Did I ever say &quot;hybrids want 45% defensive?&quot; No, that's right, I didn't. I said they wanted the defensive ability period. The degree of mitigation is irrelevant, I'm talking about getting the ability as a while as a free upgrade.<br />
<br />
 So stop saying YOUR abilities because it would only be PART of an ability. Hmmm like druid CH is PART of cleric CH.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not going to stop saying &quot;my abilities&quot;. Why? Because guess what, it's MY ABILITY. Not yours, not SK's, just warriors. If a cleric argued against HIS abilities being given to druids (IE CHeal) it's perfectly valid to say it. Why? because cheal at that point was ONLY A CLERIC ABILITY. IT WAS HIS ABILITY. NOONE ELSE'S.<br />
 <br />
It's not THE ability, only a part of it.<br />
<br />
Semantics. Druids asking for cheal were still asking for CHeal. They weren't &quot;not asking for cheal because it wasn't the same cheal as clerics&quot;. Please.<br />
<br />
Wrong argument. If that were the case, warriors would have had defensive since day 1. This was not the case.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm sorry. Not since the beginning of the game... Only since the VERY FIRST EXPANSION, several years ago. That's so long ago that it might as well been since day one. Are you seriously going to try to hold the way things were BEFORE even KUNARK was released? Ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Free upgrade? Oh you mean like incite? or the unlinking of your discs? If that's your definition of free upgrade then yes. That statement isn't even arguing the validity of the need for knight mitigation, It's just a tit for tat argument.<br />
<br />
Sorry, the incite addressed a significant aggro issue that the DEVS acknowledged, that existed in the game for SEVERAL YEARS, and which the addition of EB was put in the game in VELIOUS as a temporary fix. Try again, they just took way too long to actually get a permanent fix put in.<br />
<br />
In regards to our unlinking of discs being such a free upgrade... you're stretching the point and ignoring facts that detract from your point. PAr for the course for you. Fact is, the unlinking of discs not only benefitted YOU, to a lesser extent of course, which guess what is a FREE UPGRADE, but THAT was our only &quot;upgrade&quot; since Kunark, while let's see, HOW many spells did you get as FREE UPGRADES since Kunark? Gotta be at LEAST 30 by now. (BTW, I'm using &quot;free upgrades&quot; in the context that it was introduced in this thread by me: That being no loss of character power or giving of class abilities to other classes in exchange for an upgrade in another area).<br />
<br />
Yeah, nice way to ignore all that you've gotten with new spells while trying to say &quot;OMG LOOK AT WHAT YOU GOT~!!!!111one!!1one&quot; with unlinked discs and a fix to an imbalance that existed since almost the very beginning of the game.<br />
<br />
And you remind me of a dictatorship. The *I am the ruler bow to me cause you're slime and only deserve my table scraps after I shit on them*.<br />
<br />
Well of COURSE I do. I'm not supportive of what you want, so of course I'm the big bad guy and you're just the poor l'il paladin jsut trying to get along in this world. The more you demonize, the easier it is to convince yourself of the righteousness of your cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
This entire discussion is moot anyway. The &quot;greedy, idiotic, selfish&quot; devs have stated that defensive is a unique warrior ability that will not be shared with hybrids.<br />
<br />
You're not getting defensive. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

When your willing to talk trade for wanting defensive and are wlling to trade abilities you have to us for it, Then we will talk . Intill then we both want lots. But are unwilling to barter anything for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors don't have greed/selfishness tattooed on their foreheads. They are just defending one of the very fewunique things that they have left, and not willing to give it up without compensation. Our defensive precludes the ability to have and use a spellbook, and knights are trying to have their cake and eat it too by having their spellbook, AND defensive. And on the flimsiest of rationales, I might add. If that's not greed and selfishness, I don't know what is. <br />
<br />
Knights are trying to get a free upgrade, and are stopping at nothing to try and get it.<br />
<br />
You remind me of a communist.... railing against and screaming at  the people that have what you want, saying that you have every right to have what they have, whether that's actually true or not. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">You really need to stop putting stuff out like that.

<br />
You're really kinda slow aren't ya?  If you could read it properly, you would notice that I was refering to the ones that want to tank as well as a warrior and keep all their knight skills.  Also notice I said specifically that not all knights were like that.  Once again, reading comprehension.  The fact is that many pallys are using the &quot;holy warrior&quot; phrase as an excuse to get all of the warrior side, and all their bonus's too.<br />
<br />
Actually you're not looking for compensation. <br />
<br />
Check the war room.  There is a thread going on about a trade off between knights and warriors, for knights to get a 25% defensive.  Though in my post on that thread (which isn't against knights getting a discipline), I mention I don't want watered down knight stuff, I want something unique simply because you would be taking our last true class defining ability.<br />
<br />
Learn what the fuck you're talking about before spewing bullshit ok?  Of course, it's not like you ever have on these boards that I've seen.</div></div><hr />

Prove it. Oh wait, you can't, you're just spouting off bullshit. Again.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, tell me there's not 14million posts here from warriors going *oh YEAH, well if you get MY defensive then I should get ch/loh/ht/fd/da/rez/root/etc*. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No shit, Sherlock. You're attempting to paint me into saying something that I'm not. Did I ever say &quot;hybrids want 45% defensive?&quot; No, that's right, I didn't. I said they wanted the defensive ability period. The degree of mitigation is irrelevant, I'm talking about getting the ability as a while as a free upgrade.<br />
<br />
I'm not painting you in a corner. I'm stating a fact. EVERYTIME there's a reply in regards to the defensive ability, MANY a warrior always say *defensive* which leads to many a post from foaming at the mouth warriors screaming that knights want to be Gods. Doesn't cut it. We're not asking for your FULL ability, we're asking for a % of it. There's a big difference in the 2 and arguing to the contrary is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
No, I'm not going to stop saying &quot;my abilities&quot;. Why? Because guess what, it's MY ABILITY. Not yours, not SK's, just warriors. If a cleric argued against HIS abilities being given to druids (IE CHeal) it's perfectly valid to say it. Why? because cheal at that point was ONLY A CLERIC ABILITY. IT WAS HIS ABILITY. NOONE ELSE'S.<br />
<br />
I didn't mean as in *warrior* when I stated the *my* part. I meant, saying over and over that knights want *your* ability is WRONG because we're not asking for a copy of it. We're asking for a %. Again, there's a large difference.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Semantics. Druids asking for cheal were still asking for CHeal. They weren't &quot;not asking for cheal because it wasn't the same cheal as clerics&quot;. Please.<br />
<br />
Semantics? No. The issue is not WHAT the name of the ability was that they were asking for. It was the question of what sum of the equation they wanted. How would clerics have reacted had druids received the full CH ability? ALOT different. Why? Because then you literally would be taking the FULL ability and giving it to another class which would put them on par. If knights were requesting 45% defensive then you could see it as a complete threat of them wanting to replace you. BUT, that's not the case now is it. It's been stated time and again that we're looking for a % SPECIFICALLY to achieve some form of survivability. NOT to replace warriors in the MT role.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm sorry. Not since the beginning of the game... Only since the VERY FIRST EXPANSION, several years ago. That's so long ago that it might as well been since day one. Are you seriously going to try to hold the way things were BEFORE even KUNARK was released? Ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Funny you should say that. How many times do warriors bring up knights soloing kunark dragons as a reason for our uberness, a reason why we shouldn't get anything. Here it is you are stating that your ability dates back to YEARS and thus should be considered as well OLD, but a knight soloing that same content is deemed Godly. Double standard don't you think?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not asking how you FEEL your class deserved the change. My point was that class changes DO occur outside of a new expansion which leads to what you term *free upgrade*. The relevancy isn't if you needed it, but what did the other classes get in return for it. (This btw is YOU brining up this argument, since I didn't ASK for anything when you receive those abilities)<br />
<br />

<br />
No Daemon, fact is fact. Fact is you had your disciplines unlinked. Fact is that the combination of furious and defensive is a MAJOR advantage. Fact is that you CAN and DO use your discs now without the fear of being unable to pop defensive if the need arises. THOSE are facts. It's NOT a moot point, it's a MAJOR point. And YES, it WAS a free upgrade. Sure it affected melee classes as a whole but paladins do NOT have discs worth using and arguing that we GAINED from it the way warriors do is plain stupid. <br />
<br />
In regards to my free upgrades (spells), I beg to differ. They AREN'T free. Remember the cost I paid for having a spellbook. You know. NO offensive discs. NO defensive discs. NO inate dmg mitigation. CRAPPY DPS, lower HP, lower AC. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, nice way to ignore all that you've gotten with new spells while trying to say &quot;OMG LOOK AT WHAT YOU GOT~!!!!111one!!1one&quot; with unlinked discs and a fix to an imbalance that existed since almost the very beginning of the game.<br />
<br />
Again, we're discussing FREE upgrades. FREE upgrades come at NO cost. The COST for me to receive spells with each expansion means I do LESS dmg than you, I have LESS ac then you, I have LESS hp than you, I have LESS dmg mitigation than you, I have no discs compared to you. Need I go on?<br />
<br />
An imbalance that existed since the beginning of the game? WTF do you think the Kunark era was? THAT was an imbalance. How the hell can you sit there tooting your deficiencies to a class that had it bad from the start? That ONLY in recent history had VALUE within the game. Spare me your BS.<br />

My post wasn't implying you. Frodin knows who I'm talking about. As for you pointing to the knights that want to tank like warriors. Find me a thread/reply on this board that doesn't have the warrior community pointing at EVERY knight poster saying we want to be Gods and take over warrior roles and obsolete your class. There aren't any. Every single post accuses that of all knights. I've stipulate, explained it, compared it, debated it, proved it, that I don't want to take over the role of warriors as MT or be equal to them, yet still everytime a reply appears from a warrior it's the same thing. *blah blah blah, you wanna be god, FUCK YOU I'm not going to sit around and let you make me useless while you take my job......etc*. That's the reaction to every warrior upon the mention of finding class balance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Most warriors who are so happy to be gloating over knights now were those who made their toons during Kunark/Velious on the assumption that classes were not balanced (that warriors were the real deal with what mattered, and hybrids were joke classes).<br />
<br />
I'm paraphrasing, but I read something like this at the time:<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
newbie- I'm thinking of making a ranger... I like the idea of  using a bow and stuff.<br />
<br />
reply - Make a warrior. Get a bow and you can be just like a ranger only you wont suck.<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
When rogues and wizards are aruging over dps... do they go off on who has the most utility (like you can port so I should do more dps, so stfu... or you can sneak so stfu yourself). No, because it's irrelevant. They talk about stuff like who should be the best burst vs sustained dps, and so on. They stay on topic.<br />
<br />
Whereas warriors go on about utility as a way of obfuscating about any of the real issues.<br />
<br />
You can cast arch shielding from your ornate bp... you can invis other ppl (i can't as a sk). How do you decide what this is worth vs the spells in my spell book. <br />
<br />
We have a basic issue... how should classes tank vs do dps (for melee). That needs balancing.<br />
<br />
Then paladins have healing and sks have... guess what dps. Those CAN be factored in.<br />
<br />
But please leave out the other stuff... aggro was definitely something that needed a fix for ba very very long time for warrios and its ridiculous how long it took... but forget the I should tank so much better than you that we're several expansions apart because you can root or summon a corpse stuff, please.<br />
<br />
90% of knights, I hope, believe that warriors should be premier tanks with in an expansion or 2 of mudflation and have the unique role of tanking the really mean multi-group stuff.<br />
<br />
But we also believe that we should be in the same arena as warriors... you don't get to be in a league of your own for everything related to tanking.<br />
<br />
And we're all for you getting more cool unique stuff... for one reason because it would stop clouding the issue on the utility you feel robbed of.</div></div><hr />

No dipshit, the fact is mellee were given this new system because you were overpowered. And because of the screaming that went on to prevent a nerf to the hybrid classes, mellee got this instead.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">&quot;because you were overpowered. &quot; - how so?<br />
<br />
The thing I saw wrong was that Warriors had no kind of snap aggro which made them poor exp group tanks and basically useless as off tanks/trash tanks. Fix that and warriors innate advantages would come to the fore... the mitigation, dps, hp advantages you already had.<br />
<br />
But why did SOE need to give you a flat 500hp boost, even more innate mitigation, put in one group content that knights cannot tank, when all that was really broken was your aggro and time loot itemisation?<br />
<br />
Discs are a seperate issue, I think it's good they were unlinked and something that was due for a long time. On this issue, why do you think hybrids shouldn't get any new discs... since they are mainly melee classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Basically, if you believe that should just never be any comparison between a knight and a warrior in tanking... there's no point in even talking.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but that's not ME saying it. So quit accusing me personally of it. Replace the singular &quot;you&quot; with the group &quot;warriors&quot; and we have no problem, here. Well, except for your claim that warriors want EVERYTHING both hybrids get to give them defensive. That's just idiotic, and shows your lack of understanding.<br />

<br />
That doesn't friggin matter one bit. The fact that you think it does shows your lack of understanding. The FACT is you're asking for defensive... basically for free... because you feel you deserve to have it. JUST like druids asked for cheal... basically for free... because they felt they deserved to have it. Difference being, there was a clear and compelling reason for druids to get it... such is not the case with paladins. Druids had this issue gamewide. They had this issue in all groups. Not just some groups in some places, but ALL groups, hunting in ALL expansions. Paladins have this issue in a very few encounters, which are ALREADY BEING FIXED.<br />
<br />
 I didn't mean as in *warrior* when I stated the *my* part. I meant, saying over and over that knights want *your* ability is WRONG because we're not asking for a copy of it. We're asking for a %. Again, there's a large difference.<br />
<br />
Knights want a defensive ability.. Period. JUST like druids wanted a cheal spell. A lesser form of defensive, even called a &quot;50% defensive&quot; is STILL a defensive ability. JUST LIKE Druid 75% Cheal is still a CHeal... it's even referred to as such. IT'S THE SAME GODDAMNED THING. THE SAME KIND OF ABILITY, WITH A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF POWER/STRENGTH! In the entire time this debate has been raging, this concept has been bandied around with the label &quot;knight defensive&quot;!<br />
<br />
I can't believe you can even get this simple fact through your thick skull. Are you you always this dense, or do you have to work at it???<br />
 <br />
Funny you should say that. How many times do warriors bring up knights soloing kunark dragons as a reason for our uberness,<br />
<br />
A reason for your uberness. What a laugh. No, you've got it backward. It's that they can do that BECAUSE of their uberness. <br />
<br />
a reason why we shouldn't get anything. Here it is you are stating that your ability dates back to YEARS and thus should be considered as well OLD, but a knight soloing that same content is deemed Godly. Double standard don't you think?<br />
<br />
Here you show yet again how you just don't get it. When I referred to Kunark, I referred to it as how the gameplay was BACK THEN. Now you're talking about how several year old content can be soloed by a single class in the PRESENT when that content has been completely trivialized through mudflation? What an absolutely ridiculous comparison.<br />
<br />
[/B]<br />
<br />
No Daemon, fact is fact. Fact is you had your disciplines unlinked. Fact is that the combination of furious and defensive is a MAJOR advantage.

And YES, it WAS a free upgrade. Sure it affected melee classes as a whole but paladins do NOT have discs worth using and arguing that we GAINED from it the way warriors do is plain stupid. <br />
<br />
...as Taragor merrily continues on his way stating facts, and still trying to ignore all the other &quot;facts&quot; that don't support his poit of view. Like all those spells. And no, claiming that hybrids gained from it the same way warriors did is not stupid. It's fact. You know, those things you're so fond of? Let me see, were hybrids discs unlinked? Check. Can you use one without being in fear of not being able to use another? Check. Hmmm, sure sounds like you gained in the same way to me. Not nearly to the same DEGREE, of course, as I've already stated, but you have gotten a gain from it in the same way.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know, Taragor will be claiming that adding knight defensive doesn't mean hybrids gained from it the same way warriors did, showing his fundamental misunderstanding of the English language and the issues at hand. Here's a clue for you Taragor. Gaining &quot;in the same way&quot; and &quot;to the same degree&quot; do NOT mean the same thing. <br />
<br />
Typical.<br />
<br />
Here's another clue for you, Taragor. One you desperately need. The discs unlinking? That was part of of a specific process that they called melee rebalancing. In other words, there was an imbalance that existed that the dev's acknowledged, and THAT was one of the changes. The same bloody thing was with incite. It was an imbalance. It was a bug. It got fixed. THAT was why warriors got these changes, because there was a problem, and it was fixed. JUST like the encounters that were the source of this problem are getting. And guess what, Jack... it's not involving giving you defensive. Why? Because devs don't feel it needs to be done like they felt the rest of it needed to be done.<br />
<br />
In regards to my free upgrades (spells), I beg to differ. They AREN'T free. Remember the cost I paid for having a spellbook. You know. NO offensive discs. NO defensive discs. NO inate dmg mitigation. CRAPPY DPS, lower HP, lower AC<br />
<br />
Again, we're discussing FREE upgrades. FREE upgrades come at NO cost. The COST for me to receive spells with each expansion means I do LESS dmg than you, I have LESS ac then you, I have LESS hp than you, I have LESS dmg mitigation than you, I have no discs compared to you. Need I go on?<br />
<br />
Heh. Wrong. You paid NO price in lowering of capabilities to get these new and more powerful spells. Instead, it was the CHOICE YOU MADE when you created your character, that you would be able to cost this spell, and that spell. AFTER you made that decision, you got more powerful spells at no cost. That &quot;cost I paid&quot; doesn't match the definition used in this thread. Nice try.<br />
<br />
By your logic, if warriors get an upgraded defensive like paladins have gotten upgraded spells, they've already paid the price for a better defensive because that was the cost we paid for not having a spellbook, so that's all fine, right? Haha, yeah, right. You've be all over that screaming &quot;overpowered&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; in a heartbeat. Funny how your arguments are only valid if they benefit you, isn't it?<br />
<br />
An imbalance that existed since the beginning of the game? WTF do you think the Kunark era was? THAT was an imbalance. How the hell can you sit there tooting your deficiencies to a class that had it bad from the start? That ONLY in recent history had VALUE within the game. Spare me your BS.<br />
<br />
Oh, here we go. &quot;OMG Kunark!!!!&quot; from the Paladin.<br />
<br />
Quit yer whining about ancient history. You like facts? How about this one... The FACT is, warriors had the aggro issue since the beginning of the game. The FACT is, hybrids were fixed and rose to dominance while warriors STILL had the same issue. The FACT is, YOUR problem was fixed FAR before ours was. Quit your whining about who had what problem for how long, it's retarted and utterly pointless.<br />
<br />
And you're not going to keep your supremecy. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Our supremecy in GoD Trials? Good. That's the only thing I think you could be referring to.<br />
<br />
Jesus, arguing with you is like arguing with a retarded chimpanzee. IN case you just haven't &quot;gotten it&quot; yet, which is certainly not surprising, when I talk about hybrids getting defensive, I'm NOT TALKING ABOUT hybrids getting a defensive that's just as powerful as what warriors have, and the even if I did, it doesn't affect the point I was trying to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">&quot;But why did SOE need to give you a flat 500hp boost,&quot;<br />
<br />
Because warriors are supposed to have more hit points than any other class. And because itemization was so screwed up that knights were infringing far too much, making that advantage a mere 5 percent or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Giving a flat 500hp increase irrespective of gear is about as smart as the flat negative ac that was given to monks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks weren't given flat negative AC. No, really, they weren't. If you'd like to know what DID happen to monks, I'd be glad to discuss it another thread. But I can gurantee you that monk AC was not dealt with in any flat way shape or form. Monks still get an INNATE AC bonus. They STILL get a high ratio or actual AC per RAW AC on their items. And they still get high levels of Armor Class. It's what they did to the monk DI as well as the monk's ratio of taking maximum damage per hit ... that's where you'll find the nifty little thing commonly referred to the monk mitigation nerf. It wasn't flat and it wasn't anywhere near as simplistic as giving warriors a straight across the board HP advantage to everyone else.</div></div><hr />

This is our board you piece of shit, fuck off back to your own MB if you don't like the gripes here. We have argued these points a million times over, just because you were not around to understand that us getting shit all for aggro or anything else because people said we had defensive was a tired old hat and needed a change. Of course it had to do with our discs you fucking mongaloid backwards monkey. So take your bullshit opinions and  shove them sideways up your gangly ass you butfuck regurgatated piece of man love.<br />
<br />
I barely ever play FPS, I hate the genre. It has nothing to do with knights who are now angry that they are not the Gods they were in Pop. Cannot understand why they cannot tank as well as they used to nor understand why they are not entitled to tank every single piece of one groupable content in the game.  You have no idea what balance is, so sftu.<br />
<br />
Ps:- I have been playing this game since 99, Knights have always had warriors beat in whining, hands down espeically in retarded requests.

Yes, but that's not ME saying it. So quit accusing me personally of it. Replace the singular &quot;you&quot; with the group &quot;warriors&quot; and we have no problem, here. Well, except for your claim that warriors want EVERYTHING both hybrids get to give them defensive. That's just idiotic, and shows your lack of understanding.<br />
<br />
For starters, if you don't want me to put you in the group with your brethren about the mentaility being used, I'd ask that you don't put me in the group of my brethren either. IE: I never asked to be a God class, I never asked to take over your class role etc....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That doesn't friggin matter one bit. The fact that you think it does shows your lack of understanding. The FACT is you're asking for defensive... basically for free... because you feel you deserve to have it. JUST like druids asked for cheal... basically for free... because they felt they deserved to have it. Difference being, there was a clear and compelling reason for druids to get it... such is not the case with paladins. Druids had this issue gamewide. They had this issue in all groups. Not just some groups in some places, but ALL groups, hunting in ALL expansions. Paladins have this issue in a very few encounters, which are ALREADY BEING FIXED.<br />
<br />
Wrong answer. WHY did they deserve heal increases? I mean, SOE could have just as easily given them better nukes, different utility spells, etc. NOTHING forced them to put the major increase in their healing capacity.<br />
<br />
Except that maybe, just MAYBE, SOE realized that having only 1 class capable of being a main healer in BOTH raid/group environments was detrimental to the game and thus increased the power of the other 2 healing classes substantially.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Knights want a defensive ability.. Period. JUST like druids wanted a cheal spell. A lesser form of defensive, even called a &quot;50% defensive&quot; is STILL a defensive ability. JUST LIKE Druid 75% Cheal is still a CHeal... it's even referred to as such. IT'S THE SAME GODDAMNED THING. THE SAME KIND OF ABILITY, WITH A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF POWER/STRENGTH! In the entire time this debate has been raging, this concept has been bandied around with the label &quot;knight defensive&quot;!<br />
<br />
Yes the type of ability is the same. But minor healing is the same as CH isn't it now? They're identical in purpose which is 1 dimensional. *To heal*. The difference is in the effect and level of the ability. Saying that a 25% defensive is the same thing as warrior defensive is misguiding. Yes the ability serves the same purpose. but the impact of the ability within the game is vastly different.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here you show yet again how you just don't get it. When I referred to Kunark, I referred to it as how the gameplay was BACK THEN. Now you're talking about how several year old content can be soloed by a single class in the PRESENT when that content has been completely trivialized through mudflation? What an absolutely ridiculous comparison.<br />
<br />
My point was that the ability you received in Kunark was NOT part of the original game. So upon creation, SOE OBVIOUSLY considered warriors balanced to the rest of the classes without it.  It doesn't matter that you received the ability in the 1st expansion, you received something that was NOT allotted to your class originally and it had a MAJOR impact. Look at defensive as it is today within the game. Show me 1 other ability that has had such an impact. There is none. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...as Taragor merrily continues on his way stating facts, and still trying to ignore all the other &quot;facts&quot; that don't support his poit of view. Like all those spells. And no, claiming that hybrids gained from it the same way warriors did is not stupid. It's fact. You know, those things you're so fond of? Let me see, were hybrids discs unlinked? Check. Can you use one without being in fear of not being able to use another? Check. Hmmm, sure sounds like you gained in the same way to me. Not nearly to the same DEGREE, of course, as I've already stated, but you have gotten a gain from it in the same way.<br />
<br />
Nearly to the same degree? This doesn't even deserve commenting on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next thing you know, Taragor will be claiming that adding knight defensive doesn't mean hybrids gained from it the same way warriors did, showing his fundamental misunderstanding of the English language and the issues at hand.  <br />
<br />
Putting words in my mouth? I recall you at the beginning of your post saying I shouldn't do that. Guess typical warrior mentality is I can do what the fuck I want, but nobody else can.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a clue for you Taragor. Gaining &quot;in the same way&quot; and &quot;to the same degree&quot; do NOT mean the same thing.<br />
<br />
No fucking shit sherlock. But having to specifically state in every single sentence the meaning of a sentence means you're too fucking stuck up to actually READ the meaning of the statement.<br />
<br />
Within the realm of the game GAINING needs to serve purpose. If it serves NO purpose then there's no real GAIN is there. That better?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's another clue for you, Taragor. One you desperately need. The discs unlinking? That was part of of a specific process that they called melee rebalancing. In other words, there was an imbalance that existed that the dev's acknowledged, and THAT was one of the changes. The same bloody thing was with incite. It was an imbalance. It was a bug. It got fixed. THAT was why warriors got these changes, because there was a problem, and it was fixed. JUST like the encounters that were the source of this problem are getting. And guess what, Jack... it's not involving giving you defensive. Why? Because devs don't feel it needs to be done like they felt the rest of it needed to be done.<br />
<br />
Typical Daemonwynd lack of knowledge drivel.<br />
<br />
HOW exactly was UNLINKING your discs BALANCING. Let's see. ALL pure melee got the effect. So OBVIOUSLY warriors didn't NEED something the other pure melee classes had. So NO balancing issue THERE since they got the change also.<br />
<br />
Second. I have NO discs that are of use in a combination the way melees do. NONE. Wait. I have discs that run on 72min timers that serve only 1 purpose against only 1 type of mob. Are you so fucking dense you're trying to say that warriors needed their discs unlinked to balance them out vs knight ones? Hey dork, as you mentionned ABOVE this part of your post, they unlinked the knight ones ALSO. So WHAT were they balancing? NOTHING. What they DID though is give warriors the ability to USE their discs more often.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh. Wrong. You paid NO price in lowering of capabilities to get these new and more powerful spells. Instead, it was the CHOICE YOU MADE when you created your character, that you would be able to cost this spell, and that spell. AFTER you made that decision, you got more powerful spells at no cost. That &quot;cost I paid&quot; doesn't match the definition used in this thread. Nice try.<br />
<br />
God you're slow when you wanna be. The term PAID means the class PAYS from level 1 in a loss of pure ability because we're a hybrid. That cost yields us spells. So yes, I DO pay for them. And if I don't. Then I'd direct everywarrior to go fuck themselves the next time they say I shouldn't tank anything above a moss snake because I'm not a pure melee. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By your logic, if warriors get an upgraded defensive like paladins have gotten upgraded spells, they've already paid the price for a better defensive because that was the cost we paid for not having a spellbook, so that's all fine, right? Haha, yeah, right. You've be all over that screaming &quot;overpowered&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; in a heartbeat. Funny how your arguments are only valid if they benefit you, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Your discs SCALE. Do you know what the word means? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quit yer whining about ancient history. You like facts? How about this one... The FACT is, warriors had the aggro issue since the beginning of the game. The FACT is, hybrids were fixed and rose to dominance while warriors STILL had the same issue. The FACT is, YOUR problem was fixed FAR before ours was. Quit your whining about who had what problem for how long, it's retarted and utterly pointless.<br />
<br />
Huh hmmmm wanna try that again. If not, want to ATLEAST get your facts straight.<br />
<br />
-Were you or were you not the only tank in Kunark? Yes<br />
-Are you or are you not the only MT on raids till content is trivial? Yes<br />
-Were you or were you not always superior to all other classes in tanking? Yes<br />
<br />
If your aggro issue was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad until 4 month ago. And that problem caused your class to never get groups, how exactly did any guild get anywhere? How exactly did warriors have maxed out AA's? <br />
<br />
See what warriors refuse to accept is this. You had issues since day 1 of the game with aggro. Knights had issues since day 1 with survivability.<br />
<br />
YOUR deficiency in aggro became GLARINGLY apparent in PoP. Why? Because mobs all of a sudden started hitting *VERY HARD*. This meant that the TANK needed to have the attention of the mob FAST or healers/slowers would start dying. Knights had an ability which allowed them to gain and maintain aggro alot sooner than warriors and the side effect of this made them the *preferred* tank for *groups*. We weren't *superior* in survivability, we were *safer* to our groupmates. <br />
<br />
Did warriors have aggro issues since day 1? Yes. Was it a life or death situation until PoP? No.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights deficiency becomes GLARINGLY apparent in GoD where mobs are hitting *INSANELY HARD*. Once again now groups have an issue. The difference being that in PoP, healers/slowers died BEFORE the warrior which generally lead to everyone else dying after from lack of healing. In GoD. The knights are dying before everyone else which leads to everyone dying because nobody can tank the mobs. The MAIN difference between the two is that, unlike PoP where knights were *preferred* over warriors, in GoD there's no *preference*. There's only 1 choice. Warrior.<br />
<br />
Did knights have survivability issues since day 1? Yes. Was it a life or death situation until GoD? No.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jesus, arguing with you is like arguing with a retarded chimpanzee. IN case you just haven't &quot;gotten it&quot; yet, which is certainly not surprising, when I talk about hybrids getting defensive, I'm NOT TALKING ABOUT hybrids getting a defensive that's just as powerful as what warriors have, and the even if I did, it doesn't affect the point I was trying to make.<br />
<br />
Poor misguided Daemonwynd. I feel for you and hope when you grow up you learn the ways of the world. BALANCE means equal amounts on BOTH sides. It DOESN'T mean that the items on each side of the scale have to be *identical*. If I put a pound of rocks on 1 side and a pound of feathers on the other, they are *balanced* though they are nowhere near the same.<br />
<br />
The issue at hand for game balance is quite simple. All classes within their *class domain* should be balanced in their desireability to the *whole* Knights ARE tanks, just like warriors. We're not *identical* tanks, but we *are* tanks. In the scheme of gameplay knights *tank*. REMOVE the ability for knights to *tank* and you remove the fundamental reason for the class to *exist*. If SOE is hell bent on continuing to make their content based on *hitting harder/faster*, then they just plainly have no other *option* but to give knights a defensive type ability to allow them to continue in their *class specific* role as *tanks*.<br />

Did I say anything about gripes? I just responded to your misguided drivel.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We have argued these points a million times over, just because you were not around to understand that us getting shit all for aggro or anything else because people said we had defensive was a tired old hat and needed a change. Of course it had to do with our discs you fucking mongaloid backwards monkey. So take your bullshit opinions and  shove them sideways up your gangly ass you butfuck regurgatated piece of man love.p<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I don't recall saying I had an issue with warriors getting the provoke line. If YOU'D been around long enough, maybe YOU'D see that I was *pro* warriors receiving an aggro ability worth more than a copper.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I barely ever play FPS, I hate the genre. It has nothing to do with knights who are now angry that they are not the Gods they were in Pop. Cannot understand why they cannot tank as well as they used to nor understand why they are not entitled to tank every single piece of one groupable content in the game.  You have no idea what balance is, so sftu.<br />
<br />
Here's a hanky, you're foaming again.<br />
<br />
How pray tell were we Gods in PoP? I'm assuming you mean in xp groups right? I mean you wouldn't be so ignorant to say we were the Gods of raid tanking right?<br />
<br />
As for us being Gods, well let's see. We had aggro and you didn't. You survived hits better than I did. If I was omnipotent at the time, wouldn't I have been surperior to you in every way?<br />
<br />
We weren't Gods. Gods would have meant that warriors COULD not tank. NOT that you weren't selected because of a *deficiency* in your class. Now warriors in GoD are Gods. Why? because unlike PoP with the aggro issue, knights don't have a *deficiency* in the content they're just incapable of doing it. See the difference?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps:- I have been playing this game since 99, Knights have always had warriors beat in whining, hands down espeically in retarded requests. Ever since the days of Paladins whining on the Verant boards the day that Their Firey Avenger (33/44 basically the best ratio in the game at the time) was found that it should be a 1handed weapon, it has never stopped. At least  for the most part warriors complain about legitimate concerns, and don't post serious threads wanting things like Lay on Hands.<br />
<br />
All I can answer to this is ROFLMAO. I think you've pointed out why warriors are such  turds. Especially those that have played since day 1. WHY? Because since the creation of EQ warriors have surpassed knights in EVERY single FORM of tanking. I think what really irks warriors is that for a brief history of the game, they SAW what it meant to have a class that was unwanted. They SAW what it was like to be unable to do what they chose their class for. They SAW what it was like to be a knight, and for that brief time that they were in our shoes they sure as fuck didn't enjoy it. Grow up. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">God you're a fucking retard Taragor.  Allow me to shed some light on your dismal brain.<br />
<br />
Your discs SCALE. Do you know what the word means?  <br />
<br />
My discs scale?  You mean that Defensive is 45% at level 55, and 55% at level 65?  You mean that Fellstrike lets me hit 4 times harder at 58 and 5 times harder at 65?  You're a fucking idiot, and you don't know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
WHY did they deserve heal increases? I mean, SOE could have just as easily given them better nukes, different utility spells, etc. NOTHING forced them to put the major increase in their healing capacity. <br />
<br />
The reasons for the druid heal were not apparant when they came in, but a month into PoP they were glaringly obvious.  A druid wouldn't last 10 minutes in a PoV group with fucking Nature's Touch as a heal, now would they?  Oh, and don't try to turn that around and say &quot;Yeah, just like Paladins want to be able to tank in a XXXX Trial&quot; because you're a fucking idiot.  Druids should not be able to heal as well as clerics, which they don't, but they SHOULD be able to get the job done, which they can do.  Knights should not be able to tank as well as warriors, which is where we're at right now, but THEY CAN get the job done with a little luck/the right group makeup.  The situation is identical, you don't need a fucking upgrade you pussy whiners.<br />
<br />
My point was that the ability you received in Kunark was NOT part of the original game. So upon creation, SOE OBVIOUSLY considered warriors balanced to the rest of the classes without it. It doesn't matter that you received the ability in the 1st expansion, you received something that was NOT allotted to your class originally and it had a MAJOR impact. Look at defensive as it is today within the game. Show me 1 other ability that has had such an impact. There is none.  <br />
<br />
So then by your logic, any spell that paladins have that is not a cleric spell, which was not given to your class at release, overpowers your class.  God you're dense.  The game changes, encounters change, mobs change, tactics change.  Therefore abilities change as well.  I could also say that anything we got in Kunark must have been OBVIOUSLY considered balanced next to what the rest of the classes got in that expansion.  Are you trying to compare Knights at release to warriors now or what?<br />
<br />
I could go on and on and pick apart your display of retardation you've exhibited here, but what would be the point?  You're still not going to understand that you don't have a clue about anything.</div></div><hr />

Just shut the hell up and quit whineing to us You want defenive we will never Agree to it just like you would never agree to give warriors eitehr Harm touch or Lay on Hands.<br />
<br />
There is no ifs no ands no buts Every Class Pays for what they choose in teh case of hybreds and melee it is from level 9 on, that IS when you recived your spell book is it not?   Just recently Warriors where grained greater midagation Across the boards Untill that time here is A clue, Your LoH or HT was the diffeance only Diffrance between Yours and a warriors Hit Points.<br />
<br />
If you want to run a game as you think it should be run Make one, SoE might have lots of un happy People But they Have to balance the classes and Keep everyone happy from a buisness standpoint this is nearly an impossable concept to complete without pissig off some of the players.  Here is one last clue its a frickin game Play it to have fun not whine complain or anything like that hell you want someone that can do it all find someone to be a dungeon Master and go play Dungeons and dragons On pencil and paper.<br />

Here is the bottom line for SoE<br />

What can we do to Keep People playing the game and paying us money<br />
<br />
Money Rules all it is god Didn't you know that?<br />

Now can we stop all this arugeing its quite annoying and serves no purpose, hell even if the warrior commuity was willing to let you have a scaled down version of defensive (wich we are NOT)<br />

I'm going to tell you the reason Knights shouldn't get Defensive.<br />
<br />
Druids got a lesser CH. It expands the number of people who can MH in normal experiance groups. In raids the can not be the Main Healers, yet they still have a role as RT healers, spam healer, group healer, and even nukers. In the trials they can not be the MH, yet they STILL have a role.<br />
<br />
Ditto Shamans.<br />
<br />
Paladins have 1 role. Warrior. Name your other role. Melee? nuh uh. Healer? Noper.<br />
<br />
In 4 trials many Paladins can not be the MT, and they DON'T have another role.<br />
<br />
Fix the spellbook and all of a sudden they might be included in those 4 trials because they can be a back-up tanks, Resser, help keep themselves alive and others. They have a second role - just like Druids, and just like Shaman. Why they can even perform that second role in raids.<br />
<br />
Give them Defensive only and with their ineffective spellbook and no secondary role their is 1 way to make themselves more effective - be more like Warriors. Hey, how about being MORE like Paladins. I want you in a raid not because you are a crapier Warrior, but because you can Tank AND save the butt of someone in your goup that is going to die, Tank AND root that add.<br />
<br />
IF we need another Tank, then let's get a Warrior. At 25% Defensive are you going to be as much of a raid asset as a Warrior? No siree. But, if your spellbook let's you be an addtank AND when we get to Quarm Wave heal and cure, then you are more valuable in the Tank/Combat Medic/RGC role than a Warrior could ever be.<br />
<br />
I don't want Paladins to MT named high DI mobs using Defensive like Warriors. If you can manage because of &quot;-1 DI&quot;, a revised spellbook, and an auto parry disc then that's fine. You aren't a Warrior and those assets support your raid role. If that let's you be the second tank in Ikkinz 2 then perfect. You can melee, do group support, rez the Cleric if he dies, and help keep yourself alive when you are tanking the second mob.<br />
<br />
I want Paladins to effectively tank adds (don't need Defensive, the ability to cast useful heals without interrupt does the job), splits that aren't flaming red (don't need Defensive), and be Combat Medics (useful fast heals)/RGC.<br />
<br />
Paladins don't need Defensive to be Paladins. They only need it if they are determined to be Warriors. If that's the way things turn out Warriors might as well log and let SoE finish the job making their Wholey Warriors/Mostly Clerics.<br />

<br />
Problem is, BB, you can't upgrade paladin healing without stepping on the toes of shamans, and then if pallies get upgraded heals, rangers and beastlords will be wanting the same thing.<br />
<br />
Only way to rebalance pally healing is to rebalance all 4 at the same time... which isn't such a bad idea, really, they all need it to some degree or another.<br />

Such is already the case. In many cases, hybrids are preferred offtanks or MA on non named mobs. They still have superior ranged aggro and adequate survivability. Don't let them try and tell you that they're not, we've already seen they'll try and pull the &quot;poor me, I can't do anything&quot; routine to get upgrades - whether their claims are based in fact and truth or not.<br />

They already can do that. If they're a designated off/addtank, there's already healers there that their job is to keep them alive, pallies don't need to heal themselves to do this job. Same with combat medic... they can already do that.</div></div><hr />

You just noticed this about Tragor? Isn't it funny how Druids and Paladins get their issues addressed so quickly (even if frivilous), esp considering Alan plays both classes. <br />
Here is a warning to SOE and their bullshit, WoW is hanging over your head. GLOWING reports about BETA not even having bugs (unlike the crap you peddle), go ahead play Alan's favorites. You won't even have a player base left if you do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Daemonwynd,<br />
<br />
Paladins complain they can't cast a heal without being interrupted. The SoE needs to look at their Channeling Focus AA Ability and add more levels and make sure it works. They might need faster heals. They might need bigger hear. SoE can examine the issue.<br />
<br />
A fast cast Vie-like buff that they could cast that didn't stack with Vie could be ued to improve their survivability. And if it wasn't self-only, enxhance their raid role when not the add tank.<br />
<br />
My point is Paladins claim they have no seconday role. If tru, then they should. Druid and Shaman do.<br />
<br />
Paladins claim their spellbooks are useless. If so, they should be fixed.<br />
<br />
The Paladins priest abilities SHOULD also allow them to assist in improving their own survivability. IF they don't, then SoE should update the spellbook.<br />
<br />
Sure, give Knights &quot;-1 DI&quot; and bump Warriors to &quot;-2&quot;. Sure, give them an auto-parry or auto-reposte disc.<br />
<br />
After all this, see if they can add tank. See if they can do the trials.<br />
<br />
Fix Paladins. Don't slap on Defensive and call it a day - that's not fair to anybody.<br />
<br />
BTW when you do a trial with an enhanced Paladin, do the trial. The best strategy and group composition for a Wariror might not be the same for a Paladin. If you can blind the mob with FoL and kill it, then blind the mob. If a Ranger using WS is an asset then group him. My point is don't dumbly fight with a 10k HP Paladin like you would with a 12k HP Warrior, cast no spells and report &quot;Duh, hey boss I can't kill da wabbit.&quot; Any idiot already knows that if you don't cast spells you'll likely die.<br />

<br />
I'm almost positive they'd have to be referring to their 5 second cast time one. That's to be expected. But then, who expects a pally to cast a slower casting heal at the same time as tank, and have a hope of being able to get it off?<br />
<br />
Now, their ONE second cast time one? Man, you can get that off between rounds easily. All you have to do is actually time the heal properly. You don't necessarily need more channeling, you just need to be smarter in your spell and timing choices when you tank.<br />
<br />

They do. Several of them in fact. Offtank, and combat medic cheif among them.<br />

Of course, but that's not the case today.<br />

<br />
They can and do, their own fast heals, and LoH, and stuns and even roots all allow this. So does DA.<br />
<br />
Sure, give Knights &quot;-1 DI&quot; and bump Warriors to &quot;-2&quot;. Sure, give them an auto-parry or auto-reposte disc.<br />
<br />
No. Fix DA instead. Don't bump them to higher mitigation tables along with us. Making us mitigate better just breeds encounter design with mob damage that goes to even more stupid amounts of damage.</div></div><hr />

 With the exception of the fact that the best geared knight will get TO the end boss quicker and safer than the EP geared Warrior. In fact, for every part of the trial BUT the boss, the Knight will be the clearly better choice for the group.<br />
<br />
 Don't kid yourself with group size, the boss mobs in these things are raid level material. If it is too damaging to Paladin egos to be significantly worse with a handful of raid level mobs simply because Sony was too dumb to figure out that they don't belong in single group content, then I don't know what to tell you.<br />
<br />
 (Oh yes, the 'single group' complaint is a red herring. How does increasing group size to 8 or 10 improve Knight tankability? It doesn't, of course, it just means you can circumvent it with even more DPS.)</div></div><hr />

I felt that between the Channeling Focus AA, Divine Stun (on mobs it can land on), 1 second heals, stuns to hold aggro, a VDD with Force of Ykesha to hold aggro, Spell Haste focus items, etc. that Paladins had to be able to get an ocassional spell off without losing aggro on a mob they were add tanking.<br />
<br />
I suspect this is somewhat like the assertion made one week into GoD when a PoN poster wrote that they were losing their experiance group tank role in GoD - putting they worst possible face on things and then having players like Taragor who aren't even in GoD chiming in by the score with the hopes of getting Defensive.<br />
<br />
One solution would be to remove the stun immunity from the trial boss mobs and make them immune to all current stuns. Then SoE could provide Paladins a stun that would stick so they could have &quot;stun mitigation&quot; and time to cast a fast heal. A recourse type buff on the mob would prevent stun locking the mob.<br />
<br />
There would be a whole lot of issues that Paladins claim to have that wouldn't be addressed, but these wouldn't be addressed by Defensive either.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Sheena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Well Divine Stun is a 0 second stun, however between the 30% spellhaste a paladin SHOULD have to be tanking the GoD content, and another 10% from BoR there is no excuse even a much longer heal should not get through.<br />
<br />
I've personally seen a paladin chain heal himself against a GoD mob, I've taken one through the Tipt trial boss included, and I've seen one tank for Ikkinz group trials.  I've also seen the warrior issues.<br />
<br />
It isn't an impossibility for a paladin to get through this, or an SK.  Its very possible, but as it should be they can't do it as cleanly as a warrior.  This is acceptable.<br />
<br />
And honestly, think about it.  Paladins/SKs tanked CT and Inny in Time, mostly only CT now but regardless it was done, and it was done before they were incredibly equipped, so even they can tank raid style content.<br />
<br />
As for the defensive outcry let me think a second.  Oh yeah, it usually runs out before the mob dies.  In some cases WELL before the mob dies.  It just so happens that this is not the case in the GoD trials.  Warriors don't seem to be crying that defensive isn't long enough to last encounters, at which point their marginally better hps and mitigation are all thats there.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Re Inny and CT, speaking from personal experience i'd wager that their DPS is similiar or lower then ikkinz trial named, CT for sure, Inny might be more or similar, but well with 6-7 clerics its a lot easier.<br />

No one is talkign about impossabities, its not impossible for almost any class to tank almost any mob, its about being an acceptable rate, I personally feel knights chances are not at an acceptable rate, i'll prob get someone yelling to stfu and play a warrior  you fag you suck lol but oh well, different persepctive on what class's should beable to do i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Actually, that's a very astute point.<br />

On the majority of raid boss mobs the Warrior advantage is 3 minutes of reduced healing followed by whatever marginal advantage their equipment and &quot;-1 DI&quot; provides. This is precisely the reason Knights can MT just like Warriors on long named boss fights fights.<br />
<br />
It's ONLY on shorter named fights like those PoN Paladins are trying to eliminate from the Warrior Strongly Preferred List where Warriors have an advantage the Paladins can't easily match. <br />
<br />
Pretty devious - continue being able to MT the long named boss mobs lagging Warriors slightly until equipment allows you to catch up while focusing on the handful of fights where Warriors are needed.

I'm not sure where you're leading with this BB. I've never discussed the issues about keeping aggro, why bring it up? The issue is solely getting the spell off. <br />
<br />

I suspect this is somewhat like the assertion made one week into GoD when a PoN poster wrote that they were losing their experiance group tank role in GoD - putting they worst possible face on things and then having players like Taragor who aren't even in GoD chiming in by the score with the hopes of getting Defensive.<br />
<br />
I may not be in PoTime, but compared to the replys from some of your brethren on this very MB I don't think that means squat. Look BB I've told you before. The only way you argue is to bring in the level into play. I don't give a shit that I'm not in UQUA, pre-GoD I sure as hell didn't have visions of being the MT on raids for my guild. and post GoD I still don't, never have never will. To YOU though, that is the ONLY counter argument you have. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Let's go with your stun suggestion here. <br />
<br />
-Spell or AA?<br />
-Stun Duration?<br />
-Refresh?<br />
<br />
You know we've discussed the issues with stunable mobs before. We said it WAS an option except that SOE has always made named mobs stun immune to avoid stun locking. Do they HAVE the ability to make mobs stunnable but with the recourse buff on it to disallow multiple knights from chaining them? If they do, why have they never made mobs that way?<br />
<br />
What will sk use?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's ONLY on shorter named fights like those PoN Paladins are trying to eliminate from the Warrior Strongly Preferred List where Warriors have an advantage the Paladins can't easily match. <br />
<br />
Back with the blinders are ya BB? It's not PREFERENCE. It's *there's no way I'm doing this with a knight*.<br />
<br />
In PoP vs mini named warriors had an advantage, (rightfully so), but you see THAT was an advantage. Why? Because they same mini were tankiable with a knight in the proper gear. And the proper gear didn't mean a knight in full PoTime gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty devious - continue being able to MT the long named boss mobs lagging Warriors slightly until equipment allows you to catch up while focusing on the handful of fights where Warriors are needed. Even better if you don't need to use your spellbook to accomplish your goal of &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbook Superiority).<br />
<br />
It's also been proven that even though knights are fully capable of tanking all of PoTime, they don't do so for their guilds. warriors do. So your argument here is what?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sheena:<br />
<br />
Well Divine Stun is a 0 second stun, however between the 30% spellhaste a paladin SHOULD have to be tanking the GoD content, and another 10% from BoR there is no excuse even a much longer heal should not get through.<br />
<br />
Spell haste effects only work on spells that are 3secs and above. <br />
<br />
I'm also curious. If casting while being hit isn't an issue. Why do clerics go splat all the time?<br />
<br />
<br />
And honestly, think about it. Paladins/SKs tanked CT and Inny in Time, mostly only CT now but regardless it was done, and it was done before they were incredibly equipped, so even they can tank raid style content.<br />
<br />
And non plate classes in full PoTime gear have also tanked Gods in the content. What exactly does this prove? Also, there's a small difference between having 10 clerics around or 2. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the defensive outcry let me think a second. Oh yeah, it usually runs out before the mob dies. In some cases WELL before the mob dies.

<br />
<br />
<br />
I was referring to spells longer than 3 seconds, thus 'much longer heals' like I said.  The ones spell haste WOULD have an effect on.<br />
<br />
And why do clerics go splat all the time?  Quit simple, we are on an utterly PATHETIC mitigation table, we have no avoidance skills,  My LR doesn't even work in GoD.  I can't dodge attacks and I get hit for full from nearly every blow.  When you get hit by a full quad for full damage and die, how much time do you really get to cast a spell?  Thats why I said in Time/elemental because in GoD I simply hope I don't aggro mobs.<br />
<br />
And non plate classes in full PoTime gear have also tanked Gods in the content. What exactly does this prove? Also, there's a small difference between having 10 clerics around or 2. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice I said 'before they were incredibly equipped' there is a LARGE difference between a fully Time character and a fully elemental person.  I was referring to before paladins were fully Time, where they still tanked AND survived those encounters. <br />
<br />
Also theres a 'small' difference between the hp values of the mobs in a GoD trial and the mobs on raids.  Also there is a 'small' difference between using CH and using HL, which we didn't previously have available.  Simply put HL can offset around 850 DPS I believe my friend leveled it out to.  Thats with one cleric.  Give them two, you can win before the clerics run out of mana these mobs aren't Luclin mobs they do not have much hp at all.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Bring a paladin through all the trials without using stun, heals, or anything their spellbook gives to them and parse it and come back here.  Can a paladin do half his job, or even hold aggro without?  I doubt it.  You're asking a class to not use whats been given to them, their tools, to go through content.  Show me what a paladin can do without any of their tools and I'll show you what a warrior can do.<br />
<br />
Honestly with the sole exception of the boss mob of Tipt and the named in Ikkinz groups there is absolutely nothing groundbreaking that requires defensive at all, and you can do the boss/named without it as well.<br />
<br />
And you know what?  I'd love to take you up on that offer, since defensive is 45% effective, and with minimum hits I'd say the maximum amount they'd lose would be around 40% effectiveness (that would be 60% effective, more than half), probably about 30% on some things.

Also I dont think people often get one rounded, its more getting  two rounded.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure of delay of the named mobs but I heard someone say its 1.6 so I'll go with that.<br />
<br />
Two clerics alternating SL/HL can make  a heal land at best around every 2.2 seconds, that is assuming perfect alternation. Since the delay of the mob is less then that, invariably you'll get rounds where get two rounds w/o a heal and die.</div></div><hr />

I was referring to spells longer than 3 seconds, thus 'much longer heals' like I said.  The ones spell haste WOULD have an effect on.<br />
<br />
I have 1 spell that is 3 secs or more. Touch of Nife. Both my stuns that work up to lvl 65 are under 3 secs and both my fast heals are.<br />
<br />
Touch of nife heals for 1125hp (pre aa) with a casting time of 5 secs. With max haste I might be able to bring it down to 3secs. <br />
<br />
BTW, you're assuming we'd even have it memmed since it's a PoS spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And why do clerics go splat all the time?  Quit simple, we are on an utterly PATHETIC mitigation table, we have no avoidance skills,  My LR doesn't even work in GoD.  I can't dodge attacks and I get hit for full from nearly every blow.  When you get hit by a full quad for full damage and die, how much time do you really get to cast a spell?  Thats why I said in Time/elemental because in GoD I simply hope I don't aggro mobs.<br />
<br />
The issue is casting while being hit. You're claiming you have no issues casting CH while getting hit. We lose clerics on our raids every night and I'm not doing GoD content. So how do you explain there dificiencies vs non GoD content who don't 1 round them? Shouldn't they be able to cast on themselves?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also theres a 'small' difference between the hp values of the mobs in a GoD trial and the mobs on raids.  Also there is a 'small' difference between using CH and using HL, which we didn't previously have available.  Simply put HL can offset around 850 DPS I believe my friend leveled it out to.  Thats with one cleric.  Give them two, you can win before the clerics run out of mana these mobs aren't Luclin mobs they do not have much hp at all.<br />
<br />
How to put this. Guild level content in GoD appropriate to a EP level guild will crush your knight in secs. PERIOD. Just like you can't do much against 1 rounding, neither can a knight. Sure it might take 2 or 3 rounds but clerics will not be able to keep up. NOTE: I said CONTENT LEVEL vs GUILD LEVEL. I don't want to see an argument that PoTime lvl knights tanked the sewers without any issue. Sewers aren't PoTime lvl content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bring a paladin through all the trials without using stun, heals, or anything their spellbook gives to them and parse it and come back here.  Can a paladin do half his job, or even hold aggro without?  I doubt it.  You're asking a class to not use whats been given to them, their tools, to go through content.  Show me what a paladin can do without any of their tools and I'll show you what a warrior can do.<br />
<br />
No, the issue is that knights CANNOT tank the content because they don't have a mitigation ability. Warriors have greater survivability than knights without using defensive. Therefore, if it's doable with a knight, it's doable with a warrior without defensive. Now doable means with relative success. Not once every 20 tries.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And you know what?  I'd love to take you up on that offer, since defensive is 45% effective, and with minimum hits I'd say the maximum amount they'd lose would be around 40% effectiveness (that would be 60% effective, more than half), probably about 30% on some things.  You positive you're ready to hop on that bandwagon so easily?<br />
<br />
In PoTime gear, with repeated attempts, I say there's no way a warrior will have a 60% success rate without using defensive or a pooka and tanking them toe to toe. And yes. Bring me sustained parses and I'd jump on the bandwagon in the blink of an eye.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">&quot;Stun is avoidance, not mitigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmmm. Now that would make for an interesting debate. I personally feel stun is neither. I equate it more with acting like a SLOW spell, than avoiding damage or mitigating damage. But that's because as a monk, I never have had access to slow proccing weapons, but have had access to stun proccing weapons since Kunark. So, I always equated the two together. Stun was just what monks got in lieu of slow, regarding weapon procs.<br />
<br />
In truth, stun is stun and should probably be equated in its own classification. Slow ... stun ... avoiding a hit ... taking a smaller hit ... they're all different, but RESULT in the same thing ... you taking less damage from the monster.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've gone too far on this tangent. It'd make a great thread of its own though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also I dont think people often get one rounded, its more getting two rounded.&quot;<br />
<br />
I get one-rounded a lot. Just the other day, one of the birds (the one that drops ornate greatblade) in PoFire turned on me and one-rounded me. Granted its proc was involved in the mess, but eh, such is life. Try living a month with monk mitigation. FEEL THE LOVE!<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
P.S. On the bright side, I'm usually the first to confirm what the MAX HIT is for each new mob me and my guild faces. It sort of goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Wizard_01 tells the guild: &quot;Wow, that thing raped me. I got hit for 1200 three times.&quot;<br />
Warrior_01 tells the guild: &quot;Hmmmm ... highest hit I saw was 787.&quot;<br />
WUBAO TELLS THE GUILD: &quot;1397 is its max hit. It hit me four times. Three times for 1397, once for 787.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">What I mean is that stun will not lower the amount of damage in a single attack/round<br />
<br />
Defensive will Do that, Shielding will do that, AC will do that, stonestance will do that, even attack debuffs etc etc, all of those to varying degrees of reliabily and &quot;how&quot; it does <br />
<br />
Stun  - When it lands, makes it so you do not get hit at all for X amount of time. you avoid getting hit, if you had to classify everything as either mitigation or avoidance, stun and slow would be &quot;Avoidance&quot; because they do nothing to mitigate the amount the mob hits in a single attack<br />
<br />
Evasive, Block, Dodge mods, Riposte, Furious, Fortitude also fall under &quot;avoidance&quot;<br />
<br />
Although I do see what your saying, my basic point is that stun really wouldnt help too much, it doesnt prevent just that really bad 2-3 rounds that kill you, even then it might get resisted etc, or if its reliable enough, then its blantantly abusable with stunlock.<br />
<br />
I'm more talking about tanks when I say people generally dont get oune rounded.<br />
<br />
Mob hits for 2100ish you'd need a full 2100 attack round + riposte to take out most tanks in a single round, and well, statisticially i dont think it will happen much to be a worry  (and hell THat wouldnt take out me) Its about two or three rounds, which happen, you cant heal fast enough to get healed every round with 2 healers</div></div><hr />

 I love it. First because with an autoparry disc rather than Defensive, the Knight's chances go up tremendously in that scenario(Of course, we only hear REASONABLE Knights talking autoparry anymore, everyone else smells Defensive), and secondly, if you have 2 Clerics in group, you have 3 healers with a Paladin tanking.<br />

I don't know, maybe they aren't equipped as well, maybe they don't have the AAs, maybe they aren't fast enough, and sometimes it just happens too fast to help anyways.  The fact of the matter is when it comes down to it a cleric CAN heal themselves rather easily while getting hit, especially using Holy Light, or if even more speed is needed SR.<br />

No, the issue is that knights CANNOT tank the content because they don't have a mitigation ability. Warriors have greater survivability than knights without using defensive.

For some sure that'd clear the hump, but we're going to even consider taking away the only thing warriors have to themselves for SOME knights who can't make it?  No, I don't think so.  Yes, the content shouldn't be that way, no warriors should not be punished for it.<br />

Alright then, like you said if its doable with a knight, its doable with a warrior without defensive.  Since I've done it with a knight, I can do it with a warrior without defensive.  Am I going to do this a bunch of times so I can impress you?

 If knights were requesting 45% defensive then you could see it as a complete threat of them wanting to replace you. BUT, that's not the case now is it. It's been stated time and again that we're looking for a % SPECIFICALLY to achieve some form of survivability. NOT to replace warriors in the MT role.<br />
<br />
<br />
In regards to my free upgrades (spells), I beg to differ. They AREN'T free. Remember the cost I paid for having a spellbook. You know. NO offensive discs. NO defensive discs. NO inate dmg mitigation. CRAPPY DPS, lower HP, lower AC. <br />
<br />
Again, we're discussing FREE upgrades. FREE upgrades come at NO cost. The COST for me to receive spells with each expansion means I do LESS dmg than you, I have LESS ac then you, I have LESS hp than you, I have LESS dmg mitigation than you, I have no discs compared to you. Need I go on?<br />
<br />
<br />
And you're not going to keep your supremecy. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Taragor<br />
<br />
#1. its about tradeoffs, something you dont understand apparently.You take our best ability we want something of yours.Why not have healing will do 5000hp at level 65 and be refreshed in 45 seconds, and we could attack while its healing us etc. That would &quot;increase our survivability&quot;.<br />
<br />
#2. You cant say you gave up discs/ac/hp for spells. You are a different class.You are comparing apples and oranges. Spells are a free upgradeinthe fact that Sony doesnt take something you ALREADY HAD away to gvie you spells.You neverhad thesame AC and HP,although the gap is very small without the right AAs.<br />
<br />
#3. Bingo.You dont want Warriors to retain their &quot;supremecy&quot; which the game is structured on and has been structured on since day one.As said before, you wouldnt understand balance if it hit you right between your &quot;holy warrior&quot; eyes.<br />
<br />
#4. Yes I cut out some of the drival that Taragor typedbecause it wasnt even worth a response.</div></div><hr />
