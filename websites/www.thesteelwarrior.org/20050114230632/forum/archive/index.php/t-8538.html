Have 711 LDoN points saved from the Butcherblock (MM) LDoNs.  It's taken awhile to get these points, and I plan to do only N Ro and EF LDoNs going forward.  I'm torn between getting the +10 AC aug, or getting a weapon proc aug (currently have CHoS and SotBs, both unaug'd).  Have only one other slot in Armor that needs an Aug.   We're just starting the Planes Content, have Factory Flag, but that's it.   <br />
<br />
For the long term, should I just get the AC aug and be done with it, or go for a few more LDoN points and get a better weapon proc from the BB LDon Merchants (and if so, which item)?</div></div><hr />

If I were you, I wouldn't do LDON until level 65. Just focus on leveling up and then get a few AAs before you start with LDON, because at 65 you get more points for each completed adventure, right? I have no idea because I was 65 when LDON came out. Anyways just my advice...lvl 65+ aa is key...and then get an anger proc or two and some 40hp augs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
HPs for moes, AC for the pros!  1150 pts for a 40 HP aug would buy you 2x10 AC augs which is a much better use of your points IMHO.  There are 5 possible slots that will take the AC augs and they will last you a long time.  Once you have the full set of them, then start on the HP ones would be my recommendation.</div></div><hr />

Like Frosst said the points will come faster at 65. And like Bruenorg said AC augments are a better bang for the buck than the HP augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't spend those points at all until i am either at 1150 in EF, or maxed in Nro.  I would let those 700 points be kind of like a bonus for when you get your points in EF/Nro. Or, i like big upgrades at once, not a littler here and a littler there, so maybe buy yourself an EF aug and an ac aug or two at the same time, and notice the difference of you character =)  <br />
<br />
I am a fan of delayed gratification, might take longer to get there, but the reward is better and the taste is sweeter =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went this route:<br />
Anger2, Anger3, 10MR aug, Anger3(2nd one), 10AC aug.<br />
My next LDoN purchases will probably be more 10 AC aug7s.<br />
<br />
I bought the MR one because at the time we where working on carpin cycle, bert, and MM, so I needed the best MR I could get.  It is only 357pts.  Can never have enough Mr, at least until you have 500 unbuffed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the 10 AC augs from BB (and at a mear 51 points an AC its about the cheapest aug per point of effect you can get) and without knowing your haste situation, I would also say the 36% haste aug from BB is quite worth it for 1150 points. I stuck on in my Royal Sands Helm so I have a 39 AC haste item (and was able to upgrade my belt from RBB to cultural).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this true?  Those augs are only 51 points?  If so, that's terrific!  I'm totally going to buy several.  Can anyone else verify the price?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theyre 510 points which is 51 points per point of AC</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the augs are 510 points, the poster above was saying that for 51 points you get 1 ac (10 ac augs at 510 points per). Still go get them, definitely worth it.<br />

<br />
Haste is king.   I have a soulscream belt for haste right now. But if it's going to take a month for me to get an item I can put that haste aug in, I'll go with the +10 AC aug.<br />
<br />
HEAD BACK RANGE WAIST, Type 3 aug.. I have to buy another LDoN item for this... gonna be awhile before any of those are worthwhile, tho.  Hmmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fenrig, your statement that the AC augs are the only good items for warriors is not entirely true.  BB also drops haste augments.  One viable way to upgrade haste, depending on gear setup, is to augment the NRO helmet with the 36 percent haste augment.<br />
<br />
Dwavlin, I would wait till 65 to spend any of the points.  You never know what you might come across in that time.  Once you are 65 you can reassess what you need.  While using LDoN to level is somewhat slow, it will net you a lot of points.  However, you will level slower than if you just exp'd in PoV or PoN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh you can &quot;buy&quot; haste augs there; they are not &quot;dropped&quot;<br />
<br />
Just wanted that clarified before someone got an expectation otherwise.<br />
<br />
To original poster; buy anger 3 first.  Then  grind 65 in PoP/GoD (reg ldon is abysmal experience post nerf 8 months ago).<br />
<br />
Buy your (5) 10ac augs before 40hps.  They go by very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwavlin</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx, all.  Bought the +10 AC aug, and will save the extra points for later.  If I can't get a better haste item by 65, I will use those points to get the BB haste aug, but I suspect I will end up using these points for the +10 AC BB augs at that point, so I see no reason not to take advatage of one now.<br />
<br />
Again: thanks for the input!</div></div><hr />
