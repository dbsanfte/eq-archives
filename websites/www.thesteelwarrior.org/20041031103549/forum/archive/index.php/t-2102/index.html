<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">seru and aten bp's are basically the same. I'd take seru personally for the extra resists. Then if you don't have a haste item maybe look into the bp of speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I prefer the bp of speed myself because that frees other slots where haste goes for nice things like the belt of mastery or girdle of earthen stability (I used to have haste in my waist until I recently got my bp of speed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm waiting on the Heavy Yttrium BP personally because of the resists. We'll be in EP in a month or 2 so looking at the shoulders from Earth as my new haste item once we get to that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">seru BP is very nice, i would use, but yer loseing alot of attack over the Great Shadow, and even losing from BP of Speed...<br />
<br />
so which is more important, atk or resists?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Id go with seru's.  Once you farm EPs for a bit you will cap attack easy and should be able to pick up one of the many many haste items around there so i give it the edge due to the regen/resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taliefer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">went with bp of speed here, coulda gotten the seru bp earlier, but the dodge mod is nice, and if resists are gonna matter while tanking, you will likely be grouped with a bard.</div></div><hr />

You don't want to be crippled with Haste in another slot that you'll want to upgrade. 125hp BP is the most you'll see before you get near PoTime, so you won't have to move haste until then. That frees up belt/cloak/range/bracer or whatever for a far greater upgrade than the small difference between the BPs<br />
<br />
erm... did I miss something in your Magelo? You still to have no haste... You short term upgrade list has GoDS listed. You don't really want to be limited to 75hp in a main armor slot longterm. The resists difference is minimal on one item. The 20atk difference to GPS is minimal. BPoS wins out because of long term benefit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My favorite is seru BP ( and I got it :D  ).<br />
<br />
But you should take whats there cause theyre all not really common dropps.<br />
<br />
Btw.  you missed BP Nr. 4 in than region.<br />

A bit less HP but a nice HP buff for exp grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vladimoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Having looked at the same three options for BP upgrades I went with the BP of speed simply due to longevity.  When I made the decision the elemental/time bp molds had not been discovered yet so I viewed bp as a slot that would not be upgraded for quite a long time.  With that in mind I wanted to get the most additional benefit out of the slot that I could.  Having reviewed all three of the bp's I viewed having haste in that slot the best option.  With haste in a slot that I didn't see myself upgrading till PoTime I figured I could focus on high AC/HP items for all other slots.</div></div><hr />
