<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karlea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Till now I have hardly touched a 2hander, being MA of my guild and not being able to hold proper aggro with them. Now my guild is progressing pretty fast though so I'm playing with the though of getting one.<br />
<br />
There are three different ones I could acquire:<br />
<br />
Sword of Ssraeshza<br />
Bloodied Berserker's Blade<br />
Ornate Greatblade<br />
<br />
Could you advise me which would be the best one for a guild's MA, taking into assumption that, no matter which I'd get in the end, I'd augment it with Anger III. I somewhat think the BBB might be the best choice but I have little experience with twohanders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You mean your guild MT ).<br />
<br />
The BBB is ok.<br />
The Sword of Ssraa is crap.<br />
Ornate Greatblade not real the winner.<br />
<br />
Some parts to think about.<br />
<br />
Gaudralek (NtoV) but not so good as BBB.<br />
Obsidian Greatblade (Temple of Sol Ro) should be better than BBB<br />
GSot4W always better than Sword of Ssraa as good as Gaudralek I think (BoT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">BBB is definitely the best out of those choices, but you should definitely consider a Norge`tal (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28825). Drops off of something in Ssra, though I must admit I forget what. It holds aggro very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">High Preist drops Norge'tal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would go with the GSot4W.<br />
<br />
Nice weapon and great aggro. With Anger III I hear is very nice.<br />
<br />
And aye most guilds (that I know of ) use non aggro classes as the MA so if a tank falls they can rotate easily and not hold up the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Promethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Sword of Ssraa is crap<br />
<br />
Emp 2h is one of the most underated swords in Luclin heh.<br />
<br />
I took an Emp 2h before a BBB (I have both now, I'm a weapon whore), and tanked VT bosses just fine with it.  I got a BBB afterwards and used it mainly for tanking.  Emp 2h is really nice if you aren't MT.  I still carry mine even though my primary is a Vanazir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go4W is very niceand far easier to acquire than any of the weapons you listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well if you have access to an Ornate Greatblade, I'm assuming your guild is elemental so why not wait for SEW's or BoW?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karlea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On Firiona Vie weapons aren't No Drop, so you can buy pretty much everything in bazaar if you wait long enouch, including Elemental class armor and some assorted weaponry. My guild is far from being Elemental, but an Ornate Greatblade is for sale (for quite some coins).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh that's cool, missed the FV tag under your name, but out of those choices BBB would be the best I think.</div></div><hr />
