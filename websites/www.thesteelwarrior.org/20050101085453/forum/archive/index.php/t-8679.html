<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read the Class Descriptions (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp).<br />
<br />
The Warrior Class Description is pretty much word for word exactly what appears in the game. We take a getting hit during battles better than any other class, but we are extremely group dependent and can do little else except very average melee DPS. Think of the Rocky movie where he's getting beaten to a pulp, sticks out his chin, and says &quot;That's not so bad. Is that all you've got?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the SK Class Description begins getting less accurate after level 55. They are supposed to take away a mob's will to fight,and their ability to do so effectively. They are supposed to fill them with fear. They are supposed to take advantage of this by doing some serious damage to their hapless opponent. Like I said, Verant and SoE later did not to my mind make the SK Class Description a reality much past 55 and for no good reason what-so-ever.<br />
<br />
However SK's are evolving into good pullers, are less group dependent than Warriors, and like Warriors do average melee damage. Somewhat distressingly, a signature piece of equipment, Circlet of Shadow, which is extremely useful when pulling no longer drops in game and is overly expensive to acquire.<br />
<br />
SK's can tank, but are not as effective versus the hardest hitting mobs. My opinion is that they are extremely group friendly - they can bring one mob at a time to the group and are very adequate tanks, but they lack a real class defining ability or set of abilities. SoE would be improving the game by reading the SK Class Description and making it so.<br />
<br />
Read the boards. There's a lot of information available.<br />

I'd advise you to make a character of the 2 classes in question and see which one tickles your fancy more.    :cool:</div></div><hr />

Knights and warriors mitigate about the same--until we hit defenesive. And that differance is huge. <br />
<br />
Now SKs are fun and have some of the neatest AAs and some really fun secondary abilities. My 40th SK is a blast. Of course I have never soloed with her, and pull like I do with Kailyn (LDoNs are easy enough that most groups don't wipe with the level of gear now out there) I don't think I have ever FDed off a pull. <br />
<br />
Of course...unless you are a serious leveler by the time that you get to 65/70 what we are telling you may no longer be true.</div></div><hr />

Life is good for my 36 SK because he can snare a mob, and then hit him with fear. <br />
<br />
I'm not leveling him because I know this is as good as it ever gets for him. As far as tanking at the &quot;end game&quot; goes, SK's are only 3'rd best behind Warriors and Paladins. Warrior's have slightly better miitgation, and pally's  have stuns, which cuts the mobs DPS.<br />
<br />
Until SoE gives SK's their own version of &quot;stun&quot;, I'd shy away from making an SK toon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are plenty of warriors, being a warrior is dull dull dull for a long time, you can't solo as a warrior effectively, and even at the higher end you are heavily gear and AA dependent.  Unless you have an itch to raid, being an SK will be much more flexible for much longer and will serve you better in a wider variety of situations.  That said, being a paladin will, unfortunately be an even better choice for you.<br />
<br />
Warriors shine at being main tanks in specific situations.   I love being a warrior, but i'm a rare bird.<br />

<br />
<br />
Aye, a paladin would be a much better choice than a SK imho.. Pallys can actually heal decently, which is awesome no doubt about it. Plus, with all of the undead nukes in the pallys arsenal, there are tons of places to go and solo for you. In the 50s, Trakanons is a breeze.. a SK on the other hand cant do that. Yeh, they can dish out some real sweet damage, but htye have to burn alot of mana. Finally, HT isnt nearly as good as LoH. <br />
<br />
Also, its just alot easier not to be a MT.. When someone dies, they usually blame the cleric for not healing them or the warrior for not taunting good enough or hitting hard enough... With an SK or pally, you can just sit back and not worry about ppl gettin angry at ya hehe..<br />
<br />
Well, Id hafta say if i could remake my warrior hed be a paladin instead; at least have a chance at soloin..  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Best advice for class picking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try everything. Hell, go to test and buff up to a 25 and play around, after you get a hang of the game of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't let other people pick your class for you.</div></div><hr />

I've played most classes to atleast level 20 and most melee classes to 30. Thus I have a general idea what works for me and not.<br />
Like someone suggested before: Level both a warrior and a sk to 30 and you'll know what to pick. At level 30, warrior starts to suck at soloing and sk gets all their cool utility spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people really like warriors; some think warriors are boring. I'm never bored playing my warrior (well, uh, not while I'm actually fighting anyway).<br />
I'm also never bored playing my SK alt, and in some ways he's more fun, though I'm not sure whether that's a function of the class or that when I'm playing alts I'm usually just fiddling around in a less-tense environment than when I'm tanking with my main.<br />
The life of a warrior involves certain hassles: the combination of being a strikingly poor solo fighter and being heavily gear dependant means that starting in your 20s (if you don't run a trader) and in your 40s or 50s gear expenses are pretty high if your warrior is your main and you're trying to both keep aggro and tank for groups of players who, in many cases, will be well geared. I think lots of warriors stall out in their 50s, and that's why (though I have no real data to back that up).<br />
But: all groups need a tank, and warriors are the best tanks for the nastiest mobs.<br />
<br />
SKs have some advantages: you can solo better than warriors (though not nearly as well as some caster classes) and pre-50s SKs have some really nice little tricks up their sleeves. Warriors really do lack any sort of utility, whereas in the early phases of the game, SKs have some.<br />
Unfortunately for SKs, Battleblade's assessment of their 50+ situation is correct. Their relative utility declines and, as mobs hit harder and harder, SKs lose traction as tanks relative to warriors and paladins. The tools that SKs have for reducing the amount of heavy damage they take either don't work at all against higher mobs, or don't work nearly as well as warriors' discs and pallies' stuns. At the same time, SK damage-production and utility to a group or raid that is facing hard-hitting mobs are not especially impressive. So, life begins to get frustrating for SKs on a level that a decently geared warrior does not currently face.<br />
<br />
But, you know, you're just going to have to check them out yourself, as previous posters have mentioned.<br />
I wouldn't pick either of those classes unless you are fairly certain that you want to play a lot in groups and are willing to cultivate friends, as both classes are built with group fighting in mind.</div></div><hr />
