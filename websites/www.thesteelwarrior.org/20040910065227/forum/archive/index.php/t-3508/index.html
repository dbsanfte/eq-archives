<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Floppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yep, I'm just a lurker and ill-qualified to make a post like this. But I've had this idea rolling around in my head for a few days and I just HAD to share it...<br />
<br />
Activate Weapon<br />
Warrior Class Skill<br />
<br />
Three ranks, 6 AAs each<br />
Prerequisite: Combat Fury 3<br />
<br />
This refinement of a warrior's natural weapons expertise allows the warrior to harness the magical abilities of her weapon at will. After a period of concentration, the warrior may command her weapon to use its combat effect on her next strike. The warrior may continue to attack during this time, and does not face a channeling check, although she may be interrupted by a stun.<br />
<br />
Concentration (casting) time: First rank, 15 seconds. Second rank, 12.5 seconds. Third rank, 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Details: Only applies to the &quot;Combat&quot; effect of the weapon in the primary slot. Augment-applied effects, and casted combat innates, are not effected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But... I'm bored after farming 50 alternate experience points, and I don't have all the ones I need for defensive purposes. This AA would make me cry irl because I'd be so sad that I have to farm uh... 12+18=  30  aa just to be able to uh, you know use the skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yah.<br />
<br />
WHOOO WHERES THE PARTY AT?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apoco1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sounds cool...good idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Binn, bored after 50AA ... just wait till you hit the 100s, then you can say you are bored with AA.<br />
<br />
Least in the 50s you can still see returns for your work, you develop your tanking skills more.  <br />
<br />
Hell, after your Tank AA are finished, all you get is essentially toys to keep you quiet.  <br />
<br />
I mean ... does flurry, or Rampage help you tank ... nope, but they are fun, that is all.</div></div><hr />
