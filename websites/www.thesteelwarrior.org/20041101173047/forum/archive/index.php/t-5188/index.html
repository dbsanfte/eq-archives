<br />
...is what to Aug first (Anger proc)<br />
<br />
My CHoS/SotB DW set up (which works great for LDoN normals - not much chance I'm tanking LDoN hard :P )<br />
<br />
Or 'ye olde boom stick aka. GSoT?<br />
<br />
I'm leaning toward the GSoT just because it would work fine for LDoN (just probably not as quick of agro) and when doing PoP EXP grindage (BoT, PoV, etc.) I won't die from Repostes with it.<br />
<br />
Just looks so ugly... and what pimpin gnome warrior isn't worried about his glam looks :cool:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are only worried about XP tanking, then GSoT.<br />
<br />
If you are worried about raid tanking, I'd suppose you should augment your hammer or sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*shrugs* I have all those 3 weapons, I auged the hammer and I tank DWing in BoT just as fine, without taking many ripostes.<br />
If I have to choose between CHoS/SotB vs GSoT, I would go with the DW set up, but thats just my opinion, I tried both combos and all, and the DW seems more solid agro for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've got the same question Ernie has, as I like the GSoT fine, but on the other hand, my offhand is a 41% haste item. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree that the DW set up &quot;feels&quot; better on agro holding, but as a tank who currently usually runs around with 6500 or less HP (all depends on buffs can just tip 7k with full raid buffages), maybe I feel the added &quot;crunch, crunch&quot; of the repostes more.<br />
<br />
For example, when a CH is looking close (I'm at or just under 20% HP and waiting for the CH to come in) and dual wielding, I will generally flick off auto attack (to stop repostes) and my finger is hovering over Furious.  While with the GSoT I don't really bother with turning off auto, since it doesn't seem to make much difference.<br />
<br />
Just a &quot;feel&quot; thing.  Maybe it will even out as I can pick up some armor upgrades and should just focus on best agro generation possible to me now (quad procs on DW set up).<br />
<br />
~Ernie<br />
<br />
BTW: I have the Icicle strike and heated blade LDoN augs in my CHoS/SotB respectively as I have seen a lot of others do with their DW set up.  Cheap procs = some extra DPS, but not a lot in the way o agro like I imagine the Anger procs will.  Wish I could get more Guk pick up groups - would rather have the Yak stun + dmg procs just for the little DPS if the agro is about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did Anger cause it was on the same place Malevolent armor was :)<br />
<br />
And yes, on Enrage, DW can kill you if you dont turn attack off or are not lucky enought to dodge half of the ripostes hehe... like, dont try to drink coffee when the LDoN boss mob enrages, cause maybe you cant turn autoattack off in time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jobned</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im an Ldon whore. The combination of CHOS and the mad researcher club (from everfrost) both with anger 3 is amazing agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there are numerous threads on the CHoSvGSoT combo v GSoT combo and as far as i know there isnt a definitive conclusion on which has the best aggro. that should be the base consideration, and not the belief that 2 anger 3 procs is better than 1.<br />
<br />
personally, in my experience over longish fights, the GSoT proc will add up to more aggro than the DW combo. (ive expd with the GSoT and vs a similar warrior with the DW setup we both tanked the same mob, no taunt, and more often than not he would end up stealing aggro).<br />
<br />
on the subject of raid tanking, either combination will give you good aggro, and incite makes things MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
so all things being equal, id prob go with the gsot just for the reduced ripostes. on the issue of ripostes though, if uve got a decent cch chain on you, and reasonable tanking ability, i dont see it as an entirely deciding factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>icsdave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a hint before you make a decision based on riposte, log/parse it.  I take 7.4 dps riposte damage (from logs) in ldon, I take the same in BOT, it jumps to 21 dps on Agnarr in bot.  This is with 15+1 at 19 and 13 at 20 1hand wespons.  AND YES adding 2 anger procs is an AWESOME diffenece in aggro.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 coppers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">dps doesn't kill tanks usually. . .spike damage does, which ripostes can contribute to greatly, thanks to EQ's awesome random number generator.<br />

Play EQ for enjoyment. . .it is a roleplaying game after all.  If you don't like looking at a GSoT, then don't wield it.  It would look much better if it was more rare.  /rude SoE</div></div><hr />

Put anger on the droga combo for when you absolutely need agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since there is no clear-cut definitive answer, the good news is you can choose whichever you want.   <br />
<br />
Until I dinged 65 I used my GSoT exclusively in xp situations where I was tanking, simply because I was xp'ing in zones where riposte damage was taking a sizeable chunck out of me (BoT Krigers really hurt).  I also used my GSoT in a Vindi kill where I picked up tanking duties when our MA died, a fight where I want to take as few ripostes as I can.  Agro was not amazing, but it was enough to get me to 65.  I totally agree that the further into the fight, the better my agro lead got with the GSoT.  My only concern was agro pre-slow, and the GSoT has always performed iffy for me in that situation.  <br />
<br />
Last night I was in HoH basement, where the mobs hit more a more reasonable 500ish.  About an hour in, I switched to my CHoS/SoBS to experiment a bit.  My pre-slow agro improved significantly, and I believe I only lost agro once in an hour on a slow (where with the GSoT I lost agro approx. 2 out of 3 times on slow, and only held agro through slow if I got a proc off beforehand).  The riposte damage I was taking did not feel terribly bad, and I in fact was avoiding a nice chunk of the ripostes.  There was no noticeable difference in terms of the heals I received each fight (65 cleric healing).  <br />
<br />
The point?  I think the GSoT would probably benefit  most from being your first anger augment.  I feel that it needs a little &quot;umf&quot; that an Anger 3 augment would certainly bring.  It would help with initial pre-slow agro by doubling your chance of proc'ing pre-slow, and would nearly assure rock-solid agro deep in the fight.  An augmented GSoT with anger 3 would be my raid MT weapon of choice as well.   <br />
<br />
I think I am planning on going Anger 3 with my GSoT, and Ykesha for my dual wield setup.  It seems the cheapest way for me to be covered for both xp groups and LDoN (where I feel dual wield is better) and raid and BoT groups (where I feel GSoT is better suited).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, after spending a serious long weekend tanking in BoT, PoV, PoS mini key item hunts, etc. I decided to slap my first Anger Augment into my GSoT, instead of the droga weapons (CHoS/SotB).  <br />
<br />
My main reason was, when grouped with some serious DSP folks (Time geared monk for example), with the Drogo DW set up, I would get the early agro, but I just couldn't hold it with him.  With the GSoT, I could generally keep the agro because, IMHO, the GSoT just has the better DPS that with on top of the proc + incite is enough to keep me ahead in the agro battle.<br />
<br />
So, while I don't dig the look as much as the DW set up, the lower reposte, better agro had me spending my hard earned points to slap Anger III into my GSoT.  I'm not going to anger aug the DW set up but instead work on some armor upgrades now.<br />
<br />
~Ernie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't understand how riposte damage is such a major factor to you. I use GBoS+CHoS over GSoT. The DW combo seems to provide much more solid aggro for me whether it's BoT or LDoN, and that's what made the decision for me. I buff out to only about 6500hps in the average xp group and riposte damage has never been an issue. Don't believe the hype. <br />
<br />
It's becoming harder and harder for me to justify even carrying the GSoT around anymore. I usually just use it for a DPS weapon ^.^ but it's going to be relegated to my trader when I can afford a WMBS. (I just spent 6.5k on a gold-tipped boar horn for the cloak of greater pernicity &gt;.&lt;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hi Gharghael,<br />
<br />
I play with my hits seperated out to a specific window that is hit's mode filtered to just show the numeric value of the hits and show, oh the last 15 or so lines of damage.  I also play a good portion of the time on headphones (roomates n stuff and have my music playing and like to rock out ^.^)<br />
<br />
Anyway, when I dual wield, I'm hitting the mob like a machine gun.  Bammity bam bam bam.  I also listen to the hits i'm taking (ouch ouch, crunch, ouch ouch, etc.) and have the hit damage I'm taking in another window to the left of the damage i'm doing (hit's mode set to abbreviated).  I guess it's hours of staring at it but, I notice a corresponding increase in the scroll of the hits I'm taking when I DW and the hits I'm doing are going fast fast fast.  <br />
<br />
I notice a corresponding slight slow down in the damage I'm taking vs how fast I'm hitting with the 2 hander, which I attribute to reposte damage ~ that's how I feel the difference is noticeable.  Just a &quot;feel&quot; thing, but in BoT (and previously griding at PoV camps) it sure seemed to be a factor.<br />
<br />
As for agro holding, I guess my decision is based more on sustained agro rather than snap agro at the start.  As I mentioned in my previous post, I was grinding in BoT this last weekend (played probably 30 hours or more over the 3 days off - had Monday as a holiday) I was exclusivly in BoT cranking on AA (got AE Taunt - YAY!).  For long stretches I was in groups with Elemental and Time geared folks.  The biggest one that sticks out is a Time guild monk.  <br />
<br />
With my DW set up I just could NOT consistantly keep the agro off him.  Once he overcame my inital agro lead from Incite with his higher DPS, I could just not keep the mob from always switching over to him.  Taunt back to me and very shortly it would pop back over to him.  Ok sure, he could probably tank it better than me, but you know grinding, like to keep things straight forward and well my job is to take the hits, his to pull n dish it, so I figured I would try the 2 hander.<br />
<br />
Switching to the GSoT (no aug at this time, just the raw weapon) and what do you know, the mob would more often then not stay on me.  It appeared that my Incite + procs  were enough to make up for my lesser DPS than the monk (but apparently now more DPS with the GSoT over the DW set up of CHoS/SotB aug'd with MM 75 DD proc and Tak 50 DD proc respectivly).<br />
<br />
I guess I usually don't have that much trouble with early slowing, overactive nuking, etc.  I'm pretty vocal in groups (am usually the group leader, etc) and will work out things if they are just not working.  So I fix that problem with communication with the other group members (giving me a slice more time to get some agro).<br />
<br />
I have also done several LDoN with my GSoT (now with the Anger Aug) and not really had any problems with ping pong early agro over what I had experienced before.  Incite + good 'ol taunt seems to work out to be enough to hold agro and the 2 hander seems to have the extra DPS (you mention using it as a DPS weapon as well) to get the job done.<br />
<br />
It seems along the lines of the discussion about using the GSot4W + AngerIII as your main agro weapon http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5308<br />
<br />
Anyway, this reply is getting a bit long so there ya go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">noticeable<br />
I won't disagree with that, obviously it's something you're going to notice; and I'm not trying to argue that 2handers aren't viable options aggro-wise - My only point is that I think riposte damage should be less of a major decision-making factor than it is made out to be under similar circumstances to mine.<br />
<br />
In MY situation tanking the mobs that I tank (BoT giants, the occasional tower boss, PoV trash, ToV:HoT dragons, LDoN:Normal, etc) the aggro I maintain with my DW setup outperforms my 2H setup to a degree that the extra riposte damage is not an issue that affects my groups' playstyle. Or in other words:<br />
<br />
Riposte damage with 2H &gt; Riposte damage with DW<br />
My aggro with 2H &lt; My aggro with DW<br />
<br />
The end result of having greater aggro &gt; The end result of taking more riposte damage<br />
Without question...<br />
In my situation.<br />
<br />
I also think that riposte damage is often overexaggerated and may sometimes lead to erroneous weapon choices. (Not you personally =-p)<br />
<br />
I don't mean to imply anything else =-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Over the weekend I picked up a Sword of the Bloodsworn augmented with Anger II in the bazaar for 20k (gotta love FV).  Anyway, gave it a spin, SoBS main/CHoS (with a wimpy 50DD proc aug) offhand, in HoH Basement last night.  Grouped with 65 necro, 57 shammy, 61 pally, 57 bst, 65 Cleric. Haste was 31% + Celerty.<br />
<br />
The DW combo was enough to hold agro from the shammy trying to slow the majority of the time (maybe lost it 1-5 or 6 times).  He rarely would get slow to land on the first shot due to level, so there was usually at least 1 resist before slow landed.  In that regard, I was very pleased.  <br />
<br />
However, the combo would lose agro to the DoT'ing necro further down in the fight, nearly every fight.  The dual wield didn't seem to generate the hate to keep up with the massive DoT damage the necro was doing, likely due to lagging behind in DPS.  I would see the mob take off after the necro, even after several stun and hate procs.  I even lost agro the the BST a couple of times, which frankly surprised me.  <br />
<br />
In terms of Riposte, at 7k buffed the riposte damage of HoH mobs is fairly insignificant.  I'm sure there were a few more per fight, but I was avoiding and mitigating well anyway, so it was not a concern.<br />
<br />
Switched to an unaugmented GSoT to compare.  Again, the slower got very little agro (except for one time where they slowed earlier than normal).  The necro still was able to grab agro late in the fight, but it seemed to happen less often - there were more fights where I went straight from pull to kill without any agro loss.  Didn't lose agro to bst at all.  However, on the fight where the shaman got slow agro very early, I struggled to gain agro back quickly, and he ended up needing a heal before I could get the mob back on me.  That did not occur with the dual wield setup, as I usually either got a successful taunt or one of my 3 hate procs to go off before the shaman needed a heal.  <br />
<br />
Overall, it was interesting for me to see how well the GSoT performed unaugmented vs. the Droga weapons, one with Anger II and one with a 50DD augment.   As much as I hate to admit it (since wielding a GSoT gets me no hotties), I'm pretty convinved I'll be going GSoT+Anger III.  A Droga dual wield setup would likely need Anger III in each, or possibly a combo of Anger III and Ykesha augs, to compete with a GSoT+Anger III in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
As for a GBoS+CHoS combo, I'd expect a GBoS to be somewhat better than a SoBS due to better damage, which might tip the scales when comparing vs. a GSoT.</div></div><hr />

Thats 1200 mini hate points a minute.<br />
<br />
We still dont know how much hate Damage is worth, but if it is even close to 1 to 1 that is the equiv of having Anger III on your main hand weapon...<br />
<br />
Take it for what it is worth, since no one can figure out how much real impact DPS has.<br />

I only do High Adventures and BoT towers.  I have enough LDON points to buy my a weapon but Im torn drastically.<br />

- Time Worn Blade 40/35 + anger3 2hs<br />
- Steelcrown War Mace 37/32 + anger3 2hb<br />
- Club of the Mad Researcher 17/20 +anger3 1hb (will off hand the CHoS)<br />

In my situation with the places I hunt, what is the suggestion on weapon?<br />

I do not raid, I one group only, and I spend my time with hard hitters (ldon high's and tower mobs).  I just want the mob on me from start to finish.  Group always has a wizard and enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
41/31 +Anger3 2hb is going to be better than either of the 2 handers you have available from LDoN and you could then spend the LDoN points on say upgrading your Vindi BP to a kick ass full augged Tak BP?<br />

<br />
Agro wise it depends.  In most cases the GSoT seems to equal or exceed the DW combo.  However, in some groups - especially in LDoN - I'll occasionally have initial agro problems with the GSoT and end up switching to DW.  For raid tanking I always use GSoT and I've never had a problem holding agro (limited raiding experience...but I have tanked BoT towers.)<br />
<br />
Anyway...some more things to think about...:p</div></div><hr />
