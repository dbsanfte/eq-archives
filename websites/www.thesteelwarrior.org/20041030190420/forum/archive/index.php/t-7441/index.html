<br />
Not too sure about that.  I've never owned a CHSD, but I do know TB is 450 hate.  I used to own a GBoS and Vyd`dras RoS, which I a2'd. 450 vs 400 hate isn't much different, but compared to the GBoS's main proc, I noticed a substantial difference.  I then got a BoC, which I A3'd, along with GBoS, and spent a few hours switching between GBoS and BoC, and found them very similiar in aggro.  If I had to rate it, i'd rate GBoS's aggro equivalent to BoC, but definately above a CHSD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">GBoS is not gonna be equal in aggro to a BoC.

If you A3 both weapons, you will still end up with the same 600 aggro advantage of the BoC, but since both weapons will be pumping out a lot more aggro per minute via the anger procs, that 600 aggro is not as large a percentage as it would be without the a3 augs.<br />

Ur forgetting the DD portion of Force Struck, 179 DD.  Not saying GBoS is better, I'd prefer a BoC due to slightly better stats and delay, but far as aggro, both are similiar, and even if BoC is slightly higher, its not noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They are indeed very similar aggro from my experience, but my experience with both was prior to GoD and WA5, so in those days you typically only got 1 proc per XP fight. The extra hate of Enraging Blow procs were obvious when they happened, but in between procs the GBoS gave more sustained aggro, which made them a wash over typical XP fights.  Over longer raid-type fights the BoC would eventually pull away from the GBoS after a minute or two. Today with WA5, the BoC's advantage will be more apparent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use a GBoS and I borrowed my friend's BoC and couldn't really tell the difference between them.  Perhaps there is a bit later in the fight after several proc cycles have occured but its really not a big deal at that point since you almost always will have agro locked in by then anyway (barring the action of morons).  WA5 will affect both weapons by the same percentage so it should magnify the differnce but if you get a GBoS then anger 3 aug it, you could basically use anything you want offhand.  GBoS is a lot easier to get and I wouldn't even bother with a BoC unless you loot it or its a gift since the 400k price for one is a waste of plat.  Even a CHoS is so close to a BoC that it really is a better weapon if you consider cost and the difficulty of getting one vs. the difference in agro gained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Ditto. A CHoS is not a BoC, or even in the same class. Yes, it's harder to get, but that's like saying a DBotW is close to a CHoS because it's so much easier to get a CHoS. Doesn't work that way.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know the ppm of a DESB? seems to be higher than average...but maybe its just cause i think the blade is cool hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyways, 18/20 on the DESB is nice...so how does that dmg/delay factor in to total aggro compared to the GBoS, CHoS, and CHSD?</div></div><hr />

I had a hard time telling myself. I use the Stormblade main and GBoS offhand (both Anger auged) and have for a long time now. I only had agro issues against auged BoW's or someone with a BoC, Bloodfrenzy combo. Oh, and the occasional smart*** SK or Pally ;)</div></div><hr />

Here is what I mean:<br />
<br />
If you are in a position where a BoC is an upgrade to you, you can either get a raid together and kill AoW which is difficult for most people where that is actually an upgrade or you can pay 400k for one in the bazaar.  A CHoS costs either a few hours of camping with 2 to 5 friends in Droga or up to 10k in the bazaar for approximately 450 agro per proc.  450 agro per proc @ 10k or 700 agro per proc @ 400k.  Look at it like this-- 400k/700 agro is 571.4 plat per agro point and 10k/450 agro is 22 plat per agro point.  In this respect, CHoS obliterates a BoC.  So basically I am saying that the ease of obtaining a CHoS is a huge part of its total desirability, especially for people who are at the stage of the game where BoC is still considered the best weapon they can reasonably get.<br />

Is a CHoS as good as a BoC for agro?  No.<br />
Is a CHoS as good as a BoC for stats?  No.<br />
Is a CHoS as good as a BoC for DPS?  No.<br />
Is a CHoS a lot easier to get than a BoC?  Definitely.  It is probably a factor of 10 easier.<br />
Is a CHoS a viable alternative for a lot of people?  Yes.  Some people can not afford a BoC or don't have the resources to raid for one.<br />
Is 250 agro per proc worth 390k to you?  That depends on where you are in the game and if you have the extra 390k to blow on a BoC.</div></div><hr />

Ur missing the ENTIRE point of what they're saying dude.. yes CHoS is a viable alternative to BoC, for those who cannot purchase/loot it, but that doesn't mean you say they are equal in any given term.  <br />

If you're racing, and my car can do 100 mph top speed, and it costed me 10k dollars, and ur car can do 150 mph top speed, but it costed 15k dollars, should my finish line be 2/3 the way of yours? No the finish line is the finish line, and the end result is what matters, not how u get there.  The end result is, BoC is superior to a CHoS.<br />
<br />
What I do agree is that CHoS is better bang for the buck, but CHoS's bang isn't as big as a BoC.</div></div><hr />

I think you missed the point not me.  I am saying the finish line is in the same place but I don't think getting to the finish line faster is worth the extra 5000 dollars when you can get there almost as fast for cheaper.  Obviously if you are a race car driver living on the cutting edge this will be different but I hope the prize money for 1st place is more than 5k more than the prize for 2nd place or you just wasted your 5k.<br />
<br />
If you build a house, you can make it out of fir and plywood and nails etc. or you can make it out of hand carved mohagany held together with gold plated titanium screws.  I am sure most people would love to live in the fancy house and it is probably going to last longer, be stronger, and prettier to look at but it is an economic choice after all.  When you go buy a house, ask the architect about making your house from hand carved mohagany with gold plated titanium screws and see what he says it will cost after he stops laughing at you.  By your logic as posted above you have no choice but to go mohagany but for some people fir and plywood works just fine.<br />
<br />
My point is about diminishing returns on an investment.  Sometimes getting the absolute best is not worth the huge price difference you pay for the difference in quality obtained.  Depends who you are and what your situation is of course but everything in the real world does.<br />
<br />
CHoS works well for many people and just because you have/want a BoC doesn't mean anything and it certainly doesn't prove you need a BoC.  Its your choice but I think that the price of a BoC is so rediculous that I wouldn't spend the extra 390k for it.  I even have the 390k and I still think its a waste compared to what you can get for far less.  On the other hand, if I was greedy then perhaps I will go kill AoW with a few friends and sell the BoC to someone who thinks it isn't ok to have anything other than the absolute best no matter what the cost.  /sigh<br />

  If I ever see you say this again, I'm putting you on ignore. Seriously. This entire board is around proving, disproving, fact finding, EQ and arguing. There's pointless bickering, and if that's what you mean then I agree. But arguing over a game is NOT pointless, it's fun and useful. <br />

<br />
  The key is that a BoC is considerably better aggro than the Droga weapons. Heck, Gnoll Hide Lariats are pretty decent aggro weapons and are extremely cheap. It's about 400 aggro per proc at what, 5pp? That's incredibly more efficient money/aggro ratio than the Droga weapons. The point is that you should always maximize aggro when possible, because if you don't have the aggro, nothing else you're wearing really matters. Droga weapons are ok, but a BoC is better. Better DPS, better aggro proc, better stats. I'm not advocating selling all your droppables and trying to save for one, but it's a completely different breed from a CHoS.</div></div><hr />

I said it because I think I made my point and had nothing more to say on it.  I wasn't trying to be a dick and if I came off like that I apologize.  While I agree with you on the fact that a little bit of argueing is important to hash out ideas, I really don't see the point in continueing it after a few posts if a person made thier position clear to the best of thier ability which is the case here for me.  Some people will babble on ad nauseum for 40 pages if you say something that challenges their opinion and I don't think that is worth the effort so I won't respond more than a few times.  I think I am right but thats just me so if you don't agree that is fine but I won't waste anymore time on it because I really don't think there is much more that can be said on it to strengthen my case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd say a BOC is noticably better than a gbos on mobs that stand up awhile.Just imho.BOC&gt;GBOS/CHSD/CHOS.All close enough to pong aggro alot and all good enough to do the job in a lot of cases though.O er and umm double edged stormblade doesn't rank here hehe.Again just imo. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Why does Double Edged stormblade not rank? the dmg/delay factor of a double edged stormblade is great if not awesome at 18/20 (cold dmg is 1).  Sure the innate proc is a 150 nuke w/ no stun but i think the weapon has a higer innate proc rate than average 2ppm. I don't even have ambidexterity yet the &quot;wrath of wind&quot; proc goes off several times per fight in offhand (I do have WA3). I have BoC mainhand. Both the BoC and DESB have A3 so I cant tell you how much the A3 goes off on the DESB, but I can tell you that I noticed a huge jump in procs after switching out my fabled yak for the DESB. I havent used a GBoS yet but I might do a few Blizz raids and get one just to see if aggro is any different. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I guess my point is that you can't really knock a wpn that you haven't tried for yourself....I have no problems tanking w/ my current setup in hard LDoN's, Raids, or normal exp groups.</div></div><hr />

No, it doesn't have a higher innate proc rate than average.  And even if it did, that would not affect an Anger 3 augment.<br />
<br />
Some DPS weapons have serviceable aggro (generally 2 handers).  Pure DD proccing 1 handers do not.  They're decent compromises once augmented, but they have little aggro of their own: Agnarr's stormblade, Jiva's sword, Bert's fist, GRMK, etc.<br />
<br />
And while I knock these weapons, I speak from experience: my mainhand weapon is a Rotting Fist with Anger 3, and my guild does just fine with me main tanking everything in Elementals less than the gods.  But I have no illusions that it is equivalent to a BOC.  It's close, yes, but it's not equivalent.</div></div><hr />

GBoS is close to BoC aggro wise..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think people generally overrate the effect (Force Shock) that GBoS has. For one, it can be resisted like most procs other than anger. Secondly, Force Shock is not a Stun. It is an interrupt. That means that the universal ~400 aggro or whatever peeps think a stun is equivalent to is not really on this weapon. I would assume that if a TRUE stun like that on DBotW or GSoT is ~400 aggro, then the partial stun/interrupt on the GBoS is less (maybe 200 or so). So really, comparing GBoS (14/18 weapon w/ it's proc) and a DESB (18/20 wpn w/ it's proc) are much closer than you might think. I get slightly bothered when people ignore the fact that DAMAGE = HATE. Hence...if either weapon had no proc the Stormblade would be much more aggro. <br />
<br />
Just a couple things to think about before waving off the Stormblade as a complete non-aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />

2:  Stun(0.00 sec) <br />
 <br />
You see that stun right there? That = same aggro as any other stun = about 400-450. So a GBoS proc is stun aggro + aggro from dd. GSoT proc is only stun aggro. Therefore GBoS proc &gt; GSoT proc<br />
<br />
And X damage is nowhere near X hate, so if you try to maintain aggro by using purely dps weapons, there is nothing to stop rogues/rangers/casters from taking 95% of the beatings that should be directed at you.</div></div><hr />

Because that is what message I get from stuns on both the Fabled Yak and GSoT when I used to use them. If the GBoS displays one of these messages, then I will agree with whomever says the GBoS has a TRUE stun as an effect rather than a partial stun / interrupt.</div></div><hr />

Stuns are considered ~450 hate(I believe it has a bit of a variance imo). DD, wether resisted, critted or partially resisted, creates the same aggro.  179 + 450 = 629 vs 700(EB). GBoS is slightly better ratio than BoC.  Neither have proc mod, so unless you want to get nick picky, GBoS and BoC are similiar in aggro.  Thats from my experience.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ragulog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This isnt about GBOS or CHSD but i didn't want to start a new thread so i thought id post it here. Would a Wavecrasher with a CHOS be better or CHOS and Sotb be better aggrowise?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't rank Furo because unauged it's not a aggro weap.The a3 aug makes it viable like almost anything with a3 on it.So it's the wrong place to start.This board is full of good weapon suggestions to use for aggro.Auging one of those is better than just trying to mend the deficiency of a weapon without an aggro proc.My sa uses the stormblade with an a3 aug and it works fine for him.It's less aggro than his chsd with a3 would have been though because he would have had two aggro procs firing.He can do the job though and likes the look and dps etc.Dps has an impact ,but, it's small in comparison to an extra hate proc.Take one of those without an aug and compare it to an unauged GBOS and i'll bet the differance will be plain.As mentioned atm resists matter not for proc aggro.I tanked in kael-Vindi,AOW,etc with CHOS in main getting resisted and aggro was good.It's just nfo for new readers here tho.If you like it and have invested an a3 aug already enjoy it.It's almost an unauged BOC it'll do the job fine.<br />
<br />
I disagree that a GBOS is = to a BOC.For a long time I tanked beside warriors with BOC's,GBOS,CHSD,Blackout ect has mainhanders.I believe weapons like the CHSD (i main handed one till my bf dropped) and the GBOS(tank below me in order mainhanded this or his CHSD)are very close in aggro production not far above a CHOS.The BOC is superior  EB &gt; forceshock.Don't get me wrong the GBOS is a great weapon imo,a little stronger than weapons of similiar proc strength due to ratio,but, less than a BOC.All these weapons are close enough that they will draw aggro off each other due to the rng.On a raid mob the BOC enjoys an disticnt advantage over time tho.<br />
<br />
Obviously, some warriors have a differant perspective on thier experience with these weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Let's just hope that they patch in the removable aug thing. I would hate to do 20 or so more LDoN's to build up an A3 aug for a GBoS instead of 10AC augs or 40hp augs that i need badly.<br />

--As a side note, is it worth it to spend 9 points in ambidexterity over 10 points for WA5? I am at this critical junction atm and I don't plan on having BoW any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">WA-5 is much greater aggro boost than Ambi.It's the best aa for aggro(well with ae taunt hehe)hands down imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WA = 30 AA, Ambi = 9. I agree, just you're not comparing fairly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I think he'd be better off with 10 points in wa-5 than the 9 in ambi.In any case wa-5 is a must get aa on a higher order than ambi I'd say and a more worthwhile invetment.I held out from doing ambi before my BOW dropped and still don't have it.However,my answer stands whatever way you would like to compare it Romul hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">ambi and wa dont even begin to compare as per aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
WA is the single best aggro increasing aa out there.  it is godly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Well then i guess that sort of settles it thank you. So then, after WA5, which is my next target, should i get Ambi or AE taunt + hasted AE taunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Well, if you might possibly be tanking on switches in raids nothing including wa will beat ae taunt.Ae taunt is like magic and most warriors do well to get this early in their aa development.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Thanks for advice, Gun<br />
<br />
Also, I'm sure this has been asked a billion times on this forum yet I am too lazy to seek the answer...but....Does anyone know the actual Proc Percentage increase of Each WA level?<br />
<br />
And if so, is it constant? i.e. does WA 1 = 5% and WA 5 = 5%? Or, is it scaled ?<br />
<br />
----thanks -----</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">the common usage is 10%   per rank of WA (thus it gives from 10%  to 50%  increase in the chance to proc) even if there if a big %  of variation because of the rand which is even more odd than taunt.<br />
however the threat in the library  about WA and CE from Torrin will give more details.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5656<br />
and this one http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5656 is about proc order and its factor in the chance to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Well then i guess that sort of settles it thank you. So then, after WA5, which is my next target, should i get Ambi or AE taunt + hasted AE taunt?<br />
<br />
AE Taunt is a given warrior AA. You should have that after Defensive/HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Should I also get the hasted AE taunt? or are others more important after you get the base AE taunt?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't recommend hasted AE myself, other stuff to get as a warrior, ie: weapon affinity, fero/pb etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Furo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Ok i made magelo link....and spent the 5 pts on AE taunt.</div></div><hr />
