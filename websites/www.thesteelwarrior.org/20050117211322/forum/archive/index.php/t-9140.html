<br />
I'm not too familiar with Veksar or the certain spawns/camps but he spawns near the where the dragon spawns.  He's got some adds in his room, once pulled he stays put, he will not roam back to his room.  You can pull him to zone in, but he gates.  He wasn't trackable from zone in for a druid.<br />
<br />
Easy fight though, a guild paladin solo'ed him for about 50% after he gated and summoned (pally died when Galuk was at 1%).  Probably take three decently equip'ed people.   Also, he's undead so slays will land on him.<br />

If it only takes 2 or 3 people, I may just go do it to check if I can loot it.  If I can, I'll post back here</div></div><hr />

This will easily turn into a huge mess if alot of people end up on the same step (highly likely).<br />
<br />
Since you cant loot stuff beyond your flag progress you can't progress any further then this step either so you just have to sit and twiddle your thumbs waiting on repop and hope that you get him.<br />

So please make these two steps triggerable.</div></div><hr />

   Did Girplan Devourer Sunday. An old guildy who is now in a more raiding type guild was looking for help and I was in Scar with the Shambot collecting my drops.  Well I never bothered to ask beforehand but after wiping once with 9 toons, and getting a few more and finishing off the Devourer, he couldnt loot the drop. And none of us knew any other warriors ready for that step so as far as I know it ended up rotting.</div></div><hr />

Can't believe people are bitching about this... waiting on one or two mobs respawn is NOT the end of the world people.  FFS think of how many spawns we had to deal with on the first one compared to this one.  This quest is much, MUCH easier then the old one.  Sheesh, just be happy... give an inch and want a mile I swear.</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried the book yet.  If it's up today before raids, I'll go kill it and check.  I'm on an underpopulated server, but the Veksar guy has still been perma-killed by others.</div></div><hr />

Seriuosly - its not like theres loot on him that can be farmed.  He's a bottleneck, and one that doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense to have this kind of respawn time on.</div></div><hr />

Having to do the quest in order will create a much larger line for Epic 1.5 because people wont be able to do something else while waiting for spawn xxx.<br />

well Kilzalot I actually went through this crap with the original epic so kindly refrain from the &quot;takes a mile&quot; BS.  Its beyond exasperating if this is true.<br />
<br />
If it is a spawn every ~2.5 days then that = ~146 epics possible per calendar year (which seems like alot but if you factor in warrs plus twinks on a server basis I assure you it is not). That is called rationing...it this the EXACT same BS that was done with the original epic (rationing being Sev in that case).</div></div><hr />

We were given a vague loc of near shopkeeper, so I took my group there.  We bumped into a ranger who needed help with his epic spawn (highborn area) so we helped him kill A____ Highborn and then he tracked towards Galuk Drek for me.<br />
<br />
So I can at least narrow it down as being between the area where the ranger epic mob spawns and the Decaying Slavemaster, closer to the Slavemaster.<br />
<br />
However, I was also told that he likes to wander, aggro on people and corpse camp (while I suspect this is less of a problem now, it may mean that the Slavemaster spot is not his natural spawn area and he may have been dragged there).</div></div><hr />

I used the verbal description given on Allak, took a rogue down there and explored, decided that I had found the place described and was correct.  It wasnt easy because I wasnt familiar with the zone but I became familiar, ran around everywhere until i knew I could reach him in a couple minutes.  We took him at spawn point, but he can be pulled to zi, only problem is if he gates.  When I found him up I had logged in the rogue in to check and he was not up.  So I logged off, did something on the web and right before I was headed to bed for the evening logged in the rogue again on a lark and found him up.  Luck.<br />
<br />
Someone had posted 2 days +/- 12 hours.<br />
<br />
Based on a recent patch I had determined that 7pm on the evening in question was -12.  I would need to check log but the mob actually spawned at ~1am or at -6, 42 hours after patch.</div></div><hr />

Excellent point.  The spawn time on this mob is retarded.  It also pretty much guarantees that those of us who raid a lot and are in mandatory raid attendance guilds will not see him because we cant sit on our asses in Veksar for 3 days in a row. <br />
<br />
Hey SoE: Make him triggerable.  Questing is fine.  Sitting on your butt for 3 days, much less fighting other people for the camp that have to do the same thing, is not only not fun, its ridiculous.  Crap like this is the reason people get sick of EQ and leave.</div></div><hr />

Basically, although it's normally a 3-day spawn, it spawns when you zone in if you're at the right point in the quest, or within 2 hours if it was recently killed.<br />

I am at that step, I check Galuk Drek 2-3 times per day each time I stay about 1-2 hours at spaw point, and I can say 100% sure that doesnt work =(<br />
Maybe they fix it soon.<br />

The server crashed (came down without notice/unexpectedly) this morning at around 2:30AM I was told and he doesn't respawn on server up (or no one has claimed they've killed him) and the server also crashed yesterday at some point. So if the server keeps crashing  we won't proceed to our next step of our epic unless they change this mob.<br />

One guy logged in and tried to convince me the mob was killed earlier, ironically at the 36 hour mark.

I deleted my Kunark epic Scabbard container before LoY came out to make bank space, so Korbuk made me do the pre-quest. After getting over being annoyed by that, I had FUN working on the pre-quest, and FUN working on this quest itself... until the Elf wench in FV sent me to get her book back from Galuk Drek, and now I've been stuck here for a few days and facing many more, and so now this quest is about as fun as a malignant colon tumor. Sorry SoE, but I don't see how ruining everything is fun.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of /feedback on this sillyness, will start doing that now as well. I don't know of any other 1.5 quest that requires that you wait days for an ultra-rare random spawn that is not triggered nor up on zone reset, so I don't see why it shouldn't be fixed.</div></div><hr />

I did Galuk yesterday.  When I zoned in I got one of those screen messages saying that he was up and waiting for me.  Not sure how long it took my group to move in to get to him, but it was likely a bit longer than 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />

At any rate, you get a message something like this &quot;Galuk Drek has sensed your presence..... he is waiting for you!&quot; when you zone in and are at the correct step. Caught a few of the local seq mule trackers offguard.</div></div><hr />
