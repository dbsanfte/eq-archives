<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree, no transfers at all.<br />

And I like the way the name is being chosen, nice to see you care Absor :)<br />
<br />
Btw, someone hook him up with a custom title.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes they are thinking about no absolutely no transfers.  It would be so cool.  Having bronze or crafted armor again will be uber.  LOL I missed this part of EQ I started playing EQ almost a year ago.  I for one will create and probably make my new home on this server if they allow no transfers at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It would be cool if they start out the server from day 1 then progress to present state.<br />
<br />
What I mean that for the first month or two they only enable Orginal EQ then enable Kunark then velious then luclin and so forth.  This will allow new players to experience EQ from those that were playing from day 1.  They can call the server Renansance (sp?) or something like that.  Imagine it how much fun it would be it would slow down the leveling progression so that you won't have level 60's in a month and old zones suchs as Blackburrow, Unrest, Oasis and etc will be utilized more.  If they could do this they should I think alot of people would go for it.</div></div><hr />

*agree*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">good idea, but i think their are so many spoiler sites experanced players. that everyone will know what to do and what drops where. sure you may be lvl 1 with no way to twink, but you know wher and what to do to get stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brolie Paragus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">good idea even with the spoiler sites gives them an idea what needs a revamp to space out the player base a little so we dont have the 50 lvl 1 people lfg in mm like we used to have with 50+ in velks months back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Previn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I really like the idea.  For people who WANT to be on the high end of their server (if they dont allow transfers to new server), but started to late in the game, it gives them a chance to be tops.  You all probably know one, a guy who WANTS to be high end badly, and works hard at trying to be, but opportunities just arent as open as they were.  Case in point, flags are annoying as cr*p ;p  And by the time a person reaches the requirements to join the big guild, they usually change the requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started on TP when it first opened as a non-split server.<br />
It took 3 weeks for the first one to reach 60.<br />
After 3 months guilds had already taken out the gods and was rushing through ToV.<br />
<br />
Transfers after 6 months do not speed up a servers progression.<br />
Players created on the server will be way ahead of the transfered ones.<br />
<br />
If Sony could limit the game world with expansions and so, then it would actually make a difference.<br />
I have seen it done on the New Dawn servers, so it seems like a possible solution.</div></div><hr />

This will allow new players to experience EQ from those that were playing from day 1.  <br />
<br />
Apparantly you weren't around in EQ's youth.  I'll fill ya in on my experiences.<br />
<br />
First of all, you're NEVER gonna bring back the magic that EQ had when it came out.  The completely immersive world, the night blindness terror that came when you were out in the east commonlands killing little spiders when a young kodiak walked by and killed you in 3 hits, you're never gonna bring back the mystique of seeing your first hill giant, your first griffon, your first quested item, etc.  It's all old news, and making a server with just original EQ on it wouldn't bring that back.  People still know how to get to the tunnel from Freeport, people still know how to get to Freeport from Qeynos (my first trip from Freeport to Qeynos took me almost 2 hours), you're not going to experience anything, except what I describe next.<br />
<br />
Complete and utter frustration.  You can level in about 2 places at any level.  People don't go to places like Mistmoore and guktop and befallen because NO ONE WENT THERE FROM DAY ONE.  Oasis is easier.  North Karana is easier.  West Commonlands is easier, South Ro is easier.<br />
<br />
And when you get to 35, hah, you're screwed now.  If you can't solo, you're going to guk or sol B and you're sitting LFG at the zone in with 30 other people, 100 people in the zone and there's a group every few feet in the dungeon.  If you can solo, you're screwed too.  You're typically not a group friendly class for dungeons, so you're FORCED to solo.  No one gives a crap about a druid or a necro in guk, and if you think they do, you're wrong.  You now HAVE to solo.  But what can you kill in the old world at 35?  Well, you can go to Rathe mountains and race to hill giants with about 60 other people completely decimating the zone, or if you're good, you can kill the tree Spectre in the feerott every 6 minutes until it goes green at 48.  If you're evil and don't mind the faction hit, you can kill some barbarian guys in West Karana.  You can also kill druids in WC and EC until about 42.  AND THAT IS IT.<br />
<br />
How many people does it take to camp those spots?  About as many people as are on EQ on my city block right now....not many.<br />
<br />
Reverting the game to original EQ wouldn't make anything &quot;magical&quot; again.  It would make everything suck complete and total ass, AGAIN.  If you got over level 35 before Kunark came out, you KNOW what i'm talking about, and you remember the agonizing run to guk to see if you could find a group, and then when that didn't work, you had to run all the way to Sol B to check there...usually without SOW, usually without a port because all the druids were at the solo spots I mentioned above.  The game was not fun.  If you weren't around back then, believe me, it sucked.  And if you were, I don't know how you can possibly think that's a move in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have to agree with Haass.  Limiting it to nothing but expansionless EQ at the start would just be frustrating.  I haven't forgotten the group lists in Highkeep from level 21 to 35 because it was the best place to xp at those levels in the game.  Thankfully kunark came out at about the time I hit my low thirties so I was able to xp some in dalnir and kaesora too. (just had a really hard time travelling to those zones with no jboots and no way to sneak/hide/invis/root/feign/outrun my way out of a nasty spot. (damned drachnids)  If it hadnt been for that I'd have gotten to experience the same frustration in guk that I did in Highkeep.   When the game was younger there was a certain mystique about things that are now mundane and trivial, but going back to the way things were would be too big an adjustment.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">&quot;make a necro or shaman if you dont want to have to pay for KEI.&quot;<br />
<br />
KEI won't exist on the new server for at least a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Which is what I think he was getting at ... that casters without the C3 in bazaar crutch to fall back on, become less appealing an option on a new server like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Being a newb is so easy nowadays.<br />
<br />
The armor quests deck you out real nice and rats drop things that sell for a full pp.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for people being weary of starting new casters, you all are nuts. Its going to be easier to be a caster now too because they do not have to hunt for rare spell drops ( you can research most 60 and below spells now ), every caster has their own form of mana regen from a spell, and focus effects are easy were retro fitted on a lot of gear from every era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">yeah on haass's point think about how much LGuk will be camped....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in EQ Beta, but used Win NT and never got EQ working, so I stayed in UO a bit longer than most of my friends from there. I came to EQ because my friends did, and it has been fun, but see no reason to leave them now.<br />
<br />
It's nice to see an SOE rep post here on our board. I would love to see them reply to some of our longstanding concerns. IF they aren't going to &quot;fix&quot; them, at least tell us so we don't foster any false hopes.  SOE's refusal to respond is bordering on abuse.<br />
