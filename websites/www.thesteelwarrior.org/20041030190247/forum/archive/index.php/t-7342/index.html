<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There's now 3 new pieces of gear on adventure merchants.  Breastplate of Rage (pretty much same stats, except saves altered and 5 more hp and 5 less mana...makes it a 105hp BP), Greaves of Rage (same changes as BP I believe) and Bracer of Rage (no changes from Tak bracer that I could see.<br />
<br />
They're all 1492, but you don't need points in a specific adventure to get them.  They're purchaseable at any camp.  There's also a bunch of Paroxysm gear at each camp for 1492 (non-visible armor), some of which look like other pieces of gear from the specific camps.<br />
<br />
Oh, and there's 3 or so new Type 8 augs (+20 atk, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm wondering if there is a silk counterpart to the plate pieces. Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Woo! new bp for me tonight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think there's armor for each type...Beastlord boards are reporting leather versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are silk versions as well. <br />
<br />
You need to be able to SEE the 1492 armor on an adventure merchant in order to buy the armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aint that nice considering i just got a tak bp a couple weeks ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">apparently its not supposed to be live accordign to the developers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All the new gear (limited to the 3 different slots pieces, and available to each armor type) costs 1492 points .... with NO theme restriction  for purchase.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, the 'new' armors are almost the SAME as the high end LDoN armors except for a minor swap of a couple stats on each piece.<br />
<br />
Example: Royal Attendant BP (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44305) , and the new one [with stat differences in ()]<br />
<br />
Breastplate of Rage AC 69  STR 4 (+4) STA 12 (-1) CHA 10 (-1) WIS 9 (-1) INT 9 (-1) HP 105 (+5) MANA/END 95 (-5) FR 9 (+9) CR 9 (-3) MR 6 (-6) PR 12 <br />
<br />
Shop smart is all i got to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's a post on the EQ boards from a developer saying these items were not supposed to go live yet and they will be removing them with the next update.<br />
<br />
Also, the stats may change when the finally do go live - so buy now at your own risk  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haha, post-patch<br />
<br />
Breastplate of Rage AC 29 AGI 105 HP -10</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The developer also said that if you have already purchased an item then you will be able to keep it.<br />
<br />
As Abynormal777 said, the stats may change when the finally do go live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was kind've annoyed, since similar to a previous poster, I had just bought the RA BP a few weeks ago...and IMO, the BP of Rage is actually better for pure melee...not better enough to be worth another 1492 points, but after forcing friends to spend so much time in NRo theme to get BP and then a new unthemed version becomes available with mariginally better stats is frustrating to say the least.  I would gladly trade all +100 mana for the 5 measly hp and the few other odd stat increases (str, more resist types, etc.).<br />
<br />
    I was hoping perhaps they would let us trade in the old BP for the new BP and came here to find that out...but looks like it's just another big blunder by SONY.  Now, what I don't understand is how they could let people keep the new armor if they don't think it should be in game yet.  Just replace it with the themed version if shouldn't be in game or something....better than post-nerfing stats to those who already bought and may be in for a big surprise later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is an example of the drawbacks of LDoN.  Those points are gone gone gone once you spend 'em.  <br />
<br />
With my guild getting into VT soon, I'm being very careful about where I spend my points and am leaning more to avoiding LDoN entirely.  I've got an aug'ed out Tak BP which I put around 3000 points into.  It will piss me right off to take it off and get nothing for it if/when I improve on it.  <br />
<br />
Wish you could even get back some of the points you spent on this stuff.  Its great for folks to build good gear when they're in guilds that aren't going to get them into spots with dropable gear of comparable quality.  It really really sucks when you're at the stage I'm in now.  Sink a huge amount of time into a piece of gear only to see as good or better drop next week when your guild kills a new mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there must be a reason why there are Type 8 only augs in LDoN...but from the links I've seen in GoD, I'm not sure why, atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Type 8 augs are for equipment obtained from Plane of Time, Time-level LDON raids, and Kod'Taz and later in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It would be nice if they'd let us sell augments and items back to the adventure merchants for a return of say, half the points we originally paid for them.  Hell, 25% of the points would be better than nothing.  I guess we can always bank the stuff for CR gear at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you haven't already, I suggest adding this comment to the Brenlo thread on the SoE boards (forget the exact location...I can find it if you want...just resond to this thread if you need a link.)  I already added the comment once, but it would be good if they saw it from a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This point was brought up during the open forum at the most recent Vegas Fanfaire and the developers seemed favorable and agreed to consider it. <br />
I wouldn't hold my breath tho...<br />
<br />
----------edit below-----------<br />
<br />
however, the auto-inventory bank feature was also brought up at Vegas and we just got that, so who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I hope they look at this blunder with the eye of tak1 bp and tak2 bp.  Different stats, but they both can co-exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know that...but if you look at the augments that drop in GoD raids, etc. and compare the them to the augments obtainable from LDoN...it doesn't make a lot of sense.  The people who will ahve Type 8 slots will 90% be in a large raiding guild and will thus goto GoD raids and get the augments there.  If you compare the stats on the high end GoD augments versus LDoN, there is no reason for high end folks to do LDoN except perhaps farming hards for selling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i dont understand all this talk about people bummed out because they cant sell no drop stuff from ldon. you cant sell no drop stuff from ANYWHERE. so you have to watch where you spend your ldon points? you also have to watch what no drop item you obtain from anywhere else. whats the difference. and people complain that its a blunder on sony's part that they upgrade the ldon vendor item lists just after weve bought something. they do that with time gear too and with every other type of gear. i just dont see what people are complaining about.<br />
<br />
and its not limited to game. you can spend 30000 dollars on a new car this month and a few months from now some car company might release a new car model that you just drool over. its a way of life. get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">and its not limited to game. you can spend 30000 dollars on a new car this month and a few months from now some car company might release a new car model that you just drool over. its a way of life. get used to it. <br />
<br />
  And then you trade your old car in for a new one. Or sell it to someone. You don't just stick it in your garage and buy a new one with the old one running just fine. <br />
<br />
  People complain about LDoN point refunds, because frankly it took a long, long time to get that upgrade. Finding out there is going to be a new, better addition AFTER they spent their points sucks. They don't want to have to grind out another 25ish missions. No drop stuff in other zones very, very rarely take as much online time as LDoN gear; the two are definitely different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I hate no drop, they really should just do-away with it.  Put min levels on all gear and if they have to have nodrop make it guild no-drop but tradeable within a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I hate no drop, they really should just do-away with it.  Put min levels on all gear and if they have to have nodrop make it guild no-drop but tradeable within a guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
I LOVE this idea. Wish they had set it up like this from the beginning. Minimum levels for every item, and nothing no drop except special things (maybe various quest rewards, GM event items, special promos, etc. Too many items to revisit at this point, so I doubt we will see this happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">what ive wanted for years is do away with recommended levels make everything tradeable and then add two rules. 1) corpses are never lootable by anyone who didnt get experience for the kill. 2) once an item is equiped for the first time it becomes irrevocably no drop. hence items are tradable only until the first time they are used. <br />
<br />
this eliminates second hand gear. it eliminates flooding of the markets with cheap twink gear. it prevents level 1s from vulturing high level zone no-drops. it ALSO prevents farming of greens. it also screws up a lot of quests including all the epics which makes it problematic to implement.  but if that last problem can be solved it would be a nice system.<br />
<br />
one thing i can say in favor of ldon points though. they sure prevent groups from squabbling over who gets to loot what.<br />
<br />
ok my car example was a bad one ... lets change that to &quot;graphics card&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">expounding on my previous post. the reason for recommended levels is to reduce twinking. a worthy concept but not a very effective method. the real problems are a surplus of cash (because at high level most items that would soak up the money are actually no-drop so there is nothing to do with the cash but twink alts) and too much cash in the hands of low end players (putting 100pp tradeskill items on level 10 mobs .. what were they thinking??) which has enabled level 10 players to buy 30/31 weapons (/boggle).<br />
<br />
the economy is messed up by design. or at least it has every appearance that they hardly could have done it worse than they did.</div></div><hr />

&lt;&lt;tradeable within a guild&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
guild officers will dominate the bazaar since they can invite and then disband in order to make a trade with absolutely anything.<br />
<br />
make a 6 month membership requirement?<br />
<br />
...gives guildleaders enormous blackmailing power.<br />
<br />
it also might lead to the destruction of the guild system as we know it as &quot;superguilds&quot; form. there will be two ways to qualify for an invite to such a guild. high level .. or  ... lots of cash. i only have 700k in cash at the moment but  could get a lot richer if top of the line items were made tradeable within a super guild.<br />
<br />
its a nice concept it really is. but i think almost no matter how it were implemented the spirit of the concept would be sabotaged by clever players.<br />
<br />
dont get me wrong .. i hate the present system. its so bad its hard to fix and its very hard to think of a system that can be tossed on us at this late date that wouldnt have many unintended side effects.</div></div><hr />

Nah you could implement this pretty easily.  Mark items as Guild NoDrop and the first time anyone with a guildtag equips it, it becomes nodrop for that guild.  If you aren't wearing the guildtag then you cannot equip it.  Pretty simple, easy to do code wise.  The only problem would be if you leave your guild your gear would rather suck, heh heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah...right...I'll put this in the same category a friend of mine a raiding guild had for solving the flagging issue by allowing guilds to automatically flag guild members so they wouldn't have to backflag new members or twinks.  Ideas like this just continue to increase the deliniation between the uber and non-uber players.</div></div><hr />

i suspect you find this funny because you feel very secure within your guild. but your guildleader could walk you on a leash by threatening to disband you if you dont jump when he says jump and bow down to him when he says bow.<br />
<br />
guilds have too much power as it is. why give them the power to strip you of all your best gear anytime they feel like it?<br />
<br />
my last guild was led by a guy who disbanded everyone who missed a midweek late-night raid recently whether online or not online. i think a third of the guild was disbanded in one day. think of the power he would have had if everyone with no drop items lost the ability to equip them that day. this is already the third time ive seen guild leaders do this. the word for it is power-trip and we dont need to encourage this. the original purpose of guilds was that people would group together to fight more effectively. turning them into cartels could not possibly be supported by anyone other than those already on the inside track of one of these cartels.</div></div><hr />

Acutally my guild has about 90% quit eq over the problems so we essentially do not exist any longer.  I just found it funny. :)</div></div><hr />
