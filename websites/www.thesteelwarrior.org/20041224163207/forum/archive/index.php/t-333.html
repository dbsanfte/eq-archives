Any info on where they are and what I need to do in terms of starting them up would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's 4 large buildings in the corners of the zone. In 3 of them the basements have a single red con NPC who is trigger. 4th is undead building in the far back left(Northwest?) corner. It eats ass.<br />
<br />
 To trigger a trial you simply walk up to the red con NPC in the appropriate basement and say &quot;I am ready&quot;. A Custodian of Marr will pop. Hits 900ish, weak mob. Kill it and the trial starts(this was put in to stop single people cockblocking the trials to stop rival guilds).<br />
<br />
 Far back right trial(Northeast?) is the ogre trial. That's what we call it anyways. You sit in the room and some good type NPC's spawn and stand there. Evils start running in from the previous rooms. You kill them. <br />
<br />
 Closest left trial(Southwest?) is the Crazed Norrathians. Similar to ogre one. Except 1 lady spawns in each of the 3 basement rooms and you have to &quot;protect&quot; them all from the hobos. After you clear all the hobo's from a particular room a named spawns. finish all 3 and you win.<br />
<br />
 Closest right trial(Southeast?) is the dragon trial. Rydda`Dar. Looks like Vulak, hits like a truck(2100). Fears. Short range AE dot around MT for 3200 per tick. And I think a slow. Relatively low HP's. Kill it and you win.<br />
<br />
 All in all, if you want decent loot stick to the Crazed trial. All 3 bosses have some pretty fair drops. 100hp/mana type stuff.</div></div><hr />

We call the trials something a little differant though. :D<br />
First one you called the Ogre trial... we call Village People.<br />
Second one we call &quot;Save the Girl&quot; <br />
Third we just call Dragon, or PITA Dragon... LOL That thing is nasty. But the loot from the &quot;Save the girl&quot; is not too bad at all. <br />
The first two are pretty easy when you have a good strat worked out.<br />
The dragon is just plain nasty.<br />
<br />
Zerar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the villager and maiden trial are just an exercise in kiting, decent loot to be had from the maiden trial. normall get 2 items for 10 minutes of work. real effort is getting your raid to the locations as virtually no one knows the zone except enchanters, wizards, and necros - easy to figure out why...<br />
<br />
anyways, post a map and get easy loot !<br />
<br />
dragon trial is just mean(stupid really), fear is almost lure and hes got some mean dps to go with it. at least he drops more than a spectral !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a Fear effect that strong, it almost sounds like Warcry may actually be useful there - or am I puffing up the crack pipe?<br />
<br />
Or perhaps use a Paladin with Fearless as the MT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing the first two trials are not single groupable then.  Obviously the third trial is a full on raid.<br />
<br />
What kind of numbers do you normally take in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are all at least small raid force encounters.<br />
<br />
I would say 24 people min (including Rydda Dar if you use charmed mobs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using charmed mobs was how we did RD before, BUT now that it's nerfed, there really is no way to do that safely. I just know we got lucky on a couple of those dragon runs....<br />
I am just glad that I am pretty much done with HoH and HoHb technically. I never did like xping there, nor dealing with MM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MM would be a lot more fun if the room repops were about 2 mins longer than what they are :D</div></div><hr />
