<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Say get a poll going on all the ideas that are here now. <br />
<br />
after a week delete all threads and make a new thread of &quot;A warriors Demands: Read before posting&quot;<br />
<br />
List out the popular well agreed on things we want to make our class better. <br />
<br />
This way we can have one post the devs can read.. <br />
<br />
once we have enough I say feedback the link in teh dev corner till sombody listens..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm waiting on people to come to agreement on what should be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think we can wait for a concensus, the topics that we've covered just need to be consolidated and stickied.  A big deterant from a dev's point of view when comming here would be sorting through all the posts we have trying to figure out what we want.<br />
<br />
I think a sticky covering the taunt DoT's, increaeed HP's, pass/failure messages on Taunt, Taunt skill cap raised to 250, and more HP and AC needs to be made.  I know it's incomplete, but it would be nice to make it easy to find what we're asking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget NERF pally stuns that is a mustr and I will not give up untill I see it happen I will fuggin camp on SoE's doorstep untill they nerf it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nerfing stuns is not a first choice...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NERFING AGGRO - LOCK, which is completely different.. is what was proposed, stuns are just the easiest way to aggro lock that is abused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah well you have to start somewhere :) get one nerfed then move on to the next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Rade.  Just take all the ideas that have been posted so far, order them so that they make some sort of sense, and sticky them. Furor's ideas for getting +hate attacks, and the ideas for unlinking /disc timers seem to be the most popular, but try and include everything.  (If the druids can ask for rez and slows, nothing here seems that damned unreasonable to me)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would just make a list of ideas that have been put forth, add the disclaimer that they are only ideas, not &quot;demands&quot;, and that some are mutually exclusive.  Divide the suggestions into areas.  Improved and new skills, improved agro, improved durability, improved itemization(maybe), and reducing knight agro.  Not every one agrees with how we should be fixed, but I don't think anyone would mind if we at least put the ideas out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">May not be the best thread to post this in... but I don't see the reasoning to unlinking disc timers? <br />
<br />
When I am SA, I don't use aggressive, because MA can go down any time. In this case, the commend /discreset (Which has been in the help files, but never seems to work) would be better, to cancel the aggressive. Fellstrike doens't add signifcant damage to a raid-level mob, so I rarely use it for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Unlinking disc timers would also let you chain evasive and defenisve... something that would help on raid level targets... not so much on exp groups.<br />
<br />
IMO, the major shortfall of warriors is Aggro on demand... The ability to grab aggro on or near inc in an exp group style mob. And... unlinking disc timers doesn't accomplish that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From the way I see things there are a few basic things that most people agree on. <br />
<br />
#1 Warriors are tanks, I along with most people, don't play for fancy Discs, flashy spells, or anything else, I like to get out there and take a beating better then anyone else around.... Problem?  with Heals, Lifetaps, LoH, Stuns, Dots, Buffs, Etc... Shadowknights and Paladins can take MORE damage then warriors.<br />
<br />
#2 Agro  it is Idiotic to talk about tanking abilities without talking about the ability to get and maintain agro.  What good does it do to have a Warrior in a group somewhere only for the Shaman to Slow the mob and Tank it for the next 30 seconds only for the warrior to finally regain agro as the mob is about to run.  With all the spells and abilities given to SK's Paladins, they can get agro off a Shaman in a couple seconds EVERY time assuming that they didn't have enough agro in the first 2 seconds of the fight that the slow managed to take agro.<br />
<br />
Look I'm not saying the answer is to give Warriors Twice the HP, AC or to make SK/Paladin spells little/no agro but SOMETHING must be found to try and negate some of these differences<br />
<br />
Maybe instead of giving warriors better taunt abilities or tanking abilities give them ways to mitigate other poeples damage permanently...  for instance allow /shield to be an ability you can permanently place on a character, rather then use once every 30 minutes and lasting 3 min.  Think about it... after a few minutes of fighting with someone a even an Ogre Warrior is smart enough to figure out that the Shaman gets agro right after the slow, this way the Ogre is essentially Always on the guard for the shaman, always ready to jump in front of him sacrificing his body in an attempt to deflect blows. this type of more perminant mitigation would give Warriors back that extra nudge without making them any better with tanking holding agro or anything else, and would also in no way hurt Paladins and SKs!</div></div><hr />
