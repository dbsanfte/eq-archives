<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havnt been able to play for a long while. I basically just wanted to know if people have completed this expansion yet, if not, how far off are they?<br />
<br />
Is there a large difference between time and god gear?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know, no one is even close to finishing this expansion. So far, the gear that we have seen from tier 2+ in GoD seems to be on par or slightly better than Time loot. I would imagine that once people break in to the final zones the loot will eclipse Quarm loot by a fair amount.</div></div><hr />

So much hate.<br />
<br />
I just wish Developers would say if shit was straight up broken.<br />
<br />
It's not the fact that it's broken that pisses the playerbase off, it's the fact that we don't know if it is or isn't, and end up banging our heads against walls trying to find out. I don't mind dying constantly to hard, beatable content, but guessing if content is broken or not annoys the hell out of me. I went through this bullshit with Rathe, and here we go again. . .<br />
<br />
Seriously, if I logged in to a patch message stating that Uqua is still being tuned, I would still be mad (since it SHOULD be fixed)-- but not even 1/4 as mad as I was last night after once again, we failed to pass the zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's three hours of my life I'd love to have back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If tier2 is almost on par.. then how many tiers are there? Did beta see the end of expansions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's an item from Lucy with lore that says 'may ward off the effect of the Trushar', wonder if that's related to beating Uqua?<br />
<br />
In its current state I don't see Uqua as doable simply because no one can ever die.  Get rid of the death requirement and it might be doable.  It's not as if the mobs aren't capable of killing you without the instant game over on death.  Heck bring them back to their pre-nerf values (2500+ hitting trash) and get rid of the fail on death deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fuck content that is not beaten on first try, what the hell is going on ?<br />
But I agree on one point, considering the lack of faith in developpers we all have, it would be cool of them to tell us what zone are in beta, and what zones they barely started working on.</div></div><hr />

Drops off zone trash rarely. Equippable by int casters it seems to block the AE, but doesn't decrease the FR nerf. Given the rarity, good luck getting enough of them to actually make a difference.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking either:<br />
a)  It's working as intended, but there's several other unfound progression steps we need to do before reaching the required strength. Kinda like zoning into PoTime the day after entering elementals for the first time and finding it insanely hard. Gearing up on content earlier in the progression being a necessity.<br />
b) The traps and zonewide AE are screwed, just not enough people have gotten there yet to kick up enough of a stink to get it fixed. Think Kod raids 3 and 4, plus the summoner ring.<br />
c) GoD has a rolling cockblock of bugged/untuned content which they leave in until they've finished the next stage (/conspiracy theory!)</div></div><hr />

Hey, retard, did you miss where I said:<br />

<br />
Have you been to Uqua even?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We got to second bend in corridor!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They have made several changes though.<br />
<br />
Oh, and mobs do still hit for 3k+ further in.  Then of course there are the behemoths...<br />
<br />
At least stuff seems killable though.  Except perhaps for the afore mentioned behemoths.   7066.  It still hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The beta test was such a joke for this zone.  Here is what happened from my perspective.<br />
<br />
1) Any player in beta with run speed would crash repeatedly and since dev's gave out aa, nearly half of the testers were made useless. (every zone)<br />
<br />
2) 95% of the raid would crash to desktop upon death THEN the developers were not on the ball enough to world kick ANYONE and any raid with more than 15 deaths would come to a stand still for over an hour while people waited for 1018 to stop, res rebuff.(every zone)<br />
<br />
3) they tried to put in the new engine along with beta testing new content and if you ran into ANYTHING (collision issues) it would throw you 20,000 up into the air and you would have to wait for 3 or 4 min to fall to your death then attempt to CR along with half the server.(every zone)<br />
<br />
<br />
4) with the above problems people didn't want to log on AND no FORUMS to discuss these problems on.  <br />
<br />
For example when uqua was supposed to be tested I sat and waited for 4 hours for people to show up.  4 hours later we have 30 people and between crashing to desktop and comming back we did manage to enter the zone.  We got trained at the zone in by spawning mobs on death and everyone crashed to desktop after death and was 1018 for a half hour.  Then after waiting for a very long time they just decided to call it off,  no thanks for putting up for this no nothing.  It is beta i realize their will be problems,  but that shit is alpha if even that.  What you have on live servers now I wouldn't even call beta quality. <br />
<br />
Now I understand that the developer that was working on uqua now works for another company.  They need to get their ass loged into the test server,  summon a raid force and work this piece of shit out before making any changes.  Do an announcement saying that due to our incompetance the zone is not ready and will not be available untill we have it play tested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So whats the difference when it comes to gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One thing Brutall Failed to mention is that when we tried to play test Uqua in beta at least half of the people there were either betabuffed, or pre elemental toons with no real raiding exp.  In the end I dont think the zone got tested at all.</div></div><hr />
