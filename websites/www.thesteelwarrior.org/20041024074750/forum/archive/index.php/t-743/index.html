<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zetal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking about going this route for quicker epic...<br />
<br />
However, I don't want to fook this up...<br />
<br />
What is the best way? Put Text log ON and have MQ'er give blade to Kargek then I hand in note?<br />
<br />
Should MQ'er have their trade window OPEN when I hand in note?<br />
<br />
Give me some info on this guys..thanks~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">MQ'd one last week.<br />
<br />
I handed in the blade then he handed in the note.  Grats on scabbard.  Just make sure the hand ins are done in the right order and it shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Before the MQ I handed Kargek a bandage which he handed back.  No idea if its true or not, but I have heard that this can clear a record of previous trades.  Would suck to go in following someone else's botched MQ and have the guy doing the first hand in receive the scabbard before the note is handed in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do NOT open your tradewindow when his is open. Make sure he actually hands the item in 1st (and presses Trade), then you hand in your item. Same holds true for all MQ'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've heard turning in an item that they return resets their current trades (like if the wingblade or note is already turned in).  I'm not sure it works, but it might be a good idea just in case.  Have the mq'er turn in the wingblade first (make sure they've clicked trade), then you open your trade window and click trade.  And then you have your scabbard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had someone MQ the blade for me, and it was all in faith. The NPC did not say anythign nor could I read any text indicating it had been done...While doing the turn in I was thinking...hmm, if he ddint click trade, he's getting a scabbard ;)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, only do it with someone you can trust (a reputable guild gives you some comfort) and don't pay everything in advance...I did it post epic.<br />
<br />
Gluck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahomn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do the check with an item the NPC doesn't want, just to play it safe, then have the Person with the blade hand it in first completely... i personally asked for the person i was doing the MQ with to group with me, if he got the scabbard i will see &quot;you gain experience&quot; message. After He had turned in the blade, we stayed grouped and i asked him to move away from the NPC enough to know that he wasn't able to keep a trade window open and i handed in my note.  He/she is benefiting with coin/trade of this item, as much as you are so you both need to respect each other wishes. Freeport bank is reall close so there shouldn't be an issue.... but like someone else said, get some background on them if you can.. more information makes it less stressful..... good luck.  I was fortunate not to have any headaches other than the red blade getting resisted lol<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ranxerex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was wondering if anyone had done a MQ with their ownself, a character on the same account ( involving logging character out, then the other char in to hand in 2nd piece ).<br />
<br />
I have everything for my epics sans Queen blade(haven't went to get yet, no time), and Spiroc Blade(is on my old warrior on the same account).  So if I ever get around to going and killing queen, and getting a blade, do you guys think its possible to log in my old warrior, hand in spiroc blade, sit, camp and log back in my current warrior, and it actually work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I MQ'd gnollslayer between accounts once.<br />
<br />
Spiroc Blade, while riskier shouldn't be any different.<br />
<br />
Just be careful. Get both your toons there near the NPC's before doing anything. Make sure the coast is clear (Freeport's not exactly the newbie hub it used to be, you should be fine, especially if you wait till either really late at night or get up really early in the morn, when populations are low).<br />
<br />
Have a friend come along and stand near the NPC to stand guard. That way if someone does walk up in between logging out and logging back in, your friend can at least TRY to dissuade the person from doing anything until you get back.<br />
<br />
Other than that, good luck.</div></div><hr />
