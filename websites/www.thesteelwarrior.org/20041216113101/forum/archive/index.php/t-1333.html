Other then factioning...do we really need to hit every monster in a radius. Nothing says chanter love, than hitting all the mobs they have mezzed.  How about we change the AA ability to this...<br />
<br />
<br />
Cry of Zek<br />
<br />
Cast by you: &lt;Your Target's eyes fill with rage as they pierced by the Cry of Zek&gt;<br />
<br />
Cast on you: &lt;You are Pierced by the Cry of Zek&gt;<br />
<br />
Re-use Time: 3 min<br />
<br />
Effect: Six second stun and increase hate by 500.<br />

What do you think?<br />

&lt;&lt;EDIT&gt;&gt; Changed the name as people think Banshee was not fitting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use rampage ALL THE TIME.   It's one of my favorite skills.   Any mob that splits on death or at a given time (Think Gindan Flayers, Deadly Armadillos, etc), one rampage at split ensures that your groupmates don't get pasted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angre</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Valeris...now if I could only get all this planning and last minute stuff done so I can get back to gaming. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Frodlin7th, I would agree that rampage is good in a situation like that. However, I would gladly sacrifice it for that skill. I imagine Sony is not going to be free giving of stuff. Maybe if we could get them to just change certain situational things, we could improve the class by leaps and bounds. <br />
<br />
It's kinda the same with warcry. It is really situational too. It is great to have when you are doing ceratin mobs, AD comes to mind, but in a general raid situation you can resist fear with gear and buffs. I would rather trade warcry for say:<br />
<br />
Stoutness of Brell<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
<br />
Level 1 (3 points): 2.5% gain to AC<br />
Level 2 (6 points): 5%    gain to AC<br />
Level 3 (9 points): 10%  gain to AC<br />
<br />
Change those 2 AA skills around and we have just made up a ton of ground on the knight classes and mitigation. Our aggro sucks but even in exp groups, my mob rarely went for the chanter. With a 3min timer of an aggro generating AA, you could easily save a chanter. This would allow a knight to keep what they have and make us a viable choice for exp as well.<br />
<br />
The AC modifer would help us more in raids and also help some folks who can't make it into elemental planes a chance to drastically increase the AC helping to tank better.<br />
<br />
Just some ideas. Feel free to add more. It's finally a civil thread.  :)</div></div><hr />

A way to get around this? Pull a sort of Manaburn idea and make it usable once per mob. It will leave a buff icon on the mob that would wear off in 6 (numbers out of the rear end here!) minutes or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually Bin you have a point :p</div></div><hr />

And think that's a good point Binn.  And we really don't have to give up an existing ability for it if you think about it.  Just adding it to our existing arsenal would go a long way towards making up for all the stuff they've been giving casting classes over the last couple of expansions.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like to be included in AE groups... I know its situational, but why take it away.</div></div><hr />
