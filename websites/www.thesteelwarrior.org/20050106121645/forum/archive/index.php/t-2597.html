<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone.  I'm the guild leader of a small guild on Povar that is just about ready to begin HoT and has also begun taking on more epic mobs.  This being the case I know that we will be fighting more mobs that have some sort of AE, and I know that resists will begin to become more important to us.  Being a small guild most of the resist gear that is attainable for us is bazaar bought, and as such tends to generally mean a reduction in one of the important stats.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  How important are these resists in relation to our core stats?  I guess I'm asking if its worth it to me to lose any number of AC or HP to gain that +8 to my saves.  How important are the resists if you are MT? or ST?  or just plain there beating on the mob?  <br />
<br />
Finally, anyone have an opinion on what a good goal for our resists to be at for these encounters are?  Something I can tell my guild to shoot for?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Damage is damage, and you are going to have a healer watching you full time, so worry about hp's first.  If you are not MA/SA, then get those saves up(runed bone fork + that crown with the saves whose names escapes me this early in the morning are great for HoT).  Always remember when not tanking, if your hp's start getting low, back out till a heal lands.  First few times in HoT are a blast, and you will learn a ton about raiding, have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, have MA/SA go with as much ac/hp as possible, have everyone else have their resist gear on because they are the ones who will leach healers of their mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you hit 60 , you resist a lot of AoE in HoT. I'd recommend MA get to 60 asap.<br />
The lower people get the more the AE eats them alive, especially if there are level 55s.<br />
Usually 100 Cold, fire, magic resist is good goal .<br />
<br />
A few other comments: HoT is much harder without a good bard to sing resist song. Also, the gating mobs will wipe you if you don't have someone (a couple high enchanters) to seive them .<br />
<br />
You can get fooled by all the people who talk about doing HoT with 4 people...yes , but not when they are first trying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say if your 60th level and moveing to HoT get your resists to 100 FR/CR/MR pre-buff even for the MA. For every level over 60 drop 10 off that number.<br />
<br />
If your healer dont need to chain heal you  your rogues and rangers can get a little healin love too....</div></div><hr />

If you are able to position properly and hide the healers from the AEs, they don't need to sacrifice any stats for resists, as they should never get hit by an AE.</div></div><hr />
