<br />
Which one would be better to skill up, piercing or 2HB?I already am maxed out in 1HS, 1HB, and 2HS, and I am bored in the sense I am not improving myself,so I figured I would learn one of these 2 skills.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you can give me and possible suggestions as to which wpns would help me.<br />

I suggest you rais both skills to max. In what order is really up to you, but Piercing won't take near as long to raise as 2hb will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did them all actually. Peirce will be easier to get up duel wielding, while there are a lot more 2hbs out there that you may eventually want. <br />
<br />
Pick up a 2hb and a couple of peircers and get them both up :) <br />
<br />
As for which weapons to use, that i can't offer much info on for your level. If you wait until you are 55 you can use a GSoT for the 2hb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />

Depending on your server you should probably have one or two for sale int eh Bazzar now heh.</div></div><hr />

Definately max the 2hb for using the greatstaff of Thunder. Really is an outstanding weapon for the non-raiding warrior and readily available for very cheap (Have seen for 200pp on Povar in bazaar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max all your skills for your level, then make ann effort to keep them up until they are all capped. There is nothing worse than getting lucky on a sweet new weapons and having a skill of 56.</div></div><hr />
