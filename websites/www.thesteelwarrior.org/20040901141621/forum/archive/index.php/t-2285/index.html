<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All the calculation you do is based on that we are 90% warrior and 50% cleric. This is what is not right. We are the 90% warrior OR the 50% cleric. We cant do both at the same time. So we ether are a 90% effectiv warrior OR we are a light healer. Aslong we cant do both at the same time and we cant do that. We are not this 140% class. We are an 90% warrior at the moment OR an 50% cleric at the moment. We cant cast and fight at the same time.<br />
<br />
Learn this and we are on a good way to find a way to balance the classes. Aslong you look at us as a 140% class all this talks make no sense beause you look at us as a godclass which we are not.<br />
<br />
A paladin usually get less then 50% of the dps of a warrrior on raids. Because we rarly fight the mob for more then 40 to 60% the time and do other jobs in the other time where we cant keep the mob in target. Again dont take knights as a 140 % class. Take them as a class which can switch between 2 jobs. But this jobs are not doable at the same time. We have to give up or melee side when we switch to healing. When we switch to fighting we give up our cleric side. I think this is very important that warriors unterstand this to handle the knight-warrior situation fair.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know, who cares?  The point is you can use your spells and tank.  Paladins do it all the time.  I've seen more than one case in a group where the Cleric bit it for some reason, and the Paladin alone was able to keep the group going for quite some time.  Of course this was after the mob was slowed, but it was still impressive all the same.  I'd have died much sooner, even with defensive up.  So, to be honest, either you haven't seen a really good, well equiped, Paladin played, or you're blowing smoke.<br />
<br />
Add to that the near complete aggro lock a Paladin can generate on demand, and you can talk all day about how it isn't everything it's cracked up to be, and maybe even have some truth on your side, but what I see is a class with aggro lock, ability to tank most anything I can, with some exceptions, that can also emerqency heal like no other class.   And less than 50% of Warrior DPS on raids, what did you pull that number out of?  Not from the figures I've seen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Arbosh you must be the worst Pali out there in Everquest.<br />
<br />
You should have taken some looks in the parses of Raids from Guilds like FoH and others, where you would see that the damage of Sks Pallis and non tanking Warr is almost the same ( differenz below 6 % ).<br />
<br />
Maybe youre not really informed but for Knights and casts while fighting the rules were changed long time in the past.<br />
<br />
In the beginning of Everquest a Paladin stops fighting while casting a spell. Now this is only history. No he do not stop for a part of a second doing his melee stuff when he casts a groupheal or other stuff. He only looses Meleedamage when he had to change the target ( for a single heal .. ).<br />
<br />
And a well trained Paladin can manage this in a minimum of time - depending on the spell - sometimes between 2 swings.<br />
<br />
Dont think were dump cause we decidet to play a non casting Class. I played an Sk on an Zek server so I know that stuff a bit.<br />
<br />
Youre defense is like ours. Your offense is a bit worse, but I know of an Item which gives you a 10 % boost to one of your 2hand skill so that this skill would nearly be eqal that of a warrior.<br />
<br />
Your &quot; useless &quot; possibilities ala <br />
rooting Mobs ( for CC and safe of Casters )<br />
stunning Mobs ( for aggro and reducing Damage )<br />
healing Spells ( for reducion of downtimes and emergencies )<br />
rezzing Players ( for the lack of having a cleric in group )<br />
buffing Players ( for the lack of having a cleric in group and add brells )<br />
damaging Undead ..<br />
raising the groupdamage cause of aggro lock<br />
<br />
I am sure I forgot some of your useless stuff..<br />
<br />
are really not very needed in this game ( sarcasme )<br />
<br />
When I hear you I should think that pallis today are more worse then they were in Kunark Time. <br />
<br />
But cause I am not a dump one I think youre only a poor Moron.<br />

Try an go out and learn to play your class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Arbosch, go read your other post. I laid it out for you in extensive detail what tools the warrior has to manage agro. Want to hear something surprising? Paladins have the same tools available to them. Do Paladins use them? More often than not, no, because Paladin spells are a much more reliable source of agro generation.<br />
<br />
OK, you already have 90 percent or better of a warrior's tanking ability, save defensive, and through itemization, you can close the gap to within a few percentage points, as well as gain some of the defensive capabilities through shielding items. And end game Paladin will be almost indistinguishable from an endgame warrior, save the Paladin will have spells to draw upon, and better agro generation.<br />
<br />
Is it so much for a warrior to ask for more tools with which to generate agro without having to resort to bandaid fixes or fix through very expensive equipment purchases or long, hard raid camps? Besides, itemization is so skewed towards hybrid classes, I am laughing to keep from crying. Those EB weapons that are supposed to fix our problems? Guess what? They are Knight usable too.<br />
<br />
So when us warriors, who have been in the outhouse since PoP was released, and only let inside whenever there wasn't a Knight around to tank, or there was a mob that only a defensive tank could take on, start asking for a few more items in our toolbox, why is it Knights have to bitch, moan and complain? It's not enough that I am no longer needed for XP groups, but now Knights want my defensive capability too so they can do he ONLY thing left to my class? Screw that.</div></div><hr />

I've seen more than one case in a group where the Cleric bit it for some reason, and the Paladin alone was able to keep the group going for quite some time<br />
***<br />
<br />
This is true but what did the paladin do then ? Tanking the mobs and keep fighting. No he has to step back and heal fulltime and med up and keep the mob away from him and create as low aggro as possible. At this moment he switched to be cleric and for this and gave up his tankside. He was only a 50% cleric then but for this moment it was needed to give up 90% melee for a 50% cleric. It is clear a warrior cant do this and this make the paladin more important for this situation. At this moment you got a 0 dps tank for a 50% cleric and not a xdps + a 50% cleric. For this situation it is great. But how often this happen? If this is the norm in your gruops you need to improve your gameplay because we rarly have wipes in exp groups. I think we not lost our clerics one time in the last month.<br />
<br />
For the question if a warrior which not fight is still a 100% warrior. If he dont fight the mob he dont do his job. There is no reason for a warrior not to attack the mob. He dont have any other us then to attack the mob. It is a warrior then which play his class bad nothing else. Like a paladin which only keep hitting the mob and dont use any spells. He will allways only be a 90% warrior. Is this a reason to make him to a 100% warrior?<br />
<br />
Personal i like to groupe with warriors. In the groupe we usually have in the elemental planes we are Cleric, Warrior, Paladin and 3 others. We handle it very easy. I go pull and bring it in the camp. The warrior taunt the mob off me because when he got aggro he dont loose it. His only problem is when the mob is incoming. At the moment the mob is at 50% and i lost aggro i go pull the next mob which i tank untill the first mob is death and the warrior can taunt it from me and i get next one. This is a perfect job sharing. I am add tanker and puller and the warrior is the maintank. We usually go throught mobs nonstop and i not us a lot of me cleric side in this fights. I am a 90% tank there which cast stuns. I have to say that i groupe with elemental geared warriors so they have it way easier to hold aggro then pre elemental geared warriors. But again if they can do there job and do it well. Isnt it only a an equipment problem and not a problem of which power each classes have?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let me break it down real simple like for ya there buddy.  If a warrior isn't tanking on a raid, he/she is better off being replaced in that raid slot with...pretty much any other class in EQ.  Oh sure I can do some dps....but wizards, necro, mage, ranger, rogue, monk, bst can do far more than I can.  Knights provide utility I can't hope to match because I have exactly 0 in that department.  Clerics and druids and shamans can heal, dot, do dd, etc etc.  Bard do their ghey dance...I mean uh, songs are cool, lots of utility there.<br />
<br />
Pretty much any warrior not tanking on a raid is a very bored warrior.  I can point myself towards a mob, turn on attack and go make a sandwhich.  Nobody would notice or really care.<br />
<br />
And as far as xp groups go, lets just say I'm gettin really tired of hearing enchanter's and shamans whine about how they couldn't get a knight tank as soon as I join the group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you're suppose to be 70% warrior and 30% cleric you moron.<br />
<br />
And who gives a shit about your cleric side?<br />
<br />
the point is, you aggro better then warriors and tank almost as good.<br />
<br />
Yet you can also solo, keep groups going with healing, buff etc...<br />
<br />
In other words, you do everything better or as good as warriors... all except for one thing... a Discipline which lasts a few minutes, and can be used every 10ish minutes....<br />
<br />
If you think that's balanced, then you are in need of mental help.<br />
<br />
Even those beggars in bazaar that spend their whole EQ life trying to get money through begging, would know that this is unbalanced.</div></div><hr />

This is not correct.<br />
<br />
It is this. When you cast you dont fight. The moment you stop casting you start fighting again. They did set the delay on 0 after casting. Bevor it was casting + delay of the wapon. If you cast groupeheals for 3seocnds it is 3 seconds where you dont hit the mob. If i us groupeheals i us Wave of Marr and usually healing Wave of Prexus after because the mobs ae is higherthen 900hps. This are 6 seconds i dont fight. I can cast them every 30 seconds so 20% of the time i dont melee. If i come near 6% of your dps i need to have a higher dps then you. If i us them for 2 minutes i need to us a mod rod to have a 5. round of double waves. Which is another break of 3+ secods. If i us it full time and keep meleeing i am usually OOM after 2 1/2 minutes. If i dont us the groupeheals i need to target someone else whch will make the break even longer. You see it is bullshit what you write here with 6%. The only way i can come near this is when i am better equiped then the warrior and dont cast a single spell in the fight.  Usually i need to med in fight when i am groupehealer with waves that i can support a fight for longer then 3 minutes. If i need to support groupeheals for 6+ minutes i cant melee the mob. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">theres exactly two things I need to understand about knights.  No more, no less.<br />
<br />
1.  What kind of childhood does a person have to have to end up with such a mental state, where they feel they deserve all the perks in life while others get royally fucked?  Its a strange phenomenon, this &quot;entitlement&quot; attitude, and I'm genuinely curious what kind of RL issues cause this mental condition.<br />
<br />
2.  The otehr thing I need is I need to understand how I can set up my account so I dont even see posts made by knights (for reasons why, see #1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Arbosch,<br />
<br />
You say that knights having 90% melee capability of a warrior (your percentage, not mine) is OK, because a knight can't perform their other role when they are tanking.<br />
<br />
I disagree with your number... but it isn't really important.  I think that most here can agree that paladins are perfectly capable of tanking any mob that does not require defensive disc.  (Some might argue that they are slightly less capable due to warrior HPs... some will say that aggro capability more than makes up for that... but the point is, unless the mob requires /disc defensive then any pally/sk/war can tank it effectively.)<br />
<br />
So you are saying that all the other roles a knight can fill:<br />
healing, root parking, emergency rez (how many times has a pally saved the raid by being able to rez a cleric when they are all dead??), offtanking, stunning mobs until they are mezzed, spam curing blindness and other nasty junk, etc...<br />
are a fair trade for giving up one single thing - the ability to MT a mob that requires defensive?<br />
<br />
If you think that is &quot;balanced&quot; then you need a new scale.<br />
<br />
You complain that you can't do everything at once... that you switch to your &quot;other side&quot; and perform other roles as needed.  Well, what &quot;other side&quot; does a warrior have?  You guessed it.  NONE.  If we are going to be limited to doing one thing (tanking) then we ought to be clearly superior when we are doing it.  And except for the case of mobs that require defensive disc (i.e. raid boss mobs) we aren't any better at it than a knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had this long witty post made but I threw it all out because it would have just gotten lost in chatter.<br />
<br />
In a raid, melee dps is sad.  Very sad.  All of the Warriors in a raid hacking away at a elemental boss do less than 5% of the total damage in HP.  So this is some big bonus?  I'm sorry if I'm not elated but seeing one Warrior do less than 1% of the monster's HP in melee damage isn't exactly a big bonus or something to hold over one Paladin who does much less than that.<br />
<br />
So if I'm contributing neglable damage to the raid, why bring along me as a Paladin?  Its because I can, if nothing else, support my group.  Paladins are great because the eyes of the other priest classes are elsewhere.  No priest has time to cure people during a big fight.  No priest has time to heal that Bard who accidently took a Reposte.  Who ends up picking up the slack?  I do and I suspect Paladins all over the game do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Which brings us back to the Warrior question.  If Paladins can at least support a group, why bring along more Warriors?  You need no more than 4 to keep the raid going.  Any Warrior not allowed to tank is plainly just filler as harsh as that sounds.<br />
<br />
Arbosch is so close to being right yet being so wrong.  You have to look at classes in their entirity because single skill comparison are dubious to make.  So why do you Arbosch keep looking at the Paladin class &quot;on the whole&quot; but only looking a small part of Warriors?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're in elementals and you haven't noticed the utility of paladins on raid encounters, then one of 3 things is happening:<br />
<br />
1) You don't go to raids, in which case your opinion is invalid<br />
2) You're not actually in elemental planes, because you'd know better if you were<br />
3) You don't know how to play your class. If you're actually bitching about the lack of DPS of paladins on a raid, and about how &quot;everytime we have to heal, we're not hitting, waah waah,&quot; then you are simply a moron. <br />

Wilhelm, you're not kidding, also considering the cures needed on Babs/Jaggedtooth, Ramp healing on Magma, the list goes on and on and on.

<br />
1.) You can cry aslong you want. Doing something at the same time mean to do it at the same moment not behind each other. Throw more shit at me. You can not argument against this.<br />
<br />
2.) All you say is Knights are great because they have a cleric side they can us. Yes we can do that. But lets be serious to. Every cleric can take this role x time better then a paladin. Aslong you have enough clerics you dont need Knights. We are only good because there are not enough clerics arround the moment you have clerics noone will care about our groupeheals. There is not a single situation where a paladin is a better groupehealer then a cleric.<br />
 <br />
3.) If the situation will stay like it is now and you can have unlimited people on raids you can have your aggro creator. But Verant making the biggest bullshit in there history. Limited raid enocunters. How many clerics you have in your guild. How many members ? What will most guild do ? 2 limited raids at the same time ? They will make one raid with the best people they have to make it as easy as possible and the other have to sit arround and hope the loot there is worser then everything in PoP that people dont think this encounters are worth there time or hope they make it that easy that a raid with a total fucked up classbalance can make it past it. Verant dont want us to move throught this enocunters easy so they will make it hard. If something get hard we search a way arround it to make it easier. First thing all guilds will do then is to set there raids up with the best possible classbalance they can get.  Most guilds have 8+ clerics this will get in the raid. Noone can heal better then them and 8 clerics should give a 30 person raid more then enough healing power to survive. A few tanks to tank the mobs. A few debuffes and the rest goes to dps classes. Warriors will only have to spot for tanking. They are the best in it and if verant balance this enocounters for elemental plane guilds this tanks will need a defensiv discipline. So grats you got your spot in this raids. Does knights have a role when there are clerics arround and what is our role then? I hope i dont have to explain the differnce between a cleric which heal the groupe and a paladin which heal the groupe. If the warriors have allready there spot because they have defensiv. Isnt it then not fair that knights get the other spots for offtanking because they are better there then warriors? What you want is now that you get this spot to. Then knights are in the situation to fight against clerics/Shamans/Druids for the healing spots where we will loose badly against there healing power and against the warriors for the offtanking job where we will loose because we have no advantage there against them when they can take aggro as good as us. Why to risk to have a weaker tank when we can have a better one? You think we get a spot there when there is a cleric in every groupe to heal the groupe? if you cant support 8 clerics you are not far in PoP.<br />
<br />
Well lets fight knights against warriors when the real problem is that we are forced to limit the players we can have with us. They should upgrade the experince you get with raids. If you can get exp on raids effectiv noone will care if you are a knight or warrior when you can invite them and get the same experience then bevor. You dont need to sit arround and lfg because you can move to your friends and get raidinvite and exp with them. That will be the best classbalance they can do because we are not forced to fight against each other.<br />

There is not a single situation where a paladin is a better groupehealer then a cleric. <br />
<br />
Well no shit a cleric can heal better than a paladin, because clerics are a parent class to the paladin. You, sir, are one of the most retarded paladins I have ever come across. If you have been in the planes, which I doubt, because I dont think you have left lake of ill omen yet, paladins are tremendous for group heals, in every single raid encounter, the person most likely to save my ass from the AE's, the odd riposte from the mob turning is a paladin. Because the clerics are busy healing the main tank.</div></div><hr />

If he and I are in a group together with an aoe chewing away at us, and he gets smacked with a riposte, all I can do is think to myself &quot;At least he's probably going to drop first.&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is true but what did the paladin do then ? Tanking the mobs and keep fighting. No he has to step back and heal fulltime and med up and keep   <br />

oh no shit man, meditate is only a minor part of todays mana regeneration, with VoQ and some AAs and one or 2 FT items 66% of a paladins mana regen easily comes when standing and meleeing as well</div></div><hr />

Posturing only works when you are at least semi accurate.<br />
<br />
1. Even a dog cannot lick his testicles and anus at the same time, it doesn't mean he doesn't have an advantage over humans at testicle licking or anus licking.   Well, maybe not YOU but us he has an advantage over.<br />
<br />
2. Not healing as well as someone doesn't negate your ability to do it, or taking it into consideration when considering class balance.   Having said that, you actually ARE superior at short term &quot;burst&quot; healing than a cleric.  There isn't a cleric on earth who can cast an instant complete heal, you can cast 6 in a row with a soulfire and AA's without spending a single point of mana.<br />
<br />
3. Setting up scenarios for some &quot;future expansion&quot; which you know nothing about and creating little red herrings about it as far as raiding requirements go for tanking, etc and then using those guesses to discuss class balance is retarded.   Are you retarded or do you just play one on these boards?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I still want to know how you can be in an elemental guild and not understand the value of Paladin heals; LoH (esp with the AA), the 1 sec cast, 850hp heal, and especially wave of marr, or prexus. If you're in elementals, and worry about hte fact that you have to stop dealing damage for allof 2 seconds to cast this, I wonder how much that account cost. There's a reason you usually find those funky classes called mages, and wizards, and rogues on a raid, I'll let you guess why.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I still cannot believe your gripe about itemization, and the fact that you need to worry about getting both HP and Mana. If you haven't checked, knight elemental pieces have, on average, 5-15 HP less than warrior pieces for teh same slot. On the flip side, all knight elemental gear has at least 130 mana per slot. Furthermore, half of the elemental pieces (arms, legs, boots) has both a melee AND caster focus efect (arms I believe have both aura of bravery and mana pres IV). All of this really makes me wonder how you can possibly have these gripes about your class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ever been on an RZ raid?  Throw all of the Clerics you want into the raid and you plainly won't win.  Ever fight a elemental boss that deals big damage to the MT but pops AE in a space you can't hide from?  Clerics can't heal anything else but the MT or use another heal because the MT dies.  Not to mention its burns mana for them to do so.  If the AE is more than just straight damage is a Cleric going to cast cures?<br />
<br />
Not to mention Arbosch you clearly underestimate Paladin healing.  We don't heal like Clerics but we don't need to since Cleric healing isn't always allowed to be flexible.  When it comes time to blast heal you better believe the raid leader is calling Paladins to dump their mana in their too.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but you have a limited view of what a raid is if you claim that &quot;MT + a cadre of Clerics&quot; are all that is needed to raid.  Although simple raids like that are a valid style of raid, there are many raids in POP which don't favor this simplistic approach to attacking.<br />
<br />
As for gear, the elemental armor is quite nice.  Improved Healing IV and Mana Pres IV for casting.  Multiple Auras for improve HP regen and ATK.  All of it has reasonable levels of both HP and Mana.  So what is the complaint?  What gear are you looking at?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">also, even if i do not need it, i can roll on vengance items, EB, and haste, knights on the other hand can roll on all mana conserve items, haste items, regant conservation items, EB, vengance, and EB.<br />
<br />
some people roll on items that they have an excuse to roll on, then they make money, the knights have more opertunity there.<br />
<br />
as far as utility(honorable mention) warriors have no utility options for the average group, knights on the otherhand have many. to name a few<br />
<br />
BMB, group heals, fear, root, FD,stun(it may or may not be snap agro, but you can hold a monster from attacking a cleric for 35 seconds, that is really useful) i beleave SK's get a very short term mes, not sure on that<br />

<br />
I guess since they have to mind their p's and Q's over at PoN (if they even post there they may not for fear of gettign banned) that when they come here they let go and end up looking like retarded morons :p<br />

Oh well I need a good laugh keep it coming pallies.<br />

I will give you one piece of advice! Try to remember no matter how delusional you are the people here are based in reality unlike that other board you may read or even post on from time to time, by posing your delusions of grandeur here all you do is make yourselves look like retarded morons! No mater how much you believe in your delusions the people here who are based in reality will see through that vile crap you spew and put you back in your place.<br />

1.) &quot;....Doing something at the same time mean to do it at the same moment not behind each other....&quot;<br />
<br />
And having two different sets of abilities and being able to switch back and forth between them as needed is immensely powerful. Make a Paladin, Enchanter, and Rogue group. The Paladin buffs the group (Cleric), MT's (Warrior), and Heals (Cleric) as required. Substitute a Warrior for the Paladin. Is the group going to be as successful? If not, then why? Would a Shaman/Paladin goup be any different? Paladin/Wizard? Paladin plus any other single member?<br />
<br />
2.) &quot;....There is not a single situation where a paladin is a better groupehealer then a cleric.....&quot;<br />
<br />
True, there are three. Cleric is oom, dead, or using all his mana to keep a MT alive.<br />
<br />
3.) Sorry, can't quote anything since this section is incomprehensible to me.<br />
<br />
The game is full of special situtations. Players try hard to figure out how to jigger the odds in their favor and often look for special situations when setting up groups. I've seen SK's be the prefered puller for a deeply burried named mob. I've seen Paladins MT in raids when getting and keeping aggro was much more important than taking damage.<br />
<br />
Experiance goups should not IMO be a special situation. A Paladin's ability to get and keep aggro, heal, and MT should not outweigh the Warior's ability to MT - these classes should be equal in their desirability in groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors have a problem when the usual raid and group situations favor using a Knight to MT. Warriors can't afford to be marginalized - MTing in Raids and Groups is all we've got.<br />
