<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pigbelly_Pitfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good evening warriors, I come looking for your advice.<br />
<br />
I recently returned to the world of Norrath to find it a strange place. My guild has vanished, the majority of my old mates have quit and the few I know have been hoovered up by a Time level guild.<br />
<br />
I am looking to get back into playing EQ after a few months off (argh, careers, who needs em) and find that the type of EQ I really like - VT, Ssra, NToV, low end POP, bit of Gates - no longer exists in a guild on my timezone on my server. I am in the UK and work during the day. I am looking for a European guild.<br />
<br />
Can any of you brave souls give me some ideas of servers with medium level guilds of fun and clever people who are also working their way through the PoP progression, maybe killing a few Emps and farming Ssra? I will happily xserver, I just need some ideas of whose out there.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
<br />
edit: Time zone clarification</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drachnyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Server: Bristlebane (coincidence ? i think not)<br />
Guild: Inner fury<br />
Website (http://www.innerfury.org)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, i did not quite understant.<br />
<br />
are you european ?<br />
<br />
if that's so, you could try and check the guilds on Antonius Bayle and Kane Bayle.<br />
<br />
if you are risky, you can even sell your soul and move to the UBI servers (Sébilis : french server, Venril Sathir : UK server, Kael Drakkal : german server). but be aware that once you moved to a UBI serve you are doomed ! there is no way back to a &quot;common&quot; soe server (no other movelog possible :/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pigbelly_Pitfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thankyou so much for the fast replys - yes Kun I am European and want to play Euro evenings. I had a mate who got burnt by the UBI thing and dont think I will be looking at that yet - however I plan to only move once so if I see the right guild it may not be a problem. I only speak English or I would move to a great looking guild on KD.<br />
<br />
AB was my first though - I will look more at that, my main problem is that I know a few trouble makers who moved there to escape reputations and I am just moving because I cant find a guild on my time zone at my level.<br />
<br />
Drach - Inner Fury looked just what I was looking for - but they are mainly US - the ethos and generally welcoming style was great!<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh Wow Drach sure was fast to respond.  I am of Familjen on Bristlebane, a european guild, but I believe we are a little past your focus, on our drive to elementals, in solro tower workin RZ script.<br />
<br />
If you were interested in this, albeit I don't know if its what you're looking for (we skipped ssra and vt entirely, we care about fun, not endless hours of farming), you could check out www.familjen.dk when the website comes back up (it went down yesterday for unknown reasons).  I don't want to turn this into some silly Bristlebane guild conflict on ya, and like I said, I don't even know if we're doing the kinda stuff you were lookin for.  But if so, it might be worth your time to check our guild out as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pigbelly_Pitfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am going to camp my own thread! <br />
<br />
Thankyou Grendon - I will check out your site when it is back up. Having thought about it I think that any newly progressing guild would skip VT and ssra - I have 2 VT keys and I wouldnt wish that pita on anyone!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Inner Fury is indeed a great guild :) Currently clearing VT heavly and 2 mobs from SolRo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mecroaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What an honor to have someone reccommend our guild here.  Inner Fury is indeed a wonderful guild.  There's a strong UK and US raid presence as well.  The best of both worlds!</div></div><hr />

So in terms of where you are in game probably not much of interest on TP. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is a small euro guild on Tarew Marr called Britannic Lore that is probably not that far ahead of what you are talking about.  They seem to have trouble keeping a good member base though, and wind up in alliances with other guilds that eventually leave them behind.  <br />
<br />
I don't know anybody in Brit Lore personally, so these are just observations from reading the server boards so any actual member can feel free to correct me if this isn't accurate.<br />

Please feel free to post any other Euro guilds if you know of any - I am going to start studying these all over the weekend.<br />
<br />
If you are a UK player and have any ideas - please feel free to PM me</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly VT or NToV capable yet, but we're definatly working on getting there. Care to help out? ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daffydil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hi<br />
<br />
I am from the UK too, and play on AB. I don't think we have more than our fair share of trouble makers, and there are plenty of guilds to choose from. I think our guild is probably a bit low for you, Our greatest conquest so far is Vindi, but I am the only main warrior, so any more would be welcome.<br />
<br />
Check us out at www.faydarks.co.uk<br />
<br />
Also have a look at the servers guild list  http://www.antonius-bayle.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2540 .<br />
