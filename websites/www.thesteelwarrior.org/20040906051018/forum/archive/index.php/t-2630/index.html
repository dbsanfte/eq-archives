<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy, I was wondering if anyone has a link to a thorough PoSky walkthru, by chance ??   Guild has been up there a few times to get some epic drops, and just can't seem to get it together.  We have a lot of problems on azarack isle getting sirran to spawn, as well as other things too.   I used to have a link to a guide called Adawan's PoSky guide, but that link no longer works.  Any info would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No idea about a walkthrough, but you have to make sure Sirran despawns on the previous island before you kill the next boss, if you go too fast and he hasn't despawned...raid over :(</div></div><hr />

Every time Ive gone up there for a key there has been one stuck Azarack and weve needed GM intervention to continue.<br />
<br />
PoSky Walk Thru (http://www.geocities.com/lordhong/sky.htm) <br />
<br />
The above link is what I used the first one or two times.<br />
<br />
BTW... not sure if its a new &quot;feature&quot; but after a recent trip and zoning out left us all our keys.  We just walk right on up to what ever ilse we need now and don't even kill things unless we need a certain isle.  This has been extremly helpful since I so despise that awful place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Awesome, thanks for the info everyone !   Aye, fenring, that might have been what happened to us.   As well, anyone ever bothered talking to the little fella about the [hassle] he speaks of, if the last person to leave the isle doesn't talk to him first ?<br />
<br />
And thanks for linking that awesome walk-thrugh Faederya !  Just what I was looking for.  And yup, most of our problems have come on azarack isle.   Either it seems we can't pull the last azarack for NOTHING, or there will be 1 spawned inside the world or something *is on track, but un-targettable*, or there will be no Protector spawn. <br />
<br />
Such a headache getting all set up for a raid here, and then getting sent home after 20 minutes.  People REALLY don't like sitting around waiting for someone to answer your /petitions, so it seems we pack up early and go home.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the input</div></div><hr />
