I do not have any 1h weapons bu tI would like to have a pair bagged. I would prefer tradeable weapons since my schedule does not allow a ton of time to farm items for my warrior. I came across there 2 weapons and thought they would be pretty nice -<br />

I can get the pair for around 70k. I could also get SBoZ+HoH combo, but it seems like this combo would put out a lot more damage for the same plats. Or maybe a different combo of these 4 weapons. What do you guys think? Maybe there is another weapon I am missing that would be better yet. While I will never MT anything major, my little warrior does see some tanking duty on stuff like Kunark dragons and hopefully Vindi/KT or some ST key dragons in the near future so agro is a concern but DPS is a bit more important at this time.</div></div><hr />

you really can't say anything bad about them though; but if you're going to maybe do some minor MT work you may want to get at least 1 Aggro proc-type weapon as a 1Her?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have kinda been thinking that Shik, but I am at a loss for what to get. I keep thinking that a Sapper + something tradeable would be the way to go, but getting a group to go kill vaniki will be hard to do with everyone working on getting the Gimil earring. No way would I go to a Frosty + Wavecrasher, the severe drop in DPS is just too much for me to take. So far I haven't really had too much of a problem keeping agro the times Moord has tanked with sheer Windblade DPS, but then I haven't tanked anything bigger than a Kunark dragon yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i forgot is there are any GM troll smiths on Terris; maybe snag one of them top shelf Ykeshas ( honed blade?) ...or hell, think about using a FB shield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a windblade, the keep that for DPS output and normal exp situations. Not sure why you will want to swop out to the 2 one handers, unless parses show they give better DPS. Therefore, if your thinking 1 handers for MAing raids, id get an aggro proccer. Maybe a fleshgrinder or something like that.<br />
<br />
i have a frosty/wavecrasher combo and i agree the dps is sucky but i never use it cept when im tanking for a raid and want to be sure of holding aggro. in those cases my dps doesnt really matter that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just seems like there would be a better tradeable combo than Frosty/WC without having to sell your soul for a BoC/SoD combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh gotta love the weapon progression of warriors...from orc_1 ub3r to cheap tricks &amp; own 20 weapons up to sell_your_first_born-quit_your_job grade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go with the sboz/hoh combo over the ones you have listed if agro is your goal. DPS does effect agro but the dps loss on the sboz/hoh combo compaired to the windblade would be made up for by you swinging more often. Fast weapons always give me agro over hard hitting ones but I guess its up to you.<br />
<br />
Sboz has +100hp on it to mind you, not bad if you dont have any high end weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after mulling it over a few days I just ended up buying back the weapons I had before I got a Windblade - SBoZ and HoH. At least I paid less for the pair than what I sold the HoH for last time :)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have a feeling that I will either end up camping a no drop 1h for taunt or selling my next born for a SoD/BoC.</div></div><hr />
