<br />
Monk Epic <br />
--------------------- <br />
- Speaking to certain monk epic mobs will no longer reset the monk's progression. <br />
<br />
- Monks that turned in their letters will now be able to continue the quest from where they currently are. <br />
<br />
- Monks should have an easier time locating the lost Disciple. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild Tribute <br />
--------------------- <br />
- Players with Gates, but not Omens, should now be able to open the Guild Tribute Master to both opt-in and donate for Guild Tribute Benefits. <br />
<br />
- Suspended pets will no longer vanish when their owner turns invisible. <br />
<br />
- Skies will now show correctly for Windows 98/ME users. <br />
<br />
- Warriors will be reimbursed for their Press the Attack AA. They can buy the ability with its new range if they wish. <br />
<br />
- Salvage will no longer return items that would be returned normally. <br />
<br />

Man, someone around here said something about a broken monk epic like a month ago.  Who the hell was that guy anyway?<br />
<br />
It's cool they decided to make the guild tribute chick talk to people without OoW but with GoD tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">and nothing about the warrior 1.5 epic that seams to be buged</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ugle Smashur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm...think they did the routine &quot;Nerf the New Expansion drops/Exp/ZEM&quot; this patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doesn't look to me like there is an ususually high zem boost, at least not in the City of Dan zone.... <br />
<br />
Well if they do nerf I played 13 stright hours yesterday so I'm&quot;in before the nerf.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't really think this is the nerf patch though cause 2 servers did not go down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">[ 2 servers did not go down.<br />
<br />
Those were the non SOE servers? the ones that are always a patch level behind? European servers?<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dunno where you got that patch message, but i just patched and this was between the monk epic and the guild tribute thing<br />
<br />
Warrior Epic <br />
--------------------- <br />
- Corrected an issue with the Decomposing Pages in Dranik's Scar. They should now respawn in an appropriate amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dunno where you got that patch message, but i just patched and this was between the monk epic and the guild tribute thing<br />
<br />
It was the patch message when I patched this morning.<br />
<br />
Dunno where you got yours :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As usually, prolly there were several patches one after the other :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They mentioned the pages but didn't add anything about the geming mold.<br />
<br />
Makes me think that its here and working but we just haven't found it yet.<br />
<br />
Since they were up front on the pages thing early on i don't think they would have stealth fixed it and done nothing.  So looks like some more digging will have to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The patch message is just a simple text file on the patch server.  Someone at SOE probably read one of the many message boards complaining about not seeing the warrior epic update and took the 5 minutes to quickly type it in half way through the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dinklehimer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Talked to  Kaikachi, said the fix went live today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Poor monks, I heard one of their epic mobs is in 7th Hammer's room, if that's true I don't see many monk epics getting done. Hooray time sinks:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I heard one of their epic mobs is in 7th Hammer's room <br />
<br />
Wow.... if that's true, you'd expect that other classes would have epic mobs lurking in zones that require complex flagging or keying. And that would really suck.<br />
<br />
Though I admit it would make the quest more &quot;epic&quot;, at least in terms of length and scope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Poor monks, I heard one of their epic mobs is in 7th Hammer's room, if that's true I don't see many monk epics getting done. Hooray time sinks:)<br />
<br />
<br />
What the hell does being a monk have to do with the 7th hammer? Wouldn't that make more sense for a shaman?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is this &quot;Make sense&quot; you speak of?<br />
<br />
Is that like going to the moon to fight snake people?</div></div><hr />

At least the snake people drop nice loot!</div></div><hr />

<br />
WHAT ABOUT GOING TO AN ALTERNATE PLANE OF EXISTANCE, OR SOMETHING, AND KILLING STUFF THAT IS STRONGER THEN A GOD!?!?!?!111!1111 :confused:  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Uglukson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's a version of the 7th Hammer himself, and he is a monk.  Yay for pestering enough people to do all the PoJ trials!<br />
<br />
I hope they don't inflict similar punishments on other classes' epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We killed Cipheron in WoS last night post-patch, and as some of you may know, his only drop is some item for enchanter epic, and when a chanter loots it, the actual items/runes/etc drop for people to bid/roll on. However, as of this patch, only an enchanter on THIS step of their epic can loot the page. So since we didn't have a chanter that was on this precise step, Cipheron's loot rotted.<br />
<br />
Also, we moved into MPG after ciph, and cleared around until we came to Lightningcaller Vhalek. Perviously, he was one-groupable and dropped a horn needed for wizzy 2.0. Since it was a known 1-groupable mob, we just pulled and prepared to own him. This is similar to what I see since I tagged aggro on inc...<br />
<br />
AE Manadrain<br />
miss/1694<br />
3006/1200ish<br />
Flurry 3006/3006/1400ish<br />
1800/miss/500ish<br />
Death.<br />
<br />
DI saved my ass, and i still lived a total of ~7 seconds<br />
<br />
He now flurries for 3k, is immune to slow, AE manadrains. As an added bonus, another named spawned at the door to his room and aggroed. And the seeinvis, see-SoS walkers just outside made our corpse recovery very fun. Screw SOE and thier ninja mob changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Screw SOE and thier ninja mob changes. <br />
<br />
But OOW will have the best [quality control] of any release ever!  So saeth the SoE [fan boys].</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, Sony has done a fabulous job.<br />
<br />
Warriors are bugged on their final Epic turn in.<br />
<br />
SK's are bugged on several Epic turn ins.<br />
<br />
Bards are bugged on an Epic turn in.<br />
<br />
I hear that Druids and Rangers are as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are these the same Epic quests that we were informed were tested ad noseum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ugle Smashur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Add Rogues to that list, as well.  Looks as if one of their quest folks is not spawning.</div></div><hr />
