Does it affect damage at all? or the ability &quot;to hit&quot;?</div></div><hr />

It's all explained there,<br />
<br />
basically, STR helps with smithing, heightens your attk, allows you to carry more stuff.</div></div><hr />

Probably around 1 point per 10 strength...  but don't think I ever actually tested it.<br />
<br />
It has a very small effect on your overall DPS - nothing that I would be really concerned with.</div></div><hr />

1.  Allows you to carry more weight, wear heavier armor, etc.<br />
2.  Increases your ATK by a very small amount which in turn increases your DPS by a very small amount.<br />
3.  Can help with some trade skills (smithing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Max hit for primary hand is calculated by:  [((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (DMG)) + (Level Damage Bonus)] <br />
<br />
Max hit for off hand is calculated by:  [((Weapon Skill + STR)/100) * DMG]<br />
<br />
Not sure if that formula is still considered 100 % accurate, but it should at least give you a rough estimate.  Overall, strength adds a small amount to your DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And unlike almost any RPG you have played (other than Champions) Str does not add to melee to hit. Only Damage.<br />
<br />
LOL would be surprised if the formula is 100% accurate, but its fast, and easy to calculate. I think it was known to be off when the work was done, about 4 years ago.</div></div><hr />

Very useful IMO especially for dps</div></div><hr />

If it were only that you were right. Extensive parcing shows that Str has 0 effect on to hit. This is backed up by statements from Brad McQuaid stating Str has no effect on melee to hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Dvus was referring to the fact that strength raises ATK, and ATK affects how often one hits, not that strength directly affected melee hits. Weapon skill, offense and a few other things also factor in, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your attack rating, much like your AC, is comprised of 2 numbers.<br />
<br />
One is your chance TO hit, and the other determines how hard you hit.  Raising your STR will not increase the portion of your attack that determines how often you hit, it just raises the pretty number.   It's analagous how adding more armor on you will not influence how much you get missed, but rather lower the average damage you take per hit.<br />
<br />
You have the same chance to hit a certain mob with 100 str or 80 or whatever your naked is as you do with 255 str.  Try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ILLINI</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So then say for example a level 1 barbarian with 113 Str and an Atk of 56 has the same chance to hit a level 1 mob as a level 1 halfling with 85 Str and an Atk of 36.  <br />
<br />
I would think the Barbarian would hit more often than the Halfling would.  <br />
I am truly clueless...  came across these numbers over at my friends house tonight.  He is trying to convince me to be a Halfling after I said I was planning on being a Barb.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nyyhte</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all of the information. Let me give you some more information and see if I'm thinking correctly. I am a de and i have chosen lower delay/lower dam weapons over higher delay/higher damage weapons. I have been getting +str with items whenever I can. So if my thinking is correct, with my haste/lower delay weapons and higher str, my damage over time will be higher because I'm hitting more often. Am I thinking correctly? Thanks again for all the great info. SW rocks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grimlokk, that is contrary to all the testing that has been done since the original release. ATK is a composite number that is affected by many things (like AC is a combination of avoidance and mitigation). It is an overall representation of your ability to do damage. But raising ATK by 50 point from str is different than raising it with a pure ATK buff. Pure ATK buffs move your hit distribution closer to the max. Str increases your max hit. Neither affect your chance to hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As best I understand how it works, yes.  It will be a small increase in damage, but it will be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going from 200 str to 305 str doesn't change my max hit.  As far as I can tell atk from str is exactly like atk received from say avatar.<br />
<br />
In my mid 50s a 60tp str buff would increase my average hit by 15% which of course corresponds to a 15% increase in damage and from logs this also was shown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiras</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all know that ATK is affected by three things.<br />
<br />
1) Your weapon skill with the currently equipped weapon.<br />
2) Your Strength.<br />
3) Buffs/Effects which directly increase ATK.<br />
<br />
I believe ATK is comprised of two parts; chance to hit and damage table modifier.<br />
<br />
The chance to hit is pretty self-explanatory -- I believe only the weapon skill affects this part of ATK.  The Damage Table Modifier on the other hand is affected by STR and raw ATK buffs.  If you parse yourself for long enough you'll find that there are a certain number of distinct values you can hit for with a given weapon.  This is your damage table for that particular weapon based on it damage rating.  The modal hit is the number that comes up the most frequently.  The damage table modifier shifts your modal hit upwards on the damage table.  So the higher your DTM based on your ATK the higher your avg hit will be and the higher in turn your DPS will be.<br />
<br />
my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grimlokk, that is contrary to all the testing that has been done since the original release. <br />
 <br />
  Indeed. Just look at all that solid testing.<br />
<br />
 OK Gimel go out with 200str and attack something for an hour. Then go at it with 305. I 100% *GUARANTEE* your max hit is exactly the same. Try it with atk buffs and no str buffs even. Get Predator, Ferocity, Vallon, and Strength of Tunare. Will give you 400ish atk without budging your str.<br />
<br />
 I don't know if atk from strength doesn't help connect %. I do know that recently going from 280 to 305 strength made no difference whatsoever to my max hit. It's a myth from the times when str was generally so low that the atk from it *was* significant and enough to get you up to your capped max hit. <br />
Wy theory anyways.<br />
<br />
 But hey, maybe I'm wrong. There's apparently pages and pages of testing to prove it. Maybe I'll try dumping 150str worth of gear to test it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1541<br />
<br />
The testing was done all the way back pre Kunark, and has held up well. It is known that the formula doesn't hold quite true at the high end. How str from 255-305 works has also not been tested. But at lower levels of STR the effects are well documented.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can do some parsing on this sometime soon, but it's going to have to wait until after I play with the taunt stuff that is being discussed in the stickied thread.<br />
<br />
For high levels of STR you may well be right, if so it will be interesting to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">08-02-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tested this myself (mostly with backstab at the time, but later with the warrior).<br />
<br />
Cannot recall exact numbers but I think with windblade my max was 306. Point is... with no strength buff or attack buff I never landed a 306 in hours of logs.<br />
<br />
With my strength buffed up I was landing 306's semi regularly. So one may jump to the conclusion that my max damage was raised by increasing strength.<br />
<br />
However, I took away the strength buffs and instead used raw attack buffs. My max hits were still 306, same as with strength buffed.<br />
<br />
Now, someone could make the argument that both strength and attack raise your max, but I did a further test with both strength and attack buffed and my max remained at 306 (tho I hit for it more often).<br />
<br />
Looking at it logically, it seems safe to assume that my max was always 306, but without buffs my attack was insuficient to realistically reach it. I suppose you could assume there is a cap I am hitting, but while I dont have logs, I do know things like Hand of Ro and killing greens has allowed me to hit for max even without strength and attack buffs.<br />
<br />
It really comes down to semantics. You can say strength raises your max hit, and in cases be correct. But that is not really how it seems to work. A more accurate way of saying it may be that raising strength increases your odds of landing a max hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strength and Attack both increase max hit, however since your max hit is capped so once you hit a certain amount of ATK or STR you aren't going to see an increase in max from either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Str definitely increases your max hit.  But it doesn't take a lot of str or attack buff before you get to where you max hit stop going up.  I think around 200 str is the most strength you'd ever need to max out attack, and less if you have attack buffs of any kind.</div></div><hr />
