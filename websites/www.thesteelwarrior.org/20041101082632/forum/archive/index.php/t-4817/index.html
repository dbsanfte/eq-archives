<br />
Leashing Emp was a good thing because you could get him to the zoneline if you really wanted to.  Beats everyone getting keys, right?  Well, he's not supposed to be at the zoneline and not having half of your raid force dedicated to lockdown makes this bad boy pretty darn easy.  So in a sense, this is what should have been done from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Now, the bad news?  The bad news is, well, very bad.  He cannot venture more than about 5-10ft from his spawn location without warping back, but the range changes depending on direction.  He will warp if he's directly behind his throne-portal or just past the little ramp in front of him that he has, but his range is about double that at 45 degree angles.  It's kinda hard to explain.  For those who have fought him, that's an INCREDIBLY small leash range.  Oh, but that's not all.  Feels like an infommercial, doesn't it?  Upon warping, he mem blurs.  As if the Diminutive Statue and Rage of Ssraeshza procs that he has didn't give enough agro problems to begin with. :P  Oh, but that's not all!  Upon warping, he is also completely dispelled.  Yup, that's right, the Emp is no longer slowed.  Now, while he's no Raex Pwodill or General Rapeass, but an unslowed Emp is still a pretty mean motherfucker.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, we ended up wiping.  We got him to the 40% range when he warped and suddenly jumped up to 72% health.  Talk about a blow to the raid's moral.  <br />
<br />
Sony, if you're reading this, he's still beatable the way he is, but for Christ sake you could have made his leash a little longer than a baby step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So everytime he warped he'd gain 30 percent health?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We did him last night on E'ci<br />
<br />
had the same things happening.<br />
<br />
Leash, Dispell, memblurr on warping. He also seemed to gain lik 3-5% Health on every warp.<br />
<br />
We had a full raid, Keying up all kinds of stragglers for VT, so 72, level 65s with many elemental toys... Fight was Over 30 minutes, Was like the original Emp fights back when level 60 was max...<br />
<br />
Anyone expecting the normal emperor in for a serious eyeopening..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We did him tonight as well.  At first we just thought it was a zonelag bug because another guild was killing HP while we were doing Emp.  After HP died though, it just made Emp warp back to spawn faster....it was completely impossible to hold agro and Im pretty sure the only reason we didnt wipe was because the number of poeple still in zone (about 110) was slowing his attacks down.<br />
Anyway, the encounter is now retarded.  Hope they lengthen his chain so we can at least get him the 30-40 feet to the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killed him yesterday, no problem at all.<br />
We corner him at the corner at your left when you enter his room.<br />
Maybe he dont warp if you put him here, but we got nothing particular on him.<br />
Only diff with previous fights were : Ranger died on bringing him to corner, cause he didn't bought his WS disc before the raid :p <br />
and no trap in the room just before he Emp room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We had the same problem last night.  Had no clue about the change.  Got him to about 74 % before he got pushed out of his leash and CH'd.  Aggro was impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Victori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We went for EMP yesterday on RN and he most certainly did spawn sooner and did warp back to his spawn point about 3 seconds after agro.  What he did next tho seems kinda wierd if in fact he is leashed.  He ran straight for our CC team in the left corner and wiped out half of them.  Aggro was impossible and it seems to me (a cleric) his rampage range was increased.  We thought the encounter was bugged. Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />
