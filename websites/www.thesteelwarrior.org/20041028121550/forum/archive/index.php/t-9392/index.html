<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lilogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the patch message, they said all mobs in expeditions are now KOS.  I gather that means they want us to crawl to that rat and bat if we want to farm them. <br />
<br />
I've not been yet, but am wondering.  Have they also added some see invi mobs to the Fire Pit and the Water Hole?<br />
<br />
I'm questioning why they came about this change.  Did they feel it was too easy to farm the named mobs in the Hive?  Are they trying to force the player base to kill everything from ZI to their camp before setting up?<br />
<br />
Expeditions allowed me log on for 1 or 2 hours at a time, and actually get a shot at drops and runes.  This change now makes it impossible for me to do so.  My 1 or 2 hours would be spent just trying to get to the camp (Hive at least).  I'm a bit dissapointed with this.  I love expeds cause I don't have to fight with other people, endure stupid OOC wars, worry about trains, etc.  XP is not as good as zones like WoS, but I have peace in there.<br />
<br />
This also removes the option to replace a player mid contest, unless you have a mage with you.  Who's gonna want to do all the clearing back to the camp just to go pickup a replacement?<br />
<br />
I figure if they want us to crawl all over the place, they have to make the candy pop in random locations, not at fixed spots.  Off course ppl will park in the same area all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was in a Fire Pits expedition last night and nothing was changed in it.  No mobs see invis.  I never could understand why people would farm the Murkgliders expedition other than the fact that it is safer and the named are somewhat closer to each other.  The potential drops, aside from the runes, are so much better in the other 2 expeditions...at least in the 65-67 version.<br />
<br />
On that same note, you should still be able to move about fairly easily in Murkgliders.  Very few of the murkgliders see through normal invis.  Just kill the few that do, reinvis, and continue on your way.  I would guess that you would not have to stop more than 2-3 times to get to your camp, if that.  Once at the camp, you are likely killing everything anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since the Murkglider Hive expedition has undead (murkgliders) and live (rats/bats) mobs, that one is a little harder to farm now, since you can't just IVU all the way through with the bats/rats being KoS now.  But as far as I know, the Fire Pit and Watering Hole expeditions still only have live mobs that don't see invis, so they are just as easy as they always were to run to and farm the nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lilogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's good news on the other 2 expeditions.  Hive rat drops a very nice earring as a rare.  I agree the rest is negligeable at best.  Goes to tribute usually.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to hear, and surprised no see invi mobs were added to the Pit and Water hole.<br />
<br />
PS Where is the 2nd named located in Pit?  We all know where the noc warrior is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive been wanting to try the other 2 expeditions but I cant seem to find any info on the named and their PHers.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give out some info on where the named and PHers are spawning for the level 70 versions please?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the Fire Pit one with the Lvl 61 trash, the second named is a Dragorn Commoner PH and it is located in the last of the L shaped rooms, one of the 2 at the outside corner of the L.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same PHer in the 65-67 spawned version of the Fire Pits.  Drops are some average shoulders and the rare is a +3 regen aug.  It is the dragorn commoner just past the noc on the left in that room as you enter the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In the watering hole, the first PH is supposed to be a mob in the lower branch of the sideways Y-shaped area straight past the crossroads, according to my map. I tried farming this PH last night, but there was no mob there. I killed 3 other mobs while waiting around half an hour for it to spawn, but never saw it. Also invis'ed to the second named PH, and there was no mob there. Anyone know why this might be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stupid question but does anyone have /locs to the PHers in the 2 expids?<br />
<br />
<br />
I spent a few hours running around in water hole and couldnt find anything.<br />
<br />
Plan on trying the fire pits this weekend if I get time.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kesk Choktau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just download the maps from eqtoolbox; they have the PH spawn points marked on the maps for each expedition.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Advantage to old hive was that I could log in at 3 am, when I couldn't sleep and no friends were on, with my cleric bot itu to camp and dou each ph camp back and forth for runes. Not possible now. Planning to try the others and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>munners7</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Patch was mainly put in place to stop lower level characters getting the expeditions,mainly the hive which had 2ph out of 4 mob rotation.What happened is the lev 48,would get expedition and your lev 70 or whatever character would ivu to the location and solo these few greens which still dropped runes,of coarse everyone else would drop expd and make another solo camp and so on, these camps were held for days, so do a cycle when ever you have the time during the day or night<br />
go back to bed ect ect,so i was there with friends farming runes for days right upto the patch which we were waiting for,but by this time we had farmed enough to equip ourselves and friends with all 66/67/68 spells, about 20 runes each after a couple of days which is better than hunting for a month i guess,and at the time they were selling for like 100k now 50,but couldnt bring myself to selling,so instead we equipped friends guildies that we would play with often,which is as good as equipping yourself when you  think about the newbuffs that you can wear.<br />
So choose what you may why they changed certain things,but thats the real reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In the watering hole, the first PH is supposed to be a mob in the lower branch of the sideways Y-shaped area straight past the crossroads, according to my map.

<br />
   The nameds marked on the watering hole map are for the Lvl 68 version . The 65-57 version the first named is a Girplan mover in the first south branch of the dungeon. Its the middle Girplan of the 3 in the room. And be sure yoiu have someone along with a curse cure as it procs a pretty nasty one that has a 2 hour duration, and takes 100HP 50 mana a tick. First time we killed it no one had cure curse and we had to run back out to the exit where I luckily had the shambot parked.  The second PH there is the Discord Warrior in that northern hall. It is in the little room between the L shaped room and the round room in the middle, West of the one on the map for the higher level version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pelidorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree the nerf in The Murkglider cave is annoying, dont farm there any more. A  regular group of friends and I have been farming the Watering Hole and have found the spawn points shown on Mapfiends map are accurate. We are all level 68 or higher so mobs are level 66 at this time. We have seen several runes and some nice drops as well. The other night we spawned the named at the &quot;Y&quot; twice and the mover spawn once. Pretty easy time just have to watch that invis so it doesnt drop.</div></div><hr />
