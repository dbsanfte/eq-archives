I have heard too much about it, some saying it does and some it doesnt.  Want to know if it is worth getting it or not. Thx :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lelara</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Warriors,<br />
<br />
As an owner of the shield, here's my speculation/theory/observation (no parses though) about it over the last 3 months of using it very regularly.<br />
<br />
It is half-useless (more on the useless side).<br />
<br />
The mob doesn't flip to me when I bash for 120+ crit. There may be occasions where the mob did flip to me when I bash but it is so so sooooooo rare that I may have not noticed.<br />
<br />
I have 3 weapons that I use, Blade of Carnage, Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled and a Prismatic Staff.<br />
<br />
When using Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, I hold aggro quite good because we all know that weapon procs alot. It's because of its proc that I am able to hold aggro quite decently. Downside is it has low HP (50hp only) and ok stats only.<br />
<br />
When using Blade of Carnage, I sometimes hold aggro good, sometimes hold aggro bad. It's all about the BoC's proc. If it procs early, well good for you, the mob loves you. If it doesn't proc, you'll depend on taunt.<br />
<br />
When using Prismatic Weapon, pray your taunt works or your team members get beaten on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good sides about the shield, you have fantastic AC. Trash mobs tend to not max hit you more, clerics complete heal me twice only instead of 3 times when exping in Plane of Fire first castle mobs. A wizard once commented that he could chain nuke a few times but not everytime. So the focus effect may have some effect on the mob but I have no way I can prove it.<br />
As stated on another thread, my high AC can help migate some rampage hits especially from Warlord Gintolaken aka. Wipelord.<br />
<br />
I have MTed Solusek Ro, Sigismond Windwalker (PoAir) and Blazzax the Omnifiend (PoFire) with the shield. I owe my aggro still to the Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled's proc and Orb of the Sky effect (Call of the Sky).<br />
What I would like to try in the near future is MT General Reparm and Xegony and see how well the shield combo does compared with a Blade of War user.<br />
<br />
So does the effect work? I would say more on the No side then Yes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think people are overlooking the fact that even if the focus works, getting 50% more aggro on your proc isn't necessarily more aggro than just using a second weapon.<br />
<br />
Of course, it may not work either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">roughly 30% of your swings come from offhand.  Thats a rogue number with max aa so probably closer to 27ish% with flurry and tripple attack.  Thats a really shitty amount of dps aggro off hand and an even lower amount of aggro given the shit proc rate of Blade of carnage, assuming you dont have anything better.  If you do it may work but imo its not worth the risk of taking excessive 3kish dmg ripostes tanking high end mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will never understand why a warrior would use a shield. Until they let a warrior use a shield with a 2HS weapon, they will always be useless to our class. I would much rather have the added agro and DPS (and thus more agro) from an offhand weapon than a crappy shield that may or may not work. If you think it cuts down on your ripostes significantly more power to you. Your choice to increase the possibility of losing agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they ever want to make shields workable for a tank, they need to have an effect that compensates for the obvious DWing/2hander benefits you're giving up. Yes, a smart raid could compensate for the lack of agro from not wielding in the offhand, but why would they? There has to be enough reason to make that extra effort.<br />
<br />
Maybe a latent 50% spellshield. <br />
Maybe a latent Bulwark of Vie.<br />
Maybe a latent 50% extra agro (like BP or SK line).<br />
<br />
None of these would be worthwhile using 24/7. None of them would be worth using in your regular DPS group. If you're fighting a mob with high melee dps, you switch in the second shield for lower dps, lower agro, but a noticable increase in melee tanking ability. Next mob has some nasty AEs, so you switch to the spellshield shield instead, still with reduced agro, but you don't get hit so much by the AEs. Maybe a skilled warrior could DW, switching in the shield when the timed AE is about to fire. Next boss has a slow/stun. Now you need more agro, so in with the third shield. 2 months later you've killed the first mobs a few dozen times, gotten a good slice more hps and AC, so you don't need the shield any more. Switch back to DWing or a high agro 2hander.<br />
<br />
As it stands right now though, shields offer a negligable benefit in terms of ac/hp over dual wielding, at the expense of 25-40% less agro than an offhander. Than ac/hp difference is worthless if you're taking more ripostes than a 2hander.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Change furious bash to a Voice of Thule buff clone.<br />
<br />
Thats stacks with VoT, and is war only usable clicky <br />
<br />
Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's a clicky, you might as well put the item on a ring or a 2/200 2hb staff or a Doll. If they want us to use shields, click effects will do nothing to help that/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didnt explain enough :)  <br />
<br />
The best of all is the Calliav series for mage...<br />
A rune that poof after taking 1 or 2 or 3 &quot;damage sources&quot;<br />
(damage source = 1 dmg nuke or 4000dmg riposte)<br />
<br />
So you can probably code &quot;item/damage/focus&quot; checks<br />
It shouldnt be too had to script a buff too.<br />
<br />
Lets see ....   &quot;Furious Hate7&quot; <br />
Spell description : Decrease Agro Multiplier by 70%<br />
Limitation 1 : Clickable only by Warriors<br />
Limitation 2 : Poofs the second &quot;Shield of Strife&quot; is unequiped<br />
<br />
shouldnt be too hard :)</div></div><hr />
