<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, i noticed that you like Dex and Agility, which are almsot completely worthless atm.  You need to sell your rings, and get some 6 ac 65 hp rings, and sell those earings for BESS, the 35 hp/25 mana(?) earrigns that are like 300-400pp each.<br />
<br />
Then, just remember that AC&gt;HP&gt;STA, you can some Crustacean Armor for very cheap, get a helm and bracer to repalce the one of agitation.<br />
<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace for your neck would be a HUGe upgrade aswell<br />
<br />
For feet, look into Chokidai Hide boots, like 115 sta and 40 hp is REALLY nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't bother with crusty at your levels...look more into Thurg/SS mq's or you could get Tribunal cultural, which is really nice.<br />
<br />
Face- Grobb Hide Mask adds 40 hp I believe.<br />
Waist- Slot with no stats=BAD. Get a Spider Fur Belt or something to that liking for that slot. Just go for SCHW on the hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MQs=2k atleast, crusty=200 max, By looks of equip, it seems like she doesn't have much money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">STA and HP's, you need both.  If possible, get a group to go to UP and farm moktar, free nodrop upgrades, moktar is better than you currently have in most slots, and at 52, should be good exp.  Also look at camping Soulscream belt in Veksar, more haste and decent stats in waist slot.  SCHW is another possible upgrade you can get farming.<br />
<br />
Now for the stuff you need to buy.    Ears, as mentioned the 35 hp ears would be a nice upgrade.  Fingers should be the 6/65 rings.  Clattering Bone Necklace for neck would also be great.  Bracer, either Fine Heraldric or Helenic Tundra if you can afford it, otherwise, maybe bracer of scavenging.  Crusty helm would be a big, cheap upgrade for you untill you can get something better.  Acrylia Studded Boots would be an awesome upgrade for cheap as well.  Crystal Spider Eyes maybe for face for a few more hp's.<br />
<br />
Remeber that your gear is always a work in progress, so always keep an eye out for ways to upgrade.  Try and get in on Kael raids as soon as possible, Thurg quest gear is not the greatest armor, but it is not bad either.  There is also some nice 60 HP gloves that drop rarely near arena -).</div></div><hr />
