I will finely (after a looong time) have gotten 1492+ points in nro camp in ldon. My plan has always been to get the bp but now I am not that sure anymore. What piece should I get first considering what I have now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, bracer or gloves is the best slot to get.<br />
<br />
If you get ornate bracer or ornate gaunts, you cannot put a 40hp aug in it.  If you get the Takish bracer or Takish gauntlets, you can (giving you 110hp in wrist slot).<br />
<br />
I'd get a bracer if I were you...but others will have other opinions.</div></div><hr />

It looks like your BP or leggings would be the largest initial upgrade in terms of straight ac and hp. However, if you're willing to get the haste augment for your helm, you might end up with the largest upgrade by later replacing your cloak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah pants from EF camp are better bargin, and even out in HP when you add in the +sta on the Miraguls ones. I'd also have to say bracer. Augmented with a +40 HP aug and you're pretty set till upper Elementals, but nothing you buy will have a huge upgrade impact on you until you are able to augment them. Definately start doing EF adventures, or Guk to unlock weapon augments</div></div><hr />

The 1492 points only nets you a 8 (13ish) AC improvment. One more 510 aug from BB would give you 10(16) AC. Since the will be moveable as of tomorrow, that is my advice.</div></div><hr />
