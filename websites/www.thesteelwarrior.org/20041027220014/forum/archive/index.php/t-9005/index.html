<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garthax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I plan on playing a PvE warrior to max level when WoW goes retail.  I want to be a raid tank for my guild.<br />
<br />
Is the Toughness talent not worth the 5 points?  Especially now that the max talent points has dropped to 51.<br />
<br />
At first, I thought a +AC talent would be a must have, but...<br />
<br />
180 AC seems like nothing when top warriors on Thottbot have over 4K.  And this is before max level and raid content armor drops.  I would expect AC values to easily go over 5,000 for raid-tanks.<br />
<br />
If we end up with over 5000 AC, then there are a lot of other talents I would rather spend my points on rather than an extra 180.<br />
<br />
Opinions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldn't expect for things to work the same for raids in WoW as they do in other games. So I'm not sure what to say. Grab your taunt/agro talents, and then focus on defensive talents. Keep in mind talents are still being worked out. Toughness needs a bit of tuning, and I expect it will get some, before release.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, even items are still being balanced, so your armor figures may end up changing.</div></div><hr />
