<br />
I did gulch pretty heavily the last few weeks, pulled my ass up to stone guard, got pissed off at most of the people doing gulch heavily, and my drive to spend time there kinda fizzled out.  <br />
<br />
So I'm screwing around doing various other PvE objectives, roaming the countryside kililng people for whatever honor they're worth just to try to keep my rank steady until I forget why I stopped going to gulch and go back, I get an invite to 5 man scholo, with an actual decent group.  Sweet, I got Krastinov's Bag of Horror's that's been in my log forever.<br />
<br />
We drop Jandice in pretty good time, and figure hey, what the hell, it's clear, might as well run out and turn this in.  Well, good plan, except for the alliance zerg that gathers outside every instance (seriously..do you need 10-15 people to do every fucking instance in the game?  Come on..the loot sucks shit in Scholo, why the fuck are you raiding it?).  I manage to sneak out (getting the door open is a trick when you're getting beat on), turn in the quest, pick up the Blood, and intimidate my way back in with 5 alliance beating on me.<br />
<br />
We drop down to the porch and spawn Kirtonos.  Lots of shit happens, and I end up dying.<br />
<br />
Now, what do you do when you die in Warsong gulch, which is the only goddamned thing I've done for the past month?  You release as quick as you can to try to hit the timer and get back into the action.<br />
<br />
Doh.<br />
<br />
No kill credit for Kirtonos.<br />
<br />
Drops Valor boots.<br />
<br />
Double doh, no kill credit.  Can't loot.<br />
<br />
You bastards.</div></div><hr />
