Watch for the clues, I can't remember them all.<br />
<br />
Some are along these lines<br />
<br />
Master of mind and body is needed<br />
<br />
A fighter of strenth and cunning<br />
<br />
Someone of strength and ingenuity<br />
<br />
someone with healing powers<br />
<br />
One who can appear dead<br />
<br />
etc<br />
<br />
I won't give out the answers but when the sentinal dies he will say something similar to the above.<br />
<br />
Spot this and on the next attempt allow the class you think it is to have the kill shot</div></div><hr />

Its my understand that it takes into account the classes that are in the raid and you won't get a message for the class thats not present.</div></div><hr />

Our guild leader *still* refuses to believe this about the Marauder.  He's convinced it has to be done based on a type of magic.  Fire, cold, poison, disease, or magic.<br />
<br />
No matter how many times we've explained it, there is just no convincing him.  So eventually we'll have the Marauder actually keel over and stay down, and he'll say: &quot;see, I told you it had to be killed by fire based spells.&quot;<br />

When you see it says it's changing it goes to another class-based kill but it seems to go in a cycle.  In the end though it's probably easier just to keep on kill it until it stops coming back than trying to figure out which class kill it's changing to.</div></div><hr />

&lt;sigh&gt;You guys do have a channel to coordinate the kill shot that your GL doesn't know about right?</div></div><hr />

took me an hour of going through logs to find the sheme, it's not to hard. and by the time i had it, another guildy posted the same. Since than he went down with second killshot every time</div></div><hr />

No, we didn't have one when we were still doing Ikk 3.  I think most of us just sat back in our chairs and laughed while we did this part.  I know I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drep</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI...The Maurader is actually half way easy once you get the pattern down.  <br />
<br />
To make it easy, put him in corner.<br />
<br />
Then kill him twice if you need to, in order to understand the pattern.<br />
<br />
His pattern goes_____(edited)<br />
<br />
You will see him emote stuff during the fight.  everytime he emotes the kill goes to the next in the order listed above.   When you kill him with the wrong class, he will give you a hint to who has to kill him.   That hint tells exactly where in the order you are.   Now pay attention to the emotes while killing him.  Everytime he emotes...move to the next in line on the list above for the kill shot.<br />
<br />
We have wiped to this dude so many times till we figured this out.  Now we pretty much go in and take him down with little issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
P.S. Has anyone got an endurance aug from this raid for a while? I heard they were removed, but after getting 4 endurance augs in 2 runs we said to hell with the trial.</div></div><hr />

Haha  ok, was just trying to help.  :)      I don't see an edit button (or at least don't have one on that post)...Some moderator come over and delete my assistance.   hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pling</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also the event has been fixed so as to not include a class that you dont have at your raid. <br />
<br />
Last night we got the message &quot;blah blah... Tribunal&quot; from one of the Sentinels and we knew from previous raids that it meant that a Shammy was the class for the kill.<br />
<br />
But we didn't have any shammys in the raid.<br />
<br />
We tried every other class we could think of but nothing mattered, finally we ran a couple of boxed shammys to KT and got them inside and tada, the Sentinel stayed dead after a boxed shammy got the killshot (or killdot in this case)<br />
<br />
Then Maruader popped as usual.<br />
<br />
We had shammys in the raid when we started the expedition, but they had all logged off when we reached the Sentinels room. So beware, don't let the last member of a class log when doing ikky3:Trancendance.</div></div><hr />

lol no reason to stop doing it once you figure it out.   You should be able to clear this entire event a couple hours.</div></div><hr />

but now when we go back to do it,it dont seem to follow that list.is it random at first?<br />
til after you kill him once, then the list picks up where you killed him last?<br />
say you killed him and it fell on hybred,does it restart on hybred and goes through the list.like hybred,melee,priest,caster back to hybred and so forth?<br />
didnt get to try it much,since its a pita to get many wanting to go back to redo this trial lol.</div></div><hr />

ya.. Rog's &lt;3 that dagger for some reason.  Thankfully about all our Rogues have them now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This trial sucks.<br />
<br />
Man, you're rogues bettered never complain about consents again(ignoring the new consent features) if you actively farmed this trial for their daggers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">allamar</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it is Random classes at the start or just finding out where in the order of classes hes on.<br />
basically,you have to kill him once normally,see what class type he dies on.<br />
then rekill him as he repops by counting down the changes.til you hit the class he died on the first time.<br />
 Melee,Priest,Caster,Hybred.so if he dies on caster,then count down starting on hybred,melee,Priest then on the 4th change it should be the kill shot class.keep him at 5% let what ever class type kill him.<br />
then you can either kill Vrex or just run out of the room and recoup for him.<br />
<br />
the thing we were messing up on is,you cant leave the room after the first one dies.you have to jump on the repoped one and start the count down.<br />
running out of the room after first one dies,winds up leashing him and resets the random classes over again.</div></div><hr />
