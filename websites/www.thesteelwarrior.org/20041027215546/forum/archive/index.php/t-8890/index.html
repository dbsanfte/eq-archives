<br />
Ability: Shield Block <br />
Description: This ability grants you the chance to fully block an attack when using a shield. Increased ranks improve the chance to block attacks. <br />
Cost per Level: 3 <br />
<br />
Does the majority here then recommend using a DBoW with an uber sheild to tank with? I have yet to ever use a sheild but was open to the possibility when tanking.<br />

So based on that link, shield block reduces damage taken by as much as 20 percent (20.75%) for Shield Block 3?<br />
<br />
Defensive usually lowers damage by around 20 to 30 percent, so either warriors start using shields or we can be replaced by any similar pal/sk?<br />
<br />
This will also mean most equal knights can now tank any raid mob in PoP and below?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Those numbers posted there are outdated, probably from when the AA first went live on beta.  It reduces hits by 5%ish at level 3, from a quick parse last nite.  In any case, before it was tuned, I never saw it reducing 20% of hits, don't know where you get these numbers, 10% would be more accurate going by PoNs.  In either case it's not true, the sky is not falling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know where you're getting the 10% figure from either, 6.98% reduction of hits is what the parse with shield block 3 says. Sounds close enough to that 5ish%, if you have any data please share =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I ran some tests at level 3 (not 1 or 2, I got all the levels at once), and based off the inherent block skill as well as the lack of ripostes from unequipping the offhand weapon, basically, it was a rough 8% decrease in the amount of hits that landed on me at level 70.<br />
<br />
Note: Used a level 70 mob for 6 hours of testing at each interval<br />
<br />
Also to note:  My DPS was 74 including bash, without the extended flurry AA's with a Darkblade and Ivory Etched Aegis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bumraz Isengard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So from what I am gathering, this particualr AA, (which is not warrior only and thus brings the knight classes a bit closer to our dmg mitigation) will help. Seing as it's a passive ability and the combinatin of using a sheild and high aggro 1hs makes sense.... Did I get that right?<br />

<br />
Just curious.  How does that compare to a pally using Hopebringer + shield or an SK using cudgel + shield?  I realise we're not a DPS class but IMO if they want shields to be viable for warriors, we need to do DPS similar to a knight with 1h + shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Relevant parses are here. (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6989) Note DPS from cudgel parse, and slash parse from DBotW and Hammer of the Timeweaver. Also, note that real knight DPS will be lowered by the need to cast. The warrior w/ 1h and shield could probably use a small boost, preferably one that is not from itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Forgot about that parse.  So it looks like warriors do about 84% of what a knight does with 1h + shield.  That isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Seems like it needs a bit of a boost though.  Maybe a warrior only AA that increases bash damage with a shield or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm sure knights would be perfectly happy for warriors to get the ridiculous bash aa they got in GoD. 45 aa for 25 damage bonus to bash is cool! I mean, heck, that's like 1% more dps! =D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I parsed a Brutish Blade of Balance + shield for about 45 minutes on a level 70 punching bag mob.  Did about 110 dps on it from the front but I think its AC was pretty low.  This was with 46% item haste only and no bashing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm, I'm not sure a parse from behind the mob is completely accurate in this discussion, since it's about a Shield Block AA which would only come into affect while you were tanking (i.e., in front of the mob).<br />
<br />
I would have assumed that warriors would end up about equal while using a shield and tanking, considering not only innate triple attack, higher skill caps, and Flurry AAs, but also considering Tactical Mastery AAs because Shield Block would only be relevant while in front and tanking, despite having a lower ratio one-hander.  Perhaps Tactical Mastery would bring it up to about even?</div></div><hr />
