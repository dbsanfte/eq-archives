<br />
I am currently wielding a BoC/CHoS.  Both are un-augged.  I am not a raid warrior and pretty much just do groupage with friends, etc.  I really don't seem to have any problems in the aggro department and was wondering if i would be better of getting DPS augs for my weapons instead of more aggro type augs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhisz</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could go with the ykesha augs from Guk. They seem like ok dps upgrades, and are certainly better aggro than pure DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd look for a 2Her to get more DPS out of your setup ( EDIT: i see you got a WMBS; look for a ykesha or lifetap proc for that to get your DPS up instead )...your 1Hers ar nice; for sure; but once yo start gaining more AA's you're going to be much better off with a 2Her and augment the 2Her with a lifetap or some DD.<br />
<br />
but if anyhting, look for anger on your 1Hers. you might not have problems now but later on when you get higher and higher up in the progression with your friends you're going to find your reliable aggro go less and less ( esp when your friends become more powerful too through AA's and spells )..</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would seriously going the extra mile for anger3 in the BoC though, as it will last you practically forever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice.<br />
<br />
I understand that 2handers are they way to go for DPS.  Its just that in my usual group I am always the MT so I hardly ever bring out the WMBS, etc.    Was just wondering if I would be better off squeezing a little more DPS out of my aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
But the more I think about it i think its best to stick with the rule:<br />
<br />
&quot; Aggro is for aggro and DPS is for DPS&quot;<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does your regular group have a wizard, mage, necro, shaman, druid, etc. type person who provides a significant portion of the group's damage output?  Does that person ever go OOM, or are they limited by aggro?<br />
<br />
You may feel happier doing 10 DPS more, but if your mage friend could do 50 DPS more, then it is better for your group if you increase your aggro rather than your DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well our group is usually:<br />
<br />
65 Warrior (Me)<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Druid<br />
64 Pally<br />
64 Rogue<br />
<br />
And whoever else we can get to join us.<br />
<br />
So 95% of the time the Druid is our heaer so not much DPS from her.<br />
<br />
Like I said thus far no problems with Aggro but I can see it becomming an issue as everyone gains level/gear and depending on who we add as the 6th group member.  <br />
<br />
Im just gonna concentrate on doing my job which is aggro.  I did the math and what tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny extra bit of DPS i might add isnt worth the chance at having aggro issues.<br />
<br />
My current plan is to Anger3 the BoC and Anger2 the CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My two cents... anger 2 is a waste... if you're considerring putting that proc on an agro weapon, then put a yak aug on it instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for your situation i would say ykesha augs. your rogue friend will get tripple backstab eventualy and prolly be your biggest agro concern. the ykesha should be enough to hold it so they don't have to evade ever time they bs. the enchater is like a one shot agro per fight and will prolly gank agro anyway unless you get the fabled early proc. while the rogue will be constant agro draw.<br />
<br />
do not let other members of you group get ykesha augs. if they do it will negate the agro you gain from yak/anger2.</div></div><hr />

When you do not have problems holding aggro in your group WHY do you want to have more aggro for less damage?<br />

<br />
When you do have problems holding aggro in your group WHY do you want to make more damage for less aggro?<br />
<br />
Sure you can say maxed aggro is alltime the best, but a dead mob is better.<br />
<br />
Think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... and having not maxxed aggro, and thus a dead slower/healer/dpser in group, which results in the mob owning the rest of the group in turn... is better how?<br />
<br />
In group/raid, all out aggro is what to go for 99% of the time. And an extra ~5 dps from dd augs is insignifiant when compared to an extra 1200-1800 aggro via anger augs. Warriors can do all the dps they want, but if you can't keep aggro, you aren't doing your job. Better by far to have over the top aggro and do 5 less dps, than do 5 more as you watch your healer/slower get owned.<br />
<br />
Granted, Gaylon isn't having aggro problems atm. But what happens when the rog gets 65, some AAs, and a good poker? Or when the enchanter gains more mana, and can throw some nukes at mobs in addition to mez/slow/etc.? Also, with a random 6th person in the group, it might be an ele+ beastlord, necro, ranger, etc etc who has much better gear than the rest of the group. Without a decent amount of weapon affinity, and/or good aggro augs, that 6th person will be the tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pretty much have the same situation as Gaylon I am doing ok at the moment but can see in the near future problems. I know I am only 55 and I am working on Levels but I for one will go straight for Anger Augments for my two weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point some are making is that unless you have YOUR end-game weapons (i.e. you don't see a weapon upgrade in your 3-6 month future) you may want to go with a less costly hate aug depending upon how fast you accumulate ldon points.  Between anger 2 and Yak, you'll get more hate AND dps with the yak aug for the same point cost.<br />
<br />
This is especially a considerration for weapons like BoC which are tradeable..would you rather remove a 510 point yak aug or a 1150 pt anger 3 aug when you go to sell it after receiving an upgrade?</div></div><hr />

When you do not have problems holding aggro in your group WHY do you want to have more aggro for less damage? <br />
Because having &quot;no aggro problems&quot; just means that you have cautious nukers.  In most groups, the DPS nukers are *always* holding back to some extent.  Accept the fact that you, the warrior, are incapable of producing enough aggro to let them use their mana arbitrarily.  <br />
<br />
If your usual group has no such DPS members, then sure, focus on your own DPS.  But in a typical balanced group, reducing your own DPS by say 10% to get better aggro might make the group as a whole increase its DPS by 30%.<br />
<br />
I remember the taste of humble pie when my wizard friend explained to me, very patiently, that he was incapable of going below 40% mana in a group with me, because if he used his mana any faster then he would take aggro and die.  It took me a while to really accept that he was not exaggerating.  That was a year ago when he had negligible flowing thought.  (Clearly, I had negligible aggro to match his negligible flowing thought.)<br />
<br />
Every time I got a weapon or aggro upgrade, he and my druid friend are the first ones to notice it.  They're constantly toeing that line where my aggro sits, seeing how much DPS they can fit in below my own aggro limit.  They typically notice it long before my healer friends notice it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also gonna throw in the fact that warrior aggro, other than incite, is based solely on the RNG. I know for a fact I'm not the only person who has had 1 aggro proc on 1 mob, followed by 10+ on the next. (This with wa3, and 3 aggro procs). For every extra aug or level of WA, your chances of getting a proc early on in each fight rises. Eventually, with wa5 and 4 aggro procs, you average something like 1 proc every 5 seconds. This seems godly, but again, I guarantee you will see fights with only 1 or 2 aggro procs. It will happen much less frequently than if you had lower wa and a few dd/lifetap procs over aggro procs.<br />
<br />
Best case senario is to have either a good DW combo (16+1/20, 17/20, etc are good for vt/early ele and lower) or a nice 2hander. These are the weapons you should put the pure dd or lifetap proc in. The other weapon setup should have weapons that proc taunting blow, enraging blow, stun/dd, and even things like ac debuff (I love my OSoW off VZ). Put anger/yak augs in these, and by all means, only spend 510 points if you see an upgrade coming your way soon.</div></div><hr />

There in lies the question for me.  Honestly i about 98% sure that for me the BoC is an end-game weapon.   Im not in a guild, im not flagged for anything beyond PoV/PoS, etc.  I don't think ill be seeing much in terms of weapon upgrades to the BoC.   But im a long ways from being able to get Anger3 so ill definately think about things.  Seems to me that for me a BoC w/ Anger 3 will probably last me the rest of my days in EQ.<br />
<br />
As for the offhand CHoS seems to be about the best im gonna have access to for a LONG time but...i just have issues with spending Aug points on it atm.  Most of my points for the forseable future are for armor upgrades anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I wouldn't waste points augging your offhand weapon.  The CHoS is a weapon that you will want to replace eventually, and the offhand procs so rarely that you won't get significant hate or dps from adding an extra proc to your offhand.</div></div><hr />

That was my thinking exactly :)<br />
<br />
Now the question becomes:  Is there anything a gimp 65 Warrior can get with a few friends to upgrade the CHoS? :)</div></div><hr />

Hehe the last thing i need to do is come up with more stuff that i need points for.  As it is, EQ will be long dead before I get the points i currently want :)<br />
<br />
But yeah, ive looked at i dont see any upgrades to CHoS comming my way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
blade of carnage is one of the best tradeable agro weapons and if you are not into raiding i doubt you will upgrade it anytime soon. you might choose to buy a dps weapon to tote along for times say when you are not main tank. but augmenting an uber agro weapon with anything but an uber agro augment seems to be missing the whole point of why this agro weapon is so expensive. because people want it for agro and agro only .. and you should too.<br />
<br />
as for the CHoS in the offhand i strongly disagree with the statement about it being a waste to aug the offhand. my offhand weapon procs so much i used to get confused which weapon which proc was on. oh i suppose i could see putting a less expensive proc on it than the anger III proc that you WILL put on the BOC. but for goodness sakes put at least SOMETHING on it even if its that cheapo 40point aug you get from takish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes i think that is what i will do.  Most likely go with a Yak aug.  After looking around I have to accept that in my situation CHoS is the best im gonna have for quite some time so I need to be smart and make the best use out of it.</div></div><hr />
