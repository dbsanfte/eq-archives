<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a bunch of parsing this weekend (4-5 8+ hour parses of different weapons) and I was a little bit suprised by the results of my 2h weapon parses.<br />
<br />
It turns out, with full offensive AA (ferocity, PB, pop flurry, etc), I swing a 2h weapon just 1.85 times per round on average.<br />
<br />
With added double attack rate, the innate chance to triple attack, an added swing chance due to punishing blade, and flurry that adds 1 additional attack when it fires, I still only swing my sword 1.85 times per round.<br />
<br />
With a 1h weapon, I swing it 1.80 times per round, meaning punishing blade (which works on 2h only) adds only 1.85/1.80 = 2.8% increase in damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure that your math is right?  Looking at a parse of mine from this weekend with Fero3, PB3 and Flurry1 I get the following numbers with 2h<br />
<br />
# swings in round      % of the time<br />
1                                 31%<br />
2                                 48%<br />
3                                 14%<br />
4                                 6%<br />
4+                               1%<br />
<br />
If I do the math this works out to about 1.98 attacks per round for 2h.</div></div><hr />

<br />
start time 10:56:31; end time 14:26:52 = 12621 seconds.<br />
<br />
Heracus Helsin says 'Guards!! Guards!!' 7611 times (he says it once per round of attacks).  23 delay wep, 40% item haste is 2.3 / 1.4 = 1.64 seconds per swing.  12621 sec / 1.64 = 7682 rounds expected or within 1% of actual value of 7611.<br />
<br />
14034 / 7611 = 1.8466 attacks per round on average</div></div><hr />

DW and 2h?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So with just 1 one hand weapon in your primary you get 1.8 swings per round?  That's odd that they are so close, especially from what people have been saying about punishing blade being so good for 2 handers.  Out of curiosity it would be interesting if you did the same for 2 1handers (primary,secondary) so we could get an idea of how much duel wield changes the 1.8 number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ODB,<br />
He says he has max offensive aa's so I believe that should add up like this:<br />
2 Hander:<br />
3 (natural triple) + 1 (punishing blade) + 2 (flurry) = 6<br />
<br />
1 Hander:<br />
3 (natural triple) + 2 (flurry) = 5<br />
<br />
So 6 for 2h'r and 5 for 1h'r, max possible swings per round, which looks like happens quite rarely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Max for DW - 7 (main - 5 (triple, flurry) off - 2 (double))<br />
Max for 2h - 6 (triple, PB, flurry)<br />
<br />
Likelyhood of either of those is very low</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe oops missed that he said dw, ya add 2 to that 5 for dw, although I think Solinar did his 1h'r test with just a primary weapon and not duel wielding (maybe not?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So master of the obvious will say that 2/7 and 2/6 is bad? I would hope so, and I would hope someone will take note of that at their next &quot;Tune the Coffeemakers Meeting&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: better yet! give casters, healers, and hybrids a 2/7 or 2/6 chance of having a spell successfully land!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 (natural triple) + 1 (punishing blade) + 2 (flurry) = 6<br />
<br />
From everything I can tell, flurry is a single attack, not a double.<br />
<br />
It only fires on triple+ attack rounds, and in a 6ish hour log I hand counted some numbers with a 2hs.<br />
<br />
184 total flurries<br />
<br />
174 for 4 attacks<br />
<br />
10 for 5 attacks.<br />
<br />
0 for 6 attacks.<br />
<br />
If flurry were a potential double attack, one would assume it to be the same double attack rate check as mainhand double attack check.<br />
<br />
The numbers just dont work out for flurry to be 1 OR 2 atacks. I am pretty much convinced it is 1 attack.  If someone can show me a 6 attack round with a 2h attacking the back of a mob, or a 5 attack round with a 1h weapon (and obviously not the same type weapon in offhand),  I will change this opinion.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if there is a potential double attack, its less than 5% of the time.<br />
<br />
My take, flurry is a single attack potentially added to triple+ attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ripostes are changing my numbers, but its hard to say exactly how.  I mean some ripostes would land in rounds when I was attacking and boost up my average number of attacks, while others would land in rounds where I didnt attack and these would lower my  average number of attacks.<br />
<br />
If I get a chance I will do some more parses on this subject.  For the record I use EQcompanion to parse and it automatically splits out the number of attacks per round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I found another log and parsed it here is what I got with PB3, Fero3, Flurry1 for two handed weapons<br />
<br />
Number of attacks: 3,183<br />
Number of ripostes: 183<br />
<br />
<br />
# attacks per round          % of the time<br />
    1                             33%<br />
    2                             51%<br />
    3                             14%<br />
    4                              2%<br />
<br />
<br />
Doing the math this averages out to ~1.85 attacks per round the same as the initial poster.  <br />
<br />
The fact that I have a small number of ripostes included in the attacks I dont think really changes the outcome very much.  Since I was using a 40 delay weapon with 100% haste I would tend to attack every 2 seconds.  If you figure that ripostes (which are based on mob attacks not my attacks) have an equal chance at happening at any time aproximately half of them would happen when I did not attack in that round and thus show up under the 1 attack per round category.  The other 1/2 would show up in the 2,3,4 attacks per round categories.  This combined with the relatively small number of ripostes compared to attacks tends to minimize their effect.  If anything including ripostes would tend to skew the results to show fewer attacks per round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote from the AA window - This ability will allow you to perform up to 2 additional attacks from your primary hand.<br />
<br />
Never noticed the &quot;up to&quot; part before, I had just assumed it was 2 each time.  Gonna run some parses later if I have time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">interesting. i looked at my logs didn't count or anything to do the math. i was quite amazed and it looks like the numbers would match. i defintly saw that dw made more 4/5 attacks the 2h 3/4 PB 1 Fero 1 no flurry. 2h almost always dubbled but enough 1 hiters to bring the average down to solinars numbers some tripples but not enough. while dw stayed a constant 4/5 with the oddball 3 and  2 rarely. <br />
<br />
the dps still fell infavor of the 2h though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So is it even worth getting all the offensive AA's? Or am I going to spend points in all this just to have a greater chance at not hitting because I have more possible attacks per round?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if Punishing blade and Flurry are an either or type thing, I suppose it's possible.  <br />
<br />
Seems like Punishing blade or at least something to do with 2h'rs is broken, there should definately be more than a 2.7% difference in attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Class	Total	DPS	Hit%	AvgMod	Single	Double	Triple	Quad+	Atk/Rnd	Crit%<br />
Monk	684793	134.5	52.0	3.8	33%	51%	14%	1%	1.81	3.9	<br />
Pal	762397	111.9	49.1	3.6	34%	59%	6%	1%	1.74	0<br />
War	759716	136.6	52.5	3.9	32%	55%	10%	3%	1.84	6.9<br />
From my defense/offense comparison of monks/pally/warriors months ago.  Pretty close I would say.<br />
<br />
Very strange that it is cutting my lines like that.  Oh well, I got 1.84 for warriors and 1.81 for monks. <br />
<br />
BTW Solinar this is the testing that I did that shows that a warrior is more effective with a given weapon than a monk is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiddinn</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For mobs a flurry is one extra round on whoever is tanking it, is it not?<br />
<br />
That would make player flurry the same as one extra round that is not affected by AA and cannot tripple attack?  <br />
<br />
Just throwin somethin out there.<br />
