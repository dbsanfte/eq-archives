rangers/bards/rogues scream its poor agro i honestly thing they are jelous. suggestions? wanting to put it primary with spike driver offhand depending on how good the agro from it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tricsun-Drinal</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering about the proc on this, and on the CHoS.  Does it have a knockback?  I've been using it mostly in BoT so i don't notice any, but http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=22 says different.  I've also had people tell me that they don't produce a knockback.  Anyone have some solid evidence?  And btw, it's very nice weapon, well worth it.  :D</div></div><hr />

As per agro, most are saying it's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GBoS rules, some of the warriors in my guild even mainhand it instead of BoC.  My guild doesn't work on a DKP system so I am not sure what it would cost to loot, but honestly the GBoS is much easier to get than most other agro dual wield weapons so the cost should be pretty low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a pretty good weapon for difficulty, not sure how it compares to the droga / nurga pair but I wanted one untill I looted my Bloodfrenzy, to pair with my BoC (Previously using BoC / SoD) if  that gives you any idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has 1ft knockback on it, as most spells with a stun proc built in have.  It is a wonderful weapon, and I love mine to death.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it procs more than BoC, its worth main handing with BoC in offhand. force shock is great agro, and you get to use ingenuity for the eye candy !<br />
<br />
i would think its superior to the droga weapons but no way to test definatively, certainly better stats. only have one in guild but it does great from what i have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got mine about a week ago.  I love the thing.  I'm even, /gasp!, giving my GSoT to a guildie in need!  (Hell, I paid 20k for it, now its selling around 1k, why not?)<br />
<br />
GBoS kicks ass.  Though mine takes a couple fights to warm up, but after that, I get on a roll and my agro is pretty good.  My rogues don't have to work so hard evading when I use it =)<br />
<br />
Needless to day, I'm increidbly happy with it, and would suggest it to any warrior who can get it to get it.  Its also great to hear that its agro is in line with BoC, since my guild can never find statue/idol up =/</div></div><hr />

Those warriors in my guild with the Pair always main hand BoC and offhand the GBoS. They tried it using the GBoS main hand and found they preferred BoC main hand.<br />
If a GBoS interests you, and you dont have better already then go ahead and grab one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I would rank the agro of GBoS above SoD but below BoC.  I haven't used any of the droga weapons, but I would think that the GBoS would destroy those.  It has a much better ratio, better stats and a stun + DD proc.  Plus the GBoS looks pretty cool, my friends call it the batsword, cause the hilt looks like the batman symbol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason that the Droga hammer (CHOS) was mentioned is because it has the same proc as the Great Blade of Storms.<br />
<br />
I have the Cord Hilted Spiked Driver from Xanamech, and I bought the Droga hammer just to try it out in offhand.  I find that the proc on the CHOS/GBOS is equal or better than the proc on the Xanamech hammer in terms of producing aggro.  Force Shock appears to produce about 500 pts of hate, regardless of whether the mob resists or is stun-immune.<br />
<br />
I imagine the Great Blade of Storms' extra melee output would put it above the Xanamech hammer in overall effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binidin</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have also been wondering about this weapon for awhile. I used a chos and was not at all impressed with it, i much prefer chsd and red epic for dual wield.  Everyone I have talked to about gbos has had nothing but good things to say about it, but with my current combo is it really worth getting?  I know red epic ratio blows but the proc is great agro and it seems to proc alot.  Is there anyone with all 3 weapons that would care to comment on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has better stats, better ratio, and has the better of the two procs of the droga weapons.  What's to test?<br />
<br />
I bagged an SoD for it.  I might mainhand it over the BoC for DPS, but I think the BoC is superior for aggro.<br />
<br />
It does look great, and I get comments on it all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got all 3, and I've had the red epic bagged for months.   GBoS + CHSD are a very nice agro combination, easily attainable with fairly similar raid forces.<br />
<br />
Recently killed a dual-wielding AoW, and I main-hand that new BoC with the GBoS in off-hand now, unless I actually want to do damage to a mob, in which case I use my GSo4W. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I main hand the GBoS offhand CHSD...this thing rocks for aggro and dps.  Proc is usually very consistant as well..it typically procs 6-7 times on an exp mob.  I don't have any proof...but it seems to be more hate then the taunting blow.  Only people I have aggro issues with are the other 2 warriors in my guild that have GSo4W...can't keep up with them :p.<br />
<br />
On boss fights if I'm mtin I'll put the chsd main till it procs once then swap back....but when these two start going off (which is VERY common) not even an over nuking wizard pulls aggro...its great :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a GBoS as my primary weapon.  I have counted as many as 17 procs on a single BoT giant (the easy ones by the hub) and 10 to 12 procs a fight is normal.  It has really nice agro as well as high DPS compared to other weapons I have used and its incredibly easy to get if you have 20 or so friends and a couple of hours to do a BoT tower raid or two.  The drop rate on these is also a lot higher than it was a few months ago.</div></div><hr />
