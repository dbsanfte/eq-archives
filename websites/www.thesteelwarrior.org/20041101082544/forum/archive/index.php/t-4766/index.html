<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Id be interested in seeing parsed of both hasted with raidbuffs to compare the dps on same mob. Im not a good parser so would be interested if anyone have some or could make some and post them here.. Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seen these before, I was looking for parses raidbuffed and hasted. Thanks tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only thing that should change when raid buffed and hasted is the numbers. The ratio of the 2 DPS numbers will remain the same (give or take for RNG).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One slight technicality would be proc rate remaining constant. The proc damage will not really go up raid buffed (maybe minutely from max dex/acumen or various other effects), while the melee damage will by a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure on that Raaj (well atleast that il try to find out). I was in the belief that 2h weapons gain more on extra attack than 1h do. I was thinking of doing some parses myself, probably on one of the exterminators, with raid buffs. To get a more realistic dps than hitting a mob from the behind (ripposts for example).<br />
<br />
Not sure if this should be placed under The overlord Sanctuary, move it please if so Raaj</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why should a 2her gain more when youre more hasted?<br />
<br />
They parsed ppl with 141 % speed.<br />
Raidbuffed you will have 200 % speed. That will change nothing between the weapons. As it was mentioned that the proc rate of the weapons would not change so you have to make the math like that ( parsed DPS without procs x more % haste ) + Proc DPS.<br />
<br />
They made the 10 hour parses from the back without spell haste and other buffs to kill the RNG and all that stuff. And they knew what they did there.<br />
<br />
Trust them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're right about the proc raid, it's dps will remain constant.<br />
<br />
2h won't gain anything from more attack than 1h's - pretty sure that was a theory and has been disproven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep not sure haste will change anything, but atk will i think, also procs, and ripposts. And i know that the procrates isnt from swings but time, thats not the reason i wanted haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mobs to parse on maybe exterminator in wfreeport, have rang atk buffs, vallon, fa and atk sow.</div></div><hr />
