<br />
I've taken the route, after reading many posts here, of getting to 65 first before doing my AA's.  Here's the dilema, can a 65 War with my equipment, tank in a BoT group, without draining cleric mana every 2/3 mobs?  I'd like to get my Def AA's first, but getting them can be very long and hard staying in PoV, grinding. <br />
<br />
Info:  No, I'm not in a guild.  I'd like to see elementals, time and all that good stuff, but I don't think I can I'll be able to raid the little stuff till I get some AA's built, so I'm waiting till that happens to choose.  Perhaps I'm wrong in not choosing a guild yet... comments?<br />
<br />
At any rate, obviously I have another toon to afford the expenses of this one, but I play this guy almost exclusively now, so if there is any equipment upgrade to help me reach my goals, (I know, question for another forum), please advise.  <br />
<br />
EdIt:--- Got off course, Is the defensive AA's what I need to do tank BoT?  Also, with the average group buffs, all stats are maxxed except Agi, is it wise to put my first AA's into this?  Is run3/reg3 that important?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angrif77</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just the opinion of a 65 Shaman that has grouped with the 65 warriors in the guild many times... don't touch agi AA.  Even tho it has an effect on endurance, having max Agi won't really do anything for you.  As a shaman I never cast agi unless asked for and I have the mana.  Tho I also always drop Ferine Avatar on the main tank, off tank and the DPS melee's in that order (in regular XP groups anyway).  FA adds 140 str, dex, agi, and attack so that maxes most melee's stats even without the Str and Dex from Focus.<br />
<br />
You have to have 6 general AA's before you can move into your more important ones and Run3 is the best of them IMO.  Every class should get it first.  Regen3 certainly never hurts and is probably the second best one to get, perhaps STAMINA instead of regen as you won't always be grouped with someone that can buff it.  After that don't touch general AA's until you are almost maxed on everything else.<br />
<br />
As for tanking in BoT, in my experiance grouping with my shaman there, groups tend to look for Pallies and SK's first.  It's a sad fact IMO but they still can get near instant aggro.  As for if you can tank with your gear... it's hard for me to say as my shaman doesn't main heal in bot unless the cleric/druid is afk or they went down.  At least I try not to have to.  Most likely you'll be able to tank (having a good slower will help a lot, whether it's shaman, chanter or even beastlord) and will only get better as you gain some of those AA's.  Don't shrug off PoV AA xp either.  If you limit yourself to BoT only, you might have tough time finding groups sometimes.  XP at the wall camps in PoV is still good.</div></div><hr />

I think I had right around 6-6.5k hps buffed at the time, and while it wasnt the most laid back casual xp grinding I've ever done, it was very doable as long as I had a good group backing me up.  Also, you dont always have to be the tank in every group you're in.  If you can snag an offtank/dps spot in a BoT group, the AA's will come rolling in before you know it.<br />
<br />
Edit: AGI is not worthless, but it's close. :)<br />
I did:<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
ND2<br />
CA2<br />
PD 1 (had a few points burning a hole in my pocket, and HP's are HP's)<br />
AE Taunt<br />
I plan to finish ND3 next then work on finishing CS/CA, not because I think it's more useful or will make me a better tank than CS/CA would, but because, sadly, you don't get asked for your levels of CS/CA by most potential groups, but you will get asked for HP/AC totals alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes. Just make sure you have full buffs. Dump virtue for p9 and symbol, get bss, stamina, and focus and you will have about 6700-6800 hp buffed.<br />
<br />
Defensive AA's certainly do help, but are not required. Now if you were going to tank named I'd think twice. You could probably do ok on krigers, just use defensive/furious since they aren't slowable.<br />
<br />
Of all AA's go for hp first. get ND3, PE, planar durability, sturdiness, then CA3, CS3, LR5, and ID. That's the order I'm going in. I started with CA2 by accident before I realized the errors of my ways :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the looks of it you shouldn't have a problem in BoT groups.  I'd suggest avoiding South wing if possible, however, due to the random procs of 500 damage the giants there throw off (obviously a few badly times ones can put you down quick, before your healer notices what's happening).  On the otherhand, if you're group is strong enough (I.E. They know how to play their classes, not necessarily know the zone inside and out) you should be fine.  I'd HIGHLY suggest getting a group to do the BoT Courtyard.  The mobs there are basically wuss (hit for 550ish, half of them are melee half are clerics) and you can nearly single pull em all with a bow/whack on the head.  Additionally, because they're so close together it's a very good spot for fast exp as you just rotate around in a cycle.  Find a pattern and go to town.  It's highly unlikely you'll clear faster than repops unless you have a CoD charming Enchanter with you or a great deal of DPS elsewhere.  And you don't have to worry about trains or adds or any of that other crazy stuff.  If you do go to the Courtyard, however, I suggest moving clockwise, and keep in mind if you agro mobs through the walls, they will only go through the center opening if they're moving from section to section in a clockwise direction (if counter-clockwise, they fly all the way to the middle and will agro the four gargoyles, which can be difficult if you're not prepared).<br />
<br />
As for your gear, it looks quite good, and I'm guessing you probably get around 6970 HPs fully buffed?  Chances are you will get into groups with only a Cleric for HP buffs, so if no shaman I highly suggest you bring a few hundred plat with you, and go bum a focus and stamina off a nearby shaman (and brell's if a pally is around).  That'll give you an extra 1200 HP over just Virtue, which makes a world of difference in BoT in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, and Run 3 is certainly the best buy for the first tier of AAs I believe.  Once you get used to a character with Run 3 (or now Run 5) and then play a character without, it boggles your mind how slow they feel (and are).<br />

<br />
Lets see you can get<br />
<br />
CA3/CS3: 24aa<br />
LR5 :15aa<br />
ID5 :15aa<br />
<br />
Thats 54aa. So rather then getting 500hp I reccomend you go the defensive aa route first.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other hp aa (ND3, PD3, PE) for a much cheaper cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure you get max hps before you come. They will watch you tank well and then adjust as your buffs fade, as long as you do a good job.<br />
<br />
That is more than enough to Tank in BoT. <br />
<br />
By a mile. Don't let people here dissuade you.<br />
<br />
Getting an Anger III Augment for your GSOT to allow people to do more DPS and not get hit might benefit you more than more Hps at this point<br />

Save Defensive disc for the tougher named mobs. You won't have instant aggro lock, but using Incite, taunt and weapon procs you should be able to get aggro back when you lose it. Knights have better aggro, but they don't have the disciplines that we do to survive against the named mobs. Named mobs are where the loot is, so warriors are sought after in my experience.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoT is your friend.  Your equipment is fine, Hps are a little low for named but others you will do great on.  Learn the Mobs, do the typical tank things and people will notice.  I have had people remember me and ask out of the blue if they need a tank.  Thats good on the ego.<br />
As for AA's, Run3 is a must, I did Stam to 3 because lets face it 3 regen isnt going to touch 8k hps.  I also did all HP AA's first.  This helped a lot.  I am now doing Defensive, so I can't comment but it all helps.<br />
Good Luck and Happy Hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a sad fact IMO but they still can get near instant aggro. <br />
<br />
I just recently dinged 63 (only 2 blue in) and just turned in my incite tome to the GM and have yet to use it.  Berate has been useful, but not exactly an aggro-grabber.  I have a hard time keeping aggro (especially from other melees in group that like to use CHoS and such --- why they use an aggro weapon when they can't take a hit is beyond me..).  Actually, I wouldn't say hard time, I just need to really work at it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you limit yourself to BoT only, you might have tough time finding groups sometimes. <br />
<br />
I just wanted to open an option for BoT, as XP would have been faster here than the grind of PoV/PoS.  /agree, finding a group may be tough indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can snag an offtank/dps spot in a BoT group, the AA's will come rolling in before you know it. <br />
<br />
That would be nice indeed.  Although, having 2 wars or 2 potential MT's in group, in my short-lived experience, has proved not to be optimal dps.  Of course, this is just a general perception on my part, not necessarily correct.<br />
<br />
An Anger or Ykesha aug on the GSoT would be helpful to get and keep agro <br />
<br />
I've been doing the LDoN grind as well, little by little when I can't get a PoP group to get the anger aug.  I'm glad you mentioned the GSoT, is this the right wep to aug?  Should I hold out and aug a better wep in the future (more than likely a long time away)?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
your better off going w/o buffs and seeing how well you tank with the buffs given in your group. as mentioned before i would try to get a group with a cleric <br />
<br />
I generally always go to my group with majority of my buffs (Virtue/focus/sta/agi/str).  When my buffs fade and there is nobody in the group that can re-buff me efficiently (rarely the case), I make an effort to find them wherever I can.<br />
<br />
/agree I think first time out, I will most definately look for a cleric in the group.  Preferably one I've grouped with before.<br />
<br />
<br />
  As for AA's, Run3 is a must, I did Stam to 3 because lets face it 3 regen isnt going to touch 8k hps <br />
<br />
If my Sta is maxxed with buffs though, I would have no need (initially, till I get stat-cap raised) to use these AA's here, I don't think.  I'm looking to optimize my first 6 for what would be useful to me now.  /agree 3 regen is going to be worthless, IMO.<br />

<br />
Personally I find it simple enough to use incite on just about every pull or every other pull as soon as the mob is coming into camp, and that's usually sufficient to hold agro if I'm using a two hander (no proc) or, with a few procs, my one handers (both proc, but no anger augs).  Obviously it's not ideal, and like yourself I could use an Anger Aug, but I do think Incite is quite useful and fairly low Endurance cost (you can usually regen faster than you use it depending on your group/DPS/pulling speed).<br />
<br />
I've been doing the LDoN grind as well, little by little when I can't get a PoP group to get the anger aug.  I'm glad you mentioned the GSoT, is this the right wep to aug?  Should I hold out and aug a better wep in the future (more than likely a long time away)?<br />
<br />
Tough question; I suppose it really depends on how fast you see yourself getting Adventure Points.  Personally, I wouldn't aug the GSoT, because chances are you'll (sooner rather than later) find a better DPS weapon that you can aug (the fact is, at least on my server, you can buy Higher DPS Weapons (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45129) for 1500 plat.  Obviously things will only come down from there, so you may want to hold onto your Anger Aug/points until you have a weapon you're SURE you won't replace anytime soon.  If you have doubts with the GSoT, chances are you're right to question it and wait a while.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps and good luck in BoT!<br />

<br />
However, I think you'd do better with a CHoS/Bloodsworn combo.  You get more procs dual wielding than you do using a 2-hander.  I thought I held aggro better with that combo, anyway.<br />
<br />
Past that, you'll need a guild for upgrades.  The BoT towers (Great Blade of Storms, Greatstaff of the Four Winds), Xanamech (Cord Hilted Spike Driver), are reasonably achievable with a decent guild.<br />
<br />
As for exping in BoT, I don't think you'd have any trouble.  Your biggest trouble will be getting a group, as you say.  A big however here .. however tough it is to get a group, it would be that much tougher if you don't get 65 first.  Most BoT groups don't want a warrior to tank at all, and they certainly don't want a sub-65 one.  They won't know if you have 0 AAs, but they will know if you are only 63 or 64.  <br />
<br />
Who said krigers aren't slowable?  I think they are.  Even the nameds are slowable, although it's awfully hard without very big debuffs (tash and Malos, with OOS too if you have a bard along).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have a windblade, a touch faster delay and more damage than the WoHGS.  Is this a preferred primary wep over a GSoT?  I got it just for situation and fun purposes.  I only use it (windblade) when I have no trouble keeping aggro.  I start off every pick-up group with my CHoS and SotBS then move to my GSoT, then to my WB only if I am keeping the aggro.  CHoS and SotBS, I will keep aggro everytime, damage output is not impressive though, I find mobs are dropping quicker when I switch them out.<br />

On krigers I let the healer know that I'll be using Malos first, then slow.  I'm almost guarantee'd a resist at least once without Malos first.  Even with Malos i get resists from Krigers sometimes (even Militis sometimes too).  Biggest challengefor healers against Krigers is the proc dmg (at least in earth wing) that is unpredictable.  Strangely the named I've fought there haven't really been harder to slow than krigers... jsut that they mitigated.</div></div><hr />

Your gear is fine, you wont have any problem tanking with that gear at 65. While your gear will last well into 65 and is fine for tanking, you will be held back by your level. Level 65s, just for being level 65, get groups quicker than those under 65.  So again, while your gear is FINE, you will have a hard time getting into groups - even though you can tank fine - because of your level.</div></div><hr />

Have done about 15aa in BoT and 7 in PoV with my rogue and it seems that fiends give the same 2% aa that regular BoT giants give, without the nasty procs.<br />
BoT nameds and krigers give 3% aa, but are also a pain to kill sometimes, so the exp in PoV caves seems steadier in a good group.<br />
I made 63-65 in PoV and think in the long term, it's better for your reputation as good tank to tank very well there than perform relatively poor in BoT, where you compete with 6-7k unbuffed tanks with full defensive AA.<br />
<br />
Don't like dual wield in the planes either. With riposts it might give you larger damage spikes in bad rounds (double attack + 4 possible ripostes for 500ish .. hmhm). &quot;Postman stick&quot; (GSoT) all the way :) .. also because it really stuns mob for 1 second and therefor lowers their dmg output.</div></div><hr />

Also, when I first started tanking in BoT, I was using a GSoT, and agro was not a huge problem(this was pre incite as well), so again, you should be ok.  You will have some small trouble possibly with named and krigers(I saved disc for them, to help healer mana along so there was no pause to med after pulling them), but should be able to tank them.  I do suggest that you don't get your hopes up that BoT is your new home.  At 63, groups will be rare, unless there is a real shortage of tanks.  Keep plugging away at 65 tho where ever you can get groups, and you should get it in no time.</div></div><hr />

You're gear is almost identical to what I had at 63 (I was in HT instead of FH, but it's basically the same stat wise).  You'll do fine, I even tanked krigers and one of the mini named in the west wing with roughly the same ac/hps as you.  Get there early in the day or late at night and you'll easily snag a group. A couple of sessions of that you'll be 65, and groups will be alot easier to find.  If you have trouble getting in a group, try PoV. Xps arent quite as good, but they're pretty close, and people arent as anal about having a 65 nicely AA'd tank there.</div></div><hr />

I try not to.  But, I never know who's going to be fighting me for aggro.  I can't help but see a BL or Ranger, walking into the group with one of these, my only chance to compete (without having a quick trigger on the taunt every time they proc) is to switch to duel wield (2 proccing weps).  Although, I used incite last night, and it worked extremely well.  Then again, I was pulling and I can generally hold aggro pretty easily when I do so.<br />

Exactly what I intend to do.  Was just a bit unsure with my gear/lack of AA's/&lt;65 that BoT was a possibility.  <br />
<br />
One final question..  I think it's been established here that Run3 is a definite for first 3/6 AA's.  What about the other 3.  I am conflicted about putting it in Sta because I'm capped with buffs (always buffed).  Regen3  was noted as pretty much worthless for the amount of hps.  Agility3 worthless, just because it's worthless.  Saves?  No, I'm not raiding (no guild), but just the same, I have to burn the 3 somewhere.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies</div></div><hr />

I never camped the Droga weapons, and wasn't going to pay 15k and 10k they were at the time for them. I tanked with the GSoT so exclusively that when I'd gotten to a point where I had to get an ability in something other than Defensive/HP AAs I picked Punishing Blade. Well finally got around to going and getting the Droga weapons and started using them. I honestly did not see any huge rise in the amount of ripostes I took, but to be fair, that was only observational data, not log parses. Also, by that time I did have ND3 CA1 CS1 and PE.<br />
<br />
When I finally got to BoT I was geared very similarly to you except Helanic Tundra instead of Fierce Heraldic. I was a secondary tank a lot when I first got there. That was before the incite line came out. Since it's introduction, it's seemed to me that people are actually looking for Warriors to tank again in exp groups. At least I don't have too many times of sitting LFG for an hour.<br />
<br />
For AA, I have run 3 of course. Then I have Regen 2 and Metabolism 1. If I could do it over again I also would have gone with Metabolism 3. THe Regen I got because my first character was a Shaman that was leveled pre-PoP, when regen meant something and to a class that it actually helped more.</div></div><hr />

I certainly doesnt hurt you to have a little extra standing regen in a tougher fight, but it doesn't help much either.  If I had to do it over again, I would probably go metabolism 3 to conserve the stat foods I'm too lazy to make for myself. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for your gear, I've had tanks that had less hp than you and did fine, even at your level.  Just get an agro weapon like the GSoT or something so you have a chance at holding agro.  Start working on AAs soon and get the defensive ones and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />

My shaman got run 3 and then regen 3... then LoY came out with stoicism....  after I got a Drog i had to get Metab 3 to reduce the amount he ate.  In todays world it probably IS best to get Run3 then Metab 3 for just about every class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
instead of regen3 or stamina3 or whatever (besides the run3) .... i would get run3 then innate metabolism 3<br />
<br />
its what i did, and it lets you cheaply buy stacks of stat foods which give you more of a boost than anything else will.  its just plain nice to buy 2 stacks of halas pies ... and still have some of them left after 2 or 3 months of gameplay.</div></div><hr />

That's the order I'm going in. I started with CA2 by accident before I realized the errors of my ways  <br />
<br />
What are you kidding? Spend 84 AA before you use ONE in defense? Ever hear of area taunt? You dont plan on tanking anything other than crap, do you? It takes more than HPs to be a good tank, and CA and CS are great AA's and WAY help out tanking hard stuff. Get ND3 and PE, throw AT in there somewhere and get CA3 and CS3 and you'll have no regrets.</div></div><hr />

Most clerics don't even notice my relatively low HP, because not getting hit is so much better than having 400 more HP to heal - especially in the planes and specifically in BoT. :)<br />
<br />
CA 1, CS 1, ND 1, (1st level is always biggest bang for the buck) CA 2 , CA 3, AoE taunt (!), CS 2, CS 3, ND 2, ND 3 etc.<br />

Igenuity for the eye candy if you like, planar power as soon as you reach the caps ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzme</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,  I didn't manage to get a BoT group, so I wound up dinging 65 in PoV.  I promptly went to BoT and was able to do Lightning pretty easily.  Actually surprised at how easy it was, to be honest.  I've taken some of the advice here and have gotten run3, met3, and I've gotten ND1.  ND1 by mistake actually, I was tired and wasn't thinking.  I've got 2 aa's banked, which will go towards CA1, I think.  From there, I think I'll continue on to get CA3 and get the rest of my defensive first.  HP's (ND3), is pretty much irrelevant for what I'm tanking.   If I ever get a guild and need ND3 for raids and such, I'll just have to spend a day getting it.  <br />
<br />
As far as weapons and aggro, seems to be the same as PoV.... depends on who you are with.  I can keep aggro with my WB, but I found at time when members switch up (particularly slowers), I have to switch to GSoT.  It has never been necessary to use my 1H's to hold aggro.  I'd like to try and stay away from them, for riposte purposes.  As stated earlier in the post, ripostes are not that much, but it would surely limit them.  <br />
<br />
So this concludes it... Thanks everyone for your suggestions, it's been greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason being, def aa will not imo, give you the ability to tank bot named.  Your group will want to tank bot named.  The more hps you have the more room you have for error on the healers part.  Def aa are good, but will not give as much room for error.  <br />
<br />
Yes you can tank bot, i doubt if you could tank named with your current hps, def aa or no def aa.  <br />
<br />
I would recommend joining  a guild, depending on how much time you have to play.  If joining a guild will cut into your  exp time too much, and aa is really your goal so you can join a much higher end guild, then dont do it.  But if you have the time to join a guild and get aa goals accomplished i say go for it, you'll only benefit gear wise and experience wise (experience is good to have when you get to the highend).<br />
<br />
Thats my recommendation. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

ND3<br />
CS1<br />
CA3<br />
CS2 &amp; 3<br />
PE<br />
LR/ID as possible maybe mixed with a few offensive or GoD AA's (weapon affinity comes to mind)<br />
That's the route I'm taking (Just bought ND3)<br />
The only reason I did ND3 before CA was the fact that while I have never been asked how many defensive AA i had when joining a pickup group, I constantly get asked for HP/AC totals.  IMHO, CA and CS will make me a better tank then the few hundred hps I got from ND, but the hps are more a more visible, tangible benefit.</div></div><hr />

Birrenthehaffer,  <br />
  The all time conflict!  Since I've hit 65, I've been debating on joining a guild.  I do have plenty of time, the problem is finding the RIGHT guild.  I have reserved placing an app into any of them as of yet.  In the meantime, I'll be chugging away at my AA's.  I purchased ND1 and CA1, I'll have to do a search now and find out the most efficient.  I don't think that ND3 is a priority right now, although I would love to have the HP boost, I'm not exactly draining clerics mana.  In fact, the only time a med break has been called in any of my groups in BoT, is after re-buffing, or several pops decided to join us :D   <br />
<br />
I had the opportunity to tank a named in Lightining (forget his name, not the fly, but where he spawns), didn't go as planned.  We got him down to 26 and I went down shortly thereafter.  I'd like to try it again, I was defensive, but didn't have my 65 Disc.  Also, focus had faded just as I engaged.  Mini's, however, were fairly easy, just a little more hps.</div></div><hr />
