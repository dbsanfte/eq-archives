<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zekez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to be getting the same or even better aggro out of a 100p greatstaff of thunder. Than using my BOC / Copper hammer of striking this seem right to you guys? seems like i take aggro faster wich i understand as the 2hb higher hits faster aggro via dps. But man its unreal i pretty much dont lose aggro with that greatstaff.<br />
<br />
Im not saying i lost it much with my BOC / copper hammer but you would think for that 300k + i would get much better results.<br />

For all those naysayers, buy a GSoT already, sheesh. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Greatstaff of Thunder is an incredible weapon for the money...slap an anger3 augment on it with WA5 and it's a solid aggro option until you get a BoW...for a total investment of 30AA 1150 points and 50-500pp.<br />
<br />
That said, it's fugly and I'll keep my Bloodfrenzy and AHB.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've only been saying that for.. I dunno, at least a year. The GSoT f'in pwns but people are too caught up by the low price to give it a ahcnace. Maybe if everyone started charging 30k for it again it'd be popular?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup ...  in the long run an unauged BoC/CHoS will win out for aggro, but in the short run the GSoT is really nice.  With anger3 and WA5, you could easily tank clear all the way up through time.<br />
<br />
Dual auged, the duel wield combo would slaughter the GSoT auged as per aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, just reached the level to try that, i'm missing a few points in 2hB to be really effective but I'm wondering something, what is the message when it proc on US server?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It has a ykesha graphic when it procs, my bet is it has a Ykesha message.</div></div><hr />

You euros are a little behind in patches aren't you?<br />
<br />
It'll get fixed eventually.  It was Ykesha for us for a long while too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>JagdDoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've only been saying that for.. I dunno, at least a year.

<br />
And for those of us who cannot afford the hefty price of a BoC or the like, a GSoT is almost a piece of heaven.  Outstanding aggro and all I had to do was smack around 2 HGs in RM and I had enough to buy one.  I've had shamans in Storms ask if I could use the Fugly Stick instead of my CHoS/SotB because I was getting better aggro with it and they weren't getting smacked around as much.<br />
<br />
As a side note, for those who haven't trained in 2HB at all, like myself, the skills come fairly quickly.  Grab a guild group where you dont have to be MT and let it rip.  Or as in my case, grab a 65 necro and a cleric.  We let the necro's pet eat through everything down in Veksar while I did my training.  Cleric popped a heal every now and then and I got nearly 200 points in 2HB in just a few hours.<br />
<br />
So in the end, yeah, get that GSoT and use it well.  Its very well worth the pittance you will spend on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I liked the GSoT for its snappy crisp contact aggro for LDoN's and the like. However keep that BoC/CHoS close by for those groups filled with Necros and Beastlords.<br />
<br />
They will ususaly out aggro the GSoT in the long game if their not holding back, but do so far less with DW quad procers.<br />
<br />
(If you got a lot of the 2Hander AA the GSoT becomes even more attractive)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I didn't played on US server from a while, then I still remember the &quot;planar force stun&quot;, petitionned tonight and a GM popped in a few min to take the weapon link and disappear like he came... maybe we have busy GM's :p<br />
<br />
And yes, we are kinda late on patch and I'm really bored to  have to wait for the ZEM patch, seems like much diversity in hunting places :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Alrean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm a question from a warrior thats been on the shelf for a year or so and now come back.<br />
<br />
Would you guys consider a GSoT to be better at aggro then a BBB ?<br />
<br />
I've been using my BBB exclusivly since i came back since i gave away my BoC when i took my break. And have no other weapons worth mentioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the Great staff of the 4 winds is another lovely weapon, btw.  It has a higher than average proc rate if I recall correctly, and the dps is bascially the best you're gonna get pre-elemental. <br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder rocks.  I was tanking recently when this whiner warrior we'd picked up (was in an ldon) was talking about how he can't hold aggro against the casters, etc, and that the only reason I can hold aggro was because of my &quot;uber&quot; weapons.  I asked him if the GsoT was an uber weapon, and upon receiving my answer (a hostile no), equipped it and proceeded to annoy him to no end. <br />
<br />
I have all my 2h AA at this point, but even before I did, GsoT was a fine weapon.<br />
<br />
********<br />
I honestly believe i could hold aggro with 2 short swords augged with anger III -- someday when I have the extra 2200 AP I'm gonna prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ah, yes, assuming there are any level 55 untwinked warrior mains left in the game, for goodness sake get a GSoT. It might take you anywhere from 20-60 hours of solo farming to clear enough pp for the droga weapon set. One hour for the GSoT, including traveling time.<br />
Use the saved time to level and work on augs &amp; armor and you'll be way ahead because when you get to the point you want the droga weapons, you'll have a far greater capacity to get things done, and be much closer to getting the 1-handers the anger augs that ultimately give them the edge.</div></div><hr />
