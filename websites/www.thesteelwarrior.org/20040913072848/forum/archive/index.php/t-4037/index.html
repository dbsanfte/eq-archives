<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whats up with so many warriors having wizzard alts and maybe even the other way around :)?<br />
<br />
I know when I started EQ when it first came out I first was pally who I shortly dumped after I coundnt do cr (and thats after I figured out that one could do such perverted thing as find their own corpse and loot it) because no one was high level enough to cast invisibility spell on me so I can dodge pesky piranhas in Nektulos Forest where I woundered off to while exploering. After that I started a career of a erudite wizzard beeing how stamina was highlighted stat thats where alot of my points went! Anyways after beeing wizzard for a couple of months and reaching whooping high level 24 sitting at Aviaks in South Karana meding I thought to myself god damn it I spend 3 minutes starting at the bloody spellbook to med then get up for 30 seconds of glory if that to kill something so I can go back to staring at the book. Thats when I knew my caster career was over. So I did the most logical thing started a character who didnt have to see another moment of bleeding spellbook - a warrior. Been enjoying it ever since. What ya story with Wiz alt? Wandor better have something good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you played your wizard you were forced to stare at the spellbook.  Those days are gone.  Flowing Thought items, KEI, horses, bot9, spiritual purity.  Wizards today have a very small downtime, if any at all (outdoors).  So its all glory. <br />
<br />
It sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bashemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they nipped the high lvl buffs for lowbies in the bud. which is why my mag doesn't come out to play much. takes to long to med :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wizards are a powerful solo class, and at high level they have minimal downtime.  But the reality is all that you do is cast spells, and usually you are focused on direct damage.  Occasionally you stun or interrupt or snare or root for crowd control, but mostly it's just sit, stand, nuke, sit, stand, nuke.  Or if you have a horse, nuke, nuke, nuke.  Of course there are pauses or concussions cast in there, but it's pretty repetitive.  I grew to hate grouping with my wizard.  In a group all I did was nuke and try to time my stuns to prevent gates.  Usually someone else was on crowd control.  It became boring.  Now I only enjoy soloing with my wizard.  That is more of a challenge.  Going into fairly high level dungeons solo, like Droga, Nurga, Veksar, Lower Guk, and I find soloing in these places to be much more fun than grouping.  I have to handle crowd control, I have to keep the mobs at bay so I can nuke, I have to worry about getting aggro, I have to so all the things I am not needed for in a group.  Wo am I rambling.  My point is that for me the damage of the wizard was the initial allure, but then I realized later on that is all that wizards do, nuke, over and over.<br />
<br />
Warriors have a much more difficult job.  We oftentimes get to pull.  We always get to tank.  We have a diversity of weapons for different situations.  We have to work at keeping aggro and keeping mobs off the casters, keeping mobs on us to keep others alive.  We have to move around to stay on mobs.  A wizard just stands there and nukes.  A wizards hardest job is keeping aggro off them.<br />
<br />
The classes are nearly exact opposites.  A wizard is all offense.  A warrior is mostly defense (although we do ok dps).   I think it's the allure of doing something completely opposite from what I did for over 3 years that got me into a warrior.  Oh... and my woman started a Barbarian shaman...  and I wanted to be a Barbarian for roleplay and because she thinks they are sexy...  so a knight wasn't an option.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cause i get tired of lfg and go solo stuff with the wizzy twink. spent like 500pp on gear and 300pp on spells, and got the rest with the twink in groups. i'm realy haveing fun with it though. did the cleric thing did the rogue thing did the ahh nm you get the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the better question might be &quot;Why do a lot of druids have knight alts?&quot; Perhaps because they needed another class to be whiney, greedy bitches about?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I have a wizard alt, too. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">pfft, i just created a rogue alt so I can sit there...watch some TV and hit backstab now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XCrovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heya guys, been trolling here awhile.  Thought I would chime in to this one.  My main is a lvl 65 DE wizzy on Quell.  You guys are talking bad about the wizzy but the truth is he is a very challenging toon to play.  You have no idea how hard it is to NOT get agro on a mob after you just nuked him for 6.5k damage.  And of course if I draw agro, I die.  HP/AC buffs dont help, if I draw agro, I die.  Simple as that.  My wife plays a cleric who is 9 times out of 10 sitting right next to me and I tell her &quot;If I draw agro, DO NOT HEAL ME.  It wont save me from dying, only the tank can save my frail arse if I phock up and draw agro.&quot;  So when it came time for me to work on an alt I went for the exact opposite.  Morgg, ogre warrior at your service.  Fully buffed has 5k hp and about 1150 ac at level 52.  ROAR.  And he is FUN!!  I love me twink and have recently commited to bringing him up to the upper levels so that I can truly call him an alt.  Another key reason for building a warrior twink was that I had absolutely no use for all of the melee gear I would win with me main other then to sell it.  While selling the items would have maybe gotten me an upgrade or two, using the items has given me something way more valuable.  The last reason I had for building a war was my own mentality that a jack of all trades is master of none.  Any character in any game I have ever played has always lived by one rule, &quot;Know what you do and do it well&quot;.  XCrovax is damage.  Pure and simple.  Morgg is hp and ac.  Pure and simple.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No offense, but I played a 65 wizzy on ldon beta without ANY wizzy experience (well I got one to level 13). It really wasn't that hard. Nuke-conc-nuke-conc-nuke-conc.... and that was overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I started my wizard when I first got EQ all those years ago (back in 2000), and never played him much. Now he's 56, and I mainly play him because he gets groups much easier than the warrior does...<br />
<br />
Plus, it's a fun change not to be necessary in the group. Wizzie nuking, wizzie medding, wizzie picking his nose, most people don't notice me either way, they just kinda know that mobs drop faster. Gives me a little leeway to not pay attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe reading comprehension is &gt; than me at the moment, but I didn't notice anyone disparaging wizards (Well, until Bin there. :p)<br />
<br />
The entire point of this post is to point out a striking number of warriors that play wizards as well. I am one of them and do realize the challenges, especially since - at 53 - my wizard doesn't have Concussion. Not everyone has the option to grab a bunch of guildies and get the quest done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XCrovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, first off Bika, playing a 65 wizzy is a lot easier then getting one to 65.  Try soloing 4 mobs with nothing standing between you and death but a silk robe.  That will get the blood pumping if nothing else.  As Uhrlik mentioned most wizzies dont even get the 39th level spell Concussion until they well into their fifties.  The quest while not overly hard does require a lot of help especially if you DE and intend to keep your Overthere faction long enuff to get your spells from there.  And while Concussion is a valuable tool, no wizzy other then then those that have Elemental pants casts concussion between every nuke.  Its a mana drain, loss of DPS, and redundant if your timing is on.  I personally cast concussion maybe 2-4 times vs any big named and never any other time.<br />
<br />
And Uhrlik, every wizzy feels a little pinched nerve when someone says we are just a sit-nuke-concussion-lather-rinse-repeat class.  Thats like a wizzy saying that a war hits auto attack and goes to make a sandwitch.  He certainly aint taunting because if he was I wouldn't be drawing agro.  Neither statement is true and both wizzies and warriors can explain why til they are blue in the face but will that explaination really change their perception?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know. I was just trying to smooth things over because no one is saying that playing a wizard is easier than a warrior. It's just different.<br />
<br />
I play my wizard because no other class in the game has the job description of &quot;Go blow shit up.&quot; That's just awesome to me. <br />
<br />
Sure, other classes may do more damage (necro dot stacking), may do my job roughly on par (mage + pet is +/- some dps but I don't really care about the numbers right now, just proving a point.) but you can't deny the sheer bliss of seeing those massive numbers hit all at once.<br />
<br />
Every class in the game takes some skill to play. Some require subtlety and some don't. Neither the warrior nor the wizard requires much subtlety and I think that might be some of the affinity they have for each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No wizard here... started as a ranger who I got to 60 in a semi uber guild.. on the side I did a druid.. who is now 54.. while also on the side a cleric who only got to 27.. while also a monk that only got to 34... then I got married.. and Gunrack was born.. never looked back aside from playing a necro I started for when I only have 20 mins to solo something and log off..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/em hands Gunrack a few periods, some commas, and a semicolon or two<br />
<br />
You can use mine until you figure out what happened to your own ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">heh I decided that the only time I ever wanted to play an alt was typically when my friends and guildmates were not on and I was not in the mood to sit LFG for 3 hours just to end up in a crappy pickup group. So I made alts that do not sit LFG very long I made a cleric and a chanter. Both interesting classes to play and both very different from a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yah the whole point of this post was why you choose wizzard as alt and not some other class. That yah I have lvl 20 wiz I never play is not important :)<br />
<br />
Saying that playing wiz is not chalenging is not true. Its completley different. My wiz is 46 now and playing him is far from easy. With 600 hp all thats stoping him from death its a chalenge, but being able to cast a spell and see a chunk of mob's hp drop always cheers me up.</div></div><hr />
