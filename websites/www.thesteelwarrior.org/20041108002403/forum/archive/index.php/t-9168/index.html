<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grashopah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings everyone<br />
<br />
I'm just curious as to which effect (not AA) would increase dps the most. Assuming Cleave 3 vs Ferocity 3. You guys pump out parses like it's your job so I figured this would be the best place to gather info. <br />
<br />
anyway Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slassh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What ever results wouldnt really be reliable for a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">for a ranger cleave would be better than ferocity since fero increase melee swings and cleave add a chance to crit.<br />
thus with cleave you will increase melee and range dps, but only melee dps with fero. moreover with fero you will draw more aggro but not with cleave.<br />
<br />
so even if fero increases a bit more your melee dps than cleave, overall cleave would be a better choice for a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It would depend where in the game you are.  If you are Time+ raiding player Ferocity would be probably be better than Cleave, since Ferocity most likely improves your melee dps more so than Cleave does.  The primary form of combat in terms of dps at the Time+ level of the game for rangers is melee.<br />
<br />
If you are a non raider the chances of you outdamaging your bow dps with a melee set up are slim, so I would say Cleave, since it should impact both your bow and melee, and give you greater returns than Ferocity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd think Cleave would be better for a ranger because it effects bows but Ferocity does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Paint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends on where you are in the game progression. For me I have decent melee weapons but already have a Cleave1 item. I will be making a Fero 3 augment first and then a Cleave 3 augment. Now if only the slugworms would co-opperate ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I could definitely see getting fero 3, cleave 3, dodge 3, and parry 3 augs made to give yourself more flexibility with your gear.  You might lose stats that you could have gotten with a different aug but you're no longer forced to save a slot for that rare piece of gear with the focus effect you want.  You can mix and match and use the best pieces of gear you can find and then fill in your missing focus effects with augs.</div></div><hr />
