<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those 3 will all last you into elementals. You could also look into ornate legs or the ones that drop in GoD trial5 (Vxed) or the two LDoN legs. Gluck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all the legs are pretty similiar IMO when you add up AC and HP Umbracite is probably best all around but its pretty debatable even then, pick up whatever one you can until elemental/time/ikkinz/</div></div><hr />

...also Vxed is a one group encounter, so you don't have to spend raid points or whatever system you are on currently.<br />
<br />

....out of the initial 3, I would choose (2), then (1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Royal Attendant Greaves of Sand don't suck, especially after you aug them with 40-70 more hp or so and vengeance IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where do Umbracite Plate Leggings drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VT, I believe, on the Umbracite. Too lazy to verify atm ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of the six mentioned here (the 3 you mentioned, plus vxed ornate and ldon), the umbracite is the best of them.  25-40hp doesnt make up for the 15-20ac extra you get on the umbracite.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm using ornate legs, and I'm confident that I will not upgrade them until I get Raex legs.  By the way, most guilds consider Elemental legs a time drop nowadays, because the majority of people get their legs in Time.<br />
<br />
So, if you get any of those mentioned there, aug em up, cuz they'll last you a good long while.  If you get your choice, I'd go with:<br />
<br />
1) Umbracite ($$ AC)<br />
2) Royal Attendant (more aug slots and an extra resist to poison)<br />
3) Ivory Crystal (comparable to Royal Attendant, but with less aug slots and less resists)<br />
4) Ornate (good clicky if your sta isnt maxed, OK resists/ac/hp)<br />
5) Vxed (nice hp/resists, but the AC is kinda low -- I'd take it if I didnt have one of the above first, though)<br />
6) Fiery Might (horrible in the AC department...unless you want the clicky, let chain or leather or somebody hit that instead)<br />
<br />
I'd take any of the top 5 and ride it until I got Raex or GoD legs.  I wouldn't touch the Fiery Might, because the AC just makes me want to cry...that's just me, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have the ones from vxed.  they are very nice imo, and i picked them up on a 3 hour crawl the other day.  The zone isnt difficult if you are grouping with a competent cleric and the rest of the group knows what they are doing.  they come from a named pooka that sits in a small culley along the right path.  its about a 20 minute fight from the zin, and is on a Place holder system.   we spawned him 3 times back to back in 30 minutes.   a ranger walked away with the earing, and the cleric and warrior (myself) got the legs.<br />
<br />
GoD is heavensent  :cool:<br />
<br />
ps- i bagged my ornate legs for them.  5ac traded for 25hps seems to be somewhat of a lateral upgrade, but the extra stats and saves convinced me to pick them up.  Ornate legs are still nice to carry around for clicky stamina for myself and those in my groups.</div></div><hr />
