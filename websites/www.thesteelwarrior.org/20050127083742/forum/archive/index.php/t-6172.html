<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evariste</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... with taunting. I was grouped with a 'zerker, the same level as I am (53) and I literally couldn't taunt a single mob off of him with my SoD/CHoS combo the entire evening. He had a Two Tined Corpse Pitchfork. <br />
<br />
The night of suckage is indicative of one of two things: the Zerker didn't know how to play his class, or dual wield simply defies physics by both sucking and blowing at the same time. I'm not sure what happened, but I'm sorely disappointed at how this turned out because I spent a lot of pp on the SoD. <br />
<br />
Should I just lean almost exclusively on 2h (GSoT when I hit 55) and pawn the SoD for some Ornate and replace it with a Sword of the Bloodsworn? Or should I keep the SoD and augment it before I aug my GSoT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angrif77</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was probably using his snare and stun axe abilities and he wasn't using his aggro reduction ability.  If he was doing that it would've been like trying to get aggro from a pally than wanted to keep it with his stuns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More than likely the zerker didn't know how to play his class or just wanted to get into a pissing contest with you for some stupid reason.  His main is probably a pally :)  <br />
<br />
This occurence is in no way indicitive of the value of your aggro set up.  We've all known forever that just about any class can gank aggro from us if they suck or are just plain stupid.</div></div><hr />

you were just grouped with a jackass.</div></div><hr />

You could help him learn his class by collaborating with the healer to make sure he dies a few times :).</div></div><hr />

I've mentioned to my guild that rangers who take agro from me used to bother me a lot more than they do now. I used to think, &quot;Why would someone playing a non-plate class be so stupid as to think it's a good idea to steal agro from a warrior?&quot;<br />
Then one day it hit me: I realized that these rangers aren't actual players, but in fact are damage shields something akin to rune: I'm still tanking, it's just that as long as the &quot;spell: idiot ranger&quot; is up, I take no damage. Once &quot;idiot ranger&quot; drops, of course, I do take damage. But until then, I'm invincible to all damage except AOE spells.<br />
Probably a similar &quot;spell: dumbass zerker&quot; was added about the time the GoD expansion went live.<br />
I just wish I could figure out who is casting these spells. No one will admit doing it. Whoever it is probably realizes that having such spells makes their class too uber, and if people talk about it, the caster class(es) that have such spells will be nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 things come to mind here:<br />
<br />
1. The zerker you where grouped with was an idiot.<br />
2. An SoD is not that much of an upgrade over a SotB to warrant the insane price. Unless you have the very best tradeable gear available, I would recommend putting the SoD up for sale and upgrading the crap out of your gear. You would be MUCH better served picking up a couple 100 HP and AC from upgrades than you are from the 5% increase in DPS you get from an SoD over a SotB. Don't just blindly buy ornate either, there are quite a few items that are as good or better than ornate for a whole lot less if you shop around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zerkers have the tools to manage aggro.. the one you were playing with just didn't know how to use them.<br />
<br />
My 53 zerker can be the tank in his group and hold aggro ok (I hate monks that use stun procs!).  He can also be DPS in his group and rarely get aggro at all (and quickly shed it when he does).  If you were grouped with one taking aggro constantly, he just had no clue about how to control his aggro.<br />
<br />
Of course, his tanking days are coming to an end, as the mobs are starting to hit that chain AC too hard for it to be efficient - but that's a good thing - they are a DPS class, not a tank class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladd</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had the same issue myself as a 51 war grouped with a 52 zerker using a WMBS I was building my own 2hs with a war marshalls as well so that explained my agro loss there since im not maxxed yet on 2h. Then i swapped to the bloodsworn / copper hammer set up and still had issues. I enjoyed not being riposted or parried and contributed a healthy amount of DPS to the group.<br />
Until we had to rez the zerker then they wanted me to tank !<br />
Boy that sure sucked but i muddled through it somehow.<br />
Nothing you did wrong there just someone that was lazy or clueless about their more then likely PL'd shiny new toon.<br />

Just remember death is EQs way of saying slow down =)</div></div><hr />

Exactly, Ablative Shields &gt; all particuarlly on raids!  Nothing like being next in tank rotation on RZ in time and watching Target's Target go:<br />
MT that dies<br />
Monk that doesn't believe in FD<br />
Rogue not paying attention<br />
Rogue in pissing contest on GC<br />
Then getting your AE taunt off 'cuz the first CH just landed....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed SotB was 12/19 with a 75 dd stun proc. On the outset (compare this to SoD) the extra 1 delay won't matter crap, nor will the reduced DD component of the proc (SoD's DD is 288, but both have stun). The relevant question is: how much does Planar Stun get resisted in comparison to Anarchy? Or is there any difference at all? <br />
<br />
My original plan was to keep SoD until I got GBoS, and then sell SoD and offhand the CHoS. <br />
<br />
But I'm really starting to like Wandor's idea.</div></div><hr />

OMG this just made me bust out roaring <br />
<br />
Never forget: It is much more mana efficent to rez a ranger than heal one. <br />
<br />
I have had this problem with a wizzy that groups with me from time to time from my guild and it has been mentioned for her to chill on her nukes but she consistantly over nukes. However, on Saturday my wife was working so I botted her cleric and took our little group to POI and let the wizzy die 3 times in 20 minutes when we played on Sunday she was much less nuke intensive.</div></div><hr />

If Wandor has an suggestion, you can pretty much bet that following that suggestion will leave you better off than taking some other course of action.</div></div><hr />
