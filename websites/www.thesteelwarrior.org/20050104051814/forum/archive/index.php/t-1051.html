<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sudaka</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had numerous people tell me I should get a Wurmslayer (25/40) to replace my Lamentation (9/19) and put the Stone Bladed Axe (13/26) in offhand. Is this correct?…the delay on the Wurmslayer is high (I think) and I was under the impression that you want a low delay to get more hits in on a mob. The Lamentation is twice as fast meaning I get double the hits against a Wurmslayer, I normally hit for upper 20's with the Lamentation...so the Wurmslayer would have to hit in the low/mid 50's consistently to do an equal amount of damage over the same time period. Is the Wurmslayer that much better of a weapon?...does it hit for that much?<br />
<br />
I'm currently low 30's and don't crit often as I have a lower Dexterity, however my 1h slash is usually maxed out due to the Lamentation. Players tell me you get &quot;uber crits with a Wurmslayer&quot;, however, I don't rely on crits for damage as they are rare and inconsistent. Could someone please help me out, am I missing some key factor...I have not played a warrior before and to my knowledge cannot really recall many of the warriors I have grouped with wielding one, they mostly fight with Centi SS/LS and/or a Lamentation. If it's all I've been bragged to about why isn't every warrior equipped with one, or are we all missing the same factor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't buy into the Wurmy story - your Lammy in Main and SBA in offhand is perfectly acceptable. Generally the faster weapon goes in main (ideally with procs), while the slower, harder hitting weap with stats is in offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason you put a fast weapon mainhand is to take advantage of the free damage you get from your main hand damage bonus. The problem is that until you get into your mid to late 40s, your damage bonus is negligible. It doesn't add enough damage to justify sacrificing speed for ratio. Since you are relying on DPS for agro, you will be better off weidling a Wurmy for another 10-15 levels. Keep the Lammy bagged and swap it out when you get to level 45-48, until then the Wurmy is a superior weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor, thats one of the best twinked warriors i've seen in a long time.....  nice :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skullreaper Zek</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Wurmy hits hard but the DPS aggro is not updated until the next landed strike - in my books a faster weap with a decent ratio keeps the mobs attention better. Again it is what suits your style of play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sudaka</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, that answered my other question about the main hand damage bonus (I wasn't sure at what levels it started taking effect). I also have the following banked:<br />
<br />
Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Slashing  Atk Delay: 22<br />
DMG: 6  Dam bonus: 3<br />
Effect: Spirit Strike (Combat) (-81hp DD)<br />
WT:  1.5    Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD BRD ROG <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
I ran the quest for the fun of it (and EXP). Question about that one...the damage bonus meaning that it can potentially be a 9/22 if the bonus is applied...what is the damage bonus based off of and how often is it applied, what drives it's application?<br />
<br />
As for my current set-up I should switch my weapons around??? (Currently have SBA in primary for when I do get a crit...cause crit damage is based off of weapon damage &amp; weapon skill check right? If so, wouldn't I want it rolled against a 13 dam weapon vs a 9 damage?)<br />
With that said, if I can get my hands on a Wurmy (I usually don't have much cash, under 1k) I would bank the Lammy, put the SB Axe in primary and the Wurmslayer in off-hand (Unless it's primary only...I think I remember it being that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the damage bonus does is after you hit the mob it adds the base damage you have done + the damage bonus per hit.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
weapon dmg: 6<br />
weapon dmg bonus: 3<br />
<br />
You swing and hit for 18. That means you hit for 15 and the +3 damage bonus was added after the strike.</div></div><hr />

Ahhhhh...Ok, so that's what is meant. That will change my thinking about DPS on weapons, I was told once that the damage bonus was something similar to a crit. Meaning that occasionaly it &quot;boosted&quot; that damage multiplier...ie. 6/22 was sometimes a 9/22 weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As was stated previously, go with the weapon with the best ratio (wurmslayer) until you get to your late 40's, I think it's level 48 or 49  (did the math a long time ago) where the lammy will begin to outdamage the wurmy due to your damage bonus.  The other alternative is to use a faster weapon with an aggro proc.  And the wakizashi, while adding to overall DPS if it procs alot, wont be all that good aggro wise, 'cause it's pure DD.  Anyway, the point is, until your damage bonus gets to be about 8 or so wurmy is better than lammy from a pure DPS perspective. Use a proccing weapon in offhand (snare whip, ykesha, or better) and you should have no aggro problems at all unless someone is really trying to pull aggro (or is a total retard, which usually amounts to the same thing) :D<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

Thanks Terrorus, I am pretty happy with the little dwarf. He's almost done, time to level him to 65 and get some AA. If I could only get another acid bracer and get the damn parts for an earth bow he would be gtg for a while.<br />

I'll keep my eyes out for a Wurmy but it'll probably be a while before I can afford one as I often end up grouping in zones with very little along the lines of loot/cash. I also have a few slots I would like to do an upgrade on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say keep the lammy.  Main reason is it looks cooler!  <br />
<br />
When wurm slayers first came out people flocked towards theme but because they are very slow it makes every miss that much more of a factor.  Will you do better damge with a wurmy?  probible but the lammy is a better over-all weapon.  If your just going for ratio try useing 2hers.</div></div><hr />
