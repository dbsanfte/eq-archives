I am a 56 war and am looking for advice as to the best places/fastest way to get to 65.  FYI I do not 2 box.  Just looking for help.  Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You really have a lot and I mean, a lot of zones to do that. From PoP (PoN, PoD, PoI...) to Kunark (Revamped HS,Nurga, Droga, Seb,...), Velious (Velks, SG, Kael, EW,...), LDoN, Luclin (I didnt have Luclin when I was 56, so dunno much about it), LoY ( Nadox, Dulak, Torgiran Mines,...)... just to name some zones. At that lvl, there are really too many zones you can go to with friends :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend levelling up outside the planes for as long as it's feasible. The exp may flow a bit slower, but you'll be able to see places that will soon be unprofitable for you from a levelling perspective. Since you're looking at spending a lot of post-65 time in the planes, you should take the opportunity you have now to visit the places that Ealsur listed (especially Veksar, which I love).<br />

Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalaniel</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Live in Plane of Storms and start working on Bastion of Thunder Key Parts..If your lucky you can get in on a pickup raid (or loot the rots) for the harder parts. It should put you in BOT by 62...then its gravey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would advice against heading into BoT just when you ding 62. Tanks have a hard time into new zones, they always had (remember KC days where you couldnt get in till you were at least, 51 :p ), and in BoT, even if you are 62, you might not have the AAs (CS,CA) unless you did em earlier, if thats the case, you could try BoT. But unless you have the AAs or the gear to compensate, I would avoid being a manasponge and just go somewhere else safer and where you are gonna have a better time. If it has to be in the Planes, CoD, Torment, are two of my fav lower tier zones :)<br />
I would try Veksar too, like Lathen said, neat camps and chances for drops :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in PoN at your level and at around 57 I went to PoV. The exp there is impressive be it regular exp or  AA's. I stayed there until I had CS/CA2, PE and ND3. Then At 63 I went to BoT and finished up CS/CA and am working on LR and ID. Exp there is also pretty good. About 2% aa a kill at 65. Another good thing about BoT is the Loot. Very nice. As far as tanking at 63 in BoT, I found I had little trouble there.  Getting a group was not a problem. It's my favorite place to exp.  GL</div></div><hr />
