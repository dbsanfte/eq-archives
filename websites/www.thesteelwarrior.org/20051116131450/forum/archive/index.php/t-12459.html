Can you really get the 425+ Defense most people say you need to tank in MC and beyond while having 300+ FR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">08-08-2005, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in MC are mostly 1 or the other.   You either need high defense for the stuff thats trying to crush you, or high FR for the stuff thats trying to burn you.  The high FR covers most of the spike damage that the defense gear would on fire based mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">08-09-2005, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah. just make sure you spike it either way depending on the mob. 360 defense and 180 FR won't do much for you against Geddon, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zatriz Spiritscale</div><div class="date">08-09-2005, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it's only boss mobs that you swing for?  Ok, that sounded wrong but oh well.  ;)<br />
<br />
So basically carry two sets of armor once you get to MC level and beyond...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmane</div><div class="date">08-09-2005, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have a link to the addon that allows you to macro two sets of gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion1</div><div class="date">08-09-2005, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol you don't need 425 defense to tank in MC.  That's utter garbage.  We've cleared MC many times and have been killing Ragnaros for months now, and I doubt if any of our tanks actually have that much defense even now, let alone when we first started clearing.  <br />
<br />
FR in MC, really you only need it for the Lava Packs and for Ragnaros.   I guess Geddon too.  I suppose you could wear it for the Firelord's, but that's a lot of switching!  (just get wardrobe though, will make it easier)<br />
<br />
Yes definately keep a few sets of gear around.  I have wardrobe mod, and I have about 3 or 4 different sets of gear.  (DPS, Tanking, resists, PvP, etc.)  That mod makes it really easy to switch out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">08-14-2005, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">300+ FR gives some amusing stability vs fire mobs.  I had the stacking incinerate effect up to +2500 the other day before we ran out of firelords. ^^  Interestingly enough, even with that sort of stacking, I was still taking less damage than someone at zero.</div></div><hr />
