<br />
This is my first post, and I have a feeling I need more skill with the search function, but I am hoping it is a easy one to answer.  I am trying to decide on a anger II or yak proc for my Blas Blade of the Exiled (my main agro weapon).  They are both 510 points and I really don't do enough ldons to justify the anger 3.  It would be an additional 3-5 weeks to get the 10 more adventures.  Is there anyway to know whether a stun does more or less agro than a 400 hate proc?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Posted and then saw Brutul's thread where KoGuiN says '400hate &lt; stun &lt; 600 hate'.  I knew I needed more skill with the search funtion.  So it looks like yak is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

Ykesha has the small knockback which may be a concern at times.<br />
<br />
And atm, I'm not sure which of the two (if at all) as a better proc rate than the other.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea whether that's actually true or not.  I do know that Anger 3 seems to proc all the time.<br />

I also have no idea whether the increased proc rate (if it exists) applies to all of the 1150-point procs, or just to Anger 3.</div></div><hr />

You can look up a marble sphere of ire in Lucy and see the procrate mod of zero on it.</div></div><hr />

Great to see you.  Thanks for the offer.  I am back playing after a long long absence, 18 months I think.  Just starting to get my eq up to elem level, where my guild is.  Sorry to hijack my own thread.  Anyway, hmm knockback is annoying.  Does anyone have a feel for how much agro the difference is between 400 hate and the yak stun?  Is it significant?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on other threads, some prefer the Yak over Anger 2.<br />
<br />
When I get enough points, I plan to aug my offhand with Ykesha, and keep the Anger in the mainhand.<br />
<br />
The knockback is very small (1 foot i believe), so in and of itself is negligible. I'm just thinking that if you add pet push and whatnot, it may become a concern later. Epescially if you dual wield with yaks, get 1 ft push per proc... you get the idea.<br />
<br />
I'd say it'd be a rare thing to worry about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont' know why it wouldn't be. But yes people have parsed Anger III and it is 2 procs/minute.<br />
<br />
I would definitely get Ykesha over Anger II.  I very seriously considered getting it over Anger III but finally went with Anger III.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had Ang II, Ykesha 100 and Ang III so far....<br />
<br />
I agree 400 &lt; ykesha &lt; 600<br />
