<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xppen Nnelty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question here.  I'm a  65 unguilded warrior with just a few flags and no uber gear.. I've been trying to upgrade and the &quot;biggest&quot; upgrade I could see would be to blow all my cash on a Helmet of Rallos Zek (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8171)  or White Dragon Helm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6766)  as an upgrade.  I love the ac on the Rallos Zek helm but as you can see from magelo (mostly accurate).. my resist's are horrible.  Can't really see anything else that I could tradeskill or buy and I'd like to make a noticiable upgrade.  I'm slowly gaining ornate pieces so I'm not going to buy any molds.   Any recommendations would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KaoraEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definately Helmet of Rallos Zek, you wont regret the AC increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd have to agree, Helmet of Rallos Zek all the way. The huge AC rocks, and the only time I find myself *really* needing resists is on raids anyway (moot point since you said you are unguilded).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iwould Highly consider working on your Face and neck slots also.  Anything with HP will be alot better than what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daimadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definitely Helm of Rallos Zek.  You'll love the AC and stats.  What's better... you'll never have to worry about upgrading ur head slot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AoW helm is totally awesome, even deep in the elementals some people dont change it.<br />
<br />
Its perfect exept for 1 little detail : ITS UGLY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xppen Nnelty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great, thats what I was thinking but its an expensive purchase,  just wanted to get another opinion.  Thanks</div></div><hr />
