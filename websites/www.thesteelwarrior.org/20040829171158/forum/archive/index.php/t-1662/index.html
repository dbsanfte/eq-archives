<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. my idea:<br />
taunt makes you highest on the aggro list. when it fails it does nothing. now my idea is for ever 20 levels you gain you take 1 second off for when taunt fails. so at level 60 if taunt failed it would have a 4second reuse time and this goes so on till it works. then 7 sec. at level 40 5 sec. so on and so on. it gets reused doen to 4,5 or 6 when it fails when it suceeds 7 sec time. and when you get 65 it's 3.5 sec reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've already suggested something along these lines.  It seems like is really one of the only things which doesn't significantly improve against the mobs you're fighting as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sargman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd rather see something similar to what they've got for shield in aa abilites, where you can invest in making the reuse time shorter. When PoP came out they tweaked reusage of our disciplines because defensive would have been usable again after 1 minute had it continued on the decrease of 1 min every level past 55 that it was following before PoP came out. That would ahve made too many thigns trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heres a different idea :p Increase the reuse time on taunt but make it more effective.<br />
<br />
Currently testing reported in another thread showed taunt working 40% of the time.  Kinda crappy really.  <br />
<br />
If this was increased to 80% but the reuse was increased to 12seconds it would put a little more &quot;skill&quot; into playing a warrior - not mashing taunt, waiting for slow / debuff messages before taunting etc and less of the randomness - no more 4 failed taunts in a row as your mob chews up your chanter.<br />
<br />
Also with a longer reuse time there would be a stronger case to have it reduceable via AA's though it would suck to have them class AA's as you'd want the skill to be purchaseable before lvl 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm, well if you had a slower get a resist on slow and then you taunted the mob off, then he cast slow again, what would you do?  Just wait 12 seconds until the button ungreyed to get it off him?  Doesn't seem like an improvement to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">depends if the slower had the decency to wait an extra 3-4 secs before recasting.  when you figure in casting time + spell refresh time it doesnt take too much restraint to get 12 secs in between slows.<br />
<br />
Brings back a little skill in exchange for less dependancy on the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sargman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">by that argument Eoden, I'd rather split the difference and go 60% w/ a 9 tick reuse, although I'm not sold on an increase in time, especially with how many people out there cannot control their own agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CATEIRE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im not sold at all on the idea of increasing the taunt time. The whole point is to make the taunt ability &quot;in a xp role&quot; more along the lines of the knight. <br />
<br />
I like the Idea of decreasing the reuse time though. <br />
<br />
I think in addition to decreasing the reuse time we should see a message like: <br />
<br />
YOU SUCK TAUNT FAILED TRY AGAIN<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
MOB_01 has been enraged a the very idea of you jeering at it.</div></div><hr />
