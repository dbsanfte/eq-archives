<br />
anyone have a formula or something??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the dual wield check goes off everytime the delay of your offhand weapon comes up. So the shorter the delay, the more checks you get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes your offhand only swings when you get a &quot;dual wield off&quot; - but the time between dual wield checks is determined by your OFFHAND delay, not your mainhand delay.<br />
<br />
Your mainhand weapon has nothing to do with the performance of your offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that for aggro generation in the offhand you look at innate procs and the ratio of the weapon (damage: delay). (Will assume that aug procs could go equally on any offhand.)<br />
Assuming procs are exactly equal, then the ratio is the difference.<br />
A trivial example: A Centi Short Sword (12/25) will not generate as much aggro in the offhand as a Bloodguard Wand of the Walking Dead (16/26) even though the Centi is 25 delay and the Bloodguard is 26.<br />
Of course, the Centi looks like a sword, and the Bloodguard looks like Harold's Purple Crayon, but that's a different story.</div></div><hr />

I would say a slower ratio on your offhand is better than fast ratio that is the same.<br />
<br />
Even after you get a damage bonus on your offhand, it is scaled to the delay, so the slower your weapon is the higher the damage bonus for offhand.</div></div><hr />

See, this is a very bad thing to say to uninformed people.  Quotes like this are why after 5 years, many people still think 10/30 is just as good as 10/20 in offhand.  People interpret &quot;offhand delay doesn't matter&quot; as meaning &quot;offhand uses the primary hand's delay&quot;.  Then they make bad equipment choices.<br />
<br />
Instead you should tell people &quot;ratio is all that matters in offhand&quot;.  The offhand delay most definitely matters, because it's part of the ratio.<br />
<br />
To answer the original poster: Your main hand has nothing to do with your offhand.  You can have a lantern in your mainhand and still swing your offhand.  Offhand delay dictates how often your offhand swings.  10/30 is worse than 10/20 in the offhand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never seen a parse that proves this.<br />
<br />
I think there was a recent thread kickin around regarding scaling of damage bonus for sinister strikes based on delay (safehouse?).  Think that one had some parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in one of our threads, we parsed the offhand DB from sinister strike to INT(DL/3.5).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jakazzx</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so everyone is now saying that it's the ratio and not the actual delay that u want? weapon damage somehow factors into how fast you attack with offhand and that sinister strikes AA will help my offhand attack more and not just do more base damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya Yoda I think that was the one I had read (or did you really mean threats? heheh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the damage bonus is bigger for slower weapons in off hand but it is applied less often so it seems to me that it does the same overall damage per minute no matter what you are swinging.  All that matters is round off.  Here is an example of what I am saying:<br />
<br />
Two hypothetical weapons:<br />
<br />
One is 60 delay --&gt; 10 swings per minute<br />
Other is 30 delay --&gt; 20 swings per minute<br />
<br />
I am assuming that misses happen the same percentage to all delays so they scale linearly with each other.  We only care about relative damage here so the actual number will be less because of misses but the ratio should be unaffected.<br />
<br />
60 delay weapon--&gt;  DB = Int(60/3.5) = Int(17.1429) = 17 damage per offhand swing<br />
                                  applied 10 times a minute = 170 damage/min<br />
<br />
30 delay weapon--&gt; DB = Int(30/3.5) = Int(8.5714) = 8 damage per offhand swing<br />
                                 applied 20 times a minute = 160 damage per minute<br />
<br />
The only reason there is 10 damage per minute more on the 60 delay weapon is round off from truncating the fraction part of the damage bonus.  You lost 0.1429 x 10 = 1.429 damage per minute on the 60 delay weapon and 0.5714 x 20 = 11.429 damage per minute on the 30 delay weapon.  If the formula is correct, then the best weapons will have delays that are whole number multiples of 3.5 so that the truncated part is zero and damage bonus is maximized.  A 35 delay weapon would be ideal in other words since 35/3.5 = exactly 10.0 and would give 171 damage per minute or 2.85 dps.  By the same reasoning, a 70 delay weapon will have exactly the same maximum damage bonus of 171 damage per minute.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:  Sinister strikes gives an offhand damage increase of not more than 2.85 dps if the OHDB = Int(delay/3.5) formula is correct and this will be maximized for weapons that have whole number multiples of 3.5 delay.</div></div><hr />

I think the main thing that needs to be said is that you need to factor in the DB on the weapons (on both hands if you have the applicable AAs) with your ratio or DPS calcultions to get a clear picture of the potential damage you can do.<br />
<br />
(DMG + DB)/DLY = potential damage more accurate than just DLY/DMG like you see on many item databases. If you go by ratio alone, you could get a 10DMG/20DLY (2.0) weapon and think it is as good as a 15/30 (2.0) simply based on ratio. Factor in the DB and things change slightly as DB starts to increase, you may find that a slightly higher DLY nets you a larger DB on your off-hand, while offering the same ratio.<br />
<br />
On your mainhand, DB is applies every swing and is 13 at 65, no matter what the delay, so faster is better, while maintaining the same ratio. (10DMG + 13DB)/20 is effectively a 23/20 weapon, while (15DMG + 13DB)/30 is an effectively a 28/30 weapon. Both are the same ratio without factoring in the DB, but afterward the faster delay is clearly superior. Lending credit to the fast weapon main hand is better than a slow weapon philosiphy of agro generation. Do the math and you see why. It's not because you are swinging more, its because you are exploiting the fact that DB doesn't scale with delay on your mainhand.<br />
<br />
I hope that comes across clearly, I've had to revise it several times to be as correct as possible and now I can harly remember what the thread way about. I can only guess this is applicable at this point unitl I can read the thread again. :P<br />
<br />
I think the main point I was trying to get across is that you need to factor in the DB on your weapons when comparing different setups, AND factor in the differences between the way DB is applied/calculated on the main hand and off hand. A good main hand weapon may not be the best choice as a off-hand weapon and visa vera.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a related note, I believe this is why MONK do the damage that they do. They have the haste and usually faster weapons than warriors to apply DB more often, increasing their DPS. Give a warrior and a monk the same DMG/DLY weapons and the same haste, I bet they do very similar DPS. I could be stating the obvious, but it was a new concept to me. i always though monks had an innately batter DB than us, however I didn't see one when looking a melee damage bonus tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If two weapons have the same ratio, assuming everything else being equal, the slower weapon is the better one in offhand.  This is because you get less ripostes, and the first swing on your offhand is more aggro and more chance to proc (slower weapons more likely to proc per hit) than a faster weapon, so you have slightly more early aggro, which is important to dealing with slow/tash/etc.  The DPS from Sinister Strike is pretty much constant so it's not really a factor.  Of course, unlike mainhand, it is possible to fail to make the dual wield roll, in that case the faster weapon is better because you can try to make another dual wield again, but once DW is maxed out the chance of succeeding DW is pretty high so I think you can count on it working, especially if you have Ambidexterity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jak, we are getting all complicated here.<br />
<br />
Simply put... the delay is your off hand does matter, as far as how often you swing your off hand weapon.<br />
<br />
I don't know what level you are, but starting at about level 25, you start to get a bonus to your main hand weapon. This bonus is applied every time you swing. Because of this, a lower delay main hand weapon is often preferred- To get that bonus as often as you can.<br />
<br />
In your off hand, there is no bonus, unless you get the Sinister Strike AA. Even if you get the SS AA, the bonus, unlike the main hand bonus, is a variable- a higher delay weapon gives you more of a bonus, but it is applied less often.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the delay on your off hand isn't really very important, it's more important that your offhand has a good ratio of dmg/dly.<br />
<br />
If that's not clear... a 10 dmg, 20 delay weapon is much better then a 20 damage, 40 delay weapon in your main hand. A 10 damage, 20 delay weapon is the same as a 20 damage 40 delay weapon in your off hand.<br />
<br />
Well, mostly. See Phantron's post right above mine for some minor differences between the two.<br />
<br />
Also, having said that, I like my off hand weapon to have a damage of at least 15, making my minimiun hit 2 instead of 1, but that's probably just a holdover from the early days of Ssra.</div></div><hr />
