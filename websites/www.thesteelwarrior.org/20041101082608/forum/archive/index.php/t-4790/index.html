Do you see the need for Anger 3 / EB weapons any longer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gleb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">always a need for them!<br />
<br />
Edit: adding a bit more to this since it seemed a bit spasmatic.<br />
<br />
When we run out of endurance, we will not be able to do our needed discs, so there will always be a need for agro weapons, without a doubt.  Also, who knows where some of the 60+ discs are located, I believe they said that the all discs UP TO level 60 are in EFP or in PoK.  So some of us probably won't get the new agro disc and the new defensive disc for some time now.<br />
<br />
Even with new openings and new discs, we want to make sure that those darn wizzies can nuke to their hearts content and not get agro and die like the pansies they are.  <br />
<br />
So to sum it up, yup, warriors will always need agro weapons, but mostly because everyone, including the warriors and SoE want it so that warriors have to work to keep agro.<br />
<br />
We should never get an agro lock jus because we are warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's been said elsewhere, but all the existing disciplines and the new ones introduced in this patch are sold in PoK and EC. Absor recently said something about them thinking about having future skills be dropped/quested, but not this time around.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just to be clear, I have personally purchased them all in PoK.</div></div><hr />

The new stuff is great and exactly what we needed IMO, but you still need those procs, there is no such thing as too much aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a class that has had castable aggro....<br />
<br />
Proc aggro is still very nice because of<br />
<br />
1) Lazyness, if you can hold aggro just by meleeing, do you really want to be pressing all those buttons... ya its cool at the start but god it gets old...<br />
<br />
2) Endurance... I dont go oom much, but sometimes i do, whether its from recently ressed, manadrain, out of food, or just overuse, its nice to beable to just get aggro without using any resource<br />
<br />
3) Allows you to do other things... if i'm stunning a mob, then i cant be healing as easily, or paying attention as much to other things, if i just hold aggro through melee, /taunt its much easier for me to play my character better because i dont have to worry or spend as much time on it...<br />
<br />
4) Lazyness again! on that 20 minute fight, do you really want to accidently loose aggro cause you forgot to use provoke every time it popped? Proc aggro you do not have to &quot;do&quot; anything, its a general baseline (on the average) that you will have regardless of how many other buttons your pushing...<br />
<br />
did i mention lazyness?<br />
<br />
haha no seriously as a paladin i still like having aggro procs so i dont have to do as much work when tanking, i think for a while it will be really cool to FINNALY beacuse to get that fucking aggro now and man its so cool GET IN MY FACE AND HIT ME RAWR...<br />
<br />
few months down the road tho.. ... it get ssorta old..  i still like casting from a range on inc to secure aggro, but i'm MUCH happier if after that i just holdaggro through procs and dps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You may not always NEED the EB/Anger proc weapons and Incite gives us a lot more weapon flexibility but on named and essentially any high-risk mob where you absolutely, positively, must have aggro, yeah, make sure you have some nasty proc weapons handy.<br />
<br />
I usually do just fine with my un-aug'd 41/31 staff in xp groups but I haul out the aggro weapons for raids and named.  With Incite I should see even fewer issues with the staff but I'll still keep the aggro proc weapons ready.</div></div><hr />
