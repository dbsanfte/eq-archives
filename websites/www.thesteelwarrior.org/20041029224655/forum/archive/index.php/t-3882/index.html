<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello!<br />
I will duo alot with my GF that plays a druid.<br />
I want a good dps weapon that i can use when I duo with her. Doesnt matter if its 1h or 2h and dont need to be high aggro proc and stuff, just want good dps for a warrior between lvl 55-60 that is either Bazaar bought or easy aquired.<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For really cheap, I'd suggest Greatstaff of Thunder.  On most servers, if not all, I think they are at most a few hundred pp.  With it's proc, it's also a pretty good agro wep.  If you have more pp, a windblade is very nice *around 20k on Druzzil Ro, not sure about the other servers*, or a war marshall's bladed staff.     Some inbetween choices include tae ew 2-hander, or widebladed greatsword.<br />
<br />
These are all 2hand weps btw, as 2H does more damage than dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Presuming you don't mind taking a group with you...<br />
<br />
Take a small group to Droga and you can camp the Copper Hammer of Striking/Swod of the Bloodsworn combo.<br />
<br />
1 group of 55-60 could easily do this camp, or you could buy them in bazaar.<br />
<br />
For just cheapness, the Great Staff of Thunder can hold good agro.<br />
<br />
Be well,</div></div><hr />

hitting in the 150 - 200 range with critics in the 400 range (max)<br />
And since piggy is being slaughtered like there where a team of <br />
football players claiming for pork meat :) its price keeps going down in the servers (5K to 8-10K in AB server), Of course a windblade is better but also more expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Although these guys are both correct that for pure DPS WMBS is better I would suggest the combo I have:<br />
<br />
<br />
Long Sword of Yek main  17del 12dam<br />
Split Blade of Destruction off   19del 14dam<br />
<br />
<br />
Why use items with less DPS you ask? Well They look 10 times better AND you swing a ton with the 17delay mainhand so people near you see you hitting many many times. Although you actually do less DPS with these then a WMBS the perception will be that you do a lot more heh.....<br />
<br />
I put the WMBS up for sale, and I bag the GSoT for when I need agro.... These is just cooler....<br />
<br />
Also although I have no parse or anything although these do less DPS I dont think its very much less at all.....</div></div><hr />

Yeah, except people with intelligence see that the mob is dying slower so they figure you're a cheap twink who doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.</div></div><hr />

About 15% less actually... or the equivalent of removing a focus item if he was one of your wizards.  Would you do that just for looks?</div></div><hr />

Wtf kind of BS is that to post?</div></div><hr />

There are people who play with others hits on?  <br />
<br />
The only reason I can think of that players might have others hits on is if they are parsing in which case they'll be able to see how sad your DPS really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't go to Nurga to get the CHoS or SoTB, you'll be there a long time trying to get that drop.  Might want to head to Droga though, you may have some luck there.  ;)<br />
<br />
I don't see any problem with using weapons for looks.  Different strokes for different folks.  If you are hardcore into results then of course you are going to think that would be stupid...  But after all it is a game and is meant to be fun.<br />
<br />
All the above suggestions are good, personal style and preference are important imo...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those 40 percent of swings that you miss will happen a lot more too if someone is watching so what is the difference?  <br />
<br />
Also, if you care about looks, just take art classes and draw a cool looking warrior to hang on your wall or to keep under your mattress or whatever.  If you are playing a warrior and you let how some gear looks influence what you use, your warrior will just kind of suck.</div></div><hr />

Crap, thanks for fixing that. Will edit the post. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just upgraded my Savage Stone Axe to a WMBS.  Did a quick LDoN where I wasn't tanking and my parse showed a 5dps improvement.  I'd rather the WMBS than a Windblade personally.  The ratios are near identical, but the Windblade just seems too slow to me.  I won't see any 600+ crits with the WMBS(unless the RNG decides to be very nice to me) but if I wanted to see huge crits I'd finish leveling up my wizzy:p</div></div><hr />
