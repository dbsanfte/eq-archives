<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK folks serious questions here about proc mechanics.  All testable, but I hate to imagine doing all this parsing on my own <br />
<br />
Some of these will seem simplistic, and many of you will be &quot;sure&quot; you know the answer.  But do we actually know based on evidence, or just think we know?...<br />
<br />
1.  Independance of procs from different weapons<br />
<br />
Ok so youre wielding two proc weapons which both have nice agro procs.  Do you actually proc twice as much now (assuming both have equal proc rates), or do you simply proc the same total number of times per minute, and distribute the procs between the two?<br />
<br />
Test: compare total number of procs per minute when wielding a single proc weapon and a non proccing weapon with the rate when wielding two proccing weapons.<br />
<br />
2.  Independance of spell and weapon procs<br />
<br />
Ok so youre using a nice procing weapon and a friendly enchanter casts Nights Dark Terror or Boon of the Garou on you.  Or if youre lucky, you click your Orb of the Sky for the ranger buff Call of Sky.  You now have procs coming form two sources:  your innate buff procs and your weapon.<br />
<br />
Assuming Dex has not changed, does this actually increase your proc rate overall (total number of procs per minute, ignore the proc source) or are the procs simply distributed among more proc types now?<br />
<br />
Test:  someone who has maxxed dex pre-buffs could test this using NDT or BotG.. someone without would have to use a non-dex proc spell such as Tricksters.  Compare overall proc rates, as well as the proc rates for each source, between two test conditions: with and without the proc buff.<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
All of the above stems from one concern - my Enraging Blow proc is much more important to me than some piddly little NDT or BotG proc.  And if my second theory is correct... then these spells (aside form the negligible effect of the dex) are actually causing a reduction in EB procs...<br />
<br />
So:  anyone have data?:D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />

I'm not using an offhand weapon there, as the only one I had at the time, iirc, was a primal 1HB, and it would have thrown off the swing count and the dex values... did those tests over a year ago.  However, I consistantly find that when I was using my DW combo (Acrylia Handled Broadsword + Bonechiller), my mainhand and offhand procs were independant of each other.  I would consistantly get, over time, the same number of procs from each weapon solo and paired.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proc rate and dex is something that I have studied for a long time with many different weapons.   Just last week in the cave in pon killing Mephits (high 50's)  and fighting for 105 mins I had 205 procs from GoT for one proc every 30.73 sec.  This is what I have found for every weapon I have tested at dex of 265 or higher, WC, FB, Epics 1hs, epic 2hs, BP's the weapon made no differce the delay made no difference.  Back when my dex was lower the testing I did showed a linear relationship between dex and proc rate.   There is a huge difference in proc rate in short test but as you near 1hr or more I always come to 1 proc/30sec and the limited testing I did for offhand showed half that or 1 proc / 60 sec at &gt;= 265 dex.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents, take if for what is worth<br />

I have had combat rounds where I will proc EB 3-5 times with a call of fire proc or two in there.  I am on the side that each hand and each proc has its own idependant chance of procing.  I dont think you have anything to worry about with a procing offhand when it comes to the main hand procing EB.</div></div><hr />
