<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MrWallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I may be in the wrong place, but I'm sure many of you will gladly point me in the right direction:)  I've been playing MrWallace for 3 years and have not had many chances to melee in a group setting.  Recently, I have been doing it a bit more just for fun and have observed something strange.  I have &quot;/assist off&quot; so that when I assist the MA I do not auto attack.  After sending in dogdog and slowing I move behind the mob and hit auto attack.  All is well unless there are 2 mobs in camp.  Auto attack seems to target the nearest mob (you know the one that's mezzed!).  I have tried several times and the end result seems to be that even though I have the correct mob targeted when I hit auto attack my target switches to the nearest mob if I do not happen to be closer to the targeted mob.  Is this normal behavior that a silly Shaman who doesn't melee should expect.  Or is there another way I should engage attack so as not to ever switch my target based on proximity?  Thank you for all replies...constructive and not:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, the autoattack key in itself will not target anything, so its possibly a macro issue.<br />
<br />
Can you list here exactly what keys your hitting on the pull? or list the macro set your assist and attack keys use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MrWallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thx for the quick reply.  I hit my assist key which is &quot;/assist (MA)&quot;.  This gives me the target and attack is off because i have &quot;/assit off&quot; toggled.  When I move to engage I hit `.  That the tic or tilde key upper left.  That is the key I have setup for auto attack.  Is it possible that some new key mapping also uses that key.  Liek with the cycle through mobs they put in recently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Overlapped key mapping is a possability, I myself use /attack off rather than /assist off so i'm not sure if that command acts differently or not.<br />
<br />
I would double check the keyboard assignments in alt+o ingame, its possible something is set twice and may have been for some time but you haven't noticed since you don't melee often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MrWallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ty...I will check it out.  /assist off is a toggle that you use once.  It allows me to assist someone without attacking their target.  I can for example assist the enchanter and slow the mob he just mezzed without swinging at it:)  The `/~ key is mapped to auto attack...is that different from having an attack key?  Should I have a kay that has /attack on instead?</div></div><hr />

I believe this is my problem!<br />
<br />
Just posting this here to add info to an excellent site.  I will be coming back here to read more (even though I do not play a melee).  It may help me group with them:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some UI's i've found that if you use the mouse to click a hotkey like assist it registers the click for targeting not the assist.  I've had several casters complain to me about this problem to.<br />
<br />
Keyboard is your friend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The ~ or ` key by default is &quot;target nearest npc&quot;, just like F8. You need to either pick a new autoattack key, or unbind it from target nearest npc, and you'll be much happier.</div></div><hr />
