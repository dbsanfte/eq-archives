Wow. It's been a long time... Having a little fun with LORD and stuff though! I remember when food fight (one of them) kicked so much ass... Ahhh, the days were good when we finally got a 9600 baud modem. Crazy improvement over our 2400 baud, which had been a step up from our 1200 baud... Jeez. The memories.</div></div><hr />

Ten years later it's pretty much the same thing, only now I only need to wait 3 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Food fight and LORD were indeed the big win.<br />

We used to log in to local BBS from computer class in 7th grade on 300baud modems.</div></div><hr />
