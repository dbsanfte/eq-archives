<br />
Make tanking dependent on proximity, damage, procs (bleh, I know, I know), and other intangibles.<br />
<br />
If TAUNT didn't exist, they would have had to be creative with how agro works.  TAUNT was a crutch for the programmers that we suffer with now.<br />
<br />
No solutions now.  The damage has been done.  The TAUNT key must exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the Taunt key was the crutch...<br />
<br />
EB is the granny walker, with cute little wheels....<br />
<br />
EB is imo, the absolute worst thing ever to happen to the warrior population in EQ.</div></div><hr />

I still dont know how telling a mob that his mother smells like poo really helps. And why if they are red to me they all of a sudden just dont care what I think. =\</div></div><hr />

But they sure hate you casting those spells they are immune to...</div></div><hr />

This is in reference to hybrids which don't really need the taunt key in the first place.<br />
<br />
How would removing taunt fix anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You miss the point Steenky!<br />
<br />
They designed in many of the agro issues because they had the crutch of the taunt key to make it all okay.  The taunt key made it so they could justify how spell agro works.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it have been better to base agro on something less arbitrary than a random number generator that we push with questionable results?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it would. What sort of idea did you have in mind? I believe that taunt atleast gives a variable since it relies on the RNG. Without this variable aggro lock would occur much like it does with Paladins at the moment. This isn't good either since it removes the challange from the game on certain levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not proposing a solution; I am pointing to the crux of the problem.  They programmed in the warrior's worst problem when they created the Taunt key sometime in 1998 or 1999.  At the time it may have been a decent idea.  Now it is the design flaw that hurts the most.<br />
<br />
At this point, they can't do a total revamp of how agro works -- at least not for a pure melee like warriors.<br />
<br />
I have no ideas.  I am merely pointing with other hand over mouth at why we warriors have the issues that they do.<br />
<br />
I personally have a Blade of War.  I don't have NEARLY the problems most warriors have now.  But I understand the issue and would like to see it resolved.<br />
<br />
Taunt isn't broken.  It works as intended.  It works so poorly they created Area Taunt.  Area Taunt works so well they created Hastened Instigation.  I expect more AA solutions rather than Verant doing what would really fix the problem -- rewriting all of the agro coding.</div></div><hr />
