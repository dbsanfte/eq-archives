<br />
2:  Increase HP when cast by 1500 <br />
3:  Decrease Hitpoints by 150 per tick <br />
<br />
Is it just me or this ability SUCK hard ? it is just a simple heal AND a dot ? We have the only GoD AA with a side effect ? or does it raise max hp too ?<br />
<br />
I would like to see something in the same caliber as other GoD AAs :<br />

Which is the ideal thing for dealing with initial impact on big mobs.  I see this as being very powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a 1500pt heal, and a dot.  Basically, it's for if you are about to die, but you'll be able to be healed the damage of the dot.  So if a ch is late in a group or whatever.<br />
<br />
It's kinda like mend, though not anywhere near as good, due to the amount healed (1500 instead of 25%), and the dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mend is quite overpowered at the high end so we shouldn't expect something like it.  I'm curious what kind of refresh time this ability has.<br />
<br />
Double the HP healed/loss wouldn't be a bad idea either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabon Ssteel</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somone at the Soe headquarter must have a certain reason to always exclude the Meeles from the good stuff ... the only good thing for a War with the God aas is 500hps and more procs for weapons i guess .(just like always the wep proc is not Meele only Pallys Sks and so on get it too thoose with the 250hp procs per Spell) WTF? thats the time you scratch your head n ask hmm who got more use out of it .<br />
Warlord Tenacity is 1500hps with a reuse of like 1 hour and something minutes and it decreases thoose for 900 over 36 sec 150 a tick ... i saw 3 lvls one is 500 and 300 away  second 1000 600 and the third like said. so how many aas to invest for a basically useless skill ?<br />
<br />
(i really hope for Endurance Regen items / more Endurance skills suach as a  20% meele damage increaser for the Group with like a 1 min duration and a not too hefty endurance cost .Warriors should be the kings at leading others attacks making them stronger WE NEED SOME UTILITY FOR GROUPS) <br />
<br />
What can we do Without a good group ?<br />
What can a Paladin <br />
What can a Shadowknight<br />
What can a Ranger<br />
and so on <br />
<br />
why do other classes get more skills spells Gear why can they do much more then pure meeles ... take the Gear theres not really a outstanding war only item yet with like 200ac and 300hps BP or so (but there 1 million different pal shd weps and alot pal shd War excluded super items who have ft and better ac n hps then warrior usable items)...we share basicly the same gear with everyone at higher lvls  and have no other advantages like group buffs ...( ok 4 disc timers now) ..wow but thoose dont change alot (not like ft15 for a pally does or beastlord or insert mana user here )<br />
we dont get a 70 % haste who stacks with a 50 % haste who then stacks with a 40 % haste and with a 60 % haste song and 100% haste gear ...<br />
we get a 100% top add vengeance 30 and all attack buffs in game then its 150-90 % and some of thoose buffs are short --- not 320% like casters n Hybrids . C5 Pot9 beastlord crack mana song Forever<br />
If i just see beastlords nuke for 1350 UPWARDS (crit)  3.2 sec cast damage (250 mana) and with FT15 they do that all the time ..slow pet and tank slowed mobs Ferocity for supberb attack i COULD CRY wtf how unbalanced eq is.Wheres the warrior Ferocity he can cast on himself or Paragon AA .<br />
<br />
Theres just a big difference in Power and it doesnt get better. NO IT GETS WORSE the already stong CLASSES grow even stronger and the already weak classes get CRAP or if something good it gonna be something a PAL / SHD has too  .We cant attack big mobs with 1handers anymore or we get so many ripostes and die but ..yet they add another 1hslash offhand disc and wont ever fix the riposte rate to make dual wield a valid option again ... its just DUMB.If you can choose to get ripostes 8 times for 900 per fight or 2 times with a dual wielder what wep do you equip.<br />
<br />
All i can is shake my Head and ask will it ever get better ? i do hope.</div></div><hr />

But I dont see the point of a heal in the warrior arsenal when so many classes can patch heal or LH. It's not useless, but it is also not very attractive. <br />
<br />
and Kabon... please... Our AAs and abilities are not that bad, our class is great for our role, and beastlord nukes and how they dare to crit in front of you have nothing to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any &quot;save my own ass&quot; button is worthwhile, and since I am usually healing myself with my bot cleric in exp groups, I can envision myself using this often.  1500 hps is fairly trivial in exp groups with 700 hitters, and pretty much useless on raids, but usually in BoT, even when I'm tanking a kriger + an add as long as they're slowed, I can usually land an SR (1740 hps with improved healing IV) and get enough time to get CH off, so I'm sure if the CH is already casting but late, 1500 hps will be more than enough to let the CH land in exp groups.  The dot doesn't matter, it's just to keep you from using it to solo.<br />
<br />
Lucy shows Warlord's Tenacity III as having zero recast, but I assume it doesn't stack with itself, so you couldn't use it again until the dot finishes (1.1 min).  I wonder if it gives a buff icon.  Would be interesting if the dot could be dispelled or radiant cured hehe.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, would it have been overpowering to give us a 1500 hp heal without the detrimental side effect and a 5-10 min recast?  I don't think so considering how much more powerful mend is, but even in it's current state it's something I will buy and use.  I think the way it is now fits in better with the warrior class from a roleplay standpoint.  I'm not magically healing myself without mana, but just summoning a last little bit of energy to keep me alive for a few seconds, but if the heal doesn't come, the energy I spent to do it will take it's toll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the recast time is like Divine Arbitration(3 mins) then imo it would be a decent skill for smoothing out damage spikes in LDON exp groups and the like(on large pulls).<br />
<br />
If its one of those 30min+ recast skills, then it will be far down on my wanted AA list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think people should go read some of the other class message boards and what they are saying about their AAs..   My overall impression is that there is a general sense of disappointment in this area.<br />
<br />
Nothing i see posted on our upgrades (which of course could end up far off from the release AAs) gives me have much desire to rack up any AA points for this.</div></div><hr />

Nothing innovative, but all helpfull and something I'd want. Instrument and Singing mastery upgrades, recuded missed notes, increased tracking ability, level 65 stun cap for our instant cast 18sec reuse stun are all highly usefull abilities, higher mod cap etc.<br />
<br />
All are usefull things that will make a noticeable differance and increase the overall abilities of said bard. <br />
<br />
All warriors really have going for them is 500hp and increased proc rate, and maybe a semi usefull AA if it isnt an hour refresh (WT). Why cant warriors get some kind of utlity and fun AA for once? Christ, even a 10aa warhorsie would be acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 hour refresh is fucking useless.  All this ability does is restack hps giving you 1500 now and gradually taking them away.  Guess what..if you use this to save your ass while tanking in ldon and there is no healer you are still fucked.  100% fucking useless ability..thats why warriors get it.  In fact the only useful aa in god are run 5, sturdiness and whatever the current name for the proc increaser is..havent logged on in a few days.  Ill be done with god aa in a week..good fucking going, at least i have wow to play.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, beastlords are another class that don't seem too unhappy about their AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabon Ssteel</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What i been trying to show is how unbalanced it is ...<br />
<br />
Beastlord is a good example but pal od sk works too ...look at thoose aas ... they now basicly get our damage discs all 2mins for 30 seconds and it costs them 600 mana ??? 600 mana is regened in like 1min with the buffs out  today or Clerics gonna meele like kings soon .. all 60 secs for 30 secs 350mana ...WTF ? <br />
<br />
and we in return get a 1500hp buff who decreases over 36sec to 600hps and then poofs ? Reuse 1hour 36 mins . WHEREs OUR 2MIN REUSE ? make it cost endurance maybe like 30 % ..reuse 2mins ..add endurance regen items ... THAT  would be BALANCE .<br />
<br />
if you take that Beastlord Beastlia alligment 3 ...we would need a disc whos reusable all 2mins cost like 10% endurance and while active we do 50% more damage (cut this down because beastlord arent haveing as high dual wield as war) .THATS BALANCE ...<br />
<br />
but hey if we would get such a AA we get 24 Years reuse and a disc who last 2 seconds and adds 0.1% dam output . OMG ..who the hell balances eq ?.when i look at stuff like this it seems SoE undersetimates the Mana regen rate ... they think ok give them all the uber stuff make it cost alot mana then its balanced ...but IT isnt .Mana is a pool to drag special moves and atacks from like wars endurance pool is ... just they have much more variety and better discs ...in therms of spells .IF a Beastlord would be a warrior ...his Ferocity would cost 2k mana .(thats a low guess) in translation of power the buff gives. <br />
<br />
And thats how balanced eq is .<br />
<br />
The day a Warrior can do  things comparable to what a Mana class can do is the day im satisfied with balance .</div></div><hr />

 Other than that, lower the recast to 20 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to add a word too. This is not a specifically answer to anyone, however it came to me, when I was reading this among other threads in the same style.<br />
<br />
I'll start with a little story I heard in a documentary program in the television.<br />
<br />
About a royal chauffeur. <br />
His job was to drive royal people around. It was his only job and only duty. He was very pride of his job. He was there always on time. Never delayed, never any problems or bad excuses.<br />
<br />
The royal chauffeur had an apparently easy and simple job, which again allowed him to put all his energy into it, so he could be the best at what exactly he did.<br />
<br />
I am not saying this is a perfect example, but I see a lot of similarities between the job of a warrior and this chauffeur.<br />
<br />
We have few duties.<br />
We have a very important purpose in a raid.<br />
We have to be alert and ready always, so we can do our job exactly when it is required.<br />
We have a very small tolerance for errors.<br />
<br />
We want to be best at what we are doing!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Utility is good and might make exp groups more interesting, but always remember what is our main job.</div></div><hr />

It's a 1500pt heal, and a dot. <br />
<br />
My post from earlier in this thread.<br />
<br />
Virtue does say Increase hps by 1405 also, but notice how when you get virtue your health goes up with it also?  As compared to a shielding buff, where it only increases max hps, your hps don't go up with it.  Basically, most hp buffs also have a heal component to cover for the hps added.<br />
<br />
So this is just a heal with a dot.  If it has a short reuse on it, it could actually be useful.</div></div><hr />

The down side is if it takes a buffslot. <br />
Like many others i have to fight with trying to keep the slots down. Often have to click off less needed buffs to leave an open slot for somthing else.<br />

SoE think about it .. it wouldn even count as heal ...that way and you wouldn have to balance it with a dot .make it like a bard song just put it in shortbuff windows make it have a duration of like 5mins with a 10min reuse .(or insert every nerfing 20 hours reuse time to make it almost of no use again)<br />
<br />
Solution... just dont take this aa if it dots us after heal it just increaeses the dps of the mob hitting us say the cleric got troubles keeping war alive because he takes too much dps from mobs ...why should i use this and make it even worse.Other situations are a rarity rather use riposte disc to block all meele damage 12 secs ...but make an aa who adds like 2k ae hate that combioned with ae taunt  could be great .. well riposte disc works too but its just up all 40 secs . <br />
<br />
im very unhappy with about each aa we get beside the few good ones all classes get .This one i wont take unless the recast is 0 secs and i can constantly click it to gain 1500hps.while the dot gets overwritten *gg* <br />
<br />
otherwise i gonna have to ask me WHO THE HELL gets the idea for such useless crap aas ? there must be a team for the good loot and a team for the bad loot like there must be a team for the good aas and the bad aas ... the warrior just had no luck and the team for the bad aa idea works on his aas :) this team actually has never played EQ and has no idea about playing a Warrior.Thats the point where i gonna have to say kick them and get another good aa team who has played a high end warrior for at least 1 year let them make war aas .</div></div><hr />

we dont get a 70 % haste who stacks with a 50 % haste who then stacks with a 40 % haste and with a 60 % haste song and 100% haste gear ...<br />
we get a 100% top add vengeance 30 and all attack buffs in game then its 150-90 % and some of thoose buffs are short --- not 320% like casters n Hybrids . <br />
<br />
All i can is shake my Head and ask will it ever get better ? i do hope.  <br />
<br />
What the fuck are you talking about?<br />
<br />
Hybrids and casters DO NOT GET 320% haste.<br />
<br />
They get the EXACT SAME HASTE THAT YOU CAN GET.<br />
<br />
Every class in the game caps at 100% haste, worn+spell.  Add in up to 30% bard overhaste, and you can get to 130% haste...PERIOD.<br />
<br />
All but 2 items in the game are 41% haste or less, and the 45% and 46% haste items that drop in PoTime are BOTH warrior usable.<br />
<br />
There is NO class running around with more than 46% worn haste, PERIOD.<br />
<br />
Its bad enough that you come here, whining and bitching about how 'bad' warriors have it, but you also spew more misinformation in ignorance than I have seen in a long long time.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing from his post he's referring to mana regeneration buffs, which are to casters as haste is to melees.  Take a pill and relax.</div></div><hr />

There is a reason haste is capped and stack as it do, and there is another reason why mana regen flow and add like that. and :<br />

you really think it would be balanced ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway with this AA... I'll wait 2 days and see how it is before posting my final opinion. So far on lucy its not that impressive, but who know ? maybe there's no reuse time except the dot (after all, you cant overwrite it). lets wait the live version.</div></div><hr />
