<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the first time in a while last nigh in BoT i was not the MT so i figure id have some fun doing some DPS parses and swopping round some weapon combinations.<br />
<br />
For background info, all my melee skills are maxed, we had a bard in the group, parses were done via YALP and all melee was from the rear. My stats stayed about the same throughout (although there may have been a couple of dropped songs). I do not have any offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
The weapons i tried were<br />
<br />
Flaming Dirk 11(+3 Fire dmg)/ 20<br />
Copper Hammer 13/20 <br />
Sword of Bloodsworn 12/19<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder 31/30<br />
<br />
For all test runs Id have a minimum of 5 giants and Id clear the logs before each run.<br />
<br />
Anyway the results took me a little by surprise.<br />
<br />
With the Hammer in primary and the dirk in secondary, i was getting in the region of 76-79 DPS. <br />
<br />
Then i swopped out to the GSoT and was shocked to see it parsing at only about 70-73 DPS. I was surprised to see this as i was always under the impression that a 2hander with a ratio of 1 or less would outdamage most 1 hander combos. Anyway just to be sure there wasnt a mistake i reparsed these fights a few times and the 1hander combo came out consistently higher.<br />
<br />
Even swopping to the hammer/bloodsworn combo, i was still getting a dps of 69-72 which was not off the GSoT figures.<br />
<br />
Finally i also parsed the flaming dirk in primary and hammer in secondary and that returned a figure of around 78-79 as well.<br />
<br />
I always proceeded on the basis of 2 hander proc for exp group and for added dps and the 1 handers for aggro situations but on these resuslts, i may reconsider that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">without 2 hander AAs, flurry ect, good one handers will outdamage good 2 handers.<br />
<br />
I never use 2 handers just for this reason, ive parsed higher with my 1 handers than i have with all droppable 2 handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonehead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With a Bard in my group I avg 102DPS using GSoT.  I have PB3 Ferocity and FLurry.  With Dual weilding I avg 75 to 90 DPS.  My 2h is out parsing my dual wiel.<br />

Here is a pars Screen of over an hour using GSoT:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">could it be in your case though that your better dps is due to those AA's? which may benefit 2handers more, at least PB3 certainly would.<br />
<br />
plus the 14/24 isnt great dps wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">when ppl say good two handers, normally they are referring to tsbs or windblade when they are talking about dps. 31/30 compared to a 53/45 isnt that great for dps. most ppl like the gsot for proc and riposte dmg im sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont think your parses have enough data points to see the clear picture DPS from 2hander should look much much more streaky then what you show. Even 1handers should have 10-15 dps siparity at your lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In BoT with a shammy and bard, I was doing 98-107 dps with the Go4W off Auliffe, from the front, no offensive AAs, much to the chagrin of the epic dual wielding 63 ranger who was attacking from behind and doing about 70-75% of my dps.  <br />
<br />
GoT is a great aggro weapon but the dps is so-so.  The 41/31 off Auliffe or something like a TSBS or Windblade will do much better for you for dps, especially once you start cranking up offensive AAs.  I have both the GoT and Go4W and I use the Go4W for most non-raid MT and non-defensive situations, then drop the GoT in for the proc aggro when needed.<br />
<br />
Until you get a higher ratio 2h, you should probably use a dw combo for dps and probably tanking too since your hammer/sword is a nice aggro set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The other night in HoH, I was religated to back up DPS, so I took the time play with my damage set ups.  I found that my Braided Strands Main/ CHSD off hand, did crazy ass damage, 95 DPS + on average.  The GSoT did about 85ish DPS.  I only have PB1.  2h DPS will really come to shine when you have PB3, add in ferocity and flurry, and you can get really nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In relative terms if Windblade is 1.0 dps.<br />
<br />
TSBS/Norge`Tal = 1.02<br />
GSoT = 0.97<br />
WMBS = 1.01<br />
GSo4W = 1.15<br />
<br />
Or thereabouts. Might be a point off on one of the damage bonuses I calculated since i don't have all those weapons bagged anymore.<br />
<br />
All of them are very close in dps, til you can get Chaoswind's staff which is vastly superior.<br />
<br />
When you talk about you average dps you need to know where you are of course. CT mobs have low to average AC, Luclin mobs are high. BoT mobs are higher than HoH mobs, but both are middling to low. Also do you include your damage shield in your calcs? With a good bard going crazy I can get 100dps from a damage shield on an unslowed mob (parsed 250dps over an hour on Ssra junk). Slowed mob with just a druid DS is about 10dps.<br />
<br />
BoT tanking with bard overhaste I do about 110-120dps. From the back 120-130. But even there it varies. Krigers mitigate about 20% better than Tyv's for example.<br />
HoH that goes up about 5%.<br />
Luclin it's hard to say, most mobs are much lower level and the high end mobs have massive mitigation (e.g. Ssra names).<br />
CT it would go up a lot cuz the mobs are so much lower level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is an avg over 55 minutes of exp grinding in a BoT group.  Looks like theres enough fights to clearly point my avg DPS was 102.  SOme fights went as high as 122 others 95 but the avg which that parse is showing for the entire 55 minutes My avg was 102.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">IF parsing GSoT with EQCompanion, make sure you update to v.79, and then goto the Triggers-NonMeleeDmg and alter the Proc:Yak to do ZERO dmg. <br />
<br />
In your parses you have &quot;Proc:Yak 8.86 DPS... GSoT uses the same message as a Ykesha weapon, but Ykesha does 75dd. GSoT does no dmg, but SOE wasn't smart enough to alter the proc message. Over the course of your battles you have 523 dmg done by Ykesha, but it is false data due to the GSoT not doing dmg when it procs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With no offensive AA's, using Splitblade (14/19) main and CHSD (13/19) offhand, I was surprised to find out that I average 100 DPS in BoT with enchanter haste (no bard overhaste).<br />
<br />
Needless to say, after that I banked my primal 2-hander that I had thought of as my DPS weapon, and I have no plans to use a 2-hander again until I get say Gaudralek or better.<br />
<br />
I have decided to put off buying ambi or PB until I get a decent quality 2-hander and can judge the relative DPS properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cervesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Be careful when comparing weapons strictly on the ratio.  While a windblade will outdamage a GSoT is is very marginal and a 29/28 weapon WILL outdamage the windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">got any parses to back this shit up? I highly doubt 29/28 will outdamage windblade unless you comparing like 1 fight. I bet my 100 dolla on Windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dunno.  Using 1hs to tank in BoT i get Riposted like crazy.  If i can hold aggro just as good using a 2h weapon as using a couple of 1h weapons, and getting smacked silly by ripostes, why not stick with the 2h? <br />
<br />
Even if you're doing 70-80% less dps with the 2h instead of the 1h.  Tanking, taking all the damage while other people do not, is your job.   As long as you can hold aggro let other classes do the dps.  And using 2h weapon (as to duel wielding 1h weapons) = less riposte = less dmg taken by me = less heals on me = cleric more mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A 2-hander will have the same proportion of damage mitigated by ripostes as dual wield, so in the context of this DPS discussion, ripostes by the mob are irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">With no offensive AA's, using Splitblade (14/19) main and CHSD (13/19) offhand, I was surprised to find out that I average 100 DPS in BoT with enchanter haste (no bard overhaste). <br />
<br />
I find this dps number pretty suspect for having no offensive aas trained.  Were you tanking during this parse?  I suspect so since you were using CHSD.  I use BoC 15/20 and GBoS 14/18 tanking in BoT a lot, and I never get close to 100 dps unless I have massive attack buffs and bard overhaste.  I'd say that my normal dps with BoC and GBoS tanking in BoT is around 75 dps without attack buffs and with enchanter haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i average 90+ with my BoC/Blackout on PoP mobs, thats with full attack buffs minus bard(around 1650 attack).  So yeah, unless you have DPS AAs trained 100 with Splitblade/CHSD is kinda hard to believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used a Windblade for a couple of months, then a Norge`Tal for a couple more, then a WMBS and a GSoT for a couple more, and now I've had my GSo4W for a couple. I've parsed all of them in 5000+ fights each (I play 12-16 hours a day since I've been unemployed). <br />
<br />
I dunno who said that GSoT&gt;Windblade for dps. Windblade is better but its only 3% difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My experience matches up to what I've heard.<br />
<br />
Windblade &gt; GSoT for DPS.  <br />
<br />
WMBS &gt; Windblade for DPS, but not by a lot.  <br />
<br />
When tanking, I use the GSoT.  When in a secondary role, I use either the windblade or the WMBS, depending on what's in the bag.  <br />
<br />
I haven't gotten the copper hammer or the sword of the bloodsworn yet, but I plan to at some point.  Stuns from two faster weapons should, I would think, outaggro stuns from one bigger, slower weapon.  <br />
<br />
I think Sassinak's riposte point is wrong.  I always thought ripostes were based off the mob's potential damage, not off the damage of the person being riposted.  So, if you are riposted by a mob that can hit for 1200, you can get riposted for 1200, even if your max hit is far less than that.  If I am right about that, then you'll eat a lot more riposte damage with two one-handers than you would with a 2HB or 2HS.  Does anyone have any logs that make it clear, one way or the other?  If I'm right about how riposte works, then it's a trade-off .. better aggro from the copper hammer/sword of the bloodsworn combo, but less damage taken when using the GSoT.  <br />
<br />
Separate question: does anyone have a chart showing the rate that different mobs riposte at?  It's my non-parsed impression that different mobs riposte at different rates, but maybe I am imagining that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Risposte is off the mobs damage not yours.  Early in pos on mini boss's I would take about 5k rispsote damage with epic two hander, 10k with epic 1h anders and 15k with 18 delay 1 handers.<br />

ps for some reason I picked up a few 1500 hp risposte on a 980hp max hit mob.</div></div><hr />
