I was playing on champion until I found out the buddy of mine that got me into EQ was still playing coh and were running the dark breed SG on Pinnacle. So I started anew.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am kickin' it on Pinnacle. I started my new tank yesterday afetr work. Currently Level 10 mutation-tanker ss/invul (oh so very popular) Level 10. Named Omnus of course.<br />
<br />
1&gt; Jab / Resist Damage<br />
2&gt; dull pain<br />
3&gt; RD + 2<br />
4&gt; Taunt<br />
5&gt; RD + 2<br />
6&gt; Flurry<br />
7&gt; Flurry + 2<br />
8&gt; US<br />
9&gt; Flurry + 2<br />
10&gt; Resist Elements<br />
<br />
I am really liking this build. Been soloing in King's Row and it is very effective. I wanted RE for when I move to Steel Canyon because of the outcasts. Going to finish flurry and resist damage when I ding 11. I was really torn between flurry or boxing, but I figured if it was going to be my staple attack it needed to look cool.<br />
<br />
If anyone on Pinnacle wants to hit up some missions or just exp, let me know. Sometimes my GF is palying too, and if that is the case she is a 10 defender emp/dark.<br />
<br />
I am thinking about trying to have hasten and dull pain perma by 20, mixed with hurdle/health/stamina. But I am really considering grabing teleport foe and teleport self while slotting US. I think I am going to US route and not perma-unstop.<br />
<br />
Send me a tell if you want group/bullshit/mission etc.</div></div><hr />
