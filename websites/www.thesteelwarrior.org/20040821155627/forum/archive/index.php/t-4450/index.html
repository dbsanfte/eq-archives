<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, warriors have been crying alot about how paladins have recently been able to successfully tank high-end boss mobs. Well, I think we should look more into this:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What's your point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dito's never needed one as far as i can tell. <br />
<br />
and Dito - the subjects been covered ad nauseum why dig it up all over again?<br />
<br />
*Edit* Oh, i 'think' it's a jab about the monk tanking Terris etc.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My point is if a leather-wearing person can tank a time god, then soon, I wouldn't be surprise if a rogue can tank Quam !!!<br />
<br />
Get the point?!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No.<br />
<br />
The fact that monks can tank in Time has no bearing on whether or not I'm happy about paladins tanking in time.  All it does is show how bad the problem really is.  (And hopefully get monks to stop whining quite so much about the mitigation nerf).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi~<br />
<br />
<br />
The game is fucked now thanks to BoV. Anyone with enough HP to last 1 round can tank nowadays. Plus, that monk is the most tweeked monk in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All too clearly, why should Paladins etc have dominance in exping when we're not even garanteed to tank the raid mobs? :) <br />
<br />
This has been covered  - go away and find a truely telling point.<br />
<br />
Second thoughts, just go away :p<br />
<br />
*Edit* oh and Ninj, Monk didn't even use BoV.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Marglok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont see the point to this thread..<br />
<br />
or the one you posted in which you advertised this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Apparently the rather large orc in the link scared him and he thought that if he linked it, the orc would make people scared and forget about paladins tanking in PoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cunning strategy :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That orc is grotesquely large, possibly even a mutant of some sort.<br />
<br />
So yeah, definitely a cunning strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What's your point? <br />
<br />
 Dito's point? Top of his head. (Yes, it's true - his mother DID buy him a pencil sharpener to keep him warm in winter.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cunning strategy<br />
<br />
... cunning plan? Baldrick? Is that you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here is the thing.  We dont give 2 shits if a monk tanks a time boss, because there is no reason for a monk to tank it.  They did it cause they were bored and felt like trying.  But now, pallies are preferred tanks over warriors, as opposed to monks, who will never ever be preffered tanks for anything in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This made me cry irl.<br />
Damn you paladins! damn you and your mutant orc offspring!</div></div><hr />

Vague posts are the win!  I was there and I don't even get your point...  What was it again?  Wait maybe your point was that knights mitigate the same or better than a non-defensive warrior?  Was that it?  nm, I just remembered that was my point not yours.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

all said.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Ever heard of brain farting?, its how I feel after reading this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Macbrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That monk is a poor example of how to balance anything. He has 7900 hps and 1900 ac.  That is unbuffed.  How, many of the warriors here can state that?  <br />
<br />
I don't want the system balanced for end game characters. I would like it balanced for all characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Few expansions ago a warrior topping 1400 ac and 7khp was only possible at the very top tier. As time goes on the current top tier will become that much closer to the 'norm' therefore issues there do bear consideration when considering class balance and how it evolves. <br />
<br />
Something to consider perhaps.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/sign &quot;thick-head&quot; warriors<br />
<br />
No wonder many groups don't want to take in a warrior. They rather take in a mage or a necro since their pets are MORE EXPENDABLE than a warrior!!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ah, the time honoured 'no real response so insult 'em' tactic. Your strategic genius overawes me, Dito. :p Seriously, can we let this thread die already? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">was that even an insult?  Just looks like poorly worded gibberish with horrendous grammar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Dito, you fucking asshole, I want my 20 IQ back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Aye, give Thaak his IQ back. He's an ogre and really doesn't have that much to spare. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm down to 20 int!</div></div><hr />

Jeez, you lucky bastard ! :p</div></div><hr />
