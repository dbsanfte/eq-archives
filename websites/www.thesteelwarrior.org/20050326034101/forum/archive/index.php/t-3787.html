<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lakashu</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tis my 1st post here, though I have gained a lot of knowledge from reading these boards.  Thanks very much to those that administer them, and to my fellow warriors who so graciously share their knowledge.<br />
<br />
I have 2 questions actually<br />
<br />
1st is I need to obtain funds to gear up better.  When I first started my warrior I used my wizards funds to equip her.  That equipment served her very well until she reached 51 when she suddenbly began to be a bleeder and now sucks up healers mana.  I was able to obtain my current BP and a Lodizal shield pretty cheap and those should serve me well for sometime to come I hope.  However Im now broke and needing to upgrade almost everything else.  What would be some good zones I could solo that drop coin or loot.  (Soloing without downtime so mobs that I can dispatch with only 50% of my hps buffed with virtue about 4300 now)<br />
<br />
2nd a friend that is a 65 shammy has offered to PL me when we are both on together (though our schedules dont coincide that often).  What would be some good zones I could make exp at with him there to slow my mobs, keep be buffed,healed and hasted (drops would be nice as well but exp is more important here)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your responses<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot to mention I am no longer guilded with this character, and my wizard needs what funds he can raise to get his higher level spells.</div></div><hr />

Would it even be possible for that combo to be successful and would they get any exp out of it.</div></div><hr />

All mobs but the entrance mobs are dark blue at 65.  The ZEM is 100 (PoP is 118 and DL is 75).  Yes you can get 'good' exp in Veksar.  You can also get around the whole place using pacify and or invis / invis to undead.  Mobs dont hit so hard that you need them to be slowed.  Loot is pretty good, even before the 'highborn' area.  <br />
<br />
Frab someone to show you the layout if you dont know the camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only can you get some decent cash and xps in Veksar, but there are some phenomenal drops for a warrior on a budget.  There's alot of better stuff out there, but the stuff in Veksar is relatively easy to get and damned nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed.  Veksar is the way to go.  No runners there either.  (although I havent been to every camp yet, so I could be wrong)<br />
<br />
I got my haste belt there along with a nice helm.  If you go deeper in the mobs drop nice plat.  Think up to 17pp or so each if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
And depending if you want loot to sell then try Nurga.  Droga is better, but Nurga is way easier and pretty much never camped.  There are a few nice caster drops in there that will get you some decent money from the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
