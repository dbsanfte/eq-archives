<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is currently working towards killing Rallos Zek the Warlord, I was wondering if anyone knew were i could find a fairly thorough description/ strategy for the encounter.<br />
<br />
Incase any of you have some tips for me straight out i'll include a list of areas I felt we need improvement on.<br />
<br />
After our first attempt, and failure, this is what i saw.<br />
<br />
1) Dealing with Fake RZ adds. It seemed like our kiting crew took a beating from the adds, which lead to the death of some clerics and others.<br />
<br />
3) Approaching the pit. What's the best way to get to the pit without pissing off a lot of mobs, including RZ, in the process? Today someone aggroed RZ and he started to run around killing and banishing people.<br />
<br />
4) Controlling RZtW adds. Some say mes/OT , others kite. Which is best? We never got to this part because we took too long to summon/ rebuff. Yay for incompetence!<br />
<br />
<br />
As a side note, I'd like to ask:<br />
<br />
How generous has RZtW been with BoW's to your guild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting down the pit we used to turn left above the pit, kill the 3 or 4 mobs there, then we floated down the opposite side to RZ well outside his aggro radius...<br />
<br />
As for the adds...before the fight we used to get enchanters and druids to charm boars/diakus and send them in, RZ is all about fast DPS, get him down asap before adds...the charmed creatures helped this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fake RZ adds, keep some folks to deal with possible ones with healers ie chanters extra wars, have monks or SK with a gate potion start the fight by training everything as far down west as possible then given the ok once RZ depops gate, everyone else accept TL<br />
<br />
The spot we always drop is the left front corner right at torch, make sure people know not to run out into pit but drop down or run into corner<br />
<br />
RZ himself the previous poster said it best all out dps, drop him fast or he will drop you with a army of mobs, kiters tend to be good if you have good kiters, remember though they run faster than SoE......<br />
<br />
in regards to BoWs 1 in 5 or 6 kills :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On fake RZ we just mez the adds and have a mass TL ready when he despawns ( everyone should be bound right outside tactics). On real RZ charm as many boars and diaku (Scouts preferred) as you can and go all out DPS. Don't run into the pit, drop down from the left side and float towards the wall or corner.<br />
<br />
We got a BoW on our first kill and none in our next 4 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On our last attempt we killed fake TZ fine.<br />
Then we had trouble pulling fake VZ.  We used to send in a DA'd toon to pull all the mobs to the far end of VZ's room and this would cause VZ to warp back to his spawn point due to his tether.<br />
We tried it this time and he just camped at the far end of the room and all the other mobs wandered back.  I think next time we are going to use a BDA'd monk to pull all the mobs to the near side, then hope he stays there, watch the adds wander back to spawn and then kill fake VZ.<br />
<br />
What is current strat on fake VZ?  This part seems to have changed in the last few months.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
we kite the adds and charm as many diaku warriors(best dps) as possible, scouts arent bad alternative since they will backstab. knights and shaman dps is considerably less. give em some weapons, snare, haste, and watch rz die.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't aggroing RZ early cause more adds since the adds are timed rather than dependant on his health % ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RZTW has about 1.4 million hit points.  You have an effective time limit to produce this damage.  Wave 5 is the point of certain failure (6 minutes).  You should not count on anything going right after wave 3 (4 minutes).<br />
<br />
Your raid needs to sustain 5000 DPS to win by wave 5.  For a high chance of winning (i.e. by wave 3), you should aim for 8000 DPS sustained.<br />
<br />
The average player who is contributing DPS is probably doing 100 DPS at this stage of guild advancement.  Assume that 10 people are devoted to keeping the tank alive and do no DPS.  Also assume that kiters and charm-masters contribute no DPS (they probably do contribute a little, but it averages out).<br />
<br />
Take your amount of DPS contributers, multiply by 100 DPS, and subtract 20% to account for attrition.  That gives you a DPS figure for your players.  Now you can figure out how many charmed pets you need to bring the total up to 7000-8000 DPS.<br />
<br />
Charmed pets will do about 500 DPS each on RZTW, when you factor in DPS lost to charm breaks.  Necro-charmed wraiths bring down the average DPS a little.<br />
<br />
Note that each charmed pet is almost equal to 1 extra group of players in terms of DPS.  I encourage you to have everyone charm who can do so: druids, necros, enchanters.  Every pet should have snare (to facilitate charm breaks), haste, pumpkinhead, mage weapon, mage haste item.  Your raid members should be able to arrange this without micromanagement, once you reach the pit and start pulling pet mobs from Glykus area.  The masters' ONLY job is to stay alive and control their pet.  If they die, their pet will tear up the clerics.  They should not cast on RZTW, and should stay at long range from their pet, and manage their own charm breaks.<br />
<br />
Charmed mobs go a very long way if you have a smaller force.  50 people with 10 charmed pets will probably beat RZTW on their first try.  (25 DPSers + 10 pets - 20% attrition = 6000 DPS = win in 4 minutes.)  The difficulty of this encounter is not the healing, the difficulty is in generating enough DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
timer doesnt start till hes been dmged, not sure what percentage, but u can move him without starting the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have always kited the adds. Also, charm pets rock, but make sure you get them fast. Have someone pulling them a couple at a time, tash them, snare them, charm them, haste 'em, and get ready to roll. You do have a time limit before RZ despawns so don't waste time. Everything else has pretty much been said, just keep a tank up, it can get messy if your tank dies. Also, have everyone melee at absolute max melee range to avoid AE rampage, and get your FR up high as possible. His AE isn't hard to resist, but if you have people who don't resist it things get ugly since druids are all charming and clerics are all on the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">charm pets- give them MAGE ITEMS. we always charmed but never gave em masks/weapons, masks + weapons cut our killtime down about 50 secs.<br />
<br />
wave5 no longer happens , he only spawns to wave4. Wave4 WILL kill you though. Even if you use selos kiters, wave4 will be what kills you.<br />
<br />
Use knights to kite. They're crappy DPS , so they might as well put all that hp/ac to use and kite.</div></div><hr />
