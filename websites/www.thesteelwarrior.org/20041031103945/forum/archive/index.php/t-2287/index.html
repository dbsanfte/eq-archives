<br />
&quot;08-22 10:10 Changed Resistadj from 0 to -100&quot;<br />
&quot;07-24 20:09 Changed Slot 3 from &quot;Increase STR by 1&quot; to &quot;Stun(0.00 sec)&quot; <br />
<br />
0.0 sec stun, -100 resist adjust...<br />
<br />
PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THIS GO LIVE!<br />
<br />
haven't clicked my Orb of the Sky since we left VT months ago... now this change will make it as good as Aten gloves, except that Call of Sky is MAGIC based instead of fire. Which makes it even better.<br />
<br />
Any warriors on Test have the Orb and can confirm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not on test but recently got this one myself, can only say that it does interrupt and very rarely gets resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">as the effect is now on live servers. it does not have a 0.0 sec stun, it only has the DD component and a Push Back 1 component. push back is no aggro at all, but the 0.0 sec stun is. the push back is why you saw mobs getting interrupted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe, it does seem to help me with agro though, but I won't say no to an upgrade.<br />
<br />
The effect on Gaudralek is DD + knockback and that one is decent agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shhh don't tell everyone :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Still 10 second cast with 10 minute duration? <br />
<br />
If so I don't even know if that would cause me to use it again, I am not even sure I still have it, may have destroyed to make room for more junk, damn tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looks like it went live :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kind of an off topic question, but do Call of Fire and Call of Sky stack or does one overwrite the other?<br />
<br />
From what I understand about proc buffs, the first one on the list is only one that goes off even if they do stack.. <br />
<br />
Probably a question for the ranger/pali/sk boards actually..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Donno about Call of Fire and Call of Sky but I did get both Call of Sky and Night's Dark Terror, the Scarecrow/lifetap thingie, on me. The one closest to the top buff spot was the one going off, the other wouldn't. Oddly enough Call of Sky wouldn't stack with Tricksters Augmentation.<br />
Curious how this change to Call of Sky will affect agro. I stopped using it with my BoC cause it seemed to lower the procrate of enraging blow but would be nice if it would give me more agro when using my Ornate Greatblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I should try stacking it on my BBB or Crowfooted Gaylance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just tried it, as expected the stun component won't land on 55+ mobs, damage still lands though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Who cares if it don't stun. It still aggros like it did!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, did a few hours of raid and exp, agro is a LOT better with my ornate greatblade, god I love this change. :)<br />
Cause, no ranger can use this spell ever again without dying, but that's just typical Sony, heh.</div></div><hr />
