Anyone got any tactics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the ice mobs sometimes cast &lt;Frost Touch&gt;, and the fire mobs cast &lt;Pyrilien Charm&gt; (only seen Riftseeker cast this...), even the trash sometimes cast it (specially ice mobs).  There are 3 ways to avoid it from easiest to hardest<br />
<br />
<br />
#1 have a bard for resist songs :P<br />
#2 have clicky buffs as your first couple slots, when you pull him click those buffs off and have classes that can dispell cast on you when you're mezzed to debuff the &lt;Frost Touch&gt;.  Good idea for everyone in group to do this. May not work first try, thus have multiple clickies and have your needed buffs you want way down the last slots.  As soon as the group sees &quot;A xxxxx guard begins to cast &lt;Frost Touch&gt;, have a dispeller cast Cancel Magic (1buff dispell) if you dont got good resists.<br />
#3 have an offtank (good idea to have one) tank it while you're getting dispelled<br />
#4 have enough resists from your gear (350CR+ to resist)<br />
...<br />
have a paladin tank them mezzers while you are mezzed via /disc Sanctification (resist *most* harmful spells for short time)<br />
... or have him watch the fight to rez the group if it wipes, not like he will speed up the kills anyway (necros are GODS here too for summon/rez).  Good thing is, the mez has a Feign Death effect so once mez wears off on your pull, you can try again (hopefully no one agros the mob to your cleric whos mez is wearing off!)<br />
Ive stood right next to a mezzer and his mez wore off and just ran away with no agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like this works just like a mob spawning... you have maybe 5 secs to get the hell away from the mob.  /shrug   Saved my ass a few times.<br />
<br />
Oh and leaving the first slot open works wonders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The DoT's aren't really the issue, I think the reference was related specifically to the AE stuns, the proc mezzes, and specifically the named charm. My biggest issue with ice before swapping rogue for bard was the ae stun, which I think had a range of 70 or so. Easy to keep support classes out of range of the stun for solutions to slowing and healing, but it can still have a devistating effect on the group if the tank gets stunned right of the bat and the cleric gets heal agro. 10 seconds is a long time when your cleric is tanking an unslowed RS mob. The mez is a lot easier to resist and isn't a big issue with high end gear, but the extra resists from bard trivialized that also without the need of an offtank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was talking about frost mez which has a -350 resist check so unless you have really high end gear and/or a bard you aren't going to resist it. He never said anything about charm or stun.<br />
<br />
The DoT part was so that the SK couldn't be mezed bcause his own dot would keep dispelling himself.<br />
<br />
Obviously the mez is not a big deal if you can resist, the whole point was how to deal with it since obviously he hasn't been able to resist it. Not everyone has the option of high end gear and a bard so I offered up some things that are available more universally (radiant cure and doting yourself to break it).<br />
<br />
The stuns should never be an issue since it's range is less than any heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most camps in ice are safest when in hallways. Range is and will be an issue.</div></div><hr />

An alt healer like a shammy or druid for cures as well. Then you just need an OT, mezzer or FD puller and you are set.<br />

You guys need to learn how to make use of your skills as a warrior. <br />
<br />
1. Instruct your group to stand near you at all times<br />
<br />
2. If you get mezzed, find out who's taking the beating<br />
<br />
3. /shield them<br />
<br />
Mez = broken, have a nice day</div></div><hr />
