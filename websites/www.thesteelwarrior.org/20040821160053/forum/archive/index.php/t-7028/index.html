I've quit EQ but I am still a member of Steel Warrior</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look at all the people that currently play CoH,  also look at the WoW portion that is there for when the game comes out.<br />
<br />
It will outlive EQ, as long as people visit the site.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know I for one am looking forward to hearing a lot of angst and outrage at perceived imbalances in other games as well as EQ.  Nothing brightens my day more than logging in and reading lots of vitriolic rage over whatever trivial crap some obsessed nerd has worked themselves into a frenzy over.  I think we have a bright future of whining and saying &quot;fucktard&quot; well after EQ has been shut off!<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Sorry, sometimes I forget that I'm not supposed to read the class balance forum.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dizastor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play EQ about once a week, mostly to hang out with my guildmates... if it weren't for them I would have uninstalled EQ six months ago.<br />
<br />
Hopefully WoW will be released before the end of the year... OR I will get into the beta, all reports so far are that it's on point to kick some major ass.</div></div><hr />
