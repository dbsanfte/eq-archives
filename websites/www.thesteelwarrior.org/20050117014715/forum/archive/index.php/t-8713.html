<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screw the new expansion, there is no way in hell I'm pre-ordering that shit.  I just looked over the dev chat posted on eqstratics.  It has been confirmed, they are nothing but a barrel of monkeys with keyboards strapped to their feet.  First, none of the questions that were &quot;filtered&quot; had any kind of relavance to anything about the expansion.  Only questions that had already been answered did they accept and answer, for the most part.<br />
<br />
I remember how bad Luclin was, it was HORRIBLE.  Planes of Power was a LITTLE BIT better, and GoD was just a disgrace to the online gaming community.  I really doubt they've made any changes to the expansion after holding off it's release.  If it was the expansion that was supposed to fully balance GoD, then why was it's release put off?  Oh, maybe because they needed to &quot;touch base&quot; with the player community, and try and make the assraping, that is GoD, seem less offensive.   <br />
<br />
GoD was SOOO fucking bad, that EQ lost many of the high end guilds.  I'm positive that GoD would have been completed by now if guilds like FoH and Afterlife were still around.  That's a bold statement to make, quitting a game after 4 years because the expansion sucked so much, of course, they were lured away with leet beta accounts for WoW &lt;(^_^&lt;)<br />
<br />
Sony did make an honest attempt with the guild Summit, but ONLY because they had to.  If they cared so fucking much about the players community, they wouldn't have shipped out shit in a box.  Only when people started canceling accounts, and ultimate complaining on forums did they even think about changing the content.  The thought of losing the $$cash$$cow$$ was too great.  You lose all of the elite players who actually accomplish shit, and then no one can beat the content, no one sees phat lewtz posted on Allakhazams, and there is no drive to play anymore.<br />
<br />
I think it'd be a great statement if people cancled their pre-orders.  One that reconfirms we didn't forget they tried to serve us shit on a shingle and smiled while taking our money, hand over fist.<br />
<br />
Oh how I YEARN for the days of Verant's Vision(tm).  We complained about alot of what they thought class balance should be, but in retrospect they really had no class balance issues, no mudflations.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Verant Interactive is coming out with a new game, it's been a couple months since I've looked into it, but supposedly it's pretty top sekret.  Anyways I'll be looking forward to checking it out.</div></div><hr />

And it doesn't really matter...people still fucking buy it, and if they don't buy it immediately, they buy it in a week because they want to be with their guilds. <br />
<br />
I don't buy expansions anymore until they're fixed, period, and I haven't since Luclin.  Most people don't have that kind of self control, and as a result, the shit will never change.  It's just like asking people to cancel their accounts because the game sucks.  You get lots of &quot;No, I just won't play for awhile.&quot;  Well, that's nice, but you're still giving SoE your money and telling them that you approve of their business model, aren't you?</div></div><hr />

Sigh I dont want to buy the next release but I really enjoy hangin with my friends; you just know with 5 more levels, assorted aas and &quot;required&quot; equipment upgrades that you cant play eq and NOT by their goddamn expansion.</div></div><hr />

As for fixing expansions:<br />
It now takes me longer to swim across the lake to Halas than when my swimming skill was 5, because I have to repeatedly bang my head against the Halas seawall to jump up there.<br />
Bang, circle.<br />
Bang, circle.<br />
repeat repeat repeat repeat.<br />
Finally, jump up there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for OoW I'll probably get it because of the level cap increase and the damn defensive aa's.  It's hard to remain competitive in my guild if I fall behind.  Has little to do with whether i approve of SoE's business model but more of I want to have fun and keeping up with the Jones' is the way i'll have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think my newest expansion is the planes of power one, and saw firsthand what it did to my frmer guilds and friends who've quit eQ.<br />
owning up to planes of power allows me to go punch orcs in the face much easier now due to all my l33t armors.<br />
but to buy any more expansions now? maybe to pad the account to go PA the thing; but besides that i'll add an expansion to EQ that Sony delivers ot me free of charge and giving me an open loot table to choose whatever the hell I want to get because for 5 years +- of gaming I deserve at least a thank you for all the time they spent bending me over the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
yeah i'm a jaded gamer. i'll get over it. but i won't buy any more of their shit in a box they keep releasing. I like my shitpile I molded together already and don't see the need to add newer fresher shit to my pile.</div></div><hr />

Some players like to assert EQ is and always has been fatally flawed. I don't see that as holding much water given it's longevity or subscription rate.<br />
<br />
Besides, I just don't have the energy to play FFXI, WoW, or EQ2 - not like I've played EQ.<br />
<br />
My bigest disappointments are probably:<br />
<br />
1. Obscure and fairly arbitrary puzzles now appeaing in the game to impede progress. (I disliked intensely this aspect of many Infocom products - $cheat or a spoiler is the only rational responce to &quot;Chinese puzzles&quot;.)<br />
<br />
2. Badly mistuned or partially broken content.<br />
<br />
3. There seldom is a resting on your laurels period no matter how much you accomplich in the high end game. The developers try to insure the carrot is always well out in front of you.<br />
<br />
None of these reservations are sufficient for me not to continue playing and paying.<br />

I 'sold' one of my cars for some chinese food; so it's a good deal to me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abazagaroth</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has always seemed absurd to me that people think by not buying expansions, yet keep paying their monthly fee, that they are &quot;making a statement&quot; or &quot;giving it to SoE where it hurts&quot;. Expansions cost 1 and a half to 2 months worth of fees to play the game. That's it.<br />
<br />
So let's see, SoE spends millions developing an expansion which they will make a relatively small amount of money on (the primary purpose is to keep as many people playing for as long as possible), which you won't buy in order that SoE won't get the $5 profit from it, yet you'll keep shelling out $13 a month or whatever it is now to play in old content (essentially making their OLD products that you already bought MORE profitable)....<br />
<br />
Yeah, that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that I want to hurt SOE, Mandrake, I just withhold from them my essence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next time I buy an expansion, I know one thing: I'm first going to offer them chinese food for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the key is that if the new content isn't making money, then the enormous amount of funds and manhours they sunk into developing it aren't getting a good return. Therefore, they just might see it as being better off spending that money on solidifying the current game rather than expanding it.<br />
<br />
  That being said, I agree with Haass. This happens virtually every expansion, and it doesn't make a single bit of difference. I personally won't be buying it because I just don't play enough to bother. And when I do, it's as likely to be old school content anyhow. If I was having fun with moving forward, I'd buy it. I'm not, so I'll just chill in the content I already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or they might see it as a reason to stop investing in development completely.<br />
<br />
I would guess that the monthly subscription is the main source of SOE's profit, and that the business case for expansions is to maintain subscription rates.  That's just a guess, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not buying a shitty expansion might make them think twice before releaseing it.  Or something =(<br />
<br />
I'm still not buying it on release, and probably not for a good while after that.</div></div><hr />

Shitty or not, I buy the expansions.  It continues the game further or adds on.  Bugs or not, they're usually not to the point where NOT buying the expansion would have been best.  Hell, I have every expansion and I have barely TOUCHED GoD.  It's a game, not a government. Well, to me anyways...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course the carrot has to be always out there, otherwise people start complaining how there's nothing to do.  I'd say more bored people end up leaving compare to dissatisfied people.  <br />
<br />
As for the content being untested, an encounter is only as good as the people testing them.  I have noticed that players, as testers, are very quick to wimp out on anything remotely difficult.  Talk all you want about wanting things to be a challenge, requiring skill, or whatever, but ultimately that means 'I want this encounter I can beat.&quot;  To use a more concrete example, I don't see any significant movement to lobby Mshas to be more difficult even though they're obviously too easy for the loot they drop.  On the other hand, anything that is remotely difficult is quickly labeled as broken.  Sometimes the stuff really is broken, but people give up too fast, so I'm not surprised devs set the bar too high and ignore the pleas for a while to see if it is really broken, or just the usual whining.  Since encounters that are too easy are bad for everyone (for devs their content gets used too fast, for players you get bored, and you'll get competition hassles if it's not instanced) where as encounters that are too hard are only bad for players, it's not really surprising encounters typically start out too hard.  In an ideal world everything would start out just right but I don't think it's even possible, especially as long as encounters are tested by players who would rather have something that's too easy as opposed to something that's too hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually no. i havent logged on in a month.<br />
<br />
and its a shame too. because eq was a very good game at one time.<br />
<br />
but in all fairness i didnt quit merely because the content was ruined. that was merely a contributing factor. the other factor was it was time to get back to real life and i never had the self control to play eq in moderation.<br />
<br />
but then again in the original concept it was a game that COULD be played in moderation. now it isnt. any person who plays eq in moderation now is doomed to mediocrity. some are ok with this true. but i looked around over the last couple years and what did i see? i saw very few casual players and very very few new players. the game catered to the fanatics. when the fanatics left in droves over the calamity called gates of discord soe decided to court feedback from the major guilds. this to me only highlighted their cluelessness that they had already lost most of the casual playerbase and that they were making no effort to find out why.<br />
<br />
i might remind everyone that a casual player pays as much per month for his subscription as the hard core player. i might also remind everyone that most hardcore eq players started this game as casuals who saw a friend play and thought &quot;hmm, maybe something to try&quot;. but the majority of would be casuals will be put off from day one as soon as they log in to pok and find the lag to be unpleasant on their two year old machines and will say &quot;what is it people like about this game anyway? the performance is terrible!&quot; and the hardcore will try to remind them that &quot;we have chain link fences now! arent they awesome? we didnt have those in the old days but they improved the graphics so much i just love to drink my beer and look at those fences while waiting two hours for my raid to assemble! just pay 1500 for a new machine and you can sit and drink beer with me while gawking over the cool graphics!&quot; and the would be new player will not be impressed.<br />
<br />
im not upgrading my machine just because sony's development team gets to develop software on the latest and greatest. and im not patching my motherboard BIOS because they tell me &quot;try it, it might help&quot;. let them have their cool graphics and be proud of it. i have life to get back to.<br />

Then you're not teaching SoE anything, are you?<br />

In fact, you're doing them a favor because you're paying for bandwidth you're not using.  You're the perfect customer, which I'm guessing is the exact opposite of what you want to be.</div></div><hr />

You still don't get it.<br />
<br />
I quit EQ for 8 months.  Canceled both of my accounts, uninstalled the game and put the CD's in the closet.<br />
<br />
When I came back, Haass and Cagna were still sitting there, ready to go.  You have nothing to lose except money that should be in your pocket right now.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you, and the other 100,000 people who think like you, and bitch about the game like you are the reason that nothing will ever change in this game.  Money talks.  Subscriptions are high, no one's canceling...we must be doing something right. <br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
You're telling them that they are.  If you're unhappy, you need to CANCEL.  If you're doing anything less than that, then you're not unhappy with the game in SoE's eyes.</div></div><hr />
