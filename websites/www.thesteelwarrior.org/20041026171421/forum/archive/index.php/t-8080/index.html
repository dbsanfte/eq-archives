<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Post your impressions here.  Did a lot of testing on it and I want to hear what people think.  I imagine it was mostly uberguilds that got in last night, but I heard Suled Dar's Shade died to a couple pickup raids as well.<br />
<br />
Also post about how you think it sucks even though you've never been there and how you hate Sony.  That will be interesting to hear  :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't go but I did see a link to a Cleric only staff that had a 1.5 casting time for a 975hp heal.. my main is a cleric and I just was .. omg.. then I noticed it's just like Donal's BP, you can only cast it once on the person till they zone.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe at least on Povar I could even get a hard LDoN going, much less something that needs 6 times that. As far as I know everyone was pound the patch day pops as hard as they cool. Triton was probably off in GoD, I know 2 guilds were backflagging as fast and hard as they could and another guild was hammering Time.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear the impressions too. Just hope getting the damned key is not too hard (as I have never started the old key as I was never consistantly killing trak).</div></div><hr />

I don't log on no more, but I kno that teh new VP is awful, the new quest is too hard and long, and only the ubers who spank all the casuals can complete it, and SoE is the debbil.<br />
<br />
Aside from which, it's enticing enough to look into that I nearly turned the account back on.  I've been very pleased with every zone revamp that came down the pipe in about the last year, and from the sounds of it this one will be another win.  And so, I'm looking forward to feedback and living vicariously thru you all. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We popped the Shade on Prexus with a sorta pickup style raid consisting of mostly my guild and then some members from 3-4 others. Tried once with 30ish and wiped, then tried again and smooshed him into dragon-paste. Once we got situated and keyed up, a few guildmates and I ventured inside but weren't able to go real far since we were short some bodies (mostly the healing kind). <br />
<br />
I've always loved Veeshan's Peak and cant wait to take a look deeper inside. My only problem with it is im not a big fan of how the zone out tosses you over to near the wizard portal instead of just outside.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I kinda like that, will make people think twice about training the zone if they have to run all the way back across skyfire every time they do it.</div></div><hr />

lol thats pretty cool i hope soe doesnt move it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hola-<br />
<br />
For us PST players, anyone happen to know the repop on the key-quest-item-dropper that the orbs spawn?  Was deaded by the time I got online/guild got together, so no new key for me...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We got 25ish people keyed for the new VP last night, so we decided to do a massacre trip in there to sea what the new dragons were like.<br />
<br />
First of all, you have a statue you can click to get out of VP right at the zone in. Zone in is safe.<br />
There is a lot more trash than there used to be there,  the trash dies pretty fast and hits for 500ish but keep in mind that even though we were only 25, we are a txevu guild, so the difficulty wasn't meant for us obviously :). First nice surprise: all the wurms ae single dispel like in ToV.<br />
<br />
After clearing some trash we decided to go pay a visit to Hoshkar, he had an AE I always resisted and didnt hit for too much, pretty easy fight even for an elemental guild I think. After that we went to Silverwing, he has some nice tricks that can make the fight pretty interesting for an elemental guild, but no too hard either.<br />
Then we tried to go to phara dar but unfortunately the door is sealed, we figured we had to kill all the dragons in the zone to get the door to open, so we went to Nexona. When going deeper into the zone the trash begins to get harder (lots of yellow or red con mob instead of the blue cons at entrance). Unfortunately it was getting late so some people had left, we were down to 19 people and 2 clerics and died to Nexona. This fight can be pretty fun too but overall given the right gear and/or raid force Nexona shouldn't be a problem either.<br />
After that we decided to leave so I haven't much more to say apart from the fact that on the way to the nameds we killed some random quest givers who dropped some items.<br />
<br />
About loot, I think that given the difficulty and the aim of the zone they are pretty well done. Obviously, most of the clikies suck but they are clickies, either they suck or they are overpowered....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just got in today - many of the more powerful guilds on the server formed up a quick raid on the shade, and my wife and I got sucked into it (we're not in any of the raiding guilds, though I have a background in it).<br />
<br />
It immediately reminded me of ToV, with the mob models, and the AE on the wurms. That's just annoying, though it is a nice tossback.<br />
<br />
Didn't see any loot, or get very far, before 4 wurms and a drake wiped our little 9-person raid. Had to stop after that.<br />
<br />
I did get quite a bit of experience, even for being in a raid. At the least, grabbing other peeps to form up a quick group, and fighting at the entrance (or a little way in) will yield quite a bit of xp.<br />
<br />
On a side note, it doesn't seem that anything could see through invis, except maybe the named dragons/drakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I killed him with a pickup raid and finished my Cipher. Really I think I wanted the augment more than the key. =p<br />
<br />
The first thing I noticed upon zoning in was that the very first mob on the bridge was a big KOS wurm that saw through my SoS. I dueled a cleric at the ZI so I could OT hammer out and helped a guildmate kill Trakanon to finish their old key and convert it into Cipher. So no new VP exploration for me... yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Led a pickup on the shade, and brought a single group with me into VP later.<br />
<br />
Consisted of WAR(me), SK, BST, SHM, CLR, WAR. Trash hit for up to 800, and each had a proc/effect like mobs in PoE. The wurms cast a AE 750DD+dispell. Fought to a couple even con minis before leaving for the night.<br />
<br />
Loot was decent for non-elemental or newly elemental people. Old VP loots were in the loot table as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Old VP loots were in the loot table as well.<br />

trash mobs drop sow sword and stuff? that owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">trash mobs drop sow sword and stuff? that owns.<br />
That confirmed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We didn't see any of the old loot (and we killed Silverwing, hoshkar, and a few other nameds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I made another short jaunt back into VP last night and didnt see any old loot either. We didnt really have the force needed to attempt a dragon, so we just crawled around killing lots of trash. One thing we did get was a Glowing Drake Bile (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69374) from a random trash mob racnar. Not shabby for random trash loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I didn't go but I did see a link to a Cleric only staff that had a 1.5 casting time for a 975hp heal.. my main is a cleric and I just was .. omg.. then I noticed it's just like Donal's BP, you can only cast it once on the person till they zone. <br />
<br />
It has a 10minute recast is all. They can now put recast delays on items. The links aren't displaying them correctly, and lucy isn't either atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The VP revamp is about the only thing that would entice me to play more these days...but I'm enjoying WoW beta enough that I'll be able to live with just reading about it...so anyone got any links to others of the new loots there? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was reading on how to get the new key and was wondering if you had to kill the shade guy every time for each person or if its flag style where all in the raid at time of kill get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When shade dies a 6 chests spawn near where he spawns (little higher up ramp), there is a total of 48 books in those chests. Hand book to Dragon at VP for Brood Dragon Blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drep DeKristne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Old VP loots were in the loot table as well.<br />
The two mini's we took down dropped two items each, one being from the old loot table. From the looks of the drop lists already posted on Allakhazam, these guys are dropping other &quot;old&quot; items as well. Out of all of our VP clears, we've only seen one Blood Orchid Katana (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6483). Hopefully that will be in the mix as well.<br />
<br />
Drops for us:<br />
<br />
Travenro the Skygazer<br />
Shssar Seance Staff (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=541) (old Silverwing loot)<br />
Azure Girdle (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29810#) (new)<br />
<br />
Blood-Thirsty Racnor<br />
Fatesealer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3566) (old Hoshkar loot)<br />
Racnor-Hide Wristband (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69362) (new)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">That katana has been on my &quot;fun-item wishlist&quot; for years!  I certainly hope it's still around.  Still, one old and one new drop per dragon is a little nasty in my opinion.  Two new + one old would be more reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ah my bad, didn't notice this was from trash minis.  That makes it far more reasonable and would have been obvious if I'd followed the links.</div></div><hr />
