What do warriors have to look forward to in LDON in terms of new skills discs or abilities?<br />
<br />
Your melee balancing for future plans has been on the websight for months and months.  SOE asks for feedback about things that are annoying about spells.  Do you think that it would be a good idea to gather information regarding melee problems?<br />
<br />
After admiting that a melee revamp should be done you add things for casting classes in the next expansion without any thought regarding the melee.  I realize its much easier to code things for spells than it is for melee, maybe you could set up a program that allows melee mains to only pay 5 bucks a month because they shouldn't have to pay for the R &amp; D of new spells.<br />

How hard is it to design Paladin/Shadow Knight items and slap Warrior on them as well?  Which is basically the majority of what we see.  And since we routinely get no new abilities that are class specific, it's hard to say they put a lot time into that either, after all.</div></div><hr />

They currently have, what, 4 spells they can cast on others? Lev, Invis, See Invis and that ungodly 5 point ds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
O'Kiel's &gt; ALL.<br />
<br />
That spell SOOOOOO needs to get nerfed.<br />
<br />
It should carry with it an aggro component, so that every point of damage it does to a mob, it MULTIPLIES the aggro generated by their next nuke on said mob.<br />
<br />
So say a wizard drops O'Kiel's Damage Shield of GODLINESS on you, and the mob then proceeds to quad you, absorbing 20 points of damage from the DS, the very next nuke should carry 20 TIMES the amount of aggro it would normally carry. And if the nuke is a crit, it should be squared.<br />
<br />
THAT would bring wizards back into line with everyone else.<br />

<br />
You don't need anyone to work on melee, it's trivial.<br />
<br />
There's nothing that could possibly require any skill, focus, time, or work that involves melee in EQ.<br />
<br />
Why would you put someone to work on melee?  It's boring, you just attack and go AFK.  Making cool spells and new ideas for button pushers is much more interesting.<br />
<br />
Melee in EQ is complete, why would they need someone working on it?<br />
<br />
Doesn't melee work involve math?  I don't think SoE has anyone with a math degree working there... they certainly don't have anyone with a software engineering degree working there :P</div></div><hr />

The shielding% lines are novelty at best.  It was neat to buff  for the first day but after seeing it wear off after 2 mobs max and save half a tick of medding for a healer its not even worth buying. They changed Calrena to be spell shield% recently so it has a few uses but its still buggy.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sad Brutall cannot get an answer here.  The majority of my wins were with a knight tanking or no tank at all.  Why take a warrior at all?  This needs to have much higher priority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt that, since he showed up in the active list on MB, it's pretty easy to extrapolate that he reads here as well.  Though I haven't seen him myself on the active list it's not a far stretch to assume he reads these boards as well.<br />
<br />
let alone post...<br />
<br />
He seemed open to the idea of coming back to discuss issues other than LDON in his thread.  Maybe he's too chickenshit to do that. Maybe he's under orders from a chickenshit management not to discuss things.  But I'm tired of /feedbacking every day and would love to see a dialogue of some sort opened up.  <br />
<br />
The anger I have is basically directed at his unwillingness to open up  any communication between the company he works for and its playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Do you have some reason to believe he is likely to respond to any thread of any kind?  I'm pretty dubious about that, since he's had ample opportunity before and after the expansion to step up to the plate.  I mean, other than his attempt to peddle the LDoN expansion, of course.</div></div><hr />
