<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bamaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone.  I recently came back from about a year's hiatus of eq.  I have pretty much acquired what i think to be some decent armor and weapons to hold me out until i get better.  My main question is whether i should upgrade my swirlspine belt to something along the lines of a silvery belt of contention or a sash of the dragon born or if i should hold out for a rbg or the like.  I am not in a raiding guild and have about 7-8k to spend.  I can always farm or earn more, but i do think the haste needs to be upped asap.  My magelo is in the link under my name, thank you in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'll definitely want a better haste item than 16% if you're level 52.  If I were you I'd go to Gulf of Gunthak talk to the human female there that gives the melee only haste neck item quest, then go to Dulak's harbor and get the quest drops(torn luggald robes, and glass shard off the tavern wench).  Saves you some cash, and it's a 2 part quest.  The first item is 20% haste, the second in the series is 25% haste with some decent stats(drops are a little tougher to get).  And most importantly, it's relatively easy to get the drops, and it's free.  Final piece is called &quot;Amulet of Dark Waters&quot; or something like that.  If you just have to spend your money on it, get a really good haste belt, rbg or better. There's a new haste belt in Veksar, 31%, not sure what it's selling for though.</div></div><hr />
