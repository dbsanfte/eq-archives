My guild is currently finishing off PoP teir 1 (TT)  How far into PoP, GoD, OoW can this aggro setup go?  Is it useable in PoTime?  How about if I went epic 1.5 and BoC offhand?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

 <br />
I use BoC + A3 and Legion Issue Kurki + Yak <br />
<br />
I hold aggro just fine. Hopefully I get a DBotW , but this combo does fine for me in raid and group settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get to Time with that.  I would look for a different offhander if one comes along, but the BoC will get you there if you don't have a shot at a Bloodfrenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no experience in Time, but I have tanked everything up to and including Fennin in Plane of Fire with a GBoS/Anger 3 and BoC/100Ykesha.  You should do fine with that set up.  I would suggest however hitting Einride in BOT towers for a GBoS.  It is a superior weapon to a CHoS.  I am also guessing that the ornate plate BP and the hybrid shoulders would not rot if you are finishing TT in tier 1.  Or if you are set against this, shoot for a Scimitar from Vallon in Tactics.  Some of our other warriors in our guild use GBoS and Scim and aggro is very comparable to BoC imo.<br />
<br />
About a week ago I finished my epic 1.5 and gave the BoC back to the guild for another to use so it is no longer in magelo.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That combo will easily last you until Time.<br />
<br />
Along the way you can snag a BoW or a SEWS if you're so inclined.  Once in Time, hold out for an EoE for mainhand, then a DBoTW, and you'll be set.<br />
<br />
<br />
CSoEP is a good thing to work on as well which you can mainhand till you get a DBoTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoC has a lot of staying power.<br />
Im going to have to disagree with others though.<br />
I had to lose my CHoS when I started MTing the heavier elemental mobs.<br />
CHoS really doesnt stand the test of Time.<br />
<br />
As others have stated however, getting the GBoS from BoT took me and 9 guildies.<br />
In todays gear/level/AA generation, you can probably do it with a lot less.<br />
BoC/GBoS is holding up well in RSS.<br />
Im looking more for armor than weapons at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used EoE main / BoC offhand all the way up until Inkuta.  Swapped it for a demerix. Didn't have issues to many times. It is a good weapon for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been using BoC/A3 and GBoS/A3 for some time now.  I only seem to have trouble when I get an unlucky streak and don't proc for a while, and when I have some dot happy necros with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I second what Sir Phoenix says ( I have the GBoS and BoC).  I have tanked RZ in time and had no problems with agro whatsoever.  In fact, on raids I can hold agro just fine MTing.  My problem is getting agro for trash mobs and in xp groups.  Normally I can, but I can get unlucky.<br />
