<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have parses or solid info about how often some of the various offensive aa's go off?  For example flurry says 5,10,20pct chance of going off, but I've heard it only goes off of triple attacks, which don't happen all that much.  So does anyone have any data for flurry1/2/or3 or even raging flurry1/2/or3<br />
?<br />
<br />
Also It would be nice to know how often these happen:<br />
PB1/2/or3<br />
CF1/2/or3 and/or FotA1/2/or3<br />
ambidex<br />
ferocity1/2/3<br />
<br />
Would be really nice to have a clear picture on how often these things happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would be quite a feat to parse all of that and make any sort of readable report from it however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could parse PB results in terms of DPS increase, but there is absolutely no way to say exactly when it fires. I do however, feel that Ferocity and perhaps Punishing Blade feeds into Flurry Procs. This is just from observation, because I did not take before and after parse data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FULL OFF AA =  +20% DPS<br />
<br />
But its very hard to see who effects what, since its random.<br />
And there are a lot of AA in total</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">few suggestions in the sticky at the top. no one has posted parses and you would need a huge sample, as im sure you noticed with weapon procs. sometimes you get a few, sometimes you proc several times a fight. all the aas only give you an increased chance to crit, flurry, etc. its not a consistent dmg add like a mage damage shield or something.<br />
<br />
most the threads ive read say you get the most out of punishing blade and ferocity, but again, no parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay have the following:<br />
<br />
Ferocity 3<br />
Punishing Blade 3<br />
Raging Flurry 2<br />
<br />
The below was using a Twisted Steel Bastard Sword 53/45<br />
<br />
With those AA skills listed above I have increased my dps around 25% - 40% depending on what my haste was from low end haste to high end haste.<br />
<br />
And yes from what I have seen the above skills work hand in hand together but it is hard to parse them out to figure out what percentage each adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnimwit said Solinaar took careful logs of each offensive AA he got <br />
<br />
He lied 8(<br />
<br />
I have only ever parsed defensive damage, and different weapons in relation to each other.  Have never parsed the effect of offensive AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn tricksy gnomes :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raging flurry 3, compared to just regular flurry3 there is a fairly large difference in process rate. Now I don't know if this is due to an artifical buff thanks to ferocity creating more instances of doubles to allow for tripples to allow for flurries, nor do I really care. The fact that everquest devs have chosen to never feed us some hard facts about how our aa's work doesn't help much either.<br />
<br />
The offensive aa's make a difference, alone I'd say not much of any, but combined they all pretty much help eachother out. If you're going to nitty gritty over any offensive stuff you will be dissapointed. There is really no true way to know or parse the sole effect each has unless you were able to erase all previous other offensive aa's such as to allow for zero skill overlapping, if that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose you're right, the effect of having certain aa's feed off of others would make it quite hard to figure out the effects of a single aa.  (not impossible, but would require a large amount of good sized parses from different warriors with different aa sets, which makes the task not likely to be done).  <br />
<br />
I guess I'll just have to settle with max offensive aa's increase dps around 20ish pct (maybe more sense we have someone reporting more in the thread)<br />
<br />
Is the 20pct a 1h'r figure or a 2h'r figure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both.<br />
<br />
From what I have heard from others...<br />
<br />
1h while tanking<br />
Ferocity = 5-7%ish<br />
Ambidex = 5-6%ish<br />
Full crits = 5%ish (8% crits / 1.7 multiplier)<br />
Flurry = 4%ish<br />
Tactical Mastery = 6-7%ish<br />
Double Ripo = 1-2%ish<br />
Stalwart Endurance = 1-2%ish (from not being stunned)<br />
Planar Power = 1%ish (from increased atk/str)<br />
<br />
1.06*1.055*1.05*1.04*1.065*1.025*1.015*1.01=1.353<br />
All those little 2% here 5% there figures total up to a 35% increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
Considering 2h adds in punishing blade, and makes flurry, ferocity, and double riposte hit for more per attack, 2h is even slightly more DPS, maybe as high as 40-50% increase in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But with 2her you lose the 5-6% from ambidex :P<br />
<br />
And omg, the ogre nerf :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is my impression that most of your dps comes from your primary hand weapon anyway, since offhand has no damage bonus, and only cycles ___% of the time (based on your aas), so losing ambidex isn't THAT big of a deal for a 2h wielder... not to mention how much better Punishing Blade is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What ogre nerf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1-2% DPS from not being stunned ? That sounds a little optimistic... maybe 0.1-0.2 % is more realistic  ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uduk</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think by Ogre nerf he means the stalwart endurance AA, which means Ogre's are no longer the only race that can't be stunned from  the front in combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1-2% DPS from not being stunned ? That sounds a little optimistic... maybe 0.1-0.2 % is more realistic ?<br />
<br />
Numbers werent really meant to be accurate. Im sure some are close to being accurate, but some are total guesses.  My point being, 12 AA for 2% more offensive power here or there for an AA ability seems like a crappy deal, but you add them all up and it can be a very substantial increase in overall class power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With Stalwart Endurance 3 you can still be stunned -- just less likely, correct?  So ogres STILL have an edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does Stalwart Endurance help at all with things like the bears in PoS, or the spiders in PoV?  I'm an ogre but yet these 2 guys can stun me from the front, which is really annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and being stunned when using a 2h'r can cut into your dps more than ya'll think.  If I get stunned 1 time on a bear in PoS I miss around 1-2 combat rounds or generally around 4 attacks sometimes more.  I have a median hit of around 120, max critical of 433 if those 4 attacks were just my median hit then I lost 480 points of damage, I usually do around 8-10k damage on these guys in a group.  480dmg is 4.8pct to 6pct of my total damage I just lost, from getting stunned once in a battle.  I dunno how often people get stunned by things when you're not an ogre, but even if it's just once a fight you're losing a good chunk of your damage.</div></div><hr />
