So, of course i want to try and obtain battle gear of valor and if i get really lucky battle gear of might... But i don't know where these drop. <br />
<br />
I would like to know so i know where to farm when i hit around lvl 58 which i think is the highest lvl u need so that u can complete the set... so does anyone know where i can get it?<br />
<br />
BTW i don't want to hear crap that i'm not going to get it! i just want to know where</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might comes from MC (Onxyia still too?), and your chance of seeing this outside of raiding is virtually nil.  (I guess you could buy a bracer if you really wanted).<br />
<br />
Either set is going to take a significant amount of time to complete.<br />

Might is significantly more difficult to obtain than Valor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe Well it shouldn't be that long. i just hit lvl 51 and it takes about 10 to 15 hours to lvl so ya and i get most of my game time on the weekends so ya within the next month i will hit 60 so... any recommandations on where valor and might drop? more common?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">05-02-2005, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude, read the replies, the answer was given right off the bat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Valor involves raiding Stratholm, Scholomance, and Blackrock Spire to get the piece.<br />
<br />
Battlegear of Might involves 40 man raids in Molten Core.&quot;<br />
<br />
Specific pieces drop off specific bosses in most cases.  For example, the Baron in the UD side of Strat drops the Legs, I *think* the gauntlets are random in UD Strat (Undead side Stratholme) or maybe all of Strat, the Bracers come from LBRS (Lower Black Rock Spire).  The Valor BP comes off the boss of UBRS (Upper Blackrock Spire) General something or other, level 61ish elite dragon.  Not sure on the other pieces, but a quick search on wow.allakhazam.com will tell you.<br />
<br />
As said above Might comes from Molten Core, 40 man raids.  A guild that is doing MC will have high standards for warriors, so don’t expect to get into a MC raid unless you’ve already tanked all of the above zones, unless you’ve got some friends who are willing to take you along.  Just got a level 54 warrior his gauntlets and valor bracer a few nights back because I had both pieces, but I got the BP.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">05-03-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i got a lvl 60 warlock willing to help me and lvl 60 warrior and others that will help me grab those pieces since they both already got thier full sets, Dreadmists and Valor...<br />
<br />
I'm about to ding lvl 52 today, like 2 bars off and I already have the bracers thanks to the warrior who picked them up yesturday, I'm not worried about going into MC due to Thiers an MC raid every other day or so... and all my lvl 60 friends are always thier... so once i hit lvl 60 respect my armor and talents to a good build i will tank, i don't always have to tank MC i can do dmg as well with a fury build, seeing as i will do Arms/fury builds im not thinking of doing a proc build. Once I get lvl 60 and whole valor set which will take some times no dbout that, i will lvl up my ethier my mage,hunter,warlock or pally. i think i will do tanking/healing with my pally and dmg with my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would rather get gear oriented towards what i am doing.  IE +crit gear for pvp and +stamina/def gear for tanking.  That means not a whole lot of valor is really necessary as their are easier to obtain items out there that are more specifically geared towards what you want to do.  Valor is nice and I wouldn;t turn it down, as its always tough for the casual player to get good gear, but I wouldn;t waste my time trying to get the full set, when mixing and matching would probably get you better results, even if it looks a little off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Valor:<br />
<br />
BP Genearl Drakk in UBRS (boss)<br />
Shoulders Rend UBRS<br />
Bracer Random mobs in UBRS<br />
Legs Baron Rivendare Undead Strath<br />
Gaunts Ramstein Undead Strath (right before Rivendare)<br />
Helm Darkmaster (or some crap) Gandling guy at the very end of Scholomance<br />
Boots Kirtonas the Herald in Scholomance.  (not too far in, need blood of the Martyr to spawn him)<br />
<br />
Might all drops in Molten Core now.  Lets are from Magmadar, BP is from Golemagg, bracer and belt are from random zone mobs, gaunts/boots/helm I forget, but from some mobs in there. (Garr, Lucifron, Ghennas, Shazzrah, Gedon, Sulferon, just can't remember which drop which set pieces, I think some can drop a couple different ones)<br />
<br />
Wrath is mostly removed to Blackwing's lair until it comes out.  Wrath helm still drops from Onyxia for sure, legs MAY drop from Ragnaros, but I'm not sure on that one. <br />
<br />
There are also some good alternatives to full Valor set.  I personally had almost a full set and never wore it.  I used Rend's legs and Adam BP to tank.  There are even some good alternatives to Might/Wrath.  None of the set bonuses are really that good, although some of the piece bonuses for Might/Wrath (improve dodge, improve crit, improve parry etc.), are pretty good.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
