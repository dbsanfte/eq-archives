Q: What is AC? How much do I need and how important is it for a warrior?<br />
<br />
A: AC stands for armor class. Your AC represents your total ability to mitigate and to avoid. It doesn't however factor in dodge, riposte, parry, and hitpoints. They are seperate defensive numbers. To be an effective warrior, it has been concluded that you should put AC above all stats until you reach an AC of about 1250-1350 (depending on your AA skills). AC is easily the most important stat for a warrior until that number is reached, and from that point on additional hitpoints and stamina (up to 205) should be favored.<br />

Q: What should I spend my starting points on when creating a new warrior?<br />
<br />
A: For most races choose stamina especially if you have the end game in mind at all. Strength and dexterity items are easy to come by for a warrior while stamina and agility are harder to find. Some would argue that agility should come before stamina when making a new warrior especially when it's an ogre or something with high stamina already, but for most, stamina should be the way to go. Putting points into strength or dexterity is generally a waste. Stamina is also the hardest stat to raise with buffs.<br />

Q: What is the best race for a warrior?<br />

A: There is no BEST race... ogre, troll, barbarian, and iksar have some nice boosts... however, all races can become extremely successful warriors.<br />

Q: How should I spend my AA points?<br />
<br />
A: Most seem to go with 3 run speed first followed by 3 regen and then they move on to either durability, agility, or mitigation. It's all a matter of choice really. Note: Many stronger guilds require warriors to have AE taunt because it's useful for MT switching.<br />

Q: Will I suffer in my ability to swing when I'm fatigued?<br />
<br />
A: With over 100 stamina, you should suffer no loss in speed or damage output, you only lose the ability to jump and you are spammed with hungry/thirsty messages if it's due to a lack of food/water. Note: This has yet to be proven, but it is generally accepted.<br />

Q: Do beg/disarm work as a taunt?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, but you cannot beg while attacking. Disarm should be used as a taunt whenever possible.<br />

<br />
Q: What diety should I choose upon creation?<br />
<br />
A: Choose whichever diety you like the most. Keep in mind though, as of recently there are certain diety-specific sets of armor available in game with some mighty impressive stats (even for the end-game). Rallos Zek worshippers are blessed with a slightly better player-made armor set for warriors.<br />
