<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nefilim</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen any guides posted, so here it is:<br />
<br />
First off, Tactical Mastery is a MUST. You cannot live without this trait. Retaining rage when changing stances allows you to play to your fullest extent.<br />
<br />
Second, spamming Heroic Strike is a sin. Don't do it. That little extra damage may seem nifty, but there's a myriad of other useful skills you can use. Cleave and Whirlwind being two notable examples.<br />
<br />
There is one thing you must let your group know: you have to pull. If you don't pull, keeping the aggro will be hard. Even if you have paladins, you're the main tank. It's much better that they stand to the side and keep you healed. The group is best off focusing it's attacks on your target.<br />
<br />
Sunder Armor is a great skill to keep aggro. Taunt has no effect if the mob is already fighting you.<br />
<br />
For lv30 and below:<br />
Start the fight off by charging into a group of about four, then use Demoralizing Shout or Thunderclap to at least tag them to you. From then on, use Cleave when there are two or more. If you lose aggro and you're still in Battle Stance, use Thunderclap to blow your Rage away on keeping a little hate, then switch to Defensive and taunt the mob back to you if you haven't gotten the aggro back.<br />
<br />
Lv30/36+:<br />
Charge in, switch to Berserker stance, use Berserker Rage once all the mobs on you and whirlwind. Bloodrage, Cleave, Demoralize, Whirlwind again. From then on, just use your wits. You can Cleave, Sweeping Strike, Demoralize, or whatever. The key is to use powerful area affects to hold aggro. The more you get hit, the better - free rage.<br />
<br />
My personal suggestion for weapon choice would be a slow speed, heavy hitting two hander in later levels since both Mortal Strike and Whirlwind are both instant-cast skills that are based on your average weapon damage. Using a high-range weapon will optimize these two skills.</div></div><hr />

Someone who's level 40, do me a favor.<br />
<br />
Take a friend (just 1...healer of some kind) and go to the ogre area of Stromgarde and try this with your Arms/Fury spec and your 2h and tell me how it works out.<br />
<br />
I went there last nite with my shammy friend and got my fucking ass handed to me every time I pulled out my whirlwind axe.  <br />
<br />
This strategy might work okay for low level stuff, but those ogres are assrape in a can...and I don't see the damage situation improving as I level up.  Sword and Board + concussion blow = the way to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
These strategies aren't necessarily meant for a two-man crew. It's for holding aggro in large groups.<br />
<br />
In Zul'farrak, at lv43 (all the mobs are elites with at least +2 levels against me), I was able to hold aggro off of a lv48 rogue rather consistently. The only times it ever wandered was if someone targetted the wrong mob at the start of a fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
For fighting one-on-one, it's really anyone's game.  Personally, I prefer a slow, heavy hitting 2h with Improved Overpower, Mortal Strike, and the line of the Rend tree. Initiate with a charge, then demoralize/disarm (if they have a weapon), and rend. Follow-up by overpowering any dodges and Mortal Strike when convenient. Again, this was lv43, but against lv44 elites.<br />
<br />
<br />
Added: I was also a protective spec til 41 and relied on Concussion Blow/Improved Revenge. I switched over to Arms and I've seen quite a considerable leap in damage.<br />
<br />
1) Rend now does a healthy chunk of damage in DoT for only 10 rage (133 at lv43).<br />
<br />
2) Pairing Improved Overpower with Deep Wounds and Impale is an awesome combo. It's like a free 150 damage DoT with a two-hander.<br />
<br />
3) Tactical Mastery and Anger Management - nothing needs to be said here.<br />
<br />
3) Weapon specializations are both very nice, even though I was an idiot and took Two-Hand spec thinking it read &quot;Improve chance to critical strike with two-handed weapons.&quot;<br />
<br />
4) Sweeping Strikes - 30 rage for 5 cleaves, can't get much better than that. Some say that Cleave/SS still stack, allowing you to do double damage to both targets.<br />
<br />
5) Mortal Strike  feels like one of those skills that warriors should have started out with. Basically, it's a beefy version of Heroic Strike that is instant-cast and halves healing effectiveness. Solo, it's awesome because of the great, quick damage that can be delivered. In groups, it's a wonderful way to get some aggro while dealing damage and blowing away some Rage to switch stances when you're over 55 rage. In PvP, it really takes the edge off of the healer types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other thing this set up assumes is that you have a healer in your instance group. As I think our guild's highest healer is 10 levels below me, the charge thing so would not work for me. <br />
<br />
When we do instances, sans healers, generally the hunters will pull, and their pets will end up tanking. At least the hunters can heal them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm tanking with a healer:<br />
<br />
I'm almost always in defensive mode, sometimes I may switch out to charge to get more rage or to zerker for whirlwind etc.  Just depends.<br />
<br />
If there are pet classes tell them to turn pet taunt off.  Most people don't realize that Warriors are at their best when all mobs are on you and you're getting the crap beat out of you.<br />
<br />
You need to pull.  Pull aggro is very important in WoW, as is who gets the first hit.<br />
<br />
If I get several mobs, I demo shot immediately, and then also try to tag at least one each with a hit and sunder if I have the rage.  As was mentioned Cleave is also nice aggro in groups, so is thunderclap (its also and AE snare), if you're in battle stance.<br />
<br />
In def mode with shield i'm usually shield blocking/revenging, and also keeping sunder, demo shout, battle shout, rend, and disarm as much as the situation and rage allows.  <br />
<br />
If I'm in dps mode:<br />
<br />
I'm usually in Battle/Zerker stance.  I always let the MT pull, and I never charge or even engage before he does.  I try to charge to get rage, then bloodrage, then sweeping/cleave like a beast.  I'll toss the occasional thunderclap or heroic strike in there too.  Usually the MT is sundering, demo shouting, battleshouting etc., so I usually don't need to do this, but again its fluid so sometimes I do.  If we have lots of lower level mobs (or just cause its fun!) I'll switch to zerker and enrage and whirlwind.  I kind of feel that cleave and sweeping are more dps with several mobs and me not tanking though.  The key here is keeping my rage up by charging and bloodrage as I'm not getting hit that much.  <br />
<br />
Good talents to have, sweeping is great, TM is essential if you're changing stances, etc.  For defensive tanking I really like improved revenge.  I'm mainly an arms spec but I do have ant 5, and toughness 5, which really help with AC and defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I've grouped quite ofte from about lvl 5 (am 30 now) and I've not seen better aggro control than defensive stance, sword and a board.   Simple as that.   It takes a lil time to generate aggro(charge, THunderlcap, Bloodrage, switch to defensive ..wth tactical mastery helps alot...and speed's it up alot) but once I have all the target's sundar'd ... and it can happen quite quickly... it's kill one at a time, concentrating DPS.  Just throw a demoralizing shout and a cleave here and there to shore up aggro on those your not fighting and it's cake.  ANd this with higher lvl elites too.  <br />
<br />
Your group just has to know you need a lil time to get the aggro machine started.  If they unerstand that, then your set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had good luck when I focus on Arms, switching to Defensive for a quick Taunt/Sunder if a priest/mage draws aggro. If everyone plays smart, I can lead with a Charge and land a Demo Shout/Thunderclap/Cleave or just a Sunder if there aren't many mobs. Nothin to it.<br />
<br />
Bosses are different. I'm undecided whether I should stick with Arms and lead with Retaliation, or stay in Arms long enough to Charge and land an ATK shout, then switch to Defensive and ride that for the entire fight. It's definitely situational and if you're not too heavily spiked into one talent area you can choose either or something else and do just fine.<br />
<br />
For a few levels I used a Whirlwind Sword (2h) and did quite nicely but now that I have a Sword of Serenity and a good shield I'm sticking with that for a while. 5k armor with Devotion is a lot of pure mitigation at 42, and my DPS is only a few points lower than with my 2h atm. Again it comes down to your circumstances, your preferences, and your talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, using Berserk Stance to tank will = Death!  Have you ever tried to tank SM without CC?  3 elites hitting you are hard enough with a sword/board but with a two hander and berserk, you nuts?  <br />
<br />
Defensive is the way to go for tanking instances, and Imp Revenge + Shield block (concus if ya got it) is the way to go.  You got a few shouts for aoe aggro, some nice spammable taunt abilities, an emergency taunt skill, and an emergency aoe taunt for when the shit hits the fan.<br />
<br />
Defense stance provides 10% better tank ability AND more aggro IN THAT STANCE.  Plus you are usually using a shield, blocking, hitting them with your shield spike on the block, stunning them, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anghara</div><div class="date">01-15-2005, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have found I prefer Defensive stance in instances. I don't view my job there as adding dps really; i view it as holding aggro and not getting dead so fast the healers run OOM. That has worked well for us thus far (I am level 43).<br />
<br />
I am also a bit unusual as near as I can tell in that I have had a pretty much defensive build from level 10, since I always knew I would be the MT for our guild, and it does make a difference in the ability to take damage, wow. A couple levels ago did SM with a Fury warrior 3-4 levels higher than me with better gear, and he was just getting destroyed by one mob while I was only down to 80% health on an identical one. That was the day we did the Armory with 3 warriors, a warlock, and a paladin for heals.<br />
<br />
I know this has totally gimped my solo ability, and PvP forget it, but instances and boss mobs I can really see where the defensive stance and abilities shine.</div></div><hr />

Depends what you're supposed to keep aggro on.  I prefer defensive 70% of the time, and almost always to establish (and re-establish) aggro.<br />
<br />
Zerk stance works real nice on large groups of non-elites because it lets you spam cleave inbetween whirlwinds.  Those fights are such chaos, especially if you have people AEing.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that this post specifically states that it's a guide for tanking in instances, and then encourages the use of berserker stance, which is basically completely opposite of what is going to hold aggro and keep you alive against 4+ elites.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I agree with you in most cases there.   Berserk isn't totally without its tanking uses though (in instances), but it is limited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... so is thunderclap (its also and AE snare), if you're in battle stance ...<br />
<br />
It's an AE slow, 10%.  If there's aggro in it, it's been negligible since about 15th  level (mebbe even as high as 20th) for me, but up until then it seemed pretty good. But after a demoralizing shout, piercing howl, and grenade, I'll clap a little, just in case.  It's the last trick in my bag, tho, and there's a good chance I'll do summat else with my rage.  If it was an AE snare, it'd be a loverly thing indeed.<br />
<br />
Lately, I've taken to dual weilding, tho I was an adherent of the sword and board model.  Respeccing to a fury/arms build designed for rage generation has made it easier to hold aggro when my guildies are in to.  (And when I solo, holding aggro is almost assured!)  Observations are as of yet inconclusive, but it seems so far that spamming shouts holds area aggro better than Defiance from my prot spec, and the best thing about the old build was interrupts for soloing against casters.  It did nothing for me to hold group aggro tho.<br />
<br />
Dam* warrior is hell on my arthritis. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;On thunderclap&gt;It's an AE slow, 10%.

<br />
It's not even AE actually, it's 4 target same as whirlwind - i.e. more or less useless in situations where you actually want an AE ability, particularly given you have no control over what it hits. <br />
<br />
All warrior abilities have aggro, and thunderclap is no exception - it's not a particularly good form of aggro though due to the above issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vonpol</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wanna know how you can justify creating a post called &quot;Guide to Instances&quot; if your not lvl 60. Not to be an ass but what do you really know. <br />
<br />
There are a few people  that post that really seem to know what they are talking about. Maybe you should listen to them. <br />
<br />
Sorry i have to make some comments(some have them have allready been made) <br />
<br />
Tanking in Berserker stance(wtf)<br />
<br />
Thunderclap(write that one off, last i checked AE spells break sheep) <br />
<br />
Heroic Strike &quot; the most useless thing you can do&quot; ( that's imppressive)(like my grammar)<br />
Heroic strike is the 2nd best thing besides sunder armour for generating threat. <br />
<br />
Tactical master  &quot; A must &quot; not neccessarily, dont get me wrong its great for PVP and solo lvling. If you wanna be a bad ass at PVP play a rogue. I dont have any spec pts in TM. I dont use it as a high end warrior speced for PVE.<br />
<br />
If you saw my spec you would probably cry, but its what works for being the MT in lvl 60 plus instances. Dmg is not the concern of the MT ( thats the whole reason you have 39 other people with you) Its about holding aggro on 6 diffrent Mobs and staying alive. <br />
<br />
Velk<br />
Haass<br />

nice post gents</div></div><hr />
