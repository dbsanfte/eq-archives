<br />
Seems like some of the best gear will add to both,  but the hammered golden hoop for example is neg. 15 to AC and was a suggested upgrade by a friend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look through these boards, you will see parsing data showing a reduction in damage taken up to 2200 AC.  Old world mobs had a fairly general consensus that AC beyond 1250ish was giving very limited returns so may be useless after that, but PoP mobs show a benefit continuing with AC.<br />
<br />
I personally have never liked that earring as -15 AC is horrendous.  It typically will result in something more like 20+ lost AC since you could find a 4AC earring quite easily which equiped will give you at least 6AC.</div></div><hr />

I would pay attention to AC/HP/STA more than anything. Everything else can be buffed to all hell with a shammy, plus the difference in taking with other stats is pretty minimal compared to the big 3.<br />

When making gear decisions I usually use:<br />
<br />
1ac = 10hp = 6sta<br />
<br />
Once your STA gets over 255, then you can adjust that down a little to reflect the actual HP gained at those levels. IMO the Hammered Golden Hoop is one of the most over rated pieces of gear that is commonly found on warriors. When the softcap was 1250ac and it was hard to get decent HP on an earring it was a good alternative, but there are way too many good choices available that make this thing a pile by today's standards.</div></div><hr />
