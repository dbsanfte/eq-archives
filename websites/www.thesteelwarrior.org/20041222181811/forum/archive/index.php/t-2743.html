<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sscaley</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
Just doing some random calculations wrt sustained offensive power and I was wondering if any of you with maximum offensive AA and EP Gods level weapons (or lower) could give a good guesstimate on the possible sustained DPS on the trials in PoTime mobs. It doesn't have to be DPS while tanking, just a general guess as to which band we're talking.<br />
<br />
For wizards (which I play now) I came up with a conversion factor of 7:1 (damage:mana including ~10% resists) which I think is not totally unrealistic, accounting for all the damage and preservation foci, specialization and all that. A fully offensive AA'd and geared wizard's sustained DPS would thus approach 140 (120 mana/tick regen). However, the mana-pool acts a buffer that allows the DPS to be stored and released when a mob is in camp (take this into account before you start saying it's too low), but the 140 is what the DPS would be if you had a fight lasting infinitely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
130 dps is what I do on a given time trial mob. BoW, every offensive AA except double riposte, lowish ATK tho, only 1460 unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">140-180 depending on buff setup (atk or ac/hp) and 2H i'd say (BoW/Sews/Vazanir).<br />
<br />
My avg is close to 150-170 on xp mobs (PoF castle 1)<br />
BoW + Full AA + Vengeance49 + Ranja luvin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have some, but not many offensive AAs, and SoL weapons, no PoP... and I'm at around 100 DPS on average in Trials while tanking.  When I'm not tanking I average around 110-120 DPS.<br />
<br />
Other better equipped wars in guild can get up to 160-190 DPS on some mobs, but I'd put their sustained DPS somewhere more around 150 DPS when not tanking.<br />
<br />
When tanking or hitting from the front you loose around 20-30 DPS, maybe only 10-15 with TM3.  When Defensive you loose around 40 DPS.  I'm not sure how much DPS drops with Evasive.<br />
<br />
So even though warriors may be capable of doing decent DPS (Rogues can get around 220-240 DPS, Bards around 70-80 DPS), they rarely if ever maximize DPS because of their duty as a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed at 159 dps last night on CT for a total of 35k in damage. I have most offensive AA and was using a Vanazir/Symbol of the Planemasters. I wasn't tanking. My attack was 1582 or so. I would say 160ish is average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did Air/Undead trial today. The combined average DPS for those 19 mobs where 144 &quot;Crushing&quot; DPS according to EQCompanion(not including non-melee or proc damage). Used defensive on 2 of those mobs.<br />
<br />
This was using Vanazir and I have 240 innate ATK. Dont recall if I had SoP on or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">150 DPS sounds pretty much right for me as well.  All offensive AAs except for Pop Crit 3, and Double Riposte 3-6.  250 innate atk, BoW, and SoP.  Maybe SoB but I tend to click it off and grumble when I see it.</div></div><hr />
