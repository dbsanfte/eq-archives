Can anyone give me info on how many rotation mobs there are and basic info on how to get your guild on the rotation lists. Who oversee's the list, etc...  The guild I'm in is on Povar.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should probably check Povar's msg board for more accurate info.<br />
<br />
Prexus used to have a calendar and rotation up until Velious and then the server went FCFS (first come first served) and I think while people were upset in the beginning it was better in the long run because no one had to manage anything. There are so many mobs in the game now that there is always something up to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main bottleneck I see right now is planar progression.  Yes, there's always something to go kill, but there are a lot of 2nd and 3rd tier guilds working their way through PoP now and it can be hard to find some of the progression mobs up for flagging.  My server has at least 8 different guilds and alliances of guilds that are pre-elemental but have killed at least the tier 1 planar bosses (MB, TT, Grummus).  That's a lot of guilds looking for tier 2/3 bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO~ all of you  should xfer to Tallon Zek and join Incursion. OR You could xfer your entire guild. We have ONE guild in time and 2 guilds that are almost time. BUT because of the real raw PvP we progress slower because we have no rotation for mobs. If you want it go kill it and hope nobody comes to kill you and then take the mob for them selves. <br />
   I must say if not for the PvP I would be time flaged and or have quit already. I cant and will never leave my PvP server. Its nice. Our guild does not share anything  with anybody. If some one is in your favorit XP spot. You simply kill them and take it. Lots of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">server policies on rotations vary and are completely player created. some servers have very organized lists or calendars on certain mobs, other servers are pure fist come first serve. on xev, the only things i can think of that have any type of rotation is NTOV and Vex Thal. To get into the VT rotatin your guild myust have 2 unassisted emp kills and then talk to the leaders of the other guilds in the rotation. For NTOV, it wasnt as muchg a rotation as a rule that said whatever guild killed Aary got 2 or 3 days(i forget which) uncontested killing in ntov then whatever was still left up was free for all. best thing to do is to check the server boards for your server and maybe ask some of the guilds who are killing mobs you want to be in rotations to kill. they will be able to tell you for sure if there is a rotation and if so how to enter into it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boilerterry</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Povar rotates the following mobs/encouters:<br />

<br />
Emperor Ssra<br />
***A guild enters the rotation when it has killed Emp with its own forces Once a guild has sufficant Emp keys and banes to feel it is ready to attempt Emp, it approachs the guilds on rotation and asks for an attempt. The guild must have entered Ssra rotation first and cleared every mob on it (HP, Cursed, Creator) before an agreed attempt is granted****<br />
<br />
Vex Thal<br />
***A guild can ask for a rotation turn when it has completed 40 Vex Thal keys***<br />
<br />

You come with the appropriate size/force first, it's yours. If you arrived only to find someone else has engaged, you go find something else to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What happens if a guild goes and downs the mob that is your turn in the rotation?? Do you all go to the arena and have massive duels?? OR do you guys send threatning tells?? Perhaps you train them? Not trying to be a smartass but i just dont get the whole rotation thing.  KIll or be killed. the life of a TZ'er</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally at that point someone brings the issue to a server board and lets the rest of the server know and then the offending guild is ostracized and tormented by other guilds until they disband or go back to raiding crushbone<br />
<br />
typical examples of responses are many people will refuse to group members of offending guild, guilds will band together to cockblock any mobs the offending guild needs for pregression, offending guilds can be assaulted by random vigilante trainers while raiding, etc etc.</div></div><hr />
