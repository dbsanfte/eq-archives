<br />
The twinks/lowbies in my alliance recenly did her with like 18 people, your mileage my vary.</div></div><hr />

Anyone else can tell me about their experiences with killing Vox?<br />
<br />
20 peeps should be ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when I did Vox runs I took ~36.<br />
<br />
2 heavy tank groups of 3 wars/pals/SKs, 2 clerics, 1 bard each<br />
2 general groups of 3 melees, 1 shm, 1 ench, 1 cleric each<br />
2 nuke groups of 1 druid, 2 wizards, and 3 nukers/DPS melees each<br />
<br />
The 2 heavy tank groups charged first, got her in the center of the lair, the melees beat her down while the clerics healed with DL/SH and the bards played resist songs. The 2 general groups charged when Vox had 90% health, same general strat as the first two groups only the clerics and shaman assist healed while the chanters sieved. The last 2 groups charged at 70% and unloaded with fire nukes under her ass (really) at 50%. Nothin to it!<br />
<br />
Nowadays 20 can do it if you're all 50-52 and have good gear. 1 enchanter is needed, 2 are better (for mana sieve).<br />
<br />
Getting to Vox is easy, just don't fall into the bear pits. =P The hard part is pulling/killing the giants in her lair, most people pull them to the double doors by King and kill them there.<br />
<br />
Once the giants are dead ya gotta buff up, a good place is the room adjacent to Vox's inner lair, it's got a bunch of ramps leading from it. Then it's just a matter of a charge strategy unless you wanna just pound her with all your groups at once which is viable with the right groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">should get a map and see where all the pit traps are first. never  killed her myself, watched a few others do it but they had insane numbers for it. healers were outside her lair and they would send ppl in and then run out for heals. i was botting a cleric/enchanter/or shaman for buffs at the time, if u can get a high lvl buffer to come along, will help a ton.<br />
<br />
with 20 ppl i would think u would need make sure her lair is clear of giants, then have a trainer run her around while the rest of you run in and get position. if you dont have a bard singing ae MR/CR, i doubt you will win. remember cold buffs are still stacking too btw, get seasons and the single target cold buff.<br />
<br />
there is some point where the fear is going to hit no matter what your MR is, i would think anyone under lvl 48 would be worthless. ppl will walk into the pit traps if feared long enough.<br />
<br />
saw one good post on vox strat here (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=2620), just got to scroll down some<br />
<br />
if its your first time, should really plan on a cr heh, necro or cr gear for getting ppl out of the pits.</div></div><hr />

First off she was hiding in the wall. I targeted her..and hit taunt. Poof....I was ported to everfrost. She will not let anyone 53 or above engage her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With high level buffs on your dragon raiders, instacklick buffs for the mellees, good resist gear and casters hiding behind the rock most of the time our alt's have kiledl Voxx with 9.  I know she's prolly been done with less.  <br />
<br />
Sieve her the whole fight and save some mana for nuking her at the end of the fight when she death walks or she can get hung up on geometry and be unhittable.</div></div><hr />

She's actually been soloed, but that's an exceptional case.</div></div><hr />
