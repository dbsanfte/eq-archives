<br />
So ... I've been using up some of my &quot;Waiting Time&quot; here at work reading the official SOE forums. ( yah yah I know ) <br />
<br />
 It seems there is an abundance of posters these days who style themselves &quot; Casual Players&quot;, these players want to have high-end equipment, and access to high-end zones, and see all new content as it comes out .... but they don't want to be in a raiding guild or have to go to raids.<br />
<br />
 Casual player to me means just that, Casual. You're NOT going to get the uber gear, your NOT going to get to the uber zones, and your NOT going to see the newest content just because you pay to play EQ.<br />
<br />
 I have pointed out to these folks that the kind of gear and exp available to nonraiding players is perfect to have a challenging time of it in the zones available to the same nonraiding players.<br />
<br />
No one wants to hear that.<br />
<br />
 Mudflation has spoiled these types of players by making available to them the uber zones of expansions past. Now they think because they can fight in ToV/Ssraeshza/Tier 3 PoP that they should somehow be automatically be entitled to also access uper level PoP and GoD zones.<br />
<br />
 I can't help but wonder if some of the protest about raiding content is tied to the fact that the players who protest can't get accepted into a respectable raiding guild either due to their poor attitude or unspectacular skills/attendance. <br />
<br />
 I know some REAL casual players ... they don't give a damn less if they ever see the Elemental Planes, Kod'taz, or even SolRos' Tower. They enjoy doing exp groups in unusal places with their regular friends or in their casual guilds, they do long quests like the Coldain Shawls, the Tradeskill Trophys, the Original Epics Etc.<br />
<br />
The disgruntled whiney bitches should simmah down neh. <br />
<br />
 LDoN and Mudflation have made the casual player far more powerful then ever. If you want to play with the gear I play with, in the zones I play in ... Then go ahead and put in your time like I did. <br />
<br />
If that's too much for you to handle then you don't deserve it!  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">many so called &quot;casual players&quot; have put a great deal of time into the game but simply cannot do it in long streaks all at once at the request of their boss ... err i mean guild leader.the gear obtainable by such a player isnt even close to half the gear a full time raider would get though he puts in more than half the time.<br />
<br />
whining goes both ways and ive seen plenty on both sides. there are those who want gear they have not worked for and there are those who want to deny gear to those who would work for it. there are those who placing family above guild can play the hours but according to their own schedule not someone else's and yet they cannot advance not because they havent worked for it but because content is locked behind keys that are unobtainable no matter how much time played unless done under the cloak of a paternalistic guild. such people have every right to 'whine' that they are being denied the game that they originally subscribed to which was built around &quot;grouping&quot; with raiding as a supplement rather than a requirement.<br />
<br />
most of those that i know who love raiding also hate flagging. if so many people hate flagging then why dont we get rid of it? &quot;no no&quot; say the raiders. &quot;it would mean i sunk all that time for nothing.&quot; valid argument. so lets compensate them with a bunch of aa refund or something. &quot;no no thats not good enough! i dont want the aa, what i want is to remain in a different class of uberness than everone else.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it sounds somewhat elitist, I fully agree with you here.  If you're not willing to put in the time and effort into the game, then why should you expect to be at the top?  Ldon and such as given a lot of power to the casual player.  So much, in fact, that it's becoming more and more common for up and coming raiding guilds to practically outright skip content (because anything you give to a casual player is also available to a raider).  Remember back in the days when it was almost necessary to do VT in order to be intially successful in the elementals?  Now I see guilds not even bothering.  Why should they?  Everything they need to fill in those caps can pretty much be gotten out of Ldons if you're willing to put in enough time for it.<br />
<br />
I agree with Grumbam.  EverQuest exists on the basis of the carrot always dangling in front of you.  It always has and it always will!  If you give super high end access and super uber gear to the casuals, then what left is there to work for and take pride in for the raiders?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny, I've never seen a casual who says he wants Time access, or a Raex BP, or anything like that. Most of the ones who post merely state that it sucks that more than half of an expansion is locked behind a raid flag that they can't possibly get due to RL commitments.<br />
<br />
 Personally, I think progression should be a two way street. Got your Time flag? Great, there's no reason to ever go to Velious again! Already in (insert dumb GoD name with WAY too few vowels here)? Great, locked out of Luclin! Killed RZTW? Then you'll never ever ever need to fuck with Gorenaire!<br />
<br />
 That would leave content suitable for casuals out of the reach of bored duoing/soloing Time+++, so they can fight against people their own level and gear ratio for spawns, just like the Time+++ did oh so long ago. But you'll never see it thru all the bitter tears and moaning.....from the people who don't need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that was pretty much the reason i left EQ; i was wayy too casual to bother keeping up with my guild's progression ( time++ ) and sure my BoW and scattered kizrak+skyshrine armour pieces are nice and all; but overall the committment needed to keep going at the rate of my old guild was going meant an end of EQ and progression.<br />
<br />
these days i log on now and than ( very seldom, too much RL ) and just goof around. I agree with ya grum on your points; and i feel these days that i myself am only entitled to what i put forth effort towards acheving.<br />
sure, an old hand-me-down is great and all but for the most part i won't b*tchslap my cup of milk off the table if i'm not wearing Raex nor own a Darkblade.<br />
<br />
and it's funny...the game doesn't bother me either. it's just fun with no goals set other than just logging on and saying hi to friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Partha,<br />
I hate to say it, but you sound a lot like those Knights that were pretty happy to see Defensive turned off in Tipt and Ikky - if I can't have something, well good - glad you got screwed.<br />
<br />
Before I destroyed a rotator cuff, I skied the 3 diamond trails on most of the East Coast &quot;mountains&quot;. This didn't bar me from the bunny slopes. In fact, some of the really long intermediate slopes were a lot of fun (at least on acrobatic skies going backwards half the time).<br />
<br />
This is somewhat the way EQ is. You earn your way into the harder content, but that doesn't mean you can't if you wish relax and do easier content. &quot;Uber&quot; players have earned their way into harder and more content. Players that can put in less time don't see as much of the game - that's the way it works. They reserved Vox and Naggy, and as near as I can tell, it's only being farmed now by players trying to sell the Staff of Forbidden Rites for 1M pp. PA would like to thank you for your patronage.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing that's ticked me off recently is a few sub-7k HP players whining that this or that part of GoD is too hard. When you look at their Magelo, there's no sign of augments or no sign they've even farmed Ornate molds. Somehow they expect reaching level 65 means they've arrived.<br />
<br />
The killer is that on a few servers there are &quot;public&quot; raids. On E'ci, E'ci Public Raiders is one of the top guilds (if it were strictly speaking a guild) on the server. Raiding does not require being in an &quot;uber&quot; guild. It does however require doing more than logging in and /oocing Hey, I logged in - where's my ph4t l3wts??<br />
<br />
I saw a level 54 /oocing yesterday in PoK, &quot;So where's the entrance of that PoTime zone? Anyone want to group there?&quot;<br />
<br />
There's plenty to do as a casual player. However, you have to make your own fun. Unless your server has public raids, nobody is going to organize the fun for you.<br />

Being in a raiding guild does not appeal to me in anyway.  I put alot of time into improving my characters.  What happens when I get to the point that I can't improve my gear without joining a raiding guild?  Does this mean that even after all the time and effort I've put into progressing my characters I will have reached the end of the game?  I certainly hope not.  I don't want top of the line gear I just want some kind of upgrades that I can work towards that don't require raiding every night of the week.<br />

<br />
That's not exactly correct. I can put in the same time as raiders can but I choose, for a variety of reasons,  to do it in smaller chunks. Up through Luclin I had a resonable expectation that, even with my smaller chunks of playtime, I could eventually gain access to &quot;end game content&quot;. I could reap the same rewards for the same amount of time devoted to the game, even if it was in 2 hour chunks a day instead of 8.<br />
<br />
PoP, and flagging raids, changed that for me and a host of other &quot;casual&quot; players. Now end game progression requires encounters that take more time than I can devote in one sitting because of design decisions made by the developers.<br />
<br />
Let me make this real clear for those of you who will read into my remarks...<br />
<br />
I don't care if end game content is designed to take 1000 hours to gain access to, I can do that  but if I can't do it in 1 -3 hour chunks then for all intents and purposes i'm paying for content I'll never see<br />
<br />
The killer is that on a few servers there are &quot;public&quot; raids. On E'ci, E'ci Public Raiders is one of the top guilds (if it were strictly speaking a guild) on the server. Raiding does not require being in an &quot;uber&quot; guild. It does however require doing more than logging in and /oocing Hey, I logged in - where's my ph4t l3wts??<br />
<br />
We have a pretty good public raiding group on my server. They're actually working on taking down RZtW. I've gotten my MB kill with them. You know what the problem is though? The raids still take more time than I can play in one sitting, on most occasions, and I know for a fact I'm not the only person playing the game with this problem.  Again, its not that we can't find 4 hours to play, we can't find 4 hours to play all at once or at the right time.<br />
<br />
There's plenty to do as a casual player. However, you have to make your own fun. Unless your server has public raids, nobody is going to organize the fun for you.<br />
<br />
There is far less to do as a lvl 65 casual than many raiders care to admit. With every AA point I gain my power level relative to the content I'm doing increases. Unless I can find a way to play 4-6 hours a day and do the raids and GoD trials I need to progress to more challenging content then I will soon be at the point where hard LDoNs are trivial but I can't access the content that I would find challenging. <br />
<br />
Not every casual player want the game handed to them on a silver platter. Most of us want what raiders want. A challenge. The opportunity to progress. Encounters that yield meaningful rewards. To do things that give us a sense of accomplishment. <br />
<br />
And right now SOE's answer to those wants is......resellable augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groovdog</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">gear[/I] I play with, in the zones I play in ... Then go ahead and put in your time like I did. <br />
<br />
If that's too much for you to handle then you don't deserve it!  :mad:<br />
<br />
My 2cp, crawl back into your hole.<br />
<br />
People like you willl ensure that this game croaks because a wide portion of it cant progress which as everyone knows is how people evaluate their playing experience (other than the social piece). Dont progress, dont like, dont pay. Simple enough?<br />
<br />
Since I cant raid now due to current play times (never get more than 2hrs straight except Sat/Sun mornings) I should see all the content beyond BoT withheld to some degree? I can do GoD because I am geared for it but people who are not (those very same casuals) will struggle in it.<br />
<br />
But guess what, I bet if I could string my 30hrs+ a week into 7pm-1am EST 6 nights a week then I could be SO UBAH JUST LIKE YOU. As far as lacking skill, I am currently 6boxing because my playtimes suck. I know 6 (well actually more than that with alts) classes intimately and can handle the complications created by running a full grp by myself. When I have raided in the recent past I am bored senseless because there is not much going on outside of certain defined roles (I am usually MA/MT because only lower guilds will let a non-hardcore participant into their raids).<br />
<br />
I do believe that raiders should have relative superiority but that the gap has widended too far to the point of making 1.5 expansions (1/2 of PoP and GoD) all but inaccessable to the majority on non-hardcore (my defintion) non-raiders. That means 50-75% (my estimate) of the people cant see 80%+ of the post 65 content. I call bullshit on that one.<br />
<br />
And yeah check out that magelo with that ubah LDoN equipment, 293 LDoN wins and counting on my chanter (warrior has like 240 or something) or about 3 months equivalent of hardcore raiding for 3 pieces, some augs, and some banked pts, how ubah is that!<br />
<br />
GD<br />
<br />
For the record : I am speaking for others as my guys are time flagged for the most part and am working GoD trials but I know the &quot;wall&quot; because my pally sits right at it (ornate/LDoN/some GoD no EP flags, i.e. screwed). Try that for a day and realize how little there is left to do in the game to progress in a meaningful way.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When someone overgeneralizes, as was done in the initial post and several others in this thread, they inevitably come off sounding like an asshole.  I'll add snobbish to the title as well, although I doubt anyone is bothered by the term. <br />
<br />
I was in a small guild for three years.  These people were my best friends.  Hell, I dated one of them and I met him through the game.  We knew everyone elses real life name, telephone numbers, children, favorite colors, etc.  When someone's epic mob spawned we'd call anyone who wasn't online up and they'd hop on to help.  The guild had around 15 people in it.  The only way to get into the guild was a full vote by everyone in the guild and once you were in, you were a complete equal, access to the web page admin, ezboard admin, officer, equal loot decision-say.  We had no leader other than the one SOE demanded we technically have.  This guild maxxed out in the Halls of Testing.  Maybe we could have done more, certainly we could have when later expansions like POP were released and AAs flowed.  But if I wanted to progress I had to leave.  <br />
<br />
And I left.  And, yay!, I progressed.  In fact, I progressed right into no longer feeling like playing.  Why?  Because the people I raid with are more like co-workers than friends.  We do our jobs, people like to say its a &quot;family&quot; raiding guild, but really we do our job, get our loot, and log off.  It's the most impersonal gaming experience I've ever had and, frankly, I'm probably in the friendliest and nicest of the high end guilds on my server.  <br />
<br />
So grats me, I've progressed.  And I've left behind everything that I think makes EQ a great game.  So I guess that gives me the right to sneer and be elitist myself, eh? Even though I don't consider raiding to be more difficult with 54 or 72 people than I did with 18.  In fact, I probably had to work harder and be more on top of my game with 18 because there was no one else to cover my ass when I fucked up. <br />
<br />
Quit pigion-holing people and you'll realize it's not as black and white as you'd like to have it.  There are a lot of people who put in long hours in this game and deserve the loot they have and deserve to see higher end content too.  No, they won't be killing elemental GoDs, but maybe exping in POE shouldn't be limited to those that put their progress priorities above their friendships.  (Oh, and if you are in Qvic and never had to compromise like I did, congratulations to you - I think you are in the serious minority).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xwraithx</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main tank in our guild has 600 wins in LDoN.  He has maxxed out all his augs, and he max buffs up to 10+.  He's got maxxed aa, 800 of them (not kidding here).<br />
I'd say that's a good amount of time invested.<br />
<br />
And we are pre-elemental, pre-ssra, just because we have at most 18 people log on per day.  We don't want to disband or go join a raiding guild.  What's left for people like us to do?<br />
<br />
Sure, we can do GoD, but Tipt is the point that we get stopped at.  Lots of us are actually flagged for vxed and tipt.  But the loot there just doesn't let you progress further than that.<br />
<br />
What can we do then?  No numbers to raid, so disband guild and join a raiding guild?  Do another 600 LDoNs for 'fun'?  Randomly recruit strangers and make the guild into a raiding guild, something that we have no desire to do?<br />
<br />
There comes a time when you can get the best you can get as a 'casual' player, and there is no more real progression.  Unless you do the uber raid thing of course.  Which sucks, because it feels like EQ forces you to do that in order to progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tooby</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">however..<br />
Im not sure this is a new phenomenon, but with mudflation it seems to me that for a very very long part of the game (as a casual) the zones you can enter (unkeyed) - even with a guild of say 30 - vill have very few drops that surpass what you can already get in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
I did start the VT key - I am the proud owner of seven shards and a orb from the Va'Dyn - I would love to get there the honest way but i sincerly doubt i ever will. Firstly because it took me 4 months to get this far, and secondly as most of my casual playing friends have even further to go. In addition when you cutting edge players broke in there - you got the cutting edge gear for your efforts - once i do Ill get mediocre gear that will serve as a stepping stone into elementals into time into god.... I thiink theres a differenence.<br />
<br />
Also these long winded key quests seem to be a pretty new thing. The old expansions have one or two zones like VP, Sleepers Tomb, VT.. most zones are open and there a worthwie (at the progression of that expansion) targets to go after. Half of PoP seem to be closed and similarly the greater chunk of GoD is pretty unaccessible if you are not already at least elemental. <br />
<br />
Basically I wonder why you feel so strongly against opening up zones that are 3 expansions old. You 9-11k unbuffed raiders really cant need them for much beyond nostalgia any more, but for a casual player they are areas which would be fun to explore. And as someone said, with LDON (and mudflation) they are hardly even needed for progression any more. Eventually no-one will go there or they will have to get revamped.<br />
<br />
(note that none of these questions are rethorical Im guessing here)<br />
<br />
Bah I ramble on..  make of it what oyu will</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think some people are missing the point.  SoE continues to generate expansions.  They have the expectation that the majority of people are going to purchase these expansions.  Yet the content they've been developing and releasing in the last several expansions is clearly not content the majority of players will play against.  In some cases, never.  In other cases not for a very long time.  The raiding playing base however gain access to this content very quickly.  And they use it just as quickly.  Now here is the real question, and read it very slowly and really think about it.<br />
<br />
Why should a person spend $30 to purchase an expansion that offers them almost nothing that they'll actually be able to get any enjoyment from?<br />
<br />
Stop and think about that.  SoE is marketing these expansions as being for everyone.  And that's a blatant marketing lie.  They're not for everyone.  They're primarily for raiders with a few extraneous doo-dads thrown in to appeal to the non-raider/casual playing base.<br />
<br />
And lets be clear here, there are not just two groups within the player base, raiders and casuals, there are three.  Raiders, non-raiders, and casuals.  Casuals play infrequently or only semi-regularly.  Non-raiders play frequently and may in fact spend huge amounts of time in the game but just don't raid for whatever reason.  And raiders are people who raid, their time commitment can be huge or moderate, depending on their guild and their desires.<br />
<br />
So the primary issue is not raiders versus casuals.  Or raiders versus non-raiders.  It's casuals and non-raiders versus SoE.  SoE has made a point of catering primarily to the raiders.  And the casuals and non-raiders are pissed that SoE is for the most part ignoring their needs as a customer base.  Raiders want new content?  Raiders want progression?  Raiders want to see new opponents and see new zones?  This is reasonable.  Because it's exactly what casuals and non-raiders want too.  SoE should not be providing these things primarily to one group and for the most part denying it to the other two groups.  And it isn't about casuals and non-raiders having to have access to every single zone that raiders do.  But it is about SoE locking 75% of an expansion behind closed doors that make it extremely difficult to nearly impossible for the two non-raiding groups to gain access.<br />
<br />
Now, raiders want to feel elite?  Raiders want to feel that their time spent raiding has special meaning within the game?  Raiders want to feel that they are reward for their playing style significantly more than other playing styles?  That's okay, most casual/non-raiders don't horribly object to that in concept.  What they do object to however is continuing to contribute finacially to the development of content that offers them almost nothing.  If expansions are going to continue to provide the majority of the content and the majority of the fun soley to raiders, then raiders can expect to be picking up a bigger share of the development costs involved.  Non-raiders and casuals won't be spending their money on useless (to them) expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many of the EP gods, PoTime, and things like Ikkinz4 and Uqua require around four hours to beat, certainly at first.<br />
<br />
The bad news, is unlike the 1-2 hour play time that is concidered optimim by most board game designers, Verant/SoE seems to design raids that take four hours. Look at VT for goodness sake 8). It's almost like it only took two hours in the original design and to make it four, they doubled the rooms and the yard trash.<br />
<br />
The four hour raid is a player lifestyle/design issue and yes, players quit because of it.<br />
<br />
But causual players do not do everything they can. The number of servers that have major public raiding is pretty darned small. Want to see ALL the content? Then you have to raid - you can't get in to see Quarm with 6 players, it can not be done.<br />
<br />
SoE is NOT required to get you flagged, assemble the 20ish players needed to clear QVic in the TWO hours it requires. When OoW comes out and everyone is more powerful at level 70, then perhaps you will be wearing QVic armor - but only if YOU make the effort to beat Uqua and Ikk4 to gain access.<br />

I'm certainly not a &quot;have&quot;. <br />
<br />
And that's fine with me, honestly. My guildmates and I have chosen to play the game the way we do. Lately we've been able to field a raid force of 12 players with an average level of 60. And you know what we raid? <br />
<br />
&lt;.... drumroll ....&gt;<br />
<br />
Kunark! Velious! Luclin!<br />
<br />
And some of it is beyond our abilities! To beat that content with the groups we have, we're going to need more LDoN gear, or more levels, or more drops from unflagged and unkeyed areas of new expansions. In short, we're EARNING our gear, and we're EARNING our progression.<br />
<br />
We don't expect to compete with raiders in the Elemental Planes and Time. We don't expect to raid in the &quot;highest&quot; parts of GoD. But we should be able to progress after our own fashion.</div></div><hr />

Hate to break this to you, but there are far, far more &quot;casual&quot; players than there are &quot;uber&quot; players.  Many of said casual players are at or very near a glass ceiling beyond which they cannot progress.  Assuming I spend the next year or so grinding LDoN missions to aug all my current gear, with occasional breaks to upgrade a few slots here and there, I'll hit about 6500hps unbuffed.  And when I've done that, yay for me, it's a little easier for me to tank the same old stuff I'm tanking now.   That doesnt appeal to alot of people, as is evidenced by the recent drop in subscriptions.  I have a pretty busy life outside this game, and just to remind you it is just that, A GAME.  Because I'm busy, I can't play more than  2-3 hours a night, and some nights I can't play at all.  The ONLY reason I haven't quit already is the fact that I really like the people in my guild, and the friends I've made online.  Be that as it may, if SoE doesn't pull their heads out of their collective asses and provide the less hardcore players some progression path to at least get close to the level of gear raiders can attain and maybe see some of the same content you've seen, there's not going to be anything left but &quot;hardcore raiders&quot;.  Since you and those like you make up a very small percentage of the playerbase, have fun playing on the 2 servers sony'll be able to keep running for you.  Slapfighting with all the other &quot;ubers&quot; over the cutting edge content should be a blast.</div></div><hr />

Much of the content I dragged myself through can be skipped. Players don't need to do VT/Ser/Ssra or NToV. They can get LDoN armor, Class Diety armor, and later farm Ornate molds.<br />
<br />
Guess what? That whole EP, PoTime flagging process and all those difficult raids needed to get ot PoTime? That can be skipped too.<br />
<br />
Do Sewers, Tipt, and Vxed, some of the Ikky one-group trials, get your Ormate molds and some augmenets, wait for level 70 and either:<br />
<br />
A. Do public Ikkinz4 and Uqua raids until you make it into QVic OR<br />
<br />
B. See if OoW lets you skip that content as well.<br />
<br />
There is a casual player path, but it does contain raiding. Huge amounts of timesink content CAN be skipped, but there are some gaps and glass cielings. This can only be made up by public raids or getting a guild to allow you to tag along in backflagging.<br />
<br />
SoE could be more thoughtful about this and I think raids should be targeted at two hours and not four. BUT, if you take a look at the accomplishments of E'ci Public Radiers, it's pretty clear casual players or those who are members of non-uber guilds CAN progress.<br />
<br />
A player CAN just log in and play the game. The entire raid thing can be ignored. But, players are not likely to see raid content if that is what they do.<br />

SoE is marketing these expansions as being for everyone. And that's a blatant marketing lie. They're not for everyone. They're primarily for raiders with a few extraneous doo-dads thrown in to appeal to the non-raider/casual playing base.<br />
Very true of GoD, I think the marketing was a bit misleading however most people knew this was an expansion for raiders.  For PoP this was also true though to a smaller degree.  There are 7 zones in PoP that require raids to enter (time, 4x elemental planes, SRT and earth b), the rest can be accessed via key quests so the bulk of the expansion is available to casual players.<br />
<br />
I think SoE was a bit short sighted when PoP was released, however I remember PoP being marketed as an expansion for raiders.  Infact I seem to remember at the time there was almost an expectation that if you wanted to raid you would level to 65 and play in PoP, if you were casual you would stay level 60.  It was this perception that caused them to blunder with LoY in producing content for up to lvl 60's while most of their player base were in PoP trying to grind to 65 as fast as they could.<br />
<br />
LDoN and LoY were expansions designed for the casual player, sure LDoN had some raiding content, but its certainly not required for progression and guilds who weren't well and truely finished with Plan of Time farming when GoD came out will probably never seriously work on LDoN raids.<br />
<br />
So for all the &quot;casual&quot; players upset about GoD catering to raiders consider that the previous 2 expansions really catered to casual players.  When LoY was released the same arguement was coming from the other direction - &quot;why should I have to pay 30 bucks for all this content I don't want to get the guild management tool and armour dyes&quot;.<br />
<br />
~*'`'*~.,_,.~*'`'*~.,_,.~*'`'*~.,_,.~*'`'*~.,_,.~<br />
<br />
The social vs raider debate has been raging on &quot;The Runes&quot; enchanter board for a few weeks now and having read a couple of 10+ page threads I'd like to share my opinion on it.  <br />
<br />
The 1st arguement is always one of &quot;We pay the same fee we want access to the same zones&quot; - a little generalised, most people compare with SoL or SoV or RoK in that there was one locked zone (VT/ST/VP) and the rest of the expansion wasnt locked out for them, so as such they arent asking for PoTime access, but they think the elemental planes should be available.<br />
<br />
The next arguement is that its unfair that raiders have access to the best gear and the best XP spots aswell, and that you shouldnt have to raid to be able to use those zones to farm trade skill bits etc.<br />
<br />
As the arguements go on though it starts that casuals want the same XP spots as raiders (fair enough), they want access to farm the same tradeskill components as raiders (also fair enough), and they want the same gear as raiders - heres the problem.<br />
<br />
The elemental planes are RAID ZONES.  The reason they are successful as XP spots is because there is 1-3 groups in each plane max.  Theres nothing like BoT where you can have 2-3 groups per wing and another group at bees while a pickup raiding crew takes on the towers and a guild takes on agnar. (ok that'd crash the zone, but it illustrates the diversity of BoT).  Even Plane of Valor supports more players XPing with camps at inner and outer caves, east and west of the castle, AD's lair etc - you can get 30ish people XPing in Valor quite happily, BoT would fit close to 50 XPers without too many heads banging.<br />
<br />
Plane of Earth - the easiest elemental plane to XP in, there a quite a few good spots to sit and XP, but only 1 or 2 of these wont interfere with a raids that can go on in there.  Imagine trying to spawn the arbitor of earth and having a group camping at zone in, a group camping inside the dust ring castle who don't want to move, another camping by the mud castle etc.  <br />
<br />
Plane of Fire - the other great XP zone, before the 1st castle the XP sucks, people go there for tradeskill drops and the odd single groupable named but the XP is worse than PoV,  The 1st castle is pretty decent for XP, but also one of the spots that raids set up for 1st castle named, the birds and 2nd field named.  The 2nd castle is the best XP spot in the elementals for most players, can be kept clear by a couple of kiters or a group, also the spot where raids set up for 2nd castle named an the fennin script - someone in my guild once got a tell from a necro new to the elementals saying &quot;hi, can you guys come do fennin? GoD is in the way of my kiting&quot;.  2nd field is also great XP but without great gear its hard for a group to keep up.  So PoFire supports at best 3 XP groups 2 of which sit where raiding guilds will want to set up.<br />
<br />
Plane of Water apparently has a great XP spot or 2.  Just like Kedge keep has some great XP spots.  Nobody goes there tho.<br />
<br />
Plane of Air might have some great XP spots but since you need a raid or some mad skills just to get past the 1st island though, no one goes there either.<br />
<br />
For the same reason tactics wasnt opened up when they removed the flags from BoT, the elemental planes are not XP zones, they are RAID zones.  The only reason elemental guilded players get such great XP there is because non-ele flagged people cant go there which means there is room for a couple of groups to XP.  Also only being available to elemental flagged players means these players (call them raiders) will appreciate that when a guild leader asks them to shift camp because he wants to set his 70odd raiders up there then they will appreciate that and move (being raiders themselves).<br />
<br />
As for the loot, most elemental loot droppers take 30 or more elementally geared players to kill.  When you 1st get there in your LDoN gear you're going to need more so if you think that casual players having access to elemental zones means casual players will get elemental molds etc then you are kidding yourself.  If you arent a part of a guild that can kill the flag mobs then you arent a part of a guild that can get elemental loot.  If you are a part of a pickup raid crew that can kill those mobs then perservere cos that pickup crew can get you into the elementals and then you can kill those mobs as a flagged raider (just like everyone else who got there.)<br />
<br />

<br />
Excuse the length of this post but theres one more thing I wanted to bring up...<br />
<br />
Congrats to my previous guild, they will know who they are.<br />
<br />
This is a guild who raids 2 nights a week, has a non compulsory raid attendance policy, accepts members at pretty much any level, has killed emp in Ssra, cleared VT and killed RZtW a couple of days ago and is now in the elementals, they arent the 1st &quot;social&quot; guild to get to the elemental planes either - they're the 11th elemental guild on Tribunal, the 3rd that considers itself a &quot;social&quot; guild.<br />
<br />
What this shows is:<br />
<br />
If you don't want to be told when to raid and when to piss etc, you can still get to the elemental planes.  If you want to be part of a &quot;family guild&quot; then you can be and still get to the elemental planes.  If you can only raid for 3 hours a night at 3 in the morning but you still put in 20+ hours a week, you can still get to the elemental planes - there are guilds doing this in every time zone.<br />
<br />
But if you are sitting there going waaa waaa waaa I want to see the elemental planes but I dont want to raid to do it you are kidding yourself.  They are zones designed for raiding and you will need to raid to see them, and you will need to raid to get any real benefit out of them aswell.  Its like complaining about never getting to sit on the top of a mountain but you dont want to have to walk up hill.</div></div><hr />

What an incredibly dumb elitist thing to say. I'm in a Time/Qvic guild at the moment (although not yet flagged for Qvic myself), but to say that these people don't deserve better gear etc than what is available is moronic. <br />
<br />
Everyone deserves the opportunity to see 99% of this game, we all pay the same amount. By the very fact that you put in more time, you will see more rewards. OK, there has to be a reason to choose to raid, so the gear should be superior. But at the moment, the gap between what the raiders can get, and the casuals can get is astonishing. 200hp+ gear, when the comparison for the casuals would be 50-100hp+ gear *if* they are lucky. <br />
<br />
Then look at casters. Most of the focus effects that are on the raid loot will never be seen by a casual. They will never get close to the same amount of mana (7k+ mana is fairly standard for time based people, casuals are happy to get 4k+). <br />
<br />
Lastly, how would you feel, if I said to you, your character will *never* get more than a 10-20hp/mana upgrade on any item, and only if you spend 40+hours to get that. Once you've got those upgrades, that's it. Start an alt, because there is nothing left for you to do but xp. That's what my casual friends face. The very fact that soon, there will be nothing constructive for them to do on their characters, unless they start raiding, which they cant do. I'm guessing you'd squeal, cry, whine, and probably click cancel on that account.<br />

Since that time, I've done a LOT of exping int he various zones to see if it was reasonable to say that it's possible to progress without the benefit of a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to say that the answer is a resounding yes.  It's indeed possible to progress quite nicely in terms of gear in GoD with either a &quot;casual&quot; type guild or even guildless.   Riwwi is a GOLDMINE of exp/loot, as is Ferubi and Qinimi.     The Sewers are for the most part not difficult at all (similar to a LDoN easy until the end, then similar to an LDoN hard).     <br />
<br />
Vxed is not &quot;off limits&quot; and the only real struggle for lower geared warriors at the moment is Jhiru, who CAN be passed if you get a little crazy.

<br />
You may be right Frodlin.  But I know for a fact that you have AC and HP far beyond that which I could ever hope to achieve.  Exping in those zones is probably a moderately difficult to trivial task for you.  For my character it would be exceedingly difficult.  I'd probably have to put six months into just acquiring AAs and LDoN loots before it being a reasonable expectation on my part.  And by now I'm just not willing to continue that kind of time investment into a game where I feel the returns aren't worth it.  It feels too much like a waste of my time.  And other people trying to tell me that it isn't, doesn't change that feeling.  SoE screwed the pooch big time with GoD.  I'm done giving them second chances, they've used them all up.</div></div><hr />

I think that was a great idea, as a matter of fact I enjoyed a lot GoD till I beat Ikkinz single group 3. I was kinda disapointed when I realised that was it, no more 1 group events in this expansion. (and even disgusted by the *very* bugged ikkinz raids and *strangely* tuned uqua ...)<br />
Instead of doing a LDoN2 for single group player, they should make an expansion this way with just single group content / flags that would allow hardcore non-raiders to get better stuff than casual players. And would also please hardcore raiders with decently challenging one group content to do outside guilds event.<br />
There is a 'cost' at playing with more players, it's much more complicated, and therefore should be rewarded adequatly. But this should not mean a guild of casual brainless zerglings should be allowed to get better reward than a single group of hardcore skilled players, which is the case atm (casual players guild are making it to time, the best stuff you can get with a single group are KT / Ikkinz and LDoN, it's very wrong.)</div></div><hr />

Which is the exact same shit people were saying at the end of Luclin. Understand that mudflation next expansion is going to be pretty significant, because level 70 LDoN normal mobs hit for 998 - that's just how LDoN works, they'd have to revamp the architecture ldon instances are based on to change that without nerfing level 65 hard - and level 70 patch heals cost 750 mana a shot. Hell, you'll get about an extra thousand hp from buffs alone.<br />
<br />
Gates is awesome for those looking for a challenge. It may not offer casuals the mudflation that other expansions have, which I'm not going to blame them for or say casual players are wrong, but I do know one thing: There is no single group content anywhere that is even close to as difficult or complex as Kod'Taz+ raids, at least from a cleric standpoint. Surviving a bomber deathtouch was the funniest thing I've ever seen in this game, ever.</div></div><hr />

There are ways for us to progress without a doubt, however it is wrong to lock people from exp zones because they cannot kill a raid mob. Make alternate quest like the one for tactics. As a guild we are working on the BoT flag now. Several of us have the key now. These mobs are alot harder than normal giants in BoT what is the logic in this ?

I hate to say it, but you sound a lot like those Knights that were pretty happy to see Defensive turned off in Tipt and Ikky - if I can't have something, well good - glad you got screwed.<br />
<br />
Before I destroyed a rotator cuff, I skied the 3 diamond trails on most of the East Coast &quot;mountains&quot;. This didn't bar me from the bunny slopes. In fact, some of the really long intermediate slopes were a lot of fun (at least on acrobatic skies going backwards half the time).<br />
<br />
...<br />
BB<br />
<br />
 The problem is, BB, is that when you skate down the bunny slopes, they don't disappear for a week at a time. Nor can you time to the second the moment the bunny slopes will reappear and ski them again before anyone else simply because it's faster for you to go up the mountain in your supercharged chairlift then the guy who has to walk it. If EQ was like bunny slopes, there probably wouldn't BE any valid complaints.<br />
<br />
 All I'm saying at base is that progression should be a concious decision to leave the old behind when you go after the new. Yes, when you were in kindergarten, playing in the sandbox was fun, and there were times when you couldn't play because someone else had gotten there first. Understood. The problem in EQ terms is that many of the sandboxes are being sat in by 10th graders who want to 'relax' or farm for Ebay or farm for twinks, and it distorts hell out of progression. I'm sure you'd agree that Velious and Luclin racing was hard enough with guilds of similar gear and levels, it's frigging impossible when you're racing bored Time+++ers and/or farming Ebayer Time+++ers. I don't mind hard, but impossible is not worth my time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No doubt. But what's the point of this. I dont thinkcasuals are asking to fast forward to the gear of the raiders. Well at least im not. <br />
What i think would be fair however is to reduce the time required to enter previous expansions. People broke into VT back in Luclin, it was after a massive time sink of a quest -But as a reward they got access to the best gear in the game.<br />
<br />
Would you disagree with reducing the amount of time required for the key quest to tailor it more to casuals, now that the gear is no longer as good? Not reducing the difficulty f the encounters, but dramatically upping the drop/spawn rates on key quest components. Ie for VT the drop rates on shards and on the components for ssra bane weapons would make this quest much more feasible for casual guilds.</div></div><hr />

Alot of the post time players are farming stuff after every patch etc.  On Luclin this happens with alot of the BoT  Tower bosses. My guild is not able to take these out so it does not effect me. However alot of the guilds that can have no shot at them because the top guild on the server can take a couple groups and wipe them out for drops they have no intention of using just selling it. They have the right to do this. There are no rules anywhere that says a post time guild cannot farm named in BoT. But these are the same people saying no you can't play in our sandbox and while we are at it we are gonna mess yours up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I have absolutely no problem with the top zones in EQ remaining inaccessible to non-raiders. VT would be a waste of time for ANYONE that didn't have at least 3-4 hours straight of play time... and that's just for the minis or one of the first named. Time should be off limits; there's no reason for a non-raider to be there. I don't want them to spend time revamping the previous endgames for every expansion as WELL as the progression to get there. <br />
<br />
  What I do think should happen is that they should lower the spawn timer on some of the older mobs down from 7 days to more like 3 days or better yet, instance them. EPs should have a difficult, time consuming quest to grant FULL flagged access; so should Sol Ro. Make it similar in relative difficulty to BoT keys. This has the double effect of cutting down on guild backflagging and allowing a possible progression for people without raiding. DISCLAIMER: YOU WILL NOT GET EP MOLDS WITHOUT A RAID.<br />
<br />
  I haven't done enough GoD to really judge it at all. From what I've heard, I'd much rather they just improved travel within it, and people would be much more inclined to adventure and risk. PoP GYs spoiled folks.</div></div><hr />

I remember some really nasty CR trips. Some fondly some not so fondly hehe. We were in Hate a couple weeks ago and were hitting some of the named that were even cons. Some of these have decent drops btw, and I was actually worried about the CR if our group wiped because of adds. That was the first time in along time I had that feeling at it was really nice.</div></div><hr />

I don't really think travel throughout Gates of Discord needs changing in any way at this point...the runs are ridiculously easy as is.  See invis mobs are extremely rare, and magi get you straight to Natimbi, which is a two minute run to Qinimi, which is a thirty second run to Riwwi/Barindu/Ferubi.<br />

From your perspective everything is better for casuals than it was in Kunark, therefore casuals have no room to complain.  But the point isn't that casuals have better gear, abilities, and so forth then they did in Kunark, rather it's that SoE is catering to a very small segment of the player base, telling everyone else to screw off, and those being catered to defend it.<br />
<br />
The content is harder.  The gear progression hasn't really kept up, unless you've raided.  People talk about walking into GoD trial zones as if it's something everyone can do and should do.  Yet the threads I've read are telling Warriors to have something like 7-8k unbuffed HP to expect to do well.  Do you know how many non-raiding Warriors actually have 7-8k unbuffed HP?  Few, very freaking few.<br />
<br />
Frankly, these days EQ as a game, played for enjoyment, sucks arse unless you happen to enjoy playing in a very specific way that is really the &quot;only&quot; method well supported by the expansions.<br />
<br />
People aren't enjoying the game.  People are getting tired of paying money for a game they're not enjoying.  And they're telling the company they're doing business with that the company better get its act together or they're taking their money elsewhere, and all you can do is disparge and belittle them.  Well buddy boy, you don't pay for their subscriptions every month, they do.  And if they want to tell SOE to take their new expansions and shove them where the sun don't shine, there is nothing you have to say about it.<br />
<br />
Money talks, bullshit walks.  If the game continues the way it has and in six months subscriptions haven't fallen substantially I'll be exceedingly surprised.</div></div><hr />

Casual players/raiders will see the end game of GoD, but not until they finish the content they have in front of them first.  Same complaint every expansion, but in the end, casual always gets there eventually.</div></div><hr />

However, if you're bitching about &quot;non raiders&quot; whining, then you're 100% fucking wrong, and always will be, you fucking arrogant cockholes.<br />
<br />
How the fuck would you like it, if your raiding guild was permanently cockblocked into only doing LDoN for the rest of your days because some asshole was 6 boxing the plane of Time?  Sounds ridiculous huh?  Except that's what fucking happens to us ALL THE GODDAMNED TIME.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do LDoN&quot; you say.  Really..what about all the content that I SHOULD be doing instead of that?  What about Dozekar, who's always fucking dead...killed by people in elemental + guilds just to MQ tears for fucking alts?  What about the BoT bosses, camped by a single dude with a good computer, EQ windows, and 4 time geared characters?  Hell, you know what, near the end of my days, I couldn't even find Talendor up because some goddamned 10khp warrior duoed him with his fucking cleric bot earlier to add the Cloak of Flames to the fucking heap.<br />
<br />
You guys fucking suck shit, you'll always suck shit, you're fucking bottom feeders, and no matter how much raid content you get, you'll always be bottom feeders because you don't raid 24/7 either.  You raid until 9pm, the early people go to bed, and then you assholes proceed to scatter and kill every fucking mob that's up whether you need it or not.  JUST TRY to find a ST key holder up on any regular server nowadays.  Just try to find any small groupable mob up anywhere.  It doesn't fucking happen.  Your solution for us? &quot;just do LDoN.&quot;  How about you just do LDoN instead of killing Zland for the 47th time so you can get a primal for your level 51 rogue you piece of shit?<br />
<br />
Oh, I understand, the game is boring for you too, you're just too proud to admit it, and rather than admit fault for causing problems for everyone else who hasn't progressed as far as you can, you just come here and tell us to grow up and join a raiding guild.  Well fuck you.  I'm not gonna take your shit anymore, and I'm not gonna be told to do LDoN just because 5 expansions worth of content are single grouped in a day by you fuckwads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and its not like you &quot;raiders&quot; are actually enjoying the current state of affairs either. the amount of time equipped players who have quit the game over the last few months is astounding. and it isnt all because of incapable machines either. many have quit because they cannot stand the thought of having to go through another round of backflagging. but these are the same people who say that flagging should not be discontinued even in content they have long since surpassed. so instead they offer the lame suggestion of allowing a flagged GUILD to invite along other guildies who have not been flagged as long as a majority of the guild and the officers are all flagged. what a convenient way to keep us behind the locked flagging doors without you having to pay the same price to stay on the other side! admit it you hate the flagging as much as we do. but you do it anyway because if you do you can get gear and aa very EASILY and then distance yourself by thousands of hitpoints from those who have done as much work as you but without the benefit of a guild that will DISBAND you if you miss more than a HANDFUL of raids NO EXCUSES accepted including A JOB.<br />
<br />
and you dont choose your friends if you want the best gear. your guild chooses them for you. do you like this arrangement?<br />
<br />
you dont play when you want to. you play when you are told to. do you like this arrangement?<br />
<br />
if your guild falls apart because a third of them hated the current state so much they quit the game and the rest disbanded because they couldnt stomach the thought of backflagging you are now left out in the cold. do you like this arrangement?<br />
<br />
unless you are puller or sa your skill level counts for nothing. you could go afk on a boss encounter and few if any people would EVEN NOTICE. you can do the entire trash cleaning while polishing your nails watching tv or eating dinner and no one would notice. do you like this arrangement? are you not the least bit indignant that soe has dumbed down the game this much for you? and if you are especially talented does it not bother you that no one will be able to tell because you are a cog in the machinery of a 72 man raid?<br />
<br />
but you tolerate it. you put up with it and you raise holy heck if anyone dare even suggest the system be returned to its glory days of primarily 6-man groups and raiding as an aside. and why? because you like having 12k hp when others have 8k. the reward is great for submission to a treadmill of raiding but the process is horrifying. i honestly believe the root cause of so many high ends quitting the game is not buggy content and not raid incapable computers. its that the fun of the game has been replaced by a job that never ends. and mobs falling through walls and wiping the raid was nothing but a last straw for people who already learned to hate the game.<br />
<br />
there is a solution you know. its to open content to all who are battle-fit to handle it. then you wont have to be a slave to your guild to be able to progress. you like us can play for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">do you want to know why i never joined a raiding guild? let me tell you the story of rysingsun. rys is my druid. as ive said before my warrior's name is aerionn but rys is my log on name because i dont want to have accounts and passwords scattered all over the web.<br />
<br />
anyway rys is only level 63 even now with about 170aa. he can get an aa in maidens eye almost as fast as my warrior can in halls of honor. and the exp per kill in luclin cannot compete with pop. rys has learned the art of never ever EVER having a charmed pet killed so he can afford to give said pet the finest in pet usuable gear. he also knows how to quad kite 10 mobs while adds are everywhere without that same pet dying or even having his haste buff drop. he can SOLO an average of one mob every 60 seconds for 3 hours straight and get an aa and 8k in bazaar loot. and it would be faster still if he didnt clear such a wide spawn area that he spends so much time looking for mobs he isnt able to med more than a quarter of the time. even in hoh my warrior gets only an aa every 2 hours AFTER the work of /lfg with little loot to speak of and that at level 65 with a 100 percent grouping bonus.<br />
<br />
he and my girfriend's druid have duod many named mobs. weve killed the savant in maiden about 10 times and given away lucid shards to groups who could not take him down. i would wager anyone that i could solo the savant by now in spite of the difficulty in pulling him without getting 10 adds. we have duod the dralknr in umbral who drops those bracers even though he summons and is unrootable and unsnarable and hits a DRUID for almost 300 a pop. ive soloed a number of dungeon corpse recoveries for friends. i remember running from freeport to the undead camp in overthere on the dock at level 16 naked without sow or any other buff to get my corpse and then all the way back. at level 60 i could solo every part of my epic save 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
some of you can do these things too. but i bet you didnt learn these skills from your raid guilds did you?<br />
<br />
and thats the whole point of this post. raid guilds dont teach these skills. they teach &quot;stand up cast and sit back down&quot;. and if you are a warrior they teach &quot;stand up hit autoattack and every once in a while adjust your position to stay within melee range.&quot;<br />
<br />
and this is the system you are actively campaigning to keep in place because you consider it the superior system.<br />

eq has degenerated a long way. so have your expectations.</div></div><hr />

there are many people who go out of their way to fuck over the non-raiders (we are not even really non-raider, we just stay out of the hive guilds, we are not your fucking worker bee's)<br />

I'm not in a guild and I dont raid for the simple fact that it doesnt appeal to me.  I prefer to play EQ with a small group of friends that I live nearby and we challenge ourselves with whatever 6 man content we can get our hands on (6 toons anyway, a couple of us two box).<br />
<br />
I believe we do damn well considering our situations and gear.  We are currently working towards getting Kod flagged, have beaten all but Tipt trial so far.  It's been amusing, but the gear available to us isnt keeping up with the difficulty of the mobs.  You have to be guilded and &quot;raid&quot; to get that kind of gear I guess.  LDoNs helped our gear a lot, but if I never seen another one it will be too soon.   I have lots of AA's, but my gear progression path isnt keeping up with the game difficulty and things will begin to stagnate very quickly.<br />
<br />
Do I piss and moan that we cant access many of the PoP zones because none of us have any flags at all?  Sometimes.  Do I cry that we cant enter a ton of GoD zones?  Sometimes, but I know we dont stand a snowballs chance in some.  I accepted that this game is nearly 100%  designed for raid content and have been patiently waiting for &quot;something better&quot; to come along.<br />
<br />
Having said that though, I agree with many of the previous posters that it is freaking HARD to find targets for our group to challenge themselves on because of time+ geared people bottom feeding everything out of existance.<br />
<br />
Here is a nice thought:  How about making a few zones designed for the non raiders that you cannot zone into BECAUSE YOU HAVE certain flags, not because you DONT have them.  Have EP access?  Nope, cant zone in.  That would keep out the farmers, that would enable Sony to design the zone so it wont be a slaughterhouse for people with lesser gear.   It would allow Sony to balance the mobs more realistically, instead of always having to balance them versus a Time+ geared group.  Would that idea fly?  Hell no, too many people would cry foul.  But it's ok that I'm not allowed to xp in fire or earth?  Thought so.<br />
<br />
Hehe how about Sony drasically lowers the monthly subscription rate, and as you progress further into the game, getting more flags and access to more zones, your subscription rate goes up.  Nah, too logical.</div></div><hr />

Now, if Killington was a 100 foot high bunny slope, nobody would come to it at all and it wouldn't exist. However, it's got enough expert, interrmediate, and beginner slopes to accomodate a variety of customers at varing progression levels.

<br />
True, I ski very often and given my acceptance of the process one must follow to improve as a skier, I get to ski parts of Killington you might only see on postcards.<br />

Buying that lift ticket does not mean that you can ski the most difficult trails. Neither does only skiing the intermediate slope for four years.

SoE, if it wants to keep you as a customer needs to provide you with content that will keep you paying. It however is under no obligation to remove the bolders, widen the path, and groom the slope on the Expert trails and make them Intermediate so you can ski them. It also has an obligation to keep you off the expert trails so you don't ruin my fun if you in fact can't handle them.<br />

Since that time, I've done a LOT of exping int he various zones to see if it was reasonable to say that it's possible to progress without the benefit of a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to say that the answer is a resounding yes.  It's indeed possible to progress quite nicely in terms of gear in GoD with either a &quot;casual&quot; type guild or even guildless.   Riwwi is a GOLDMINE of exp/loot, as is Ferubi and Qinimi.     The Sewers are for the most part not difficult at all (similar to a LDoN easy until the end, then similar to an LDoN hard).     <br />
<br />
Vxed is not &quot;off limits&quot; and the only real struggle for lower geared warriors at the moment is Jhiru, who CAN be passed if you get a little crazy.    Make some friends, heck send some high end warrior a tell asking if he'll help you get through tipt, I know I would and do when someone asks me unless I'm real busy.<br />
<br />
I dont disagree with the xp comments, but I beg to differ on the loot. I have routinely done a search of Allak. to see if there are any upgrades available to me (actually my pally more who is LDoN/bazaar/ornate geared but also for my weak warrior parts since I cant raid now) in a single grp format in GoD. I have yet to consistently find an upgrade in lower end GoD that beats what is available with a 1492 fully auged LDoN part.<br />
<br />
As far as the mystical social or public raiding guild that is EP or better, guess what guys, they exist on only a handful of servers. With 40+ servers that leaves a bunch of us out of luck (I would argue most), especially those of us who cant raid because of time stretch not time spent.<br />

<br />
and what would you think if theese olympic champions, that can ski on the hardest slopes, start to go on average slopes with funny clothes and making nice movement/jump/figures/... all attached together with ropes.  Sure it would be nice to watch it but after a while you would start to says that's enougth and that they are monopolizing underskilled slopes for their fun and that they prevent you in using them in order to have fun and try to progress.<br />
I agree with you that flags shouldn't be remove to keep undergeared people out of uberzone in order not to mess uberguilds' fights. But the oposite should be take care either, prevent them to mess underguilds/pick-up fights and farme non-raider mobs.<br />
look : RoK, SoV, SoL, LoY, LDoN, PoP, GoD. do you think it's normal that end PoP/GoD people (EP-flaged+, Qvic+) are still farming AoW and VT (between 2 and 5 expension ago depending how we count). and now that some old planes and  VP are retuned to EP content it remove even more zones for the other people that was progressing behind.<br />
<br />
the gap between ornate/LDoN/bazard gears and raex/PoT  is in Seru/VT for armors and ssraa for weapons, (according we don't count Boss that give access to EP, and Inkinz4+ content). So if uberpoeple farm them to gear at max them and new guild member, then the following guilds are bloked in their progression if they don't have enouth recruits to face strong encounters with undergear toons (but a zerg force).</div></div><hr />

Woot one, I have heard mention of about 4 total of all the servers... I know my server has tried and I know one guild that tried social and collapsed when part wanted to go hardcore.<br />
<br />
And the sad thing is farmers arent usually farming to outfit twinks (which I could somewhat tolerate) but rather farming pp to sell on PA/IGE/etc (those of you who say people Ebay know little of how this really works, Ebay doesnt allow intellectual property sales of SOE stuff and polices it somewhat often). Having spent a year in DAOC, the same thing happens with high-end players but there are easily enough spots to farm cash loot to achieve the same effect without cockblocking people<br />
<br />
And the fact that EP is supposedly raid zone basically validates all of our points, ie. SOE is ignoring the non hardcore-raider. Basically you are saying that over 1/2 of PoP is of no use to non hardcore-raiders. And now of course we can add VP to the list of areas that is less accessible to the masses then before.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is I see more high-end people leaving than low-end (or maybe they are more visible) so its clear that the uber raiders arent happy either (I expect most will leave to at least try WoW unless they want to remain to rule the trash-heap).<br />

It pisses me off the more I see it, I wish sony made ornate super common for a month, because the truth of it is the yantis folks keep extra cash stored in ornate, this way even if ornate goes from 100k to 300k, their &quot;stock&quot; value keeps up with inflation.<br />

As far as the mystical social or public raiding guild that is EP or better, guess what guys, they exist on only a handful of servers. With 40+ servers that leaves a bunch of us out of luck (I would argue most), especially those of us who cant raid because of time stretch not time spent.<br />

 &quot;I'm real busy right now, so gimme a couple of days and I'll come back and rip this up one side and down the other. You're so wrong it's not even funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
Look, folks, the first post in this thread is close to being trollish. I'd say it is trollish, except there are a number of people who think as the poster thinks, just as there are a number of people who want top gear without having to sweat for it.<br />
I don't have a firm grip on how most time-intensive raiding players feel, but I suspect (hope, even) that they fall in some sort of median around Battleblade's posts. Likewise, I'd hope that most sensible casual players know that if they play less and/or play in shorter blocks and/or in smaller guilds, they aren't going to have access to cutting edge content/drops.<br />
<br />
Arguments that casuals have it better than ever gear wise are lame, though. It's an excellent example of a statement which is simultaneously true and without substantial meaning: once upon a time, top players wore bronze and raided Vox. <br />
<br />
My guild is a very small guild; most of us have kids and jobs in real life. If 12 of us are on at once, that's a lot of people. So, you can judge where we are in progression and how much content we'll simply never see. Yet, my guild predates EQ. We've been around a while, most longer than I have. I have met a few non-guildmates who were as good at playing as people in my guild given similar levels; these players were usually alts of high-level guild officers. So arguments that casual players do not raid because they don't have the skill to be in a raiding guild are not impressive to me. <br />
<br />
Some casual players blow, sure. And some raiding warriors know little more about the game than /assist and where they stand in their guild's looting system, sure. Again, these statements are true but without substantial meaning.<br />
<br />
Before there were shared bank slots, fairly often people in my guild would be approached by strangers who would ask us to hold stuff for them so they could move the stuff to a different character. We got asked because of our guild tag. Arguments that casual players are not in raiding guilds because we're poorly socialized or can't get along with people are not especially convincing to me.<br />
<br />
Now I've told you what issues are not important, here's one that is: SONY is under a certain kind of pressure that will get more pronounced over time. The pressure is this: the longer the game exists, the greater the &quot;spread&quot; in the advancement among characters/players, even characters who have put in a good deal of time. SONY has to have something for cutting edge people to do, and those zones/mobs have to take the top guilds some time to work through--at least enough time that developers can come up with the next thing. That's why flaging was thought up in the first place.<br />
But eventually (and this possibly happened as early as PoP) keeping cutting edge folks busy will require content so difficult/time consuming that some other folks will likely never get there.<br />
At that point, SONY has to start supporting at least two games--stuff for the strong guilds to do, and stuff for the &quot;casuals&quot; to do: and you get a bifurcation in expansions so that some are GoD/top-end and some are LDoN/casual. The problem is, of course, that unless SONY is clever (or tricky), casuals will see less and less reason to buy the GoD-type expansions, and raiders will see less and less utility in LDoN/casual expansions. Suddenly, SONY risks having to produce twice as many expansions (with twice the development and production costs and risks) to service the same population of customers.<br />
Telling casual players that they should expect to see smaller and smaller percentages of some expansions (even after those expansions are &quot;old&quot;) is basically an argument that casuals shouldn't buy the new expansions, which is basically an argument that SONY's revenue/cost ratio should go down, which is basically an argument that SONY should have fewer resources for developing new content, which is basically an argument that SONY should produce new content for raiders at a slower rate or with less careful design or with inadequate testing before an expansion goes live.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness the inadequate testing thing hasn't happened yet! But be careful what you ask for.<br />

The truth is that was marketing speak for, the content will keep changing because we have to fix all the shit we busted with the latest expantion, and the new quests you get will be clicking yes or no on the pre-order pop up for the next expantion<br />

<br />
Thank you for clearing that up for me you elitist fucksticks.<br />
<br />
For the more reasonable among you, its not solely about loot, its not solely about exp, its not solely about access to the very end zones on 30 minutes a day.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have lots of room for growth for my warrior. I just recently broke 5K hps unbuffed (and still remember when that would have been a big deal :) ) . But I can safely tell you that I can already feel the content softcap looming overhead.  I've already reached the point where if I only have an hour to play, unless I know I'm logging in to a premade LDoN group, there is nothing I can do to advance my warrior except farm green mobs for tradeskill drops to sell in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I do LDoNs as often as I can but my threshold for monotony is much much higher than the people I normally group with. Its not fair of me to insist we do LDoNs most of the time even if it is the single best upgrade path for me at the moment. On top of that suggesting people only do LDoN for gear upgrades is the same as suggesting to people that they do the same old exp treadmill zones to get to lvl 60 or 65.<br />
<br />
There are serious issues for the non-raiders (if you want to call us that instead of casuals). When the majority of progression content is geared around raiding but the majority of the player base is casual or non-raiders then the developers are designing their own player base out of the game.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% opposed to raid content by the way. Raids are fun from time to time. What I'm opposed to is being forced to raid. Its true that there are quests that will get me access to some PoP zones but those quests flag me for those zones for exp only. If I want to actually get into the elemental planes some day I still have to go back and get the raid flags since those are the only ones that count for progression.<br />
<br />
Its also unrealistic for a raider to say &quot;oh, that raid should only take 4 hours&quot; or &quot;You should be able to kill XYZ in two hours or less&quot;. You are projecting your well-oiled raid machine standards onto groups of people who don't always group together, don't have the latest strats from the web, don't have the same level of gear as you and often can't stay for a second or third attempt if the first couple of tries end in a wipe.<br />
<br />
Suggesting we skip content isn't the answer either. Skipping content is what causes the general belief that the player base is less skilled on average than it used to be. I might be able to take two groups to NToV and do something that used to take a 40 person raid thanks to mudflation but unless I and my two groups learn the different tactics needed for pulling, breaking, killing specific npcs or what have you then all our gear hasn't gotten us anything but better stats. <br />
<br />
What I want to know, and nobody can explain to me yet, is why raiders think its necessary for every raid to require so much time? What is wrong with thinking its a reasonable expectation to have raid encounters designed to be accomplished in shorter amounts of time? Designing raids around longer and longer periods of time is self-defeating. Eventually even the raiders will run out of time since it is a finite resource. <br />
<br />
Time spent does not have to mean the same thing as encounter difficulty. It might be a factor but it shouldn't always be the factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of at least 4 guilds from time and ep's on my server who have people with very low playtime.A lot of our guys show up on their mains mostly only to raid and do that from 0 - 10 hours a week.They fill their slots albeit at a slower pace than people who play more.<br />
<br />
When I leveled up on Stromm there was almost nothing worthwhile in the bazaar;no weapons with a decent ratio(I quested and dropped mine ...still used a 8/24 mainhander at 50 for example),no armor besides ringmail,expensive at the time regular plate and so on.I wore crafted and banded in PON and mixed in some champ stuff( dropped on raids) by the time I hit pov and BOT.I found my present guild at 60 and went on pog raids where most of the warriors got their gear.I found a great smith and farmed components for combines until I had mostly fh cultural.My mainhand choices were like my seru disempower proccer or the sword from the general in echo my first guild had raided with me.The GSOT and droga weapons kept me goin np till ssra and everyone had craptastic gear.Well the droga weapons were $$,but, we dropped them ourselves.We carried on upgrading slowly by dropping what we could find up.Some raids just were not popular with the hardcore guilds...like Grieg and both Burrowers.I think we got to kill AOW like 3 times.He was always down with 2 ep guilds smacking him when he popped.We had one guild BOC which I deffered to our GL/MA at the time.Cursed was very hard to find up ..same people droppping him and emporer was always busy of course.At this point we were mostly in crud gear compared to older servers I believe.<br />
<br />
We got lucky and hit VT when the guilds ahead of us were busy elsewhere so that was pretty smooth although the hours involved taxed many of our players often limiting our raid strength.Even better we had a couple months with little competition in EP's because the guilds in front of us had moved into in time.Several times I went off to help people with an epic only to see ep/time ppl killing the target for whatever alt/pp etc.<br />
<br />
The bottem feeding thing was often a problem for us and personally, I don't think some kind of trivial loot code for characters flagged beyond certain points would be a bad idea.Although, seeing how soe allows for folks to buy and sell characters and game goods irl I don't see them caring really.<br />
<br />
I got very lucky in finding my guild.It has been filled with great people who really made the game a richer place for me.It's also been a lot of work and far more challenging than grouping on many levels.There are few people (certainly very few tanks)who spend much time afk ,or,are not being challenged to some extent on our raids.The time,patience and effort to make the team succeed are greater by far than what I have ever experienced in a group.Grouping is something we do to relax and have fun.Hehe even tipt trials are relaxing by far in comparison for me.The skill and awareness required to tank in groups is so much less than in a raid for me that I have difficulty undestanding some perceptions here.I'm not saying raid tanking is rocket science,but, generally group stuff is trivial by comparison.Personally,I've learned  far more tanking raids than i ever would have just grouping /shrug.<br />
<br />
I agree that there is a problem with people bottemfeeding content and especially the pa stuff that helps to encourage it.I also would like to see more group content opened up to level 65 folks that would give alternatives to raiding.Pop created a massive leap in gear that is difficult to account for now.I'd like to see group and small raid content biased to pre elemental people for a bit to give them more choices than just god and the 10 thousandth LDON. :( It would still have to stay in balance with the difficulty/reward balance present in the game.No ornate geared group should be able to win an ep mold quality drop in one encounter.I hate the way stuff is getting dumbed down too.From xp group mods and free 200 sense heading to find pc( er i've used this erp) and a lot of stuff It seems that eq is trying too hard to ease people through the game and cheapening it. <br />
<br />
Not all guilds are created equal and running one well and progressing through content is a bigger challenge than simply leveling to 65 and grinding LDONS.If your guildies were often afk and you found it unchallenging something was wrong imo.I say give it another shot.Form your own guild if you have to and keep plugging.Do it in the right spirit and most of  the disenchanted raiders here can make it work and have fun doing it imo.Raiding is like the next big adventure after you've learned how to group well.Anytime you have to coordinate constantly with a larger group of people the challenges increase and it's not always easy or fun.However you do get to accomplish stuff for the team you couldn't have done with a group.For some people this kinda perspective just won't fly and I hope they do create more fun content to explore.If the measure of your fun is always centered around what loots will drop then I never see grouping working for you in eq past a certain point.A group &lt; a raid and cannot/should not  compete for loots.But yeah more room to advance through differant ,fun content is needed...er not LDON bleh.It never has to lead to raid quality drops.<br />
<br />
I think soe erred with the crazy upgrade in power of drops in pop.However,I also think ponding away mindlessly in LDON's collecting points was the wrong direction for eq to go.No spirit in it just points &amp; loots...kinda cheap.I also wish raid force size had been kept down  to 30-40 or so,although,artificial limitations can suck too...o well.We've worked hard the last year logging the majority of our limited playtime raiding with each other and it's been a blast.Certainly,it's required me to adapt my rl schedule and deal with stuff i probably wouldn't if i was just grouping.Like anything else It's how much you want to do it.I know theirs a lot of younger folks with endless free time able to get through content far faster than I will /shrug.I'm having fun with my team doing stuff at our own pace.The raid game is the final evolution of character development in EQ.You don't have to do it,but, you won't evolve to the same level either.Yeah some people suck so some guilds do too.For people that want to pause along the way or take a differant angle i do hope they develop more group /small raid  content.<br />
<br />
Hehe sry,lack of sleep...just my perspective. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can tell you why.  Because requiring raids to take so much time is another method of excluding a percentage of the player base from the content.  It's another way raiders can feel special, because they managed to set aside the 4 or 6 hours necessary to accomplish the goal.  Therefore they're &quot;better&quot;.  They're &quot;superior&quot;.  And they've got the lewtz to prove it.  This isn't really necessarily true.  What is true is that they've got the time to commit to the goal and at the very least a leadership that will push them towards it.  That doesn't make them &quot;better&quot; or &quot;superior&quot;, but people are always looking for ways to think of themselves in that fashion, aren't they?</div></div><hr />

I'm not buying another expansion just to be able to get level 70 so it will be easier for my guild of usually 20 to get access to zones we bought the expansion for over 2 years ago. Someone in one post mentioned that in PoP there were only 6-8 zones that required flagging still but how many zones didn't require flagging? I think it's what 4? Then the idea that these elemental zones could not handle the pressure of that many people being in the zone. It's a wonder you can ever raid them if more than 3 groups will crash them. Maybe they should buy more servers to handle the pressure with the money made from the expansion.<br />
<br />
For now atleast my character was donated to my guild for their use but I'm not paying any longer. I would have rather retired him never to be seen so that there was no way his use would amount to Sony getting any kind of $ from him but as is true I think with most smaller(family style if you like) guilds he was the one we outfitted and I could not take that from them.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an alternative, let's look at EQ like buying a monthly lift ticket at Killington. Now, if Killington was a 100 foot high bunny slope, nobody would come to it at all and it wouldn't exist. However, it's got enough expert, interrmediate, and beginner slopes to accomodate a variety of customers at varing progression levels. (In contrast I once was at the top of a mountain in Switzerland that was sooooo intimidating that I took the gondola back down and didn't ski that day.)<br />
<br />
True, I ski very often and given my acceptance of the process one must follow to improve as a skier, I get to ski parts of Killington you might only see on postcards.<br />
<br />
Buying that lift ticket does not mean that you can ski the most difficult trails. Neither does only skiing the intermediate slope for four years. In fact, the Ski Patrol might deny you access to some trails if in their opinion you can't handle them. Conversely, (back in the day) they'd lift up the rope and Trail Closed - Icy Conditions signs on the most difficult slopes for me and wave me on through.<br />
<br />
SoE, if it wants to keep you as a customer needs to provide you with content that will keep you paying. It however is under no obligation to remove the bolders, widen the path, and groom the slope on the Expert trails and make them Intermediate so you can ski them. It also has an obligation to keep you off the expert trails so you don't ruin my fun if you in fact can't handle them.<br />
<br />
On my server 5 guilds are or have been in PoTime. Another few have just entered the EP's - perhaps as much as 25-30% of the server population (excluding twinks). Today's challanging content is tomorrow's Trak raid. This is particularly true with OoW raising the level cap to 70.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
 You misunderstand. The idea is not for Sony to make the trails easier. The idea is that the person who buys his ticket who hasn't skiied before should be able to attempt the bunny slopes, but they can't because expert skiiers who want to 'relax' have roped off the slope and jammed the chairlift so it's almost impossible for the new skiier to even try to attempt the stuff and move to the intermediate hill.<br />
<br />
 I'm such a firm believer in progression that I would have loved to finish all my keys and get my flags when I was still playing. The problem was, my progression targets were repeatedly pulled out from underfoot by single/two groups Ebaying (random note: It's a generic term, like tanking, Groovdog), trying for 'challenge', or twinking out alts. Hell, there was a four month period trying for my Bard epic where there was a pair of 65's from two different guilds who were racing Phinny spawns, one to twink his wizzy alt, the other to sell MQ's. Sure, I could single group it, but no way in hell for a single group to race a single toon. If I had lost the race four months running to groups of similarly geared people, that wouldn't have bothered me. But when being outraced by something you CAN'T race, and then having the racer /ooc an offer to sell you the piece you need in zone......Fuck that.</div></div><hr />

 JUST TRY to find a ST key holder up on any regular server nowadays <br />
<br />
On Terris ST keyholders sometimes go for 5-6 days unkilled.<br />

Cockblocks? who would cockblock you just for the hell of it? back then they needed the mob to so they just would not do half a turn in or kill a place holder to fuck you over, now we have people doing it all the time, we even have mother fucking slime that sits in our server PU raid channle to find out what we are hitting <br />

<br />
&quot; I pay the same $12 a month for this game as everyone else, I should be able to zone into the Plane of Time if I want to&quot;  <br />

This is what sparked me to wrote this post ... I just don't agree</div></div><hr />

Zebuxoruk has dozekar issue.  He basically permacamped for alts. I had friends who did it, I tagged along a few times. But since dozekar only requires alittle facxtion work to able to get to he is perfect for alts. Also perfect for the non-raiders.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they are not good grouping zones but when friends from the past 4 years use them for exp zones and talk about the good loot from trash mobs many are going to figure that raiding is just one demention of the zone. If it is just a raiding zone then they would probably figure that out rather quickly if it is anything like PoF, PoH, or PoG used to be. You could zone in but back in the day how many would really zone in without a raid force there or otw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you came here with an arrogant, casuals are just whiny babies attitude, when you don't even understand the issues. From your perspective everything is better for casuals than it was in Kunark, therefore casuals have no room to complain. But the point isn't that casuals have better gear, abilities, and so forth then they did in Kunark,<br />
<br />
You pretty much summed up my arguement.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
 rather it's that SoE is catering to a very small segment of the player base, telling everyone else to screw off, and those being catered to defend it.<br />
<br />
You know...it doesn't take a raid to beat instanced one group content.<br />
<br />
Vxed and Tipt for example.<br />
<br />
Every single piece of gear I wear at the moment came from single group content.  Chavoor the Trickster does not require nor does it permit a massive raid to go in and farm it, Ravv Hunter is easily dealt with, and I assure you that Pixxet Elites don't require raids, nor does a ra'tuk savagefury.  Then you don't need nor can have a raid to do Kyv Heartpiercer Jhiru.<br />
<br />
My current gear comes entirely from those mobs.  <br />
<br />
The content is harder. The gear progression hasn't really kept up, unless you've raided. People talk about walking into GoD trial zones as if it's something everyone can do and should do. Yet the threads I've read are telling Warriors to have something like 7-8k unbuffed HP to expect to do well. Do you know how many non-raiding Warriors actually have 7-8k unbuffed HP? Few, very freaking few.<br />
<br />
Not only has gear progression kept up, it's actually sped ahead of what it's normally at.  Single group content has access to things they've never had before...the only problem for most casual players is that...GASP...it's no drop, so they have to actually KILL the mob for it instead of buy it!<br />
<br />
Seven to eight thousand hitpoints are acquired through both bazaar and Lost Dungeons gear...it's the common ridicule of many channels actually.  The Steel Warrior Channel, the Rogue Channel, and the Paladin channel all scoff at the fact that Lost Dungeons warriors can tank most pre-Kod'Taz content with just their bazaar/LDoN gear.<br />
<br />
The problem is no one WANTS to try these things.  If people get up and go do these things for themselves, they have a revelation.  They see that the bazaar channel was wrong.  Your random bazaar casual player hasn't experienced Gates of Discord, heard the horror stories of Kod'Taz, and therefore applied it unnecessarily to all the other zones.<br />
<br />
Fact is...Riwwi is easier than Plane of Valor.  When you're done in Riwwi, head to Ferubi/Barindu as a natural progression.  Casual players can flourish  in these zones.<br />
<br />
Let's look at some of the loot:<br />
<br />
 Rhyolite Tear of Thralldom -- off of random Mastruqs and Ra'Tuks (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26152) <br />
<br />
Polished Garnet Loop -- off of Chavoor the Trickster...a rather easy named in Vxed (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26332) <br />
<br />
Daunting Opaque Orb -- off Pixxet Elite Brawler, an easy named in Ferubi (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26338) <br />
<br />
Bone Shard of Rigidity -- off of another easy named in Ferubi, Pixxet Elite Hammermaster *or* the Blademaster (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26138) <br />
<br />
Cloudy Jewel of Growth -- off ANOTHER Pixxet Elite, who is no harder than an LDoN named. (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26204) <br />
<br />
Diamond-link Chain Mail -- Off a relatively easy Pixxt named.  This is the tunic *I'M* wearing at the moment. (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26284) <br />
<br />
Gilded Ixt Spear -- same mob, has a 20 percussion instrument mod. (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26340) <br />
<br />
A Taelosian Child's Toy -- same mob (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26283) <br />
<br />
Grey Mesh Legbands -- same mob (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27530) <br />
<br />
Rageshard Ring of Destruction -- same mob (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26545) <br />
<br />
The Journal of the Vagabond -- Same mob...better charm than what most casuals can ever get. (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26680) <br />
<br />
Scaled Leggings of Dark Dreams -- same mob (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27077) <br />
<br />
Should I go on?<br />
<br />
Frankly, these days EQ as a game, played for enjoyment, sucks arse unless you happen to enjoy playing in a very specific way that is really the &quot;only&quot; method well supported by the expansions.<br />
<br />
This is the cry of people spoiled by Planes of Power who are too frightened to experiment and try new things.  That's why the Dedgerex's Flint Forged Cudgel can still sell for 90,000 platinum on this server, because people are too afraid to realize how easily obtained it is.<br />
<br />
People aren't enjoying the game. People are getting tired of paying money for a game they're not enjoying. And they're telling the company they're doing business with that the company better get its act together or they're taking their money elsewhere, and all you can do is disparge and belittle them. Well buddy boy, you don't pay for their subscriptions every month, they do. And if they want to tell SOE to take their new expansions and shove them where the sun don't shine, there is nothing you have to say about it.<br />
<br />
I play the same game &quot;buddy boy&quot;, I pay the subscription every month just as much as anyone else, and I have as much say in its progression as any one else does.  I also retain the right to point out why people are wrong, ignorant, or simply refusing to see why their arguement is wrong.<br />
<br />
The arguement that Gates of Discord is bad for the casual player is a bad one.  A poor one.  One that holds no merit.  It's said by bazaar mules and people who are spoiled with Bastion of Thunder and don't want to risk anything else, because they want safe exp, but they want safe exp with good drops.<br />
<br />
I won't lie.  Ferubi and Barindu and even Riwwi are pretty dangerous.  But not impossible.  Not even &quot;too difficult&quot;.  You have to exhert a little bit of effort to get greater rewards.  Things are not handed to you because you pay a $13 a month subscription and say &quot;I'm a casual&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Instead of griping because you don't get loot...try going out to where the loot drops, killing the mobs, and then saying &quot;I can't do this content, because when I tried, I experienced this and this and this and this&quot; not &quot;Well, someone told me that GoD is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Money talks, bullshit walks. If the game continues the way it has and in six months subscriptions haven't fallen substantially I'll be exceedingly surprised.<br />
<br />
Similarly, if people start wisening up and realize that because they have less time than some people they deserve better loot, I'll be equally surprised.  <br />
<br />
Gates of Discord is *not hard*.  In Riwwi, mobs hit for 350-355, with a chaos claw proc.  The proc can get a little deadly, but it's nothing that can't be remedied by a decent healer.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's healed in Plane of Valor or Bastion of Thunder can heal anywhere up to and including Ferubi.</div></div><hr />

Chavoor seems to have difficulty handling a charmed Pooka. He also doesn't like WS or Furious. A little investigation would reveal that this is a mob that CAN be done by groups containing an undergeared warrior. You do however have to log in and enter Vxed to kill him.<br />

Damn, I could 2 bot this shit. <br />
The fact that some people just can't play correctly does not mean the game should be tuned for them. There is no fucking way a real 'casual' playing a few hours a week will exhaust content avaible for him. <br />
Problem are not so much casual players, than non-raiders that suck. A raider that suck will still pogress, there are other people there to think for him tell him where to go and what to do, that is the most tragic inequality. If you are hardcore to the point of exhausting single group content avaible without the help of a guild, then joining a raiding guild will just take a small part of your play time.<br />
<br />
What can you do with 1 group and no guild?<br />
Old World<br />
Kunark<br />
Velious (except AoW, unless you have  decent gear)<br />
Luclin sucks for most of it, but you can do most of it if you really want to waste your time.<br />
PoP access to 10 out of 15 zones<br />
LDoN<br />
GoD access up to Yxtta / KT / Ikkinz<br />
<br />
You can do all this without ever joining a raid.</div></div><hr />

You are smoking crack in what you define as easy in Ferubi/Vxed for a casual player.  To get those Ferubi augs takes a tight 6 man team in non VT/Ellie equipment to not make any mistakes for 3-4 hrs (break and camp).  The Trickster in Vxed requires a competent 6 man team that can easily handle hard ldon.  <br />
<br />
 Your solution for us? &quot;just do LDoN.&quot; How about you just do LDoN instead of killing Zland for the 47th time so you can get a primal for your level 51 rogue you piece of shit? <br />
<br />
Haass is so friggin right.  I had figured by this point that Tormax/AoW/Emperor etc all as 3+ year old content would be largely available to the masses (hell I'd still like to see a Boc someday just for egos sake...got knows in 20+ kills i never &quot;earned&quot; one).  The problem is that high end time guilds break up and the players instaed of reforming at that level instead gon back and bottom feed....its really funny as hell to see a 6 man group kill aow.  Until you realize that its taking away drops from peeps who might actually get some enjoyment from the items.  I think most of what motivates these people is an effort to re-live past glories etc all...kinda like Al Bundy at Polk High....<br />
<br />
I truly wish that EQ suported a framework by which 15-20 good friends could progress solidly.  I just quit a raidng guild because I just cant stand the fuktard politics of them.  As a somewhat hard core non raider (on 6-7 days a week, 4 hrs a day) I still find lots to amuse me (the new VP looks fun).  <br />
<br />
I personally get tired of hearing the &quot;questionable talent raiding guild zerg mothers who hang out like dkp leeches&quot; bitch about people who want a sense of indentity and get tired of being blatant kiss asses to earn loot in the  corporate time raiding guild of the month.  So touche you elitist bastage fuktards that bitch about &quot;non raiders&quot;. It takes alot more skill to do challenging tasks with a 6-12 group with questioanble gear than with a zerg army such as you claim.<br />

Really...the only competence factor you need is for one random person not to run the wrong way and aggro every mob in the zone.<br />
<br />

What is skill ? from a leading point of view, there's just no possible comparison between the leading skill required to get 50 people do their job right and 12.<br />
<br />
You just can't compare the difficulty of setting a strategy for a 50 people event and a one group stuff. <br />
<br />
Not even talking about the difficulty of running a 70+ non-casual players guild.<br />
<br />
From an individual point of view, it's easier to shine in a group than in a raid, but since PoP raids DO require quite a few skilled people.</div></div><hr />

Chavoor isn't hard at all, he's been toned down rather dramatically, and you can STILL use defensive on him after furious.    With a pooka or hynid pet, he goes down rather fast, and has very low Atk.   <br />
<br />
I fail to see how it could POSSIBLY take 3-4 hours to get to Ferubi nameds.  Invis till you find the first see invis mob.... Kill 2 mobs to make a camp, pull the see invis, kill, reinvis and repeat.   Takes about 15 mins to get to any named in Ferubi.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, lots of random trash drops insane gear in Ferubi as well, so if you choose to fight your way in, you'll get a piece or 2 anyhow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, Grum, its happening on Povar for one.  <br />
<br />
Povar is a rotation guild.  To my knowledge, AoW, NToV, Ssra named, Emp, VT are all still on rotation.  The fun thing about this is the requisites for getting ON the rotations are created by the cockblocking asshat &quot;hard core raiding&quot; guilds on the rotation back in the day and they ALL had an agenda to keep the rotation as small as possible (before you go bitching about how casual guilds should be able to get on them).  To get on AoW you have to have a guild &quot;permit&quot; you to kill their statue, which is one form of cockblocking.  To get on NToV I believe you have to kill Yelinak and Tormax (there's one other but those two for sure).  Unfortunately, large guilds or even bottom-feeder guilds still on the rotation, IMMEDIATELY kill Tormax to keep smaller guilds off the rotation.  <br />
<br />
More recently, the only Qvic-enabled guild on this server has taken to showing up on the AoW-rotation day and killing the AoW with single groups, laughing, and telling the rotation guild to fuck off, there is no rotation for this mob.  You see, it no longer benefited them to have a rotation about three years ago.  And once they left the rotation for bigger and brighter green fields, i can only assume that they felt it was their fucking Support For Assholes Everywhere duty to ruin the mob for every body else. <br />
<br />
The same thing happens with any ST-key dragon and for the same reasons. <br />
<br />
Looking at your magelo it looks like maybe you just graduated from &quot;have not&quot; status yourself.  I see several non-raiders on this thread with far higher HP than you currently possess, even with two peices of Raex armor, but I also witnessed you blow off their concerns with your little tirade.  Yet, okay, so apparently your guild has progressed somewhere into the EPs and I think you've forgotten somewhere along the way what it's like for smaller guilds and for these serious non-raiders who have clearly put significantly more time into their character and their items than you have yourself.  Or maybe you are &quot;new generation&quot; and never knew, hell, I don't know.  But the fact is that you just plain have no fucking idea what its like anymore.  If it makes you feel better, I wouldn't either if all I did was play my main in my Time/Uqua guild.  But I don't.  I also play my warrior and I play her with a small group of friends in an extremely small family guild.  So I can see what it's like for them and others in their phase and I can take stock of it both as a &quot;hard core raider&quot; and as a &quot;non-raider wannabe.&quot;  Basically, quit eating the propoganda of the big guilds and look fucking around.  At the very least don't try to bullshit those who don't buy into the hype.</div></div><hr />

I think a few guilds kill Vindi and so forth but you'd never catch either of the 2 Terris Uberguilds - Clan Ta Veren - or - Valon Bottomfeeding in velious .. they have better things to do. <br />

I guess you have a bunch of jackasses on Povar .. not much I can say about that except no one *I* know does this and my experience of the game doesn't hold that there are uber players out there killing the targets that midlevel raiders and non-guilded types would want.</div></div><hr />

Here in lies the fundamental flaw with your argument.  You are taking *your* experience and extrapolating from that a blanket argument that you feel should apply to everyone.  When you do that, you are being told by a far larger population of people and experiences that your experience with this topic is not indicative of the general population.  You then come back saying that all these other people are wrong because they haven't had the same experiences as you have had.  The reason for that is because you are part of that upper 10 - 20% of each server.  You look from the top of the mountain and see nothing but green fields rolling out beneath you and forget about the other people that are standing in the shit trenches below and all they see are cow pies and assholes standing on hills.</div></div><hr />

That still didn't address my point in the slightest (although I find it intresting that you addressed the magelo comment by updating from your last update of July 7 with a brand-spanking new 400 hp!)  I can understand that: it doesn't correspond with your idealogy and agenda here. <br />

You don't know what its like for those in small guilds anymore.  Period.  Your bullshit flame-provoking post and your follow-up replies only highlight that you have lost any grasp you ever had on the low-end game.  That you would taunt and provoke warriors _in this thread_ who I can see with one glance at a magelo have worked five times as hard for their equipment as you probably did for your raex boots just shows a lack of class.  Or a lack of unity in class.  Or something. <br />

I think a few guilds kill Vindi and so forth but you'd never catch either of the 2 Terris Uberguilds - Clan Ta Veren - or - Valon Bottomfeeding in velious .. they have better things to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
You'd be shocked and amazed, my gullible friend.  I have friends in the top Povar guild who never knew that single groups of their guildmates show up to kill small Velious content and flaunt the kills in front of rotation mobs.  It happens.  The fact that you don't do it - instead you come in here and make up shit that you think smaller guilds are doing - doesn't hold a lot of weight with me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the 2 sides in this arguement are debating 2 different things...<br />
<br />
The &quot;casuals&quot; are saying they need more content available to them.  There are 2 main points are firstly that they are buying expansions which they will largely never see which is true, alot more of GoD and PoP is locked away behind raid flags than any previous expansions, and 2ndly while there are alot of raid targets of previous expansions that are now killable by casual players, these targets are kept dead by bottom feeding &quot;ubers&quot; for twink loot or stuff to sell on player auctions.<br />
<br />
With regard to whats available in expansions for casual players I agree about GoD.  Its a shit expansion for the casual player but the previous 2 expansions had very little for raiders so its a bit of give and take there.  It was marketed misleadingly and people who bought it expecting more playable content than the 1st few zones have a right to feel shitty about it.  While it has a single group progression path really Tipt is a killer and without elemental gear on the tank it really is out of reach of the casual player unless they are using a 2healer, charmed pet group which isnt available to everyone.  For PoP I dont think the elemental planes should be opened up, though I think a single group access quest for Sol Ro tower would be a worthwhile addition, just don't whinge when you get there and learn theres no zone out :p<br />
<br />
The problem with bottom feeding sucks too.  Personally I don't play excessively outside of the time I raid, and then its mostly LDoNs for augs or KT when I can get groups there.  I help guildies with epic mobs for their twinks occasionally but not to the point where it would be difficult for a casual player to get these mobs.  On the Tribunal there are alot of smaller guilds that raid velious and luclin targets, there is a pickup raid channel that hits PoP flags and targets like AoW, lower PoP flagging mobs are pretty highly contested too.  I don't really see a solution to fix the bottom feeding problem without making more of the loot on those mobs No Drop or SoE cracking down on PA/IGE (which isnt gonna happen).  That really sucks, but I dont think removing flags from the EPs is the solution.<br />
<br />
The other side of the arguement from people such as the original poster is one of if you want access to the EPs and Time and the loot from those zones then by all means the hoops are there for you to jump through same as they were for the raiders who are there now.  <br />
<br />
No one is saying bottom feeding is good, I don't think any of the raiders want to cockblock casuals from other content (atleast not the ones posting in this thread).  More non-raid content is good also, I would use it myself, and Im sick of LDoN's too so yeah its time for a casual gear progression path post LDoN that doesn't involve grinding 1000's of points in monotonous dungeons, but the solutions isn't to open up the EP's to everyone and gimp the mold droppers so 2 groups of LDoN geared can take out General Rape'm (who would just get farmed by Qvic flagged ubers for their twinks anyway :P ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can only speak for my server, but on Terris the uberguild players want nothing to do with old content. In fact when someone mentions backflagging people will start to log off so fast it will make your head spin. <br />
<br />
ST key dragons stay up for 5-6 days unkilled.<br />
<br />
Dozekar gets neglected quite often too.<br />
<br />
We've had to leave the radio on while we're gone so The Dain doesn't pee on the floor from seperation anxiety.<br />
<br />
a lot of todays players who WOULD be camping these mobs think themselves &quot;Too Cool&quot; for things in velious. They only want to go to the Elemental planes. <br />
<br />
Are you sure this isn't something a few people made up and duped others into believeing?<br />
<br />
Emar is another server known for its cockblockery, Cries of insurrection(server leader in teaching cockblocking skills and greaving players) just disbanded, thankfully there are 5 other top end guilds, 3 of which that employ cockblocking, ready to jump in their cockblocking spot</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I'm sorry, this isn't true.  LoY offered the non-raider/casual level 65 player bubkas, nada, the big zippo.  Hell charms, the big selling point of the expansion weren't worth crap.  LDoN is the only expansion out of the last four, PoP, LoY, LDoN, and GoD, that offered a level 65 non-raider anything.  And there is every sign that OoW is going to be GoD II.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I have about the bottom feeding comments are pretty simple. Anytime I get loot I don't need and I sell it or twink an alt, I supose I could be accused of bottom feeding. If I do an LDoN easy, I'm competing with a less well-equipped Warrior for a spot. If I roll on a drop, why that's reprehensible.<br />
<br />
But at the same time QVic armor costs 11000pp per piece to make. Keep in mind I dob't tradeskill. Where, without bottom feeding, do you propose I get that 11000pp per piece? What dropable loot is there that's Uqua/Ikkinz4+??<br />
<br />
If no one in my guild is online and I want to inish up an AA, I often go to PoI. If a group is there pulling left, I pull right. If two groups are there, I leave. I don't farm retro mobs (with rare exceptions), except the Kael Arena for my twinks.<br />
<br />
Yet, I get a constant stream of tells fom less well-equipped players eager to enlist my services (especially since I'd be a gready slime-bucket it I rolled on anything). Let's do an LDoN Difficult ('cause we could use the drops), help me with my Epic, Feel like taking out some BoT tower named? Wanna do Rumblecrush? Could you PL us awhile? We're in PoI.<br />
<br />
Oh yes. If I off a named to sell the loot so I can buy QVic armor, I'm pond scum. But if you want something from me in some retro zone, why I'm your best buddy.<br />
<br />
I used to do 2 or 3 epic fights a month. I used to help people I didn't even know to get GoD flags. But, I've gotta tell ya. Getting h8 tells from lower level players should they trip over me while I'm soloing one of the two or three low level loot mobs that aren't on the progression path for pp ticks me off no end.<br />
<br />
You know what buckos? AFAIK only Trak is a progression mob in Sebilis. Anything I kill for either experiance or salable loot I'm entitled to do. Disagree? Petition a GM.<br />
<br />
I don't kill the progression mobs of up and coming guilds. Your group needs the camp I'm soloing? 99 times out of a 100 I take off. My favorite phrase in LDoNs is &quot;Pass on all loot.&quot; But don't even take on an attitude with me.<br />

<br />
Thats assuming the named is already up. It takes, if I remember correctly 75 kills to spawn a Pexxt from a fresh zone. That could easily take a group that isnt in Time+ gear 3-4 hours to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Oh and as to the main discussion, the reason Sony uses flags to block content is because mudflation long ago made it impossible to require any real &quot;gearing up&quot; in order to beat content. Its much easier to design 1-2 events to be too hard initially while everything else is too easy to insure there is artificial breakpoints in progress rather then trying to make sure that each level of content needs to be beaten and farmed in order to have a chance at the next. So, you get Rallos Zek,  Rathe/Coirnav and Uqua creating artificial stops in progress. <br />

If there were no flag system in GoD, whats to stop casual guilds simply heading to Time and getting p1-2 loot and never bothering to touch Agnarr or Rallos Zek or Bertox?</div></div><hr />

If you look at my gear, you'll notice that Doze and the drakes in HoT allow the questing of some amazing warrior guild. I'm not deliberately cockblocking lower guilds; rather, I'm using the items to upgrade my main and my friends. However, because I was there with a single group, or at most 2 groups, you COULD sort of consider this bottom feeding. Is this a bad thing? Not on my part, I feel. I'm not selling, ebaying or twinking.<br />

  Ferubi can always be dangerous. We had 2 EP groups wipe there due to an untimely LD and resisted mez killing both of our CC. It happens. There is a lot more leeway with a high ac/hp tank in dangerous zones... And a pickup group can be outright deadly. It's not a walk in the park for people without high end gear.</div></div><hr />

why do you assume that as soon as flagging requirements are lifted that we would rush like a bunch of lemmings into that content only to be unable to do it? is that what you tried to do or what? most people are smart enough to take it a step at a time. but we cannot take those steps because flagging is a giant bottleneck institutionalized by sony and enforced by guilds who have no business in those zones.<br />
<br />
sony has never been satisfied with making challenging content. they notice that we adapt progress and conquer so they compensate by putting ridiculous bottlenecks into quests of all types. its been here all along and was made famous by the epic bottlenecks which did nothing whatsoever to make people glad they bought the game.<br />
<br />
sony's idea of customer feedback is to invite guildleaders to &quot;summits&quot; so they can hear from the community. you see to them there is no one BUT the large raid guilds. the rest of us dont count. what have we gotten from them that you like to point out so much? ykesha? sorry but thats lower end content unsuitable for anyone who has reached 65. ldon? they gave us four zones called collection assasinate slaughter and rescue. each of those zones has variations but honestly the variations are such clones that after doing 250 of them i still have a hard time telling them apart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To say elementals are raider zones only is about as smart as a frozen turd in winter, BoT is a group zone but has just as many raids going on at any one time, the game AA xp numbers are based off the exp rates in the elementals this alone is enough to suggest that the elementals were ment to be a place where people xp AND gear up.</div></div><hr />

sounds like what you are saying is that sony made such a screwup of the content that they had to block it with mindless flagging events that the large majority of people hate doing. but the flagging existed upon release so it cant be argued that they were taken off guard or anything.</div></div><hr />

I thought LDoN was a great concept.  Content that you could be in and out of in an hour, didnt require the perfect group makeup of PoP, there was no long camping and every time you completed an adventure you earned points that you could put towards a 40hp upgrade or an EB proc for your weapon.<br />
<br />
Its absurd how many people have been slagging off LDoN in this thread.  Think of what it did for the casual warrior:  <br />
- Before LDoN if you wanted EB on your weapon you had to be in a guild that could kill AoW or come up with 400k in plat.  Now you can add a near EB hate proc to any weapon you have!!!<br />
- Before LDoN warriors were fighting with their red epic's / SBoZ combos or Windblades and every thread on TSW was about warrior agro<br />
- Before LDoN unless you worshiped RZ the only warrior legs available to a non raiding warrior with more than 40hps were ornate and every time a warrior tried to camp for a new set of greaves they'd lose the roll to some shitty necro who was going to sell them in the bazaar or put them on his lvl55 paladin twink which was then going to get picked for a group instead of you.<br />
<br />
Yeah now that we are about a year on since release people are getting a bit tired of it but it was a fantastic expansion for people who play in short bursts and gave players to opportunity to work towards gear upgrades in small chunks rather than logging on for an hour hopeful of getting a spot in BoT Upper Sands then logging no closer to your new set of legs.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what the solution is.<br />
<br />
I don't think that keys/flags to zones are a bad thing. They existed in Kunark (Sebillis and Howling Stones) however the quest to get the key was easier than the zone in question. Right now we are doing the BoT key as a guild. The mobs we have to kill for the pieces are much much harder than the normal BoT mob. If I am correct you have to kill Rallos in tactics for EP access. There is no way I believe that RZ is easier than the normal mobs in the EP's. Sorry not sure what it takes for SolRo access for a comparison there. Just becuase I got my sebillis key long ago did not mean I was going to try and kill Trak. Same thing is true for all in BoT now. We are not killing Agnarr or even the tower bosses.<br />
<br />
What I am trying to say is fine make key/flag quest but make them proprtional to the content you will be facing in that zone not way above and beyond the normal content. To repear a statement I have seen on these boards before. Why do I have to kill a raid mob to access and experience zone ? It is a very simple question that I have never seen really explained.</div></div><hr />

Zero, zero, and zero.  Because when GoD came out and I went to check it out, I found that my unbuffed 5200 HP arse would be handed to me on a silver platter if I stepped into GoD.  And by the time they claimed to have fixed it, I was done.  Over.  Finished.  Tired of the bullshit SoE pumps out year in and year out and calls an expansion.  Tired of chasing the cheese in the gigantic mouse maze they call EQ because I knew that not only was the guy in the other maze going to get a bigger piece of cheese because he's hanging with 72 of his closest friends (note the sarcasm here for the sarcasm impaired) but my piece of cheese wasn't going to be enough to even make a noticeable difference in my hunger.<br />

The game is fubared, pure and simple.  You true believers who are getting your jollies off of preaching the gospel that everything is hunky dory, non-raiders are the problem, they're lazy, they're stupid, they're unwilling to take risks, they don't want to face challenges, and so on, just keep up the bullshit.

Tired of chasing the cheese in the gigantic mouse maze they call EQ because I knew that not only was the guy in the other maze going to get a bigger piece of cheese because he's hanging with 72 of his closest friends (note the sarcasm here for the sarcasm impaired) but my piece of cheese wasn't going to be enough to even make a noticeable difference in my hunger.<br />

The game is fubared, pure and simple. You true believers who are getting your jollies off of preaching the gospel that everything is hunky dory, non-raiders are the problem, they're lazy, they're stupid, they're unwilling to take risks, they don't want to face challenges, and so on, just keep up the bullshit. Because you're not convincing anyone. You believe it? Great, you're a true believer. Nobody gives a damn. And nothing you are saying is changing the minds of anyone who disagrees with you. So keep on wasting your breath man, I couldn't care less. Your opinion is so next to meaningless to me, it's hard to even tell where meaningless ends and your opinion starts.<br />
<br />
So in other words...you haven't experienced this content, but because it's not spoonfeeding you, it's by default bad?<br />
<br />
First you say &quot;the game is broken&quot;, and in the opening days of GoD...the expansion was.  Then SOE fixes it, and you're not happy.<br />
<br />
You're ranting and raving at people for saying &quot;No...there ARE places good for casuals&quot;, really that's what opened GoD zones are...but you wouldn't know that.<br />

<br />
No, what I was saying is that itemization has progressed to the point where Sony simply cant devise a way to make content a progression through learning/gearing up. If there were no flags in POP and Time was actually finished at release, people could have been killing there within weeks. If there was no flags in GoD, people wouldnt have set foot in Uqua at all.<br />
<br />
Back in the days of Velious, youd loot a set of Warlord armour and it was a massive boost over Indicolite. Nothing will ever compare to looting a primal weapon in terms of instant improvement. Gearing up in Velious was meaningful. Going from 190hp items to 230hp items means VERY little in comparison. Except for new apps, there has been no dramatic powershift for players in GOD. Even in POP you didnt need to gear up and farm in order to progress, you simply had to learn the events. The flagging itself is the block on content, not a logical progression in difficulty thats overcome by farming and gearing up(coupled with learning).<br />
<br />
This is the reason there are flags, not because Sony is determined to keep the casual player down but because theyve painted themselves into a corner with regards to the way itemization has progressed.</div></div><hr />

I had 5500hp/1300ac and was working on Dozekar items to bump me up over 6k/1500 unbuffed when I quit the game.  Could I handle the EP's with that?  In my opinion, yes.  Will I ever see the EP's? No, because I can't/don't want to form a 72 man raid to take down RZ.<br />

See, you're not getting it at all.  I give your opinion of my opinion no value.  Zero.  None.  It doesn't matter.  You're an arrogant self righteous ass who is trying to convince other people that their perceptions and opinions are wrong.  You can't do that.  You can only fail.  And while you can continue to try and whittle away at my credibility and attempt to portray me personally as uninformed and therefore someone with an invalid opinion, the truth of the matter is I'm not the only one with this opinion.   To discredit me means you're also going to have to discredit a hell of a lot of other people who share a similar opinion.  Sounds like a full time job.  Good luck with that.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile those of us pissed off at SOE and what they've done to the game in the last 2 years are taking our dollars somewhere else where they'll be more apperciated, even if we don't happen to want to spend chunks of 4-6 hours with 72 of our closest friends several times a week in order to have fun and feel rewarded.<br />
<br />
In short, good luck with your continued attempts at belittling and degrading paying customers such as myself with your self serving elitist propaganda.  But you don't pay my subscription fees every month, I do.  Therefore what you think is completely and totally 100% irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

 Yet you admit in the VERY same sentence, you only want a Blade of Carnage for your ego.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont attack me personally...you so completely lack context and are stabbing wildly in the dark looking for a hit (you are just embarassing yourself by doing this).  This is just a cheap shot.<br />
<br />
More specfically: You can't lead a casual group to &quot;invis past the mobs in ferubi&quot;.  The dogs see invis and there a pile of them that pat...have you done this crawl before or are you using your elite Rhondo claering raids as a measuring bar (note I have the 15ac aug in my magelo from actually having done the crawl)?  <br />
<br />
A REAL casual group will need to break to them...this implies knocking down the pats and crawling...a laborous challenge for the FT/AC &quot;challenged&quot;.  please stop acting like you know what you what are talking about if you dont have the logistics of doing the actaul activity down.<br />
<br />
Also, have done the trckster with a number of pick up groups (set camp outside that alcove kill from that point). It is ridiculously easy to wipe to him with pickups (let alone the FT/skills of a casual group).  Again if you REALLY want to learn the context take a lvl 65 toon in bazaar gear and limited aas and then form a pickup and try it...dont use your Time+ geared toon.<br />
<br />
 You're an arrogant self righteous ass who is trying to convince other people that their perceptions and opinions are wrong. <br />
<br />
No I think he is being a self righteous ass because he is trying to convince me I'm wrong on things i have myself SEEN cause issues (as a non casual player) via actual experience when he doesnt even know the actual logistics of the encounter (the see invis pats are fairly obvious).</div></div><hr />

What you forget is you throw the curve off, most people wont even invite you to a hard LDoN unless your 6k unbuffed so guess what that means? out of all the poor bastards doing hard LDoNs or GoD who gets left out? the warriors because some little cloth class bitch thinks i am not ment to tank there until i break 6k(which is just about the same time most make it to elemental)<br />

<br />
 Well, part of the reason he may not be happy is that groups won't choose tanks below a certain 'comfort zone' in AC/HP - which generally can't be attained without doing at least some of the 'old progression' - which, as people across different servers will be glad to tell you, is being bottom fed.<br />
<br />
 I personally would love to try tanking in GoD, if I come back. Problem is, most (read: nearly all) of my guild didn't buy it based off of the perceived level of progression needed for the expansion. (A perception that was only enhanced by the horror stories that came out of the 'broken part'.) Of course, I COULD attempt pickups, but I only raidbuff to a lil' over 7k - most PU groups simply won't take a tank with that few HP.<br />
<br />
 It's a real problem, Ezedriel, and one that hardcore raiders routinely underestimate whenever they propose that casuals aren't that bad off. Ask your guild Clerics if they'd feel comfortable in a group with a tank that had less than 1500 AC and, say, 6k unbuffed tanking in GoD zones or trials. They wouldn't, and I wouldn't blame them.</div></div><hr />

It's so stupid, I have to quote it again.  <br />

If &quot;Time=work&quot;, then a ton of marginal raiders are way over rewarded for their time v. non-raiders who absolutely hit an artificial ceiling that's a very bad design principle.  <br />
<br />
You can be sure it will in fact change.  Or the game will die.  In fact, I think THE biggest reason for EQ decay is the extent of BS involving flags.  Nothing kills a guild faster than having to backflag up a new generation of gimps and newbs who then go to a class board and talk trash like they are the shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a solidly middle-of-the-road warrior,  in a middle-of-the-road raiding guild.<br />
<br />
As a previous poster has pointed out I don't have an impressive magelo, I don't have over 10k HP's buffed, I'm not yet in the plane of time or qvic.<br />
<br />
Yet you portray uber players as sitting up on a hill looking down on the &quot;Little People&quot; ... I'm sorry, unlike most of you posting here I STILL ACTUALLY PLAY EQ, and nobody I know anything like that.<br />
<br />
I think people who want EP/Time/Kod'Taz access open to any idiot who dings level 65 are setting up for a situation like when BoT opened up:<br />
<br />
People running around everywhere with mobs they can't kill chasing them,  Running these mobs to other groups so the other groups would die too, running these mobs to the zoneline to kill the AFK people, spamming idiotatic crap in shout/OOC, arguing and training each other etc.<br />
<br />
The fact that in the upper PoP zones I don't see kiddies acting out and greif players giving the general public a hard time is probably the main appeal to exping there.<br />
<br />
The instanced zones of LDoN ( I love LDoNs BTW ) are another way to escape the jackassery that is open level 60+ exp zones.<br />
<br />
I realize not every unguilded, unflagged, non-raiding, plays-6-hours-a-week guy is a training griefer. But almost every training griefer I've ever met is a nonflagged, non-raiding, unguilded toon. The reason being guilds good enough to have EP access don't accept this kind of player as a member. <br />
<br />
Guilds serve as a filter to weed out sociapaths and badly behaved children. If I am grouping with a members of Raajs' guild for example ( Clan Ta Veren ) I know right up front their NOT going to act like a jackass, because Jackasses aren't accepted into CTV in the first place. <br />
<br />
Keeping difficult areas clear of the people who can't hunt there and only want to go to enact their childish retribution of those who can is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Nope, just another fool 6boxer. I have heard of him though (not many of us out here). And no I dont farm ornate/etc for pp sale to turn into cash (those who do I actually hate).<br />
<br />
And as far as upgrades go, I am talking about equipment, i.e. no augs. Very few have fully augged their stufff to max 1 grp available augs (50hp/mana, shielding etc.) but then few have capped their AA either.<br />
<br />
In short I am comparing this to raiders who have wholesale part upgrade paths still available (even the highest HP warrior I have seen at 11k+ unbuffed) still has equipment upgrades available.<br />
<br />
It looks like the softcap for pally hp sits around 6-6.5k hp depending on what you do for FT, etc. This compared to the 9.7k for the best pallys (and I wont even bring up the gap to warriors at 11.3-4K unbuffed). Used EQRanking btw for the data.<br />

<br />
Gotta call bullshit on this one. Look at my magelo. A bunch of ep/time and the rest is 1492 LDoN with augs. I BARELY break 8K with a capped charm and 1/2 way on the charm stone. I could do some more augs,finish charm stone, and finish sturdy (only have 1) and end like short of 9K. I would love to see an &quot;AUTHENTIC&quot; magelo of this said 8k warrior who has only EP- and 1grp GoD/LDoN hard equipment. Nothing in those zones drops more than like 130ish hp with out augs and almost all my equipment is that high or better. AND NO SHIELD specs either, real aggro drawing warriors. Maybe with S5 but even that is gonna be few and far between (i.e. not available to 99% of warriors who dont want to have 400+AA, capped LDoN, and flagged for KT).<br />
<br />
And for those of you who havent figured it out, citing was is theoretically possible vs. what is probable for any normal person playing 20+ hrs a week is kidding themselves. In theory I could duo Time gods if they misssed every time too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groovdog</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the 2 sides in this arguement are debating 2 different things...<br />
With regard to whats available in expansions for casual players I agree about GoD.  Its a shit expansion for the casual player but the previous 2 expansions had very little for raiders so its a bit of give and take there.  It was marketed misleadingly and people who bought it expecting more playable content than the 1st few zones have a right to feel shitty about it.  While it has a single group progression path really Tipt is a killer and without elemental gear on the tank it really is out of reach of the casual player unless they are using a 2healer, charmed pet group which isnt available to everyone.  For PoP I dont think the elemental planes should be opened up, though I think a single group access quest for Sol Ro tower would be a worthwhile addition, just don't whinge when you get there and learn theres no zone out :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree generallly with your post and more reasonably argued than most but LDoN helped uber raiders as much as casuals. Uber raiders just dont spend as much time there (they have other better choices, i.e. raiding).<br />
<br />
Pre-GoD, LDoN was the non-raid equipment upgrade path (and need something quick to do pre-raid with little risk of not making the raid) for ubers. 40hp/mana augs and anger augs if nothing else.<br />
<br />
LoY was a crap expansion for many other than bankslot. Some content and not bad equipment for the time and place, but by the time it came out many (even casuals) were beyond that point. The zones here are some of the better middle casual zones in the game.<br />
<br />
Both still dont address the effective softcap that exists at the ornate (LDoN 1492 level is a minor upgrade in many cases) which has existed since PoP came out. GoD has tweaked around the edges for non hardcore raiders, but I dont see the equivalent to what might be a 2000AP (or GoD single trial) visible armor path like the ornate/elemental/GoD path that has prevailed in the major expansions. LDoN = slightly better than ornate, GoD = much better than elemental = much better than LDoN = slightly better than ornate.<br />
<br />
You wonder why a uber GoD raider has 11K unbuffed (at the high end) while a non-raider caps in the mids 6s (depending on AA and augs obviously)? Simply they had 4 major upgrades (ornate/LDoN/elemental/GoD) available while the non-raiders had 2 (ornate/LDoN). I personally am ok with there being one MAJOR upgrade difference (even its like 100-150 hp/end difference) but there needs to be more (better) options available (either old or new) for the non raider. And however its done should not require 250+ wins in repeatable boring content. At least flagging gives u some non-equipment satisfaction when you drop the mobs, LDoNs dont.<br />

The whole tiered access thing just upsets everyone (speaking for myself, raiders don't like feeling they're cut-off in another game either).<br />
<br />
-edit... allot of 'casual' ppl do come off as whiney because raiders remember not feeling envy when they saw velious geared ubers in 100hp gear when they were in kunark or worse (hp free) gear. But the game isn't the same... it's turned into more of a rat-race because (imho) of the whole tier thing that came in with PoP.</div></div><hr />

For your 8k EP and below profile -  This warrior is the MT for a guild on Saryrn that just entered the elemental planes in the last few weeks.  I've CH'd him for over 10k with a cleric bot before as well.<br />

Ok there is one out there. Glad to hear it. Show me 10 per server and we can talk. Like I said, theory is a poor subsitute for the likely.<br />
<br />
As far as 8-12pm EST, between 8-10 I am watching my kids, giving them baths, reading stories to them, putting them to bed. I guess I need to program my wife better. Your story makes me even sadder, because I play more than you and just because I cant do it at the &quot;right&quot; times means I doomed to tread relative water.<br />

<br />
Here's the deal.  You apparantly are either very blind, or surrounded by very focused people.  I highly doubt the later, but I'll give you the benefit.  The reality of the matter is that the game exists far beyond your realm of sight.  Like life, it simply does not end at your clipping plane on Terris Thule. (one of the newer servers, i might add).<br />
<br />
Go to an old server, and you'll see that things are quite different than the utopia you paint.  On CT, here's what I'd find as I was progressing thru the game, a mere 12-24 hours after a server reset.<br />
<br />
Kunark -- Gorenaire, VS, Trakanon, Talendor, Drusilla Sathir, all dead.<br />
<br />
Velious -- Dozekar, Wuoshi, Zlandicar, Kelorek'dar, Klandicar, Gozzrem, Telkenor, Eashan and Ikiatar, all dead. <br />
<br />
Luclin -- Ssra -- perma dead.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power -- well, who really gives a fuck, cuz I can't gear up for it since all of my progression mobs that I should be killing are all dead.<br />
<br />
Refute these facts.  Please, I dare you.  They contradict your argument.  They are not only the experiences of me, they are the experiences of many people who live their lives, and play EQ second (IE : I don't fucking follow some goddamned &quot;Raid at 6pm, attendance mandatory 5 of 6 days of the week&quot; bullshit.  I play when I get done doing what I need to do for the day)  I'm productive with my time.  I don't have shit for gear, in fact, I was one of the best geared non raiding toons you would find for the majority of my existance in EQ.  Please explain to me how your version of the world and my version of the world can coexist.  Don't skirt the argument, fucking address it, and if you can't, then kindly take your trolling ass elsewhere, because you honestly don't have a clue what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
You don't need any of these mob's loot to progress. XP items drop are now ~ elemental quality why the fuck would you kill goronaire to 'progress' ??? Ya need a fiery defender ? or is it the dragon hero bracer you need to tank Vallon Zek ?<br />
<br />
Fact : to beat PoP you just need bazaar gear. LDoN gear is a plus though.<br />
<br />
As for the no-life raiders, actually the top end guild are made of a LARGE part of 25+ year old people with wife / job / child, raiding 3 / 5 days a week.<br />
<br />
It's better to get someone attending 50% of the raid for 4 years that some teen playing 20h per day during summer holidays and then get his internet connectivity shut by his parents in september.<br />
<br />
You can be in a top guild raiding 15h a week, that's not what I would call playing 'hardcore'. Of course you'll also have some very hardcore player, but don't think the top guild of your server is just made of them. When you're recruiting you're trying to get info on people's personal life, cause no matter how much someone is playing, if he leaves EQ after 4 months it's a huge waste of time and gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More specfically: You can't lead a casual group to &quot;invis past the mobs in ferubi&quot;. The dogs see invis and there a pile of them that pat...have you done this crawl before or are you using your elite Rhondo claering raids as a measuring bar (note I have the 15ac aug in my magelo from actually having done the crawl)? <br />
<br />
Well, I'm the one that said that, and yes, it's the easiest thing on earth to get to Pxets in 15 mins or less with invis/break/fight/reinvis.    Not all the dogs see invis, and since the hallways are long and aggro ranges are tiny, you can see them coming from a mile away, clear a spot (consisting of 2 mobs), and wait for the dog to come, kill it, re-invis, and  keep moving.   <br />
<br />
A REAL casual group will need to break to them...this implies knocking down the pats and crawling...a laborous challenge for the FT/AC &quot;challenged&quot;. please stop acting like you know what you what are talking about if you dont have the logistics of doing the actaul activity down.<br />
<br />
I've done it a number of times.    There's nothing &quot;laborous&quot; about invising, killing a couple mobs, reinvising and moving, or nothing that a &quot;real casual' group can't do.  Conning mobs to see if they see invis isn't a skill only made available to raiders.  Furthermore, even IF you had to fight in, isn't that *exactly* what you had to do in Sebilis to get to any named?    <br />
<br />
Also, have done the trckster with a number of pick up groups (set camp outside that alcove kill from that point). It is ridiculously easy to wipe to him with pickups (let alone the FT/skills of a casual group). Again if you REALLY want to learn the context take a lvl 65 toon in bazaar gear and limited aas and then form a pickup and try it...dont use your Time+ geared toon.<br />
<br />
The thing you're missing here is that the single most powerful tool against Chavoor (or any Vxed/Tipt named for that matter) doesn't require anything but a charm spell.  It doesn't require any AA's, or Time+ gear, or anything else, just a spell.</div></div><hr />

Go to an old server, and you'll see that things are quite different than the utopia you paint. <br />

I'm not saying your lying, but that's not my experience in EQ and I can only base my opinions on my personal experience.<br />

<br />
ok. Just spoke to one of my ( unemployed ) buddies during my lunch break.<br />
<br />
according to his report on TT:<br />
<br />
Dozekar, Zlandicar, Snotalak, Yelinak, WToV and NToV are all up. Dain is up, Tormax is in fact dead. The Doomshade trigger in UP is spamming, Grieg has spawned. <br />
<br />
Ssraeshza is dead, and I've been told there are several guilds keeping it cleared. Looks like you're right about this one. <br />
<br />
The reality of the matter is that the game exists far beyond your realm of sight. Like life, it simply does not end at your clipping plane on Terris Thule. (one of the newer servers, i might add).<br />
<br />
Once again I can only comment on the game based on my own experiences of it ... that much is true. <br />
<br />
But what am I doing wrong exactly that after 4 years of playing EQ I'm still having a great time and I'm not filled with such outrage, posting how SOE sucks and the game sucks and so forth?<br />
<br />
they are the experiences of many people who live their lives, and play EQ second (IE : I don't fucking follow some goddamned &quot;Raid at 6pm, attendance mandatory 5 of 6 days of the week&quot; bullshit. I play when I get done doing what I need to do for the day) I'm productive with my time. <br />
<br />
I don't do that either. I work full time and between volunteering for the lodge and doing going out with my friends I don't have the time to play EQ 6 days a week either. In fact i didn't log in for the entire month of may because I was just too busy and had too many other things going on. <br />
<br />
Just the other night I my guild did a raid for a flag I happened to be missing. I had to work late and couldn't be there. One of the officers of my guild, knowing I was going to be working late and I'd miss this raid, logged my toon in at the end to get the flag for me. Why? Not because it's a guild policy to do that, but because my guildmates are my friends and they like me, and want to see me progress. <br />
<br />
If the people you play with when you log in wouldn't do this ... If the people on your server are so mean and bitter ... maybe you should seriously look into a server transfer. I find it hard to believe people are such assholes everywhere but where I am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's all well and good.  The problem is, as I mentioned in my original post that you completely ignored, that you not only base everything off your own opinion and experience, you then come back after being told by numerous people that your experience is not the experience of the vast majority of EQ players and telling them they are wrong because that isn't the experience you have had.<br />
<br />
You are entitled to your opinion as is everyone else and you are more then welcome to express those opinions and experiences.  What pisses people off to no end is your fucking elitist attitude that because you see everything as one way then everyone must see it as the same way.  That's great that in your world uber guilders don't bottom feed, they don't cock block, planes and GoD progression are insanely easy and attainable by all.  But that's not the experience of most other people so stop coming back and telling us it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ezedriel7th Ham</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest misconception most people make is that because you are casual, you are inherintly unskilled or proned to stupidity.  That's a pretty unfair analysis of a casual player, and refusing to give them the benefit of the doubt is, well, bullshit.<br />
<br />
My best friend plays a level 57 cleric.  She doesn't have much time to play due to RL necessities, her computer is a little fubared thus keeping her further, and she's in a, well, not so admirable guild.  <br />
<br />
She's been in her 50's for almost a year due to her poor amount of time on, but the time she *is* on, she makes full use of it, and is one of the best clerics I've ever grouped with.  Hands down I'd trust her before I'd trust most clerics in high end guilds.  She's simply that good and adaptable.<br />
<br />
She's also willing to constantly try new things.  At 57 she was there in Ferubi with us, in Riwwi.  Her words were &quot;Man this place rules&quot;.  She is very poorly geared, not even with an epic yet, but she's learned adaptability.  You don't have to be a raider to not suck or to be smart or to be good at the game.<br />
<br />
But by some of your peoples' arguements, she has to suck, because she's not a raider.  That's wrong.<br />
<br />
See, you're not getting it at all. I give your opinion of my opinion no value. Zero. None. It doesn't matter. You're an arrogant self righteous ass who is trying to convince other people that their perceptions and opinions are wrong. You can't do that. You can only fail.<br />
<br />
Who's stepping on the pedestal of self-righteousness now here Glattius?<br />
<br />
Your biggest problem is you see that I'm telling you you're wrong, and now you get all offended and want to start yelling at people.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you're right that convincing you that Gates of Discord has merit is impossible.<br />
<br />
Because you've made up your mind already.  Not necessarily through experimentation, but by word-of-mouth.  If that's enough for you, then that's fine.<br />
<br />
But don't then come to a board and say &quot;There's nowhere casual friendly&quot; just because you've made up your mind already without actually experiencing it.<br />
<br />
 And while you can continue to try and whittle away at my credibility and attempt to portray me personally as uninformed and therefore someone with an invalid opinion, the truth of the matter is I'm not the only one with this opinion. To discredit me means you're also going to have to discredit a hell of a lot of other people who share a similar opinion. Sounds like a full time job. Good luck with that.<br />
<br />
Glattius, I don't need to sit here and try to whittle away at your credibility.  I don't want to sit here and whittle away at your credibility.  Your credibility means nothing to me.  However, I am also not making you out to sound uninformed.<br />
<br />
By admission, you are  uninformed.  You have admitted you don't know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
You haven't hunted in Riwwi.  You haven't done the sewers.  You haven't done Qinimi.  You haven't been to Ferubi.<br />
<br />
So therefore any arguement you make in the contrary of these zones is invalid.  I assure you, all 5500 of your hitpoints would be upgraded by hunting in those zones.  Trust me on this Glattius.<br />
<br />
You're also right again.  There are lots of people who don't know the values of Gates of Discord, but base their opinon on it off of their local bazaar channels.  It doesn't matter, you're the only currently crying out the most about it, that's why I'm responding to you.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, if you were to go hunt in these zones, you'd learn first hand why you're wrong.  If you can handle hunting in Plane of Valor you can easily handle hunting in Riwwi.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile those of us pissed off at SOE and what they've done to the game in the last 2 years are taking our dollars somewhere else where they'll be more apperciated, even if we don't happen to want to spend chunks of 4-6 hours with 72 of our closest friends several times a week in order to have fun and feel rewarded.<br />
<br />
Well...then you and your five buddies should have fun playing City of Heroes.<br />
<br />
But throwing around the &quot;I'm taking my money and going elsewhere&quot; threat, well, doesn't work.  I'll be 100% honest.  No one cares.  Not because it's you of course, but because anyone who puts themselves on the level to say &quot;SOE fix what I want right now or I leave&quot; has essentially lost their credibility.<br />
<br />
If EQ is that displeasing to you, then leave.  I play lots of other video games.  In fact, quite recently, I picked up the game War and Peace.  This game has, well, a lot of flaws to it.<br />
<br />
Recently, I stopped playing it.  I did not find www.thesteelprussia.org and say &quot;Hey, fix content for the lower Prussians&quot;.  I said &quot;Hey, this game sucks, I don't want to play it any more&quot;, and went on to a new game.<br />
<br />
In short, good luck with your continued attempts at belittling and degrading paying customers such as myself with your self serving elitist propaganda. But you don't pay my subscription fees every month, I do. Therefore what you think is completely and totally 100% irrelevant.<br />
<br />
You can think of me however you want.  I don't care.<br />
<br />
Because you are misinformed and seemingly have an ignorance that you force upon yourself willingly, your opinion means even less to me.  Call it self serving elitist propaganda.<br />
<br />
Though if you'd take a look at my current main's magelo, I am far from an &quot;elitist&quot;.<br />
<br />
In fact, humorously enough, I'm decked out entirely in Gates of Discord one group gear.<br />
<br />
Isn't it curious how that works?<br />
<br />
That's why what I have to say about Gates of Discord (having been decked out completely there from oh I donno...a CRYPT ROBBER'S CHESTPLATE, an Orc Fang Earring, and other such bazaar atrocities) holds a little more merit than what you say about Gates of Discord...someone who admittedly has never gone there except for one time where you got crushed.<br />
<br />
By your theory, no good-aligned player should ever have gone back to West Commons.  Instead, they should have complained and ranted and whined because Kizdean Gix was &quot;too hard&quot;, that &quot;the zone was not compatible&quot;.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with a lot of the casual theories is that they assume that because they don't have the same time as everyone else, that the time that they spend should result in more reward.  That they should be pushed ahead and given handicaps because of their inability to play.<br />
<br />
I don't play a lot of my games very often.  That doesn't mean I should be scooted to the end level simply because I don't play it very often.<br />
<br />
It means if I want to see the end, I should sit down, pick up my control pad, and actually play it.<br />
<br />
What has been called for casuals is becoming increasingly open to casuals.<br />
<br />
No one believed casuals could take down Avatar of War during Velious.  Now, casuals laugh at you for suggesting they can't take down the Avatar of War.  <br />

Except for every now and again, during weekends, after a patch, after a server crash, people go &quot;Hey, wouldn't it be fun to go back and kill X mob?&quot;  Note that's not cockblocking, that's &quot;Hey, wouldn't it be fun to go back and kill X mob?&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope with your theories that people shouldn't be allowed to kill old content mobs, you stay the hell away from the Orc camps as you're passing through the Commons, that you stay away from Dorn B`Dynn.  That you stay away from LGuk.<br />
<br />
And when you're travelling from West Freeport to the Magus Camp that you don't swipe at any of the moss snakes.  I hope you stay away from Sebilis, and certainly refrain from shakerpaging any old world zone.</div></div><hr />

Assertions like all the Old World dragons, all the ST keys mobs, all the flag mobs on the way to the EP's, all the Ssra mobs, Seru, KT, Dain, etc. are dead and Ferubi death touches all that enter on Server X CAN be checked.<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, yes, there is no doubt some &quot;cockblocking&quot; occurs. However, LDoN, Sewers, Vxed, Tipt, Ikkinz4, and Uqua are instanced. Totally independent of the VT/Ssra/Seru content that can be skipped, or even EP/PoTime content that can be &quot;cockblocked&quot;, two other paths to higher content are wide open.<br />
<br />
Need a haste item? Well no one can prevent you from getting a Soulscream Belt, or an LDoN haste aug, or Tribute haste. Need a decent BP? I seem to recall one in LDoN that's pretty competitive.<br />
<br />
Local server conditions can, I'm sure, make progress more difficult - but it's hard to saddle SoE with reasponsibility for griefers on your server. Believe me, other than on those rare servers with rotations, everybody in &quot;uber&quot; guilds have raced other guilds to ST or AoW. It's part of the game.<br />
<br />
Fortunately no one guild can camp every mob in the game simultainiously. Most guilds afaik who have entered challanging and rewarding new content focus on that and not retro raids for loot that's inferior to stuff they can get in their current target list.<br />

<br />
No, I see you telling me I'm wrong and your expectation that I'm going to take your word for it.  Your experiences aren't my experiences.  Your words that everything is peachy don't jive with my personal experiences.  Your expectation that I should reject my own observations, experiences, perceptions, and those of numerous other people and instead accept yours at face value as being more correct is where you come across as arrogant.<br />
<br />
You're entitled to your opinion.  I'm entitled to mine.  Apparently they don't agree.  But I'm not telling you that you have to change your opinion to agree with mine, I don't care if you don't agree.  Lots of people don't agree with me at one time or another.  Just as lots of people agree with me at one time or another as well.  I don't need your agreement.  But you certainly seem to feel the need to either convert me to your perspective or attempt to convince anyone who might be reading this that I'm wrong.  Why?  Why do you care?  If people are leaving the game because of, as you seem to feel, misperceptions and inaccuracies, why do you give a damn?  What's it to you?<br />
<br />
I think you're wrong.  And I'm not willing to come back to EQ just to verify that belief one way or the other.  The game isn't fun anymore.  I'm not wasting my time and my money on it.  And after four years of being a dedicated player, SoE has pissed me off to the point I don't want anything to do with their online games.  I find it hard to believe that if I've come to this point, that there can't be hundreds, maybe thousands, of people who've arrived at the same conclusions.  All the grandstanding and arguing you can present isn't going to change that one iota.  People don't care what you think about the game.  Most don't even care what I think about the game.  What people care about is what they themselves think about the game.<br />
<br />
Lets check the subscription numbers in six months and see who's closer to right, shall we?  If EQ's numbers are holding fairly steady at levels similar to those they had prior to GoD, I'll admit mine was obviously the minority opinion.  But I don't think that will be the case.  I believe, with a great deal of confidence, that barring some pretty extreme changes on SoE's part, that those numbers will be down, SIGNFICANTLY.  Only time will tell if I'm right or I'm wrong.  Meanwhile, quit trying to convince me I'm wrong, because I'm not buying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS.I assume people post here because they care about the game and tanking in it.The hate soe stuff is tired.I agree they do a lot of things wrong,but, they obviously do more things right atm for most of us.Anyone can log in and progress ...the game is laid out in front of you.That it needs tuning ...constantly I agree with.I imagine even when Kunark was the top expansion everyone had to raid for the top end gear?So if you want to be in competitive top end gear you've always had to raid.Yeah I know...pop gear is a much bigger leap than stuff before it.My wife and I had tons of fun exploring ykesha before I got into the raiding thing again(I never cared wat X warrior had for a bp from his raid guild either) and we woulda loved taking time to look through GOD.Now our online time is like 90 pct raiding with our team,but, thats great fun too.<br />
<br />
There are ways to progress for everyone.You can play and probably have fun and more stuff is likey to pop up.If the competitive gear thing is really important to you you can raid like everyone else had to.It's a bigger challenge to play well on a raid than in a 6 man group.If you don't think so imo you're never pulled your weight consistently in a raid force...try it again and play for the team you might like it.If not then accept that there will be significant differances between what a 6 man team can take down as caompared to a raid force.Play to explore have fun and I bet you'll progress anyways.</div></div><hr />

yes you are indeed living in a fantasy land. the worst trains ive ever seen were created for fun by high end guilds. there are plenty of jerks to go around at all levels. but this statement &lt;&lt;Guilds serve as a filter to weed out sociapaths and badly behaved children&gt;&gt; only makes you out to look like one of those sociopaths who looks with contempt on everyone who hasnt achieved your toon status.<br />

grumbam let me remind me you of something. eq is nothing but a huge timesink game. while others are out there doing something useful with their lives to better themselves their familiies and their fellow man you and i are squandering our time on self pleasure by entertaining ourselves all night long night after night on eq. at least i admit its a vice. but you state that those who are not in time guilds are much more likely to be sociopaths and &quot;badly behaved children&quot;. grow up grumbam.</div></div><hr />

Local server conditions can, I'm sure, make progress more difficult - but it's hard to saddle SoE with reasponsibility for griefers on your server. Believe me, other than on those rare servers with rotations, everybody in &quot;uber&quot; guilds have raced other guilds to ST or AoW. It's part of the game. Fortunately no one guild can camp every mob in the game simutainiously.<br />

<br />
Well first off Battle, I'm not sure why you addressed this post to me since I never made any of the claims you talk about, I merrily pointed out that someone is repeatedly telling me that what has happened to me hasn't happened to me.<br />
<br />
But since you addressed it to me, I shall respond.  I myself reside on the Cazic server.  On this server the top guild is The Relentless.  I have no guild and none of my R/L friends play the game any longer so I am completely reliant on pickup groups if I want to do anything that can't be soloed by a Rogue with a Druid on the second box.  I have tried to do the Soulscream camp that you mentioned for an alt since my mains progression is pretty much were it's going to stay.  Unfortunately, every time I attempted to do this camp there has either been a group there with legitimate need for the item which is how it should be, or more likely, a TR necro running from named camp to named camp dropping PH's and if you try to move into a camp that they aren't currently at, they will just ks the PH/Named.  I can't tell you how many times I have been moving to a camp in a zone and been leap frogged by Time+ geared fuckers that feel it's their right to do so because they own the server, they are top dog.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the GoD progression that everyone seems to believe is freely and readily available to everyone.  As I mentioned before, I am completely reliant on pick up groups since there isn't a chance in hell I'm doing anything in GoD with a rogue and a druid.  To date, having had the GoD expansion for 2 months,  I have been in a group in GoD once, we started a GoD trial for XP only, supposedly, at which point we moved in and as soon as the named spawn we moved to it, killed it, the groups Tank got the drop and the group disbanded.  That makes my total time spent doing anything in god exactly 47 minutes.  Mind you, GoD is the only place I will take a group now because I'll admit, it was fun as hell, but that also means I haven been doing alot of jack and shit for a long time in game.  Is this the acceptable GoD progression you speak of?  Oh, I know I should make myself friends or find myself a guild right because my play style isn't the right kind right?</div></div><hr />

I had to work late and couldn't be there. One of the officers of my guild, knowing I was going to be working late and I'd miss this raid, logged my toon in at the end to get the flag for me. Why? Not because it's a guild policy to do that, but because my guildmates are my friends and they like me, and want to see me progress. <br />
<br />
If the people you play with when you log in wouldn't do this ... If the people on your server are so mean and bitter ... maybe you should seriously look into a server transfer. I find it hard to believe people are such assholes everywhere but where I am.<br />

If the game does not suit you, go play another one. Worst thing that can happen is that every game try to please every single player. Seriously, soloing in EQ is dead long ago. Like LONG ago, there is no need to bring this part of the game back at this point for a LOT of reasons (wasted designing content, impossibility to balance class between raid / group / solo and so on). If you just refuse to play with other players, EQ is not for you, when most of the content is designed for 50+ people raid and full single group ( PoP / LDoN / GoD)</div></div><hr />

You're entitled to your opinion.  I'm entitled to mine.  Apparently they don't agree.  But I'm not telling you that you have to change your opinion to agree with mine, I don't care if you don't agree.  Lots of people don't agree with me at one time or another.  Just as lots of people agree with me at one time or another as well.  I don't need your agreement.  But you certainly seem to feel the need to either convert me to your perspective or attempt to convince anyone who might be reading this that I'm wrong.  Why?<br />
<br />
Because you're wrong.<br />
<br />
That's why I'm telling you you're wrong.<br />
<br />
You're trying to get changes or trying to get people to be of a similar, incorrect mind.  That's why I'm telling you you're wrong.<br />
<br />
On the same note, why do *you* care what I have to say about this topic?<br />
<br />
I had never addressed you until you went off on me.  From there, I responded to you, and learned that you know nothing about your debate subject.  <br />
<br />
  Why do you care?  If people are leaving the game because of, as you seem to feel, misperceptions and inaccuracies, why do you give a damn?  What's it to you?<br />
<br />
Leave the game, you're right I don't care.  Funny thing is, I don't think Sony cares either, they have enough player base at the moment to not care if the great Glatius quits the game.  You like to on one hand call me arrogant, and then on the other act as though your threats of leaving hold some kind of ground with Sony.<br />
<br />
Why do I &quot;give a damn&quot;?  Because you're spreading about false information, and I'm clarifying it.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you see this as arrogance but...you're wrong.  You are not right.  Your statements to the effect of Gates of Discord being inadequate for the casual player are ungrounded.<br />
<br />
I think you're wrong.  And I'm not willing to come back to EQ just to verify that belief one way or the other.  The game isn't fun anymore.  I'm not wasting my time and my money on it.  And after four years of being a dedicated player, SoE has pissed me off to the point I don't want anything to do with their online games.  <br />
<br />
Funny thing is...they've been PALMFEEDING the casual player.  Lost Dungeons, Legacy of Ykesha, Gates of Discord, easily accessible high exp zones with Planes of Power, easily acquired items of great power in comparison to older items that required raids...what part of that doesn't benefit the casual player?<br />
<br />
Oh that's right, the part where they don't put a Riwwi book in and make everything drop like rain for you.<br />
<br />
 I find it hard to believe that if I've come to this point, that there can't be hundreds, maybe thousands, of people who've arrived at the same conclusions.  <br />
<br />
You know why the game began to lose it's glimmer to me?<br />
<br />
Because they are giving too much to casual players simply because the casuals whine and moan.<br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge...was a bad idea.  Really, it was.  And that's currently there for no other reason than because casuals wanted an easy way to get across Norrath with no need for a CR.<br />
<br />
The fact that what it took me to get powerful has been completely tossed aside, and people can obtain that same power within a month, and they STILL have the audacity to whine and complain.<br />
<br />
If you've quit the game, then stop talking about it already.  You've made up your mind - and obviously the cancelling of your subscription hasn't effected Sony as dearly as you seemed to have hoped it would.<br />
<br />
 All the grandstanding and arguing you can present isn't going to change that one iota.  People don't care what you think about the game.  Most don't even care what I think about the game.  What people care about is what they themselves think about the game.<br />
<br />
If they want to quit based on false information, then they're stupid.<br />
<br />
I'm presenting accurate information, perhaps they can go &quot;Hey, maybe Gates isn't THAT tough, I'll give it a try.&quot;  Then they'll realize that it's not nearly as hard as you make it out to be or as all the other casuals make it out to be, and actually enjoy the game some more.<br />
<br />
Lets check the subscription numbers in six months and see who's closer to right, shall we?  If EQ's numbers are holding fairly steady at levels similar to those they had prior to GoD, I'll admit mine was obviously the minority opinion.  But I don't think that will be the case.  I believe, with a great deal of confidence, that barring some pretty extreme changes on SoE's part, that those numbers will be down, SIGNFICANTLY.  Only time will tell if I'm right or I'm wrong.  Meanwhile, quit trying to convince me I'm wrong, because I'm not buying.<br />
<br />
I don't need to convince you you're wrong.  I'm happy with the fact that you *are* wrong.<br />
<br />
Though the fact that you think you can argue a point you are admittedly 100% ignorant about is rather funny.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, see, this would be nice if there weren't so many high enders running around bored. One week it's player_X and his buddies, the next it's player_Y and his buddies, the next five it's player_Z and his buddies alt farming, the four after that it's player_Q deciding he needs a quick bout of cash for his rent.<br />
<br />
And no, most casuals don't gank named well below them that I've seen.<br />
<br />
Partha, there isn't some unwritten code that all casuals obey because they want the high enders to obey it too.<br />
<br />
If they see a named up, they'll decide to kill it just as quickly as a high end player.<br />
<br />
Farming content isn't as big an issue now adays as it was - simply because way back when, there was so little content, that those things that were farmed, were some of the only exp places for casuals.<br />
<br />
Now...an entire collage of places are open, but no one wants to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. that's not even close to what i said<br />
<br />
I said Raajs' guild is far LESS likely to have sociopaths and badly behaved children ... since those sorts of people don't get accepted as members. <br />
<br />
My guild doesn't accept those kinds of people either, and if they act out they get booted. Every guild I've ever belonged to does this. <br />
<br />
<br />
You all have nearly convinced me that I'm some kind of freak because I am not all outraged at the state of everquest ... but then I ran into this post: <br />
<br />
I see a lot of folks saying that they are casual players and don't have time to group.  EQ has always been about grouping.  Nothing in the 5 year history of the game has changed that.  If you have made it to 65, as a casual player, you most likely had to group.  Grouping has been and will always be a necessary part of advancement in EQ, even if we decide to add Solo adventure zones.  <br />
 <br />
Raiding on the other hand is optional.  If you want the bigger rewards, then you will have to raid. The amount of group content as compared to raid content is enormous and there is much that can be done in short amounts of time with a group.  There are over 200 hundred zones in EQ.  Many unused, but capable of supporting small group encounters for an hour or two.  Omens will have fewer raid content and more group content than Gates did.  It will not require many flags to progress so few zones will be locked to any players but it will still require a group effort for the most part, as EQ always has.<br />
 <br />
I am what you have labeled as a casual player.  I have a few characters in the 60s and I am nowhere as hardcore as many of you.  I have been playing for over 5 years now.  I have only raided twice.  I can logon and find plenty to do in a couple hours of play time.  I know that I am not going to get the cool Time or Gates gear unless I raid and I okay with that.  That is not a time investment I want to make, nor is it the way I choose to play the game.  <br />
 <br />
So is this argument that you have nothing to do outside of raiding if you are a casual player?  Which I believe, and I know many of you will agree, is false.   Or is this argument really about wanting the raid awards (loot) without having to raid?<br />

<br />
  You are talking about numbers here. More levels, more hp, more ac, more stats... All useless. There is a very limited way to progress your character, and frankly, none of it's new. BoT grinding gets old. LDoN runs get VERY old. LoY isn't good experience or loot(I don't have this expansion, so take that for what it is... Me parroting what I've HEARD.). Upgrading gear and stats is nice, but it really does lose some of its luster when you are no longer moving anywhere while doing it. If raiders had as many zones locked to them as non-raiders do, raiders would be raising hell... And rightly so.<br />
<br />
  GoD brought in trials, which were a good thing... IF you could convince everyone of it. There is most definitely a bias against GoD from a non-raider perspective. It's too bad, really, but it's there and that's that. You won't be able to convince the average LFG player to go there with a pickup group. It's perception, like rangers sucking or monks being worthless; not true, but still there. <br />
<br />
  Once again for emphasis. Gear without new content gets very boring. Non-raid players are getting half the content per expansion than raid players are, and very few of the unique challenges of raid targets. This is a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, fuck off with your go play another game bullshit.  This game used to be something great where people that weren't in guilds that could field 100+ people could still do almost all of the content and while &quot;casual&quot; players were never as well equiped as uber guilders atleast the gap wasn't as insanely monsterous as it is now; then it morphed into an elite guild pandering shit box.  You show me on the original EQ game specifications where it says I have to have 74 other people with me to accomplish anything in the game and I'll stop bitching about having to.   <br />
<br />
I have no problem with playing with other people, I don't solo anymore because it isn't entertaining, but that doesn't change the fact that I have hit a brick wall as far as my progression goes.  I could join a guild, but with the time I have to put into the game I don't qualify for any guild that is any further along then I already am.  I currently have half the HP and 2/3rds the Atk of a high end Rogue and I have no progression path to come even close to that.  I have worked hard for what my toon has, I have done things with 6 people that I've seen guilds fuck up, but despite all my hard work and long hours played over 5 years I still have jack shit compared to what an uber guilder can get in 2 hours of raiding one evening.  It's fuckin bullshit and you can say what you want about desire and ability, I can play circles around most uber guilders with any class on the server because I have had to learn to be that good if I wanted to get even as far as I have, and my reward for that is mediocrity.  <br />
<br />
I could sit in a raid with 75 other people and pretend like I'm doing something while I watch a movie too, but that's just pussy lecher bullshit, big guild does not necessarily mean big skill.  But I've gotten off my main point.  I am willing to group with others, and I go lfg and actively look for groups in GoD every night I play and the fruits of my labor has been 1 group in 2 months.  So don't piss on my head and tell me it's raining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at Mokor's alternate magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=528126&amp;alt=230751).  It reaches 7k hp with just early GoD gear, no LDON gear.  Add some LDON Tak armor (e.g. hat) and some LDON augments and some hard LDON loot, and that magelo profile would easily reach 7600 hp.  That's a 10k-buffed warrior who's never raided.  I can't imagine an EP group turning him down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish I had never, in light of all the problems I was having with GoD, started reading the boards. I would be far happier with my situation hoping that there was the possibility of positive change for all players rather than just a small group of elite wannabes. Do we (non raiders) so severely diminish your ego that you cant handle us coming into content that is now going on 2 expansions old? Is this game a proxy for your inadequacies in other places?  Being an uber EQ player is an accomplishment but its not going to save humanity or mean your children will be productive adults (in fact it may mean the opposite). I suggest some here get some perspective. ITS A DAMN GAME AND SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. THIS IS NOT WORK. THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE.<br />
<br />
And for some of you who say Glatius doesnt matter, well guess what he does (as if implying that he doesnt matter means that you in fact do). It starts with 1 or 2 people and becomes far more if things arent fixed. He is a symptom of the problem not the source. If SOE doesnt care about losses like him then we are all doomed to play a dying game.  <br />
<br />
If SOE doesnt care about losses like him then we are all doomed to play a dying game. In the past it hasnt mattered (no real competition) and this has bred the ingrown hatred that is manifesting itself on this board and highlighted in the stupid title of this thread. It aint gonna work much longer folks and those of us who would like to keep playing would ask all to at least think outside of your box (or the box you moved past 2 years ago).<br />
<br />
And as for you Eze, guess what, I DO MATTER MORE THAN YOU. If only for the simple fact that when I walk they will lose 8 accounts in one shot. Its about money and not because I am better than you. Guess that makes me leet in some sick fucking way. No Ebay/PA for my guys, anyone left at that point will be logged in my favorite spots, deleted, and canceled. Bye bye $1000+ a year not including expansions.<br />

At this point you did not wonder why you could not get a group ? When some random dude ask me if I want to join their Sewer / Vxed / Tipt group, there's no way i'm going to accept. Know why ? because it's not THAT easy, and do require some team work, people you can rely on. Neither can be found in a pick up group, which is, just a bunch of random people that never played together.<br />
If you want to do cutting edge content, you need a 'serious' team, people that are ready to miserably fail to learn.<br />

BB<br />
<br />
Not really.  Brenlo is just stating pretty much what we all are stating.  Casual players, on this board anyway, know that they aren't going to be #1 without raiding.  Our point is mostly this, when EQ firsted started anyone could go to any zone and fight or whatever they like doing.  In some of these zones were an &quot;end boss&quot; type NPC that required a raid force to take down, and for these peoples ability to follow like sheep and zerg a beefed up NPC, they got a special peice of loot that couldn't be obtained any other way.  Did this loot double their stats in comparison to someone who doesn't feel like being one of the herd of hundreds? No, but it gave them an advantage but not an incermountable one compared to a non-raider. <br />
<br />
However, now a days a casual player can not even access a zone, despite the fact they could fight and xp fine in that zone, unless they are a member of a group of 75 that can take down the &quot;end boss&quot;.  I, as a casual player, am not asking for the best of the best nor am I asking to be able to take down RZ with a force of 6.  Why should the raid reward equipment be 3 times the stats I can get after grinding LDoN's daily for a month, for once peice of equipment.  The ability to raid doesn't show skill, it shows the ability to follow someone elses orders and all click on the same mob at the same time. <br />
<br />
All I am asking is that I be allowed to atleast enter zones that I payed as much as anyone else to see every month.  It's just dumb shit that a zone be limited to people that can zerg a boss mob to get access to a zone that has plenty of single group encounters and XP spots.  It's basically saying &quot;Hey, you can whack at a mob with a fuck ton of other people, your reward for this ability to gather a large group of people is access to a zone with single group content, or soloable even, with drops that aren't worth it to you but that you can sell to those &quot;casual&quot; gamers for inflated fees.&quot;<br />
<br />
So back off with the &quot;You just want everything without working for it&quot; comments.  Raiding isn't work either unless you are the 1 or 2 people leading it, but you still get the same chance as them at the big pay off.</div></div><hr />

No Brenlo just proved that he doesnt understand his customer base (as did the guild summit) and is likely just helping drive this thing into the ground. People play as long as they are interested (and in EQ's case arguably some point beyond). Then they stop, as does the money.<br />
<br />
I would argue these boards are dominated by raiders because there is not only a shared information aspect (which is more useful at the very low and then again high end of the game and especially related to raid tactics) but also a BIG SWINGING DICK FACTOR. The 10-20% EP+ raiders risk their future game to the rest of us if you push this thing too far down the slippery slope that PoP started and GoD kicked into overdrive. If the softcap doesnt move then more and more wil hit it and leave, simple as that.<br />

What's wrong with that ? You don't like the fact that there are CHALLENGING single group encounter, that actualy require more than just time to beat ? (ie unlike LDoN normal adv)<br />
<br />
Why should you be able to beat ANY single group encounter with ANY fucking group of newbies ? where's the challenge ? where's the achievement ? where's the fun ? fun is when  you KNOW like in LDoN you'll get you're fucking shitty upgrade every X fucking hour ? When you're not like 'OMG WE DID IT' (yeah I nearly shouted this RL in the middle of the night after defeating the diabolic destroyer a couple of weeks after GoD release) but like 'cool i'm earning Y points of LDoN per day in X day i'll be able to afford a nice piece of armor' then YOU are the one playing EQ like a RL work.<br />
<br />
If there is ONE thing EQ doesn't need, it's MORE trivial single group content. There's plenty of it around. EQ need a single group progression, progression means not only progression in loot but also progression in DIFFICULTY.</div></div><hr />

Well maybe if you actually read my posts you knee jerk shitbag, you might fuckin realize that I'm not asking for trivial fuckin encounters.  I enjoy a challenge as much as the next person.  But lets think about this for a second, You are telling me that these encounters require a group of people that you know, are experienced with, have fought with before on a regular bases,   and have a tried and true history with.  So that's great, you have developed an expantion for a group of 6 people and only those 6 people because no one else can be trusted to know what they are doing enought to give them a chance.  Great way to encourage more people to stick with or even buy the game in the first place.  People just picking up this game today and installing it have almost no chance what so ever of even seening the limited aspects of the game I have seen over the last 5 years.  Way to ensure the longevity of the game.</div></div><hr />

And still you don't HAVE to get a great group, you have to if and only if you want to do the most challenging content. And it's not like these encounter will remain forever out of reach of pick up groups, mudflation will end up by beating them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...<br />
<br />
Guilds serve as a filter to weed out sociapaths and badly behaved children. If I am grouping with a members of Raajs' guild for example ( Clan Ta Veren ) I know right up front their NOT going to act like a jackass, because Jackasses aren't accepted into CTV in the first place. <br />
<br />
<br />
Are you fucking kidding me?  No.  Lets be frank here, you aren't kidding anyone, including all of the raiders on this thread.   I would bet that almost every single raider here has faced the problem of reflagging and backflagging total n00bs that they personally felt never deserved access to the elementals or Time or GoD because the real solid core of the guild either hated it so goddamn much they all left or they grew disgusted with the game and left.   If your guild hasn't personally backflagged these useless tards, then I bet you know of an elemental or Time guild on your server that has.  The term &quot;zerg guild&quot; is wellknown and well-used for a reason and I'd suspect almost every single server has at least one.  <br />
<br />
So don't try to feed me this bullshit about how the guilds serve as a filter and only the best players have access to the planes and beyond blahblahblah.  It's a crock and, what's more, you know it's a crock.   Maybe you are trying to convince yourself that you are leet or maybe you think the non-raiders won't know this.  Well since one such non-raider also happens to have a main in a raiding guild and refuses to maintain the necessary snobbery and silence I guess the secret is out.   If you wanna try to tell me that you never experienced this mass backflagging of complete morons AND you never saw it happen from a similarly situated guild on your server, then I think the only person you'd be lying to is yourself. <br />
<br />
With that said, I don't see any reason why the planes should require flags.  All it does is force the raiding guilds to keep backflagging because - news flash - in my opinion pretty much everyone who wants to see the elemental planes and is able to sell out to a large guild will eventually make it through one of the mass recruit madnesses, no matter how retarded or useless they are.  Can they breath?  Then they're in!  Might as well give them access and, with them, the solid casual playerbase who has played for years, knows their class like the back of their hand, and refuses to give in to raiding pressures.</div></div><hr />

Not only to entertain me outside raids, because raiders progression do not come from single group encounters, but also because people not in guilds or small guilds need goals they can achieve, someday, something out of reach for the moment, but with some time &amp; practice will become possible.<br />
Hard LDoN were quite , well hard, when LDoN was released, with only players of top guilds doing them. Now It's not even someone in a top raiding guild who is #1 LDoN hard adv on my server. And there are a lot of very nice items to be found there for the non raider, as well as some challenge, yet possible to achieve with a pick up group. Once said non raiders master hard LDoN they can do GoD single group content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, Vox and Naggy were intended to be single-group encounters.  Sony was shocked when the player-base &quot;cheated&quot; with multiple groups to take down the dragons.  I don't think Sony has quite recovered.  Oh, your point was?  :p   Do you honestly believe it takes you more effort to get your EP armor than it does a casual player to acquire the LDoN wins to get fully-augmented LDoN armor?<br />
<br />
It works both ways so I don't see why you are being an ass on the one side - your entire argument above is completely and utterly worthless and besides the point.   I know countless non-raiders who have played the game since 99.  In fact, I started Vig in 1999.  You can imagine how happy I am when someone creates a character (or buys one!), powerlevels up to 65, joins an EP guild in the midst of mass back-flagging, and now wears Raex armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BB, you're not getting it.  People don't give a damn what raiders have.  People care about being able to deal with the new content of the majority of an expansion, not just one little corner that they're allowed in on sufference, and feeling like they're making what they feel is reasonable progress.  That class diety armor you make a big deal about is now 4 expansions old and hasn't been allowed to progress. <br />
<br />
Many of us don't feel like we're getting reasonable progress.  We don't feel our time is well spent or well rewarded.  We don't feel we're having fun anymore.  When Kunark came out, anyone could go explore and advanture there.  Same with Velious and Luclin.  Some areas were harder, some areas were easier, but any player could get to most of all the zones with minimal effort.  That wasn't the case with PoP.  That isn't the case with GoD.  And it most likely won't be the case with OoW.<br />
<br />
But even if they threw open the doors to every zone in the game and made it an all access pass, that still wouldn't solve but part of the problem.  Access does not equal progress.  Having access to a zone doesn't mean you'll be able to handle the content.  Because the content is designed for people like you, geared to the eyeballs with raid loot, not for people like me in a combination of mismatched diety armor and old era velious drops.  And there are lot more people like me in the game than you.  Yet you are getting the lion's share of the content, progress, and feeling of achievement.</div></div><hr />

I like how everyone talks about how uber guilders and raiders are somehow better then non-raiders/casual players.  Unless you organized and lead those raids, explain to me what skill it takes to be a raider?  If I'm in a 6 man group and 1 person fucks up, we are all fucked.  If I'm in a 120 person raid and one person fucks up, or hell, if 30 people don't know EQ from their own asshole, and it doesn't mean shit.  To mean it takes far more skill to accomplish something with 6 then it does 75, so why don't people that actually have more skill get the rewards?<br />
<br />
You're right, people can get to where you were 6 months ago with bazaar loot.  But show me where a 6 man group of even the most skilled people in LDoN and Bazaar equipment can pick up a BP with 300+ HP?</div></div><hr />

But why should I be required to join an uber guild to see even a good portion of the game currently?  My idea of a good time is grouping with a few good friends and doing challenging things.  Not being part of the heard, moving where I'm told when I'm told and turning on attack on the mob I'm told.  It's called Everquest, not Uber Zerg Guild Gets It All.  When EQ first came out I could group with a few good friends and see every inch of the game, even the boss mobs, though you'd usually die soon after.  Now I don't even have that luxury and I'm being told now that I need to conform to what an uber guild and SoE tells me to in order to do anything in a game I pay my fair share to play monthly.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but I'm now being told that I have to be a sheep to an uber guild to get the equipment from the last 2 expantions so that I have a snow balls chance in hell at the single group shit in the new expantion.  That's fucked up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because there is no challenging 1 group content. No pain no gain. 300hp BPs are avaible to handful guilds serverwide. You probably don't even realise the difficulty of some GoD event to say this. <br />
Actualy Ikkinz single group trials are somewhat hard, and the drop a potime quality. 1 group content. <br />
<br />
You're already complaining that GoD single group trials are too hard, and you'd want single group event on part with the raid difficulty content ? me think you don't fully realise what you are asking for. You're asking for 6 hours long single group expedition, that you can only try once every 5 days, that you'll get kicked off if you wipe once, that won't drop any item until you spend 60 hours in them, and of course will not get you any xp in the process. Once you beat it, you'll get 1 item every 3 / 4 time you do it, then it'll be about balanced.</div></div><hr />

Maybe LDON was too little reward for too much time investment.  I can believe that.  I would certainly agree if you suggested that LDON equipment costs be cut to 2/3 or 1/2 of their current levels.<br />
<br />
Maybe SolRo and EPs should be opened up to an alternate access quest for non-raiders.  I can buy that too.  I see casual players in Ferubi a lot, and if they can handle Ferubi then they can handle PoEarth.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't change the fact that there IS a progression path for casual players, which includes LDON as an essential step, and which continues far beyond BoT and LDON, well beyond EP-caliber content.<br />

Maybe one or more of the steps in that progression path needs to be improved.  I'm sure a lot of people would agree with you on that.  The GoD part of the progression was already revised, and is probably as well-tuned as LDON at this point.  That doesn't mean GoD and LDON are ideal; they could both benefit from further attention from Sony.<br />
<br />
But the progression path does exist.  Maybe you were broken by the state of LDON and gave up on EQ at that point, but the path was there for you, and had you continued following it, it would have led you to accomplishments far greater than killing PoEarth trash.</div></div><hr />

No pain no gain. 300hp BPs are avaible to handful guilds serverwide. You probably don't even realise the difficulty of some GoD event to say this. <br />
Actualy Ikkinz single group trials are somewhat hard, and the drop a potime quality. 1 group content. <br />
<br />
You're already complaining that GoD single group trials are too hard, and you'd want single group event on part with the raid difficulty content ? me think you don't fully realise what you are asking for. You're asking for 6 hours long single group expedition, that you can only try once every 5 days, that you'll get kicked off if you wipe once, that won't drop any item until you spend 60 hours in them, and of course will not get you any xp in the process. Once you beat it, you'll get 1 item every 3 / 4 time you do it, then it'll be about balanced.<br />
<br />
See, this is the elitist bullshit that pisses us of.  You seem to think that just the uber raids require more skill or more difficulty then anything a single group encounter could.  That's bullshit.  I raid of 75 takes skill from 1 person, the leader, everyone else has to be smart enough to target the mob he calls and hit attack or count to 5 before hitting their CH button.  An encounter with 6 peoples requires that every member of that party is at the top of their game, they know how to play their class and they need to know how to adapt.  This idea that raids are the end game because they require the top of the skill food chain is bullshit and I'm not gonna eat it.<br />
<br />
Oh no, you spent 6 hours on a raid in the hope of getting that 300HP item and you didn't get it, my fuckin heart bleeds for you.  I spent a month and a half straight doing nothing but grinding LDoN points in the same dungeon over and over and I have a fuckin 16/19 poker to show for it and that poker doesn't form a fuckin key that allows me to enter the plane of uber ness where I can 1 group farm armor.  So take your uber guild sob story and go where someone gives a shit.</div></div><hr />

And yet I still seem to get the same responses.  That's fine, when all is said and done you believe there is a viable progression path.  I don't.  Other people who are at about the same level in the game as I was, when I played, have said the same thing.  We apparently have a fundamental disagreement.  And that's also fine.  I've fixed my problem by going to a different online game where I feel my time is better spent and rewarded.  Those who disagree with me have stayed in EQ.  Now, all I ask, the only thing I would desire, is that people accept that not everyone is going to see EQ the same way you do.  And that rather than running those people down and attemtping to belittle them for feeling differently about a, and let me emphasize this word, game you accept that maybe not everyone sees it the same way.  And if enough people see it differently, maybe it would be in SoE's best finacial interests not to continue down the path they've taken.</div></div><hr />

You obviously have no clue at all of what you are talking about. 300hp BP = top end, not just some shitty guild just making it to potime, TOP END, 500 players serverwide at this tier of the game.

This casual guild (http://triune.150m.com/) is routinely single-grouping in Ferubi on my server.  That's harder content than Hard LDON.  I've watched them before, and they have little downtime.  They seem to be enjoying it, or at least enjoying the rewards.  Look at their web page.  Finishing epics and turning 65 are noteworthy; Droga and Shawl are &quot;raids&quot;.  They're casual players, and yet their groups are choosing to do content that's harder than Elementals.<br />
<br />
Every time you almost convince me that the game is in an unhealthy state for casual players, I run into another group like them, who are demonstrating that the game still works at their pace.  Maybe they're succeeding despite the state of the game rather than because of it, but the point is that they're succeeding, and they're not leaving.  I think the game will survive for a while longer.</div></div><hr />

LOL, yeah, your right I have no clue, this coming from boy blunder.  Ok, so you don't have your 300HP BP, I appologize I bent your e-penis.  So tell me where I get my 200HP BP or my 150HP BP?  You see my fuckin point now knuckle dragger?  If I grind for a month and a half I can get one 100HP peice of armor, that is my &quot;TOP END&quot; where as an uber guild can grind for a month and a half and hit content that drops 300HP items.<br />

EQ is a progression game. You can pretend, but if you didn't win fights and level up you could not ever see Vox. If you couldn't fight past the Juggernaughts you didn't get to see Trak. And later, if you didn't kill one of the right mobs, you didn't get to zone into ST.<br />

<br />
Brenlo didn't &quot;Pwn&quot; anyone, but your reading comprehension sure &quot;pwned&quot; you in this thread.<br />
<br />
Brenlo is a casual player..he said he doesn't have many 60+ characters.  I have 3.  My necro was 60 before Velious came out, and Haass and Cagna were 60 right after.  I've been at the top since the beginning, and I've NEVER been locked out of this much of the game.  In original EQ, the only things that the uber guilds did that I didn't was kill Naggy, Vox, and raid fucking freeport.  Kunark? They had VP to play in, that's fine with me.  I couldn't kill Trakanon or VS or Talendor or Gorenaire, but I could still walk right up to them if I felt the need.<br />
<br />
Velious, they had ToV to play in.  I got to ToV, eventually.  I guess you could say they had plane of mischeif, but who the fuck really worried about that anyway.<br />
<br />
Luclin was such a piece of shit that I really don't care too much about it anyway.  PoP is ass.  You get the ENTIRE expansion to play in because you were a tool in your guild and got to hit A while someone else planned a strategy to kill Rallos Zek.  I have more skill than 80% of the people in your guild, I fucking guarantee it.  That claim applies to EVERY guild.  The difference?  I refuse to find 72 &quot;friends&quot; so I can be l33t.  That's the difference between you and me.  When your guild starts to suffer, you're so scared of being dumped back to mediocrity that you put up with all the idiots and backflagging and everything else, I just refuse to play those fucking games.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I work overnites.  I don't play from 5-9pm EST.  When I played, it was 6 hours in the morning, or 8-10 hours a nite on the 3 days a week I had off.  I'm NOT a casual player.  I'm a player from a small guild, who knows what he wants, knows how to advance, and knows that I'm being fucked by game design.  Now shut your fucking pie hole about me wanting something for nothing, you arrogant cock.  You don't understand, and you'll never understand, because as soon as your guild breaks up, you'll quit the game rather than have to deal with the world without 72 of your &quot;closest&quot; friends.</div></div><hr />

This arguement is weak sauce dude.  First, Doom is a single person based skill game and with single person skill you can progress.  You don't get 120 dudes playing Doom to kill one monster by zerging the fuck out of it, which isn't skill by the way.  I have great skill with my EQ toon, if this was Doom, I'd be at the end game.<br />
<br />
Second, your right I do have to kill things to progress, I kill jugs to see Trak, and I do that with 1 group.  Now SoE says I gotta kill the fuckin Zeks with 75 man raids to see yard trash in the elements.  You see, the game has reversed, it used to be that you progressed with a small group to get to the mob you need to kill with a large group.  Now you need the large group to get to the fuckin yard trash of another zone.<br />
<br />
See, what has happened here is Everquest has changed from the great game it was into what it is now.  Now people like you, the almost 11k unbuffed tanks, that this model favors defend it to the last and say fuck all the other people that aren't going to be the sheep and won't do the mindless zerging.  I prefer to play with real skill, individual skill, when I fuck up it's my fault and my group pays for it.  But When my group is on, we do amazing shit and all the glory is ours.  You are a part of the faceless masses, you mow down shit mindlessly and then some how try to convince yourself this was an amazing feat and it took great skill on your part to acomplish it.  It's all bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BB dun like to call out anyone round here but was that 7k buffed or unbuffed?<br />
<br />
Cause on xev i havent got a hope in hell of gettin into a god group at 7500 to 7900 (depending on buffs available at the time). i have 5523hp unbuffed, the first question i get asked before an invite to hard ldon or god is what is my unbuffed hp. i tell them that then get told not to advertise for hard ldon till i hit 6500 unbuffed or god till i am 7k unbuffed. so how am i supposed to get into a god group. Playtimes mean i can get on when the rest of my guild is sleeping, cant get a pickup so stuck with normal ldon, ldon adventure merchants are my only means of upgrades since i cannot get into hard ldon or god on my server.<br />
<br />
Just remember guys, it differs from server to server, on xev u are overlooked unless u are an 9k+ tank, On younger servers i am guessing this is not as much of a problem<br />
<br />
PS:- as a side note, if a warrior was willing to pay for a server transfer, could anyone recommend a newish server that is not top heavy in tanks like xev. I will say straight out that having so many raid tanks at 9 to 10k + hp on xev is the reason i am stuck at this soft cap, since the support structure available is used to having it easier and are not willing to take a risk on a lower tank.<br />
<br />
PPS:- i did meet one crazy cleric that took me thru a nro hard ldon :-) had no named in it but had a blast being quadded for 950 and watching half my hp dissapear lol. we won as well and the cleric turned around and said she haddnt had that much fun on a ldon in a long time, i made her work, instead of just sitting on her ass. That has been my only ever hard ldon invite. even then we had 2 chanters and a ranger leave because they felt we would fail without a 9k+ tank.</div></div><hr />

I don't claim to be the most skilled player in the game. Every one of my guildmates is more skilled than I.<br />
<br />
When the 3 monks go out on a pull, I stand on high ground and watch the proceedings. When one announces Incoming, I watch for more than one mob, target each to find if one is unmezable. I run three assist buttons in case more than one Monk is bringing in mobs at once. I use F7 to scan the list of nearby mobs to locate any nearby unmezables. I try real hard not to let the Enchanters die. Just like any other Wariror I tag mobs at the moment it appropriate. I don't tag if the Monk is unaware he's got 5 aggro or a bard song has aggroed a bunch. I communicate with the pullers saying things like - &quot;Yer back spawned&quot; or &quot;2 mobs in camp atm&quot;. They chat with me.<br />
<br />
I call for assist, watch my HP's, call for DI to be refreshed, listen for OOM, decide when to break mezz or even resist the urge to break mezz if we need a couple seconds or a late arriving ummezzable is otw. I position the mob and walk it if necessary to give Rogues and rogue pets their greatest DPS insuring that I complete my final direction change prior to the mob Enraging.<br />
<br />
And even with 8 red unmezzable mobs in camp, I try to remain calm and do my job predictably and methodically while anticipating what others might be doing to help out. I try to take the mobs in the right order and take into account who's tanking it, what kind of shape they and their healer/s are in, and how we might re-impose order as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I do all this as well as it can be done and am satisfied with simply doing what is expected of me. Ocassionally I mess up and even can cause my entire guild to wipe.<br />

All sony can do is provide opportunity. Are they fair in it? No. (Except for instanced zones.) Instanced zones finally made a case that there is some fairness. Until then the ENDGAME was extremely cutthroat on several servers. X guild that got on and was ready to raid at 6:30 had a huge advantage on guild B that could raid at 8:30.  Just like getting camps anywhere. First on had an advantage. If you wanted X loot you either were to the camp first or joined a list. <br />

Nothing has changed than the perception the carrot is further away.. I just think people finally started noticing that they were on a treadmill.  And Worse the bility to link items Jaded many people. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally it seems useless to post after a thread has gone past a couple of pages since it collapses into deconstructive arguements and bantering, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on where a semi-casual, non-raider stands currently in EQ.<br />
<br />
The original arguement about people who whining about not getting access just because they pay the monthly fee is fine, I don't think EPs or Time should just be opened up, really if I wanted to join an EP+ guild to finish EP flags it wouldn't be that much trouble, I just choose not to.<br />
<br />
Unless I do get EP flagged and start raiding though, I'm running out of upgrade paths.   I'm pre-EP and pre-VT, so any upgrades I'm getting are coming mostly from LiS, KT, Ssra, Tipt, Ferubi and Ikk, a Ring of Destruction and Marsinger Gem would be nice too, and with some work I could get a fair ways along on BiC quest.   I've done a lot of Ldons (406-15 record, 67-4 on hard) and have about 6.3k AP saved, so I've got about all the upgrades from there that I'm going to get, I could buy a 40 hp aug for feet and some vengeance augs but at this point I'll sit on the points I have.  I still have upgrades to get, but off the top of my head I'm guessing I won't get much more than 350 hp and 150 AC in upgrades if I got everything I'm looking at, which is nice and all, but I do feel that I'm nearing the end of what I can get without raiding before there's another expansion.<br />
<br />
For me AAs are pretty much the same story, I hit 400 yesterday, with 28 saved, I'll probably look at Taanan Mastery once I hit 30 since the other options I have don't appeal to me all that much.  <br />
<br />
Really, I don't see anything wrong with this situation, I know what I can get as a non-raider, and I know what I could get if I was raiding, and I'm in a position where I have a choice about which way I want to go.  Not everyone feels they have a choice, and perhaps people in that situation are the most frustrated, because there easily could be more room for non-raiders to grow, whether or not they're &quot;entitled&quot; to it.<br />
<br />
For example, theres a few quests/camps that people can do easily, but they simply don't have access to, raiders and non-raiders alike.  RZ is an obvious example for the raider, more that likely you can take quite a few EP raid targets before you're able to kill RZ for the flag.  This makes sense to me, because once you defeat RZ you should be adequately prepared for what's next, and even if it's a break-point in progression, it's not a meaningless one. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, take the Signet of Might quest.  The flagging requirement to progress through this quest seems arbitrary to me.  Besides needing a few drops from EPs, especially with the hope stone, the majority of the work in this quest is working up your tradeskills and grinding taanan mastery AA.   With EP access, you've already gotten plenty of rewards: a significant charm upgrade and access to new camps/raid spots and loot.  The last and next to last earring are both very nice, but is the flagging requirement really necessary, and is it really out of line to have this reward available to someone non-EP flagged who's gotten ~220 in all tradeskills?  (Ok, so you'd probably have more problems with this being MQed without the flag requirements, but having flag requirements seems a bad solution to preventing MQ problems.)  BiC quest is along the same lines, you can get farther along in that quest without needing flags, but you're unable to get but so far in the quest without raid flags.  And I understand that doing high-end GoD raids can often be a lot of trouble for loot that is a minor upgrade to time gear (think GoD bows for rangers), but again you have a quest that gives raiders a double reward (the quest and the ikk++ loot.)<br />
<br />
To me both of these quests are examples of where a resonable upgrade path for a non-raider that can be done either solo, 1 group, or a small raid (3 groups) is blocked by large raid flagging requirements.  The new VP quests also tend to fall into this area (although I'm not as familiar with them, corrections appreciated), you need to get a fairly powerful raid to kill the dragon in SF to get VP access, but the quests seem to be based on 1 groupable conent and faction, and for the most part the rewards aren't unbalanced game-breakers (although if the quests were opened up, I'd definitely think the collection quests should be harder.)<br />
<br />
These few quest barriers are only really an issue for me coupled with the cap that a non-raider already has on progression, limited to pre-EP/VT/yxtta-qvic content.  While these quests were designed for raiders, they're just the type of progression that non-raiders need more of, such as coldain ring/shawl quests.   There's plenty of quests targetted for pre-65 progression, and plenty of quests for raid level progression, but very little for the level 65 who wants to advance from one to the other, only doze quests, veracity earring and marsinger gem jump to mind, and the first two fall into that category only because the content is so old but the rewards are still pretty good.  Both raiders and non-raiders have caps on progression, but I think that the cap for non-raiders is unquestionably lower and if anything offers smaller and smaller upgrades for more and more work, which if you think about it is not the way the game is designed for raiders where, after ceratin steps, the level of rewards you get explodes (pre-EP to EP, EP to Time, etc).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it seems to me that the difference between the Have's and Have Not's is most noticible in the warrior class and probably close as far as knights. Why because tanks are more so than other classes judged by their gear/stats. I have never once been asked while LFG in my shaman what my mana pool is , what my wisdom is , what my FT is or even what spells I might be missing. Yet with my war I have been asked what my HP and AC are. When doing a pick up group in BoT I have never seen anyone ask a wizard their stats or if they have their crit AA's trained. I have seen almost every ranger asked if they have EQ/AM. Why is this ? I think it has alot to do with perception.<br />
<br />
Now it is true if we are talking tanking single pull after single pull anyone with 10k hp and 2000 AC is going to take alot less damage than a 7.5k hp 1400 AC tank no matter what. The ability of the player has nothing to do with it it is stats that make the difference. So saying someone is less compitent based on their lesser gear or the fact that they are tank 5 in Uber Guild whatever is a wrong assumption. There are good and bad players all over from lvl 20 to lvl 65 and 300 AA's. Unfortunatly a warrior that lacks in playing time or a group of people that can get him flagged for whereever is penalized severly.<br />
<br />
I am not using me as an example. My war is fairly new still only 34 days played. He was made to duo with my shaman and because our guild was/is lacking in tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't claim to be the most skilled player in the game. Every one of my guildmates is more skilled than I.<br />
<br />
When the 3 monks go out on a pull, I stand on high ground and watch the proceedings. When one announces Incoming, I watch for more than one mob, target each to find if one is unmezable. I run three assist buttons in case more than one Monk is bringing in mobs at once. I use F7 to scan the list of nearby mobs to locate any nearby unmezables. I try real hard not to let the Enchanters die. Just like any other Wariror I tag mobs at the moment it appropriate. I don't tag if the Monk is unaware he's got 5 aggro or a bard song has aggroed a bunch. I communicate with the pullers saying things like - &quot;Yer back spawned&quot; or &quot;2 mobs in camp atm&quot;. They chat with me.<br />
<br />
I call for assist, watch my HP's, call for DI to be refreshed, listen for OOM, decide when to break mezz or even resist the urge to break mezz if we need a couple seconds or a late arriving ummezzable is otw. I position the mob and walk it if necessary to give Rogues and rogue pets their greatest DPS insuring that I complete my final direction change prior to the mob Enraging.<br />
<br />
And even with 8 red unmezzable mobs in camp, I try to remain calm and do my job predictably and methodically while anticipating what others might be doing to help out. I try to take the mobs in the right order and take into account who's tanking it, what kind of shape they and their healer/s are in, and how we might re-impose order as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I do all this as well as it can be done and am satisfied with simply doing what is expected of me. Ocassionally I mess up and even can cause my entire guild to wipe.<br />
<br />
I have touble understanding your denigration of raiding and raid tanks. It is not as simple as you make out. <br />
<br />
Alright, BB, since you're willing to be reasonable, then we'll discuss this.<br />
<br />
I led a guild of 1 or 2 groups of real life friends, we all knew each other, most of us worked together, in fact Bourbon was the only guy in the guild that didn't live in Minnesota.   We played video games on the weekends, we got together and played board games during the week, we're fucking gamers, that's what we do.<br />
<br />
We're goddamned good at what we do.  We pick up a game, we kick it's fucking ass.  EQ is absolutely no different. I do the EXACT same shit you claim to do, AND i played the shammy too.  I kept buffs on everyone, Avatar on all the melees, and often times, the shammy is the only crowd control.  Alas, i'm not here to measure dicks with you, that's not important.<br />
<br />
Lets assume, for one minute, that we're the same skill level.  Why should you have double my hitpoints and double my AC?  Because you have 50 more friends?  Why should that even be a consideration?  When the fuck did it become acceptable for a video game to require 70 man groups to improve your character (with the alternative being a VERY LONG and very boring grind in a cookie cutter instanced dungeon).  That's not progression.   That's ridiculous.  I can't believe that you actually WANT to involve yourself in, and are standing up for that kind of idiocy.</div></div><hr />

I don't have to have played in GoD to know that at release GoD was choked full of buggs and completely misdesigned. I have hundreds, thousands, of posts supporting that. Do I need to have experienced a Ford Pinto blowing up to know that at one time the gas tank was outside the frame and the vehicle was therefore prone to blowing up on rear end impact? No, I don't. Same deal. I know GoD was a bomb on wheels when released without ever having had it blow up on me.<br />
<br />
You hear by word of mouth that an expansion might be bad.  So you decide it has to be, then go on some kind of crusade to insure everyone else believes that.<br />
<br />
No, your analogy was off.  There's a slight difference between a well known and visible risk in an automobile that is irrefuteable and proven via hard facts...and your opinion of an expansion you've never been to.<br />
<br />
Your rants are all exaggerated, and anything you say only comes off as false.<br />
<br />
You can try to dismiss what I say as &quot;mere opinion&quot;, but how would you know?  You don't have the experience to back it.  You don't even have the heard evidence to back it.  You simply have the &quot;I'm a casual and I quit playing&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I care because I'm one of the people you came along being an ass to. I'm one of the people who have left the game because of exactly the issues under discussion. And all you can do is be a prick. That's why I care. As far as you telling me I'm wrong, haven't I made it clear that your opinion on that matter is of no significance to me? Guess not. How can I be clearer on that point?<br />
<br />
Problem here...<br />
<br />
You spew false information.<br />
<br />
I offer correct information to counter said ignorance.<br />
<br />
You can choose to not take in facts because you refuse to be anything but right, but the simple fact remains...<br />
<br />
Actually, I've stopped trying to convince anyone of anything. I'm merely expressing my opinion in counter to those who want to come along and spout off the kind of pure unmitigated elitist arrogant garbage people like you spout.<br />
<br />
My magelo indicates my elitism, in all of my Lodizal Booted glory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, and still more bullshit.<br />
<br />
You know what, I'm not even going to bother addressing the rest. I think you've shown your true colors with the whole, casuals should have been made to suffer by having to run clear across the game or buy ports because PoK was a bad idea, comments. You're an ass. You and I don't and probably never have played the same game. And you want everyone to believe that if they just listen to you, it will all be fun again. Bullshit. Grow up. And go away.<br />

<br />
I can only speak for my server, but on Terris the uberguild players want nothing to do with old content. In fact when someone mentions backflagging people will start to log off so fast it will make your head spin. <br />
<br />
ST key dragons stay up for 5-6 days unkilled.<br />
<br />
Dozekar gets neglected quite often too.<br />
<br />
We've had to leave the radio on while we're gone so The Dain doesn't pee on the floor from seperation anxiety.<br />
<br />
a lot of todays players who WOULD be camping these mobs think themselves &quot;Too Cool&quot; for things in velious. They only want to go to the Elemental planes. <br />
<br />
Are you sure this isn't something a few people made up and duped others into believeing?<br />
<br />
You'll have to excuse Grumbam. He's too busy tanking what I tell him to tank to know wtf goes on no our server.<br />
<br />
Actually, plenty of people &quot;bottom feed&quot; on Terris. Lately, when we've taken a night off or whatever, I'll go wander around and find mobs to one group that used to take us a large group of people. We don't camp mobs for the bazaar or player auctions, but plenty of people do. We typically take a guildie or useful alt that would need specific drops off those old raid targets. <br />
<br />
Several times I've seen members of guilds above us in progression(we're Rathe away from Time) hustling to get to a target before we did, or while we did one. <br />
<br />
What sucks is that Sony is starting to include these old targets in quests for elemental level rewards. Look at the rewards for some of the new VP quests and you will see targets that small guilds or lower level people might possibly still benefit from. But, also to be fair, most of these targets DO stay up for days on end before a group or two goes and kills them for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
Right now on Terris a &quot;non-hardcore&quot; raiding guild or casual family type guild could clean up with raid targets and drops from previous expansions. Not much below Ssra is done. The problem is, most people want Pop level drops, so they aren't willing to &quot;enjoy&quot; Luclin and Velious. Also the hundreds of AA skills available to people who xp more than raid makes those old expansions trivial and less fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far as keys/flags go, while I hate doing backflagging, I am glad that some zones are locked. My guild has worked very hard to do what we've done, at our own pace. We don't push as hard as some guilds, but we get where we want to go. I honestly would not want to share Fire, Earth, etc... with every jackass currently running around BoT. For the most part, most people who have had to work their way into the elementals on our server, respect what it took to get there and have some amount of respect for the others in those zones. <br />
<br />
Everquest is a game that was written for player interaction to be a large part of the game. Much of the content initially requires players working together in whatever fashion to achieve the goals set before them. Sony did open up some Pop zones a while after release and maybe they will open up more, I don't know. For those people who say they can't spend the time in one sitting or their guild isn't capable, it does get done. Maybe it only gets done on servers where someone has the ambition enough to make it happen.<br />
<br />
Many raids in Pop below elementals can be done in 1 to 2 hours, or much less. Yes, it will take longer during the learning curve, but most can be quick raids with good raid leaders, good planning and good execution. If your guild only gets 12 or 15 people on a big night, find 4 more guilds like yours and raid two nights a week. It won't take long and you'll be downing those flag mobs. <br />
<br />
If you don't like to raid, or only play 30 minutes at a time, then unfortunately, you most likely won't ever see some zones. <br />
<br />
<br />
For the people who suggested reverse locking of zones, that's actually a good idea imo. It couldn't realy be zones with any flag mobs in them, since backflagging is a way of life, but there could be zones with good content and realistic rewards for single or two group guilds that wouldn't let anyone in with a EP clearance, for example. I don't think the rewards should compare to EP drops, but they could/should be comparable to what's needed to be able to do them. People mentioned the drops form  xp named in fire/earth/water/etc.... Make the good drops in these locked zones be comparable to these drops so people could get low level EP drops, but wouldn't be able to get elemental armor or true raid level items. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm in favor of locked zones that require effort and team work to get into, but I'm not against non raiding people getting new content. I have plenty to keep me busy.</div></div><hr />

Naturally I play games too. I've also worked for game companies.<br />
<br />
EQ does not have to fit your model of what a game should be like. It provides an opprotuntiy to solo, dou, group, small raid, and raid.<br />
<br />
It reminds me of a RL roleplaying game called Nero. On various weekends 100 or so people gather and NPC's move the plot forward as they play their characters. Sure, you could go to Nero and &quot;solo&quot; but your gameplaying opprotunity would be pretty limited. Some players form groups and while they can take on slightly more difficuly challanges, the real action happens at the Clan level. The major plot and storyline is designed around your clan and what happens to it in various Nero campaigns.<br />
<br />
EQ is Massively Multi-player. While there is solo and group content, the bulk of the game revolves around your clan, or in this case your guild, and what happens to it in a titanic stuggle that plays out in Norrath.<br />
<br />
There is plenty of positive motivation to join a clan and participate in the lagrer events in the game. Part of it is the greater challange and wider canvas. Only clan members have a realistic chance to conquer ALL of the current content challanges and for just a moment raise their arms in triumph and declare &quot;We beat EQ!&quot;<br />
<br />
You might favor soloing, or only grouping, or three group raids - but the most difficult challanges in the game are reserved for small armies. Once these were unlimited in size. In order to prevent zergling they are now made a reasonable size so multiple clans will exist on servers, compete at least in accomplishments, and provide manpower that can be thrown at challanges designed for them.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for you, EQ's model doesn't fit your small group of friends playing D&amp;D on Saturday night model if you expect to make steady progress toward end expansion high-level content. Neither does it fit my middle son's loner vs Norrath model. Groups do harders content than one player alone. Raids do harder content than one group alone. Harder content = greater reward. If you're looking for a game built around the soloer, the group, or two groups you're going to be disappointed. There IS content and there IS a progression path, but the game is not focused as strongly as you would like on smaller clans. It isn't the droids you are looking for, nor it it likely to change dramaticly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does tanking one mob or 6 incoming to a 6 man group account for skill against raid tanking when you have to sync with 50 - 70 people.Things are more intense they happen quicker and well they have worse consequences.When I'm grouping even in tipt or a similiar spot their are only so many variables and sources of aggro in play.In a group situation your choices are limited and I imagine the people posting in this thread don't find keeping up with a group challenging skill or effort wise.If my group wipes becuase i get silly... well I say sorry and we rez up.If your choices or lack of skill cause a raid to wipe you're gonna feel a lot worse.Sorry this doesn't wash with me Bourbon.Maybe your raidtankng experience is limited,or,you just followed people around with auto attack on and never stuck your neck out.In that case im not surprised you don't like raiding.Any of our wars who never acted to support the raid without direct instruction from the raidleader or ma would never have got past their app.The bloody raidleader can't issue instruction for every move you make if you want your team to fight well.The differance is night and day for me.When we're raiding my effort and attention levels are easily tripled from grouping.Grouping is easy by comparison.Sure some people get dragged along by their peers....would you want to be that warrior?<br />
<br />
Anyways,you can't get the same rewards from a hard ldon group mob as you do from Reparm.It wouldn't make any sense and would steal what integrity is left in the game.The mob's are standing there...at some point anyways...find a way to kill them like everyone else had to.There is a challenge to overcoming hard raid mobs.Most of our raiders feel that challenge and work far harder than they need to in xp groups to beat those mobs the first few times.I agree that pop was too big a jump in gear,but, it's done and it's there for you to overcome if you want.If you want to take a differant route that is possible too.Again ,I think more group content is required for people with pre ep gear.I want to see more group stuff as well hehe.My wife and I love seeing new places.<br />
<br />
The game is there to play.Has long as we all play by the same rules I'm ok with it.The unethical E-Bay and cockblock crap can complicate stuff,but, both are overcome with patience.If you can't get into a guild with immediate rewards in better gear what would be wrong with finding some people you like to play with and tanking for them until they reach that level.We have lots of people with very low playtime.Some only come out for a few hours on weekends.If that is too much to adjust to then you don't really want that experience.The average age in my guild is probably mid 30's I'm 37.We all had to decide to devote some rl time to raiding.I often work overnight and lack sleep on raid days.So what ,it's fun and worth it to me.Btw I didn't join my guild because I wanted loot.A good friend asked me to come along on some raids and I enjoyed seeing new stuff and working with the group to do bigger things.Worry about that stuff first and raiding might be fun for you again.<br />
<br />
EQ is a big game.They shouldn't change the rules in midstream that many people had to follow.It cheapens everything.There's room for lot's of play styles and I hope more groupable content comes out to fill out the gaps.I never cared about EP's until we were well into the flag mobs and vxed is better xp for me.I'd like to see more zones of varying difficulty apart from the raid game.LDON does offer need upgrades for people,but, it does it in such a clinical number crunching fashion that it encourages the worst aspects of the eq upgrade game.Make people have to adventure and quest stuff not grind the same halls over and over until you see the loot check out clerk.I think the real problem is the focus for non raiders is a straight gear grind rather than seeing and questing kewl stuff with some nicely balanced rewards.Attitude is everything...especially when you're trying to have fun. :) <br />

No, it has EVOLVED to be that way over it's lifetime.  How about we make it so that you can no longer get the best rewards in the game without the full cooperation of 2000 people?  Would you willingly keep sucking dev cock so you can be l33t, or would you finally say that it's overboard for what should be expected for a fucking game?<br />

<br />
It doesn't much matter if EQ EVOLVED into primarily a raid game or not. People certainly formed guilds and raided in the original release and that aspect of EQ certainly grew and blossomed.<br />
<br />
You are not forced to join a guild or raid. Since this is all just pixels anyway and l33t gear is hardly required for group content, I don't see what all the hubbub is bub. Log in with your buds if you wish and drink beer at the PoD lift for all I care. I certainly don't care if you raid or not.<br />

My Magelo is doing just fine thank you. I also choose not to play Doom 3 or games where the stuggle to progress is meaningless - I gave up twitch games about thirty years ago. I think you are barking up the wrong tree if you are suggesting that I suck up to developers or SoE. I rather imagine I've been a tiny but irraitating burr under their blanket.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I continue playing EQ, think raiding is the one and only reason the game is worth playing at all, and don't think it's &quot;overboard&quot; for a game. If at anytime I believe high-level raiding is too demanding for me I can always stop and join y'all in East Karana hoping the &quot;ubers&quot; didn't kill all the Highland Lions.<br />

It doesn't much matter if EQ EVOLVED into primarily a raid game or not. People certainly formed guilds and raided in the original release and that aspect of EQ certainly grew and blossomed.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I think it very much matters, it's basically what this entire thread is about.  Yes, people did form guilds and raid in the original game.  However, in the original game, we weren't REQUIRED to raid to be able to see 50% of the content, that is the point.<br />

Ah, how cute, you tried a subtle insult.  But this is pretty much the elitest attitude that is rampant in uber guilds, &quot;You are a little nothing because you don't belong to the sheep herd, you are benieth us &quot;highly skilled&quot; guildies, so go back to your pathetic whatever it is you ants do&quot;, thanks for further proving my point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ is a game. It has rules and strategies that a player needs to employ in order to &quot;win&quot;. We keep score two ways:<br />
<br />
1. Are we having fun or are we stalled out in content we find to be stale.<br />
<br />
2. How are we &quot;doing&quot; relative to other players.<br />
<br />
I believe you and Haass are angry because given the only ways &quot;score&quot; is kept in EQ, you've lost.<br />
<br />
You needn't be trapped in old stale content. A progression path exists. Not too long ago my guild had an inviteee in a mixture of LDoN and armor from Ornate molds. He fought with us in PoTime and looted drops there. E'ci has public PoTime raids. On my server FIVE guilds are in or have completed PoTime with still other guilds in the EP's and otw. That's probably 500 acounts!! It CAN be done, you just couldn't or chose not to do it.<br />
<br />
IF however you maintain you don't wish to raid, why then there's really not much reason to complain about PoTime or QVic and Inktu'Ta - they are just rides in the amusment park you don't want to be on anyway, they are raid zones.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Doom 3 may be much better suited to you. No progression, no equipment that is retained from one session to the next, no guilds, etc. Just a chance to log in with a few friends and tear up some mobs. That however is not what EQ is or is ever likely to be.<br />

That's a pretty poor analysis of what I'm saying.  If you'd read these things and take them for what they are other than me trying to get involved in your odd shouting matches, perhaps you wouldn't have quit the game for reasons that didn't exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
To the guy saying raiding is the only way...<br />
<br />
Raiding has always been the only way to get the *best* items, ever since raid content was put into the game.  <br />
<br />
The best gear is attainable by those who overcome the hardest feats.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean there's no good gear for those who can't raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have made a couple twinks. The most interesting one was a Karana Halfling Ranger that hit level 30 between raids without being PL'd in 1 week. Just like you, he had some friends in game - in his case a level 65 Warrior (me) and a 56 Halfling Karana Druid (me).<br />
<br />
He was very adequately equipped for a character that was never going to raid. He doesn't NEED equipment like mine to group. He would only need if if he chose to be a raider - he's a casual player. Should he hit some kind of ceiling, I'll just roll another twink. After all, I'm not competing with the game when I play a twink, I'm just having fun.<br />

<br />
At level 40, I inspected an &quot;uber&quot; Warrior - Flynte Fyreforge as a matter of fact. Hmm, looks like I need levels, a haste belt, twin Yaks and Indicolite armor. I leveled and camped the items needed. Whoa, you need to raid to get Indicolite - so I raided PoHate around 75 times.<br />

And so it went. New expansions and new raids. Did I catch the carrot? Nope, but I progressed. Have I had fun? You betcha. PoTime was FUN! I'm glad I made the effort to get flagged.<br />

You guys are deluded if you think SoE is going to ease the requirements to get Indicolite, Kunnark armor, Raex, or Vadd's. MAYBE mudflation will get you there. But IF you are going to eschew raids then don't for goodness sake think there ought to be a:<br />

I for one am very willing to raid as are alot of the people I group with. However because of RL issues I cannot keep the schedule required by the top raiding guilds on my server. Yes I have checked everyone of their requirements. I cannot possibly meet the 4 to 5 night a week at primetime schedule because of my job. Now we have had people move thru our guild and progress to the raiding guilds and we are still in contact with alot of them. None of these guilds have been at all willing to allow us to join in on a flagging raid even if they are not full. I do not expect to be allowed in on the loot, would just like to be able to help them out if they are at full raid numbers. Now I know some guilds do allow people to flag with them and that is very nice of them. Just as of yet we have not found one that would allow us to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a FEW items in GoD that a non-raider Warrior in the 5500 HP 1400 AC range, more or less, might be able to get ahold of if there was a group willing to let him tank in the content to begin with.  Do I know they won't?  No I don't.  But I've heard the experiences of Warriors much like me saying that it's not only unlikely, it's down right unheard of.  That proves nothing, other than there is some second hand information saying it isn't happening much.  You on the other hand are trying to convince me that in fact this second hand information is wrong based on your second hand information.  Frankly, I'll take the word of people who are actually struggling with the situation over your word.  Call me biased.<br />
<br />
There are huge gaps in the available non-raid gear out of GoD.  A number of the drops people point to as being potential upgrades are also supposedly obscenely rare.  But yes, they do exist. <br />
<br />
Is any of this significant enough to get me to come out of EQ retirement, change my stance that the game is currently hosed beyond all recognition, and stop me from being pissed as hell at SoE for what they've done to the game and telling anyone willing listen that I am?  Not hardly.</div></div><hr />

It's just possible my perception IS different from yours. On my server I think 1 guild is in VT with another &quot;bottom feeding&quot; exactly once in the last six months. On my server 25% of the server population may be in the EP's. I don't bottom feed, therefore, I don't see anyone bottom feeding. I see guilds flagging each other's members - I don't see &quot;cockblocking&quot;, that was soooo two years ago. There are 5 guilds that have seen PoTime on my server - sound like there's much &quot;cockblocking&quot; going on?<br />

It sounds to me like some of you haven't seen GoD, haven't logged on in 4 months, and have no idea whatsoever if the VT shard camps are all taken much less if there are any Pixxt's up in Ferubi.<br />

There should be a noticable difference between the gear gotten from 1-3 groupable encounters and 12 group encounters.  You get exactly what you invest loot-wise and nothing more.  If the end of this game could be reached by only a small handful of people, this game would be dead by now.<br />

PS-  It is feasible for a warrior to have over 7500 unbuffed hps with all single groupable gear ... possibly even a good bit more.  Last i checked there were no 15k hp and 3k ac unbuffed warriors out there.   You are a tool, and your gear reflects it because you have not done everything in your power to hit the end-all of gear upgrades and still maintain the bitch against those who do so.  The end.</div></div><hr />

Ok Apolyon, let me clear this up for you since read comprehention obviously isn't one of your very limited skills.  If you had the capacity to actually read Haass' post you would have seen that he stopped playing in the PoP era, a.k.a before augments even fuckin excisted, before LDoN dungeons even fucking excisted (are you seeing where I'm going here).  If your keeper would have read the posts to you a bit more thoroughly, you would have noticed that one of his pionts is that during the PoP era, the best say bracer for instance he could obtain was around 55hp while someone in an uber guild could have obtained something closer to 3 times that.<br />
<br />
And as far as Velious goes, what part of Velious could we not get too without a raid force?  Sleepers, one zone, and same for Luclin (though that entire expantion was just a steamer), that's it, and that's fine.  Now the game has turned from 1 zone into about 50% of all zones, and now not only is future content locked to anyone but raiders, they are going back and revamping old world zones for EP+ guilds.  That's fuckin bullshit.<br />
<br />
So take your fucking droolings ya slack jawed Troglodyte and skitter back under the fuckin rock you came from.  This conversation is obvioulsy far past your ability to contribute anything.</div></div><hr />

If you had the capacity to actually read Haass' post you would have seen that he stopped playing in the PoP era, a.k.a before augments even fuckin excisted, before LDoN dungeons even fucking excisted (are you seeing where I'm going here).  If your keeper would have read the posts to you a bit more thoroughly, you would have noticed that one of his pionts is that during the PoP era, the best say bracer for instance he could obtain was around 55hp while someone in an uber guild could have obtained something closer to 3 times that.<br />
<br />
And as far as Velious goes, what part of Velious could we not get too without a raid force?  Sleepers, one zone, and same for Luclin (though that entire expantion was just a steamer), that's it, and that's fine.  Now the game has turned from 1 zone into about 50% of all zones, and now not only is future content locked to anyone but raiders, they are going back and revamping old world zones for EP+ guilds.  That's fuckin bullshit.<br />
<br />
So take your fucking droolings ya slack jawed Troglodyte and skitter back under the fuckin rock you came from.  This conversation is obvioulsy far past your ability to contribute anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
YO FUCKSTICK &gt;&gt;&gt; IF HE STOPPED PLAYING BEFORE LDON, THEN WHY THE FUCK IS HE USING A GOD EQUIPPED WARRIOR AS HIS FUCKING MEASUREMENT STICK??? IS IT NO SURPRISE THAT 2 FUCKING EXPANSIONS DOWN THE LINE A WARRIOR HAS TWICE HIS HPS?  <br />
<br />
Especially when he never even bothered to finish the expansion he was on before he quit.<br />
<br />
AS for velious, ToV and ST both required Raid force.  Kael required a raid force.  Skyshrine required a raid force. Luclin all required a raidforce unless the content was trivial.  PoP requires a raidforce.  Even the uber stuff in original eq required raidforce, as well as Kunark.  There is nothing new here except for the fact that you need flags and keys, which have been requirements since Kunark to keep just any old retard with 0 dedication out of these zones. Any more questions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bourbon</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you can still see it.  You just gotta put in the time to raid it.  Nothing is skewed in anyone's favor there Einstein. <br />
<br />
Do you want to see the game??? Then get off your fat, lazy e-world ass and go fucking see it.  There is no &quot;the man&quot; holding you down.  Nobody is out to get you or wanting to keep you from progressing.  Dont expect anything to be given to you.  Go earn it and stop the bitchfest.<br />
<br />
You make me want to vomit.<br />
<br />
PS-  It is feasible for a warrior to have over 7500 unbuffed hps with all single groupable gear ... possibly even a good bit more.  Last i checked there were no 15k hp and 3k ac unbuffed warriors out there.   You are a tool, and your gear reflects it because you have not done everything in your power to hit the end-all of gear upgrades and still maintain the bitch against those who do so.  The end.<br />
<br />
<br />
/sigh, you just don't know when to quit when you're ahead do you?  Allow me to once again elaborate for you.  I don't hate end gamers, that's great if that's how they want to game.  What I don't like is that content that I could very easily XP off and get upgrades from is locked behind flags that require me to have a raid size force.  And I don't like people how are end game coming back and telling me that what my situation is in game can't possibly be true because they don't have the same issue.<br />
<br />
So fuck you shit bag, try reading some shit before you open your crap spewer.  I'm not going to retype every post I've made up to this point so that you can actually get a fuckin clue, you can hire someone to read it to you.</div></div><hr />

Is this because of lack of effort no it is not. My war has a total of 34 days played at this point with only 25 AA's. I have alot of room to grow thru gear in LDoN augs in LDoN and alot of AA's. I am not saying there is no progression left for me and never have. Yes I will be purchasing OOW because I want lvl 70 when it comes out. Level is one the formost ways of advancing your character. I also hope that some of the mobs we cannot take out at this time might be doable at 70 where they are not at 65.</div></div><hr />

If you played in the Velious era, both HoT and WToV also required raid force.  If you think single groups or 2-3 groups were running willy-nilly on doze, LTK, goz, telk, and the other named, then you are sorely mistaken.  Hell, if you even look back far enough the damn arena took a raid force, as did a lot of the ring quests. <br />
<br />
Seb and HS require key quests ... all of these zones also have min levels to keep people out.<br />
<br />
If you're trying to argue that EQ has not had a very central raiding aspect which isnt doable by small groups till many expansions later ... then you, sir, are a fool.  Raiding is a big part of eq and has been since beta with Vox and Naggy.  All expansions when they come out require raiding ... maybe this changes a year or more later when small groups can waltz in and take the cookie ... but by then the &quot;cutting edge&quot; and the &quot;high-end&quot; raiding has already shifted to much harder content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True but the quest for the key are easier than the zone itself. That is no longer true in alot of cases.<br />
<br />
Yes the Arena in Kael and HoT in ToV did require raid forces. They have become 1 groupable now with the advancement in gear AA's and levels.</div></div><hr />

Dude, are you trying to be dense?  I know their has always been a raiding aspect in EQ, as I have said in several of my posts, you'd know this if you bothered reading what others of said instead of jumping in 14 pages later and starting in with the same shit that has already been discussed.<br />
<br />
What hasn't always been a part of the EQ is this mentality that it's ok to lock off huge parts of expantions behind flags that non-raiders/non-guildies will never attain.  I've said it before and I'll say it again just for your benifit, I don't have a problem with people being better equiped then me, I do have a problem with someone the same class and level having over twice my fucking stats, hell, even uber guild casters have more HP/AC then I have.  And I have a huge problem with being locked away from single group content behind a raid sized flag.  Raid targets should be raid targets, available for people that raid, Raid targets should not be the gate to single group content everyone could benefit from.</div></div><hr />

I started Apolyon in April when i tired of my ranger.  I xp'd ... earned plat ... bought upgrades ... then hit 5k hp unbuffed and felt pretty uber.  Lets see ... then i did some small time raiding for some BoT tower stuff (2-3 groups) and did ldon regulars till i had some anger augs.  I then concentrated in LDoN hards with friends that were willing to have me and picked up ~6 nodrop items as well as a few droppables which added a hell of hps to me.  I then ground out several 40hp augs via hard ldon and regular ldon as well as lots of 10ac augs and spent 60aa for 500hps.  I then with my shit went to GoD and picked up some more augs and a nice pair of leggins and did some 1groupable shit for my Scimitar of War and Shoulder items.<br />
<br />
The only raid level gear i have on me is my BoC and RZ helm ... both of  which are buyable (i got them on raids tho).  Everything else on me is 1groupable.<br />
<br />
That, sir, is how you progress.  Don't like it or want to put in the effort?  Then either quit playing or quit whining.  Nobody in this game can have twice your hps unless you arent doing everything you can to be better (and yes this excludes raiding).  At 7250 hps i can say i am living proof of this.</div></div><hr />

If you look on CT, some of the very first people to do the Kael arena FOR GEAR with one group, were me, and Bourbon, and Rasco.<br />
<br />
Did we have a helluva time?  Yup.  Fuckin Haass had just hit 55, and without defensive, we couldn't take down a veteran.  Were we able to do it? Yes.  Hell, you know what, we were doing it LONG before it became common to do it with one group.  In fact, we were told several times that because we didn't have a raid force, we weren't camping it, and fucksticks like yourself barged in and stole our fucking camp.<br />
<br />
Am I able to go try to get Raex pieces?  No.  Why? Because I haven't killed Rallos zek with the Zerg force.  Explain to me how it's different, and then explain to me WHY IT'S DIFFERENT YOU FUCKING MONGOLOID.</div></div><hr />

By not being in a guild and not being a raider you really had no access to the better spots in velious and definitely not in luclin.  You could enter the zones, sure, but you sure as fuck arent going to be able to do jack shit once youre there.  I've been to the EP's, and if youre not geared/ready for the content then youre fucking useless.  The locks/flags on the zone are a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Update your magelo.  Claiming to be a 5k warrior with X ac means nothing.  Magelo's are pretty standard around here.  This is nothing new. <br />
