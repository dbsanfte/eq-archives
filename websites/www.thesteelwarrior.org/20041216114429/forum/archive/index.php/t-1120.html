<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm looking for some basic information about elemental gods.  I was wondering where I could get this.  Seems most people are keeping this kind of information close to their chests, but I'm really only looking for basic information.  What, if any AEs do they have.  Are there adds?  Nothing I could possibly gleam any sort of strategy from..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, about the only information anyone is going to be willing to give you, you could just get by running up taking a death.<br />
<br />
Info such as adds, AE, and special skills (rampage, AE rampage, etc.) are all you need to know to figure out the strategies. None of the elemental god encounters is very hard to figure out after the first serious attempt at doing it. Go try them out, half the fun is figuring out how to win.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I guess this only applies to Fennin, Xegony, and Coirnav since everyone and their brother has talked about the Rathe strategy. I believe you can get specifics from one of the archived FoH home pages from a while back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as simple info like AE or rampage/flurry, I would say its not really a big deal since once a guild is to the point of engaging that god, it takes like 30 seconds to send in a test monk with stonestance to see what the mob hits for and what spells he casts (which then takes about 20 seconds on lucy to see what they do).  I will include the ones that require no set-up to engage (Fennin and Xegony).  Since coirnav and Rathe are less conventional and require learning their ring style events, I will hold off on them.<br />
