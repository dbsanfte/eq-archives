<br />
1. My war is Barb(tribunal) and my shaman is Troll (Cazic) so shammy is obviously KOS to keeper side. Is it worth it to get them on same faction ?<br />
<br />
2. Can I start doing missions with both to get faction that way or do I have to do the small individual tasks first ?<br />
<br />
3. I am unclear about the rewards for completing a mission. Crystals I believe but you turn them in to determine faction ? maybe I am wrong here.<br />
<br />
4. Can you turn the crystals even if still KOS ?<br />
<br />
Any other information that you guys may have would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to the crystals, you get a token to turn in for faction when you complete a mission.  If you have your characters on opposite faction, then only one or the other of them will be able to get faction on any given mission.  Since faction is a big part of the DoN progression quest, I would definitely suggest having both of your characters on the same faction.  Once you pick a side, you can start missions and your kos character can do the missions and get faction tokens for the other side.  You can turn them in at the Mercenary camp outside to get faction until you are no longer kos.  There are also solo factions at the mercenery camps that you can do to raise faction with either side.  Took me 3 missions and 2 tasks to get out of kos with the good camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1:  Faction is not to much of a pain to work on in DoN.  On an off night from raiding, we di about 5 hours of missions, and the troll shaman with us was no longer KoS by the end of the night, with no previous missions done.  The token you get at the end of a mission appears on your curser.  If you deceide to go good faction, take it to Mercenary Guard Youra near SOlB entrance and turn it in to her.  Not sure of the turn in person for evil faction.<br />
<br />
2:  You can start doing missions right away.  In fact this is a good source of faction.<br />
<br />
3:  You get 2 rewards for completing most missions.  Crystals, with which to purchase things from the DoN merchants, and a faction token, which you turn in for faction(and I forget the name of offhand).<br />
<br />
4:  If by crystals you mean the faction token, then yes.  Mercenary Guard Youra is indif to all, and takes the tokens to boost good faction.  I am unsure of the person to turn in for evil faction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks alot for the info. Hopefully can throw a group together tonight and try a couple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive done a few missions so far, but whats the deal with tasks? Anyone shed some light on those, where ya get em, etc..  The missions ive done have all been good side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tasks u get before u get to indiffernt with a faction.. are just for faction... <br />
<br />
Once your indiffernt with either good or bad, u have to get quests at that camp, from the Main guys in the back..  These Task, which are accually small quests, are part of the progression of DoN.. and after doing them and a mission/raid, u get nice rewards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taraddar</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the KoS people the tasks from the wayfarer camp are a good help. There can be done while in a group doing the regular missions. For example the kill the 20 stillmoon mobs can be done while doing the statue quest. Nice way to pick up a little extra exp and faction while doing em.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started threatening to KoN and apprehensive to DR, but my dwarf cleric started apprehensive to both. All my friends are goodie-goodie elves so I went with KoN and my cleric is up to the Emoush even faction-wise while I just hit dubious with KoN. ARGH! <br />
<br />
At least the merchant will let me buy stuff with my hundreds of crystals I've amassed :P<br />
<br />
PS the required level 70 stuff is lame! My cleric has all these crystals and can't buy his full suit of armor and augs til he gets 4 more levels! :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The req level sucks but it is necessary since it's pretty trivial to earn crystals.  You don't even have to be physically present on a mission to earn them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was true for LDoN too. Did one in my mid 50's and one of our group have to leave. Was a complete guild group so we told him gate to POK but stay in group afk. We won the mission and he got the win and the points while afk in POK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we finally got a chance to try a mission the other night. I was playing my shammy since our main tank was on and hadd others fill out group. <br />
<br />
We picked the one about the statue plans in Stillmoon Temple. Exp was pretty nice but we didn't finish the mission before it got too late. Messed around for a couple hours in there and could not find the stuff it was asking for. We had no tracker so that didn't help. <br />
<br />
Was wondering if maybe there is a certain order we should try the missions in ? I saw some start in Lavaspinners some in Stillmoon and some in the Nest. Does the zone dictate the difficulty or just avg level of group ?</div></div><hr />
