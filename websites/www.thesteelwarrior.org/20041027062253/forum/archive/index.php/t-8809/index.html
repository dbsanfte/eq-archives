<br />
And anyone happen to know/guage if tapping/siphoning mana from a mob is a rather large aggro increase?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">-200 resist check is pretty good.  you can expect very few resists on that spell, unless you fight a specific elemental mob(ie: fire resist check on a mob in solro)  exampe: Hand of Ro(druid spell) is -200 FR, so it sticks on 99% of the mobs...if it doesnt stick, then the mob has insane FR. i dont belvie i've ever had Hand of Ro resisted on an LDON,  or in PoV, CoD,  and PoD.  Nortlav in Hole resist it....all the mobs in SolRO resist it, i suppect PoFire will be the same way(duh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viernafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for that :)<br />
<br />
Now I'm just curious to know if a DD that hits a mob for 200hps and takes away 200 mana is a large aggro inducer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stave of the Slayer from Ikaav I. Pox in barindu?  woudlnt mind picking up one for dps and/or offhand.  dropped him for the first time sunday, but only gave us the mask and the priest 1hb<br />
<br />
i know the DD part wontbe very much aggro, and i cant make a guess to the mana DD part of it. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viernafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes. . .thats the one.<br />
<br />
Been mainly trying to find and/or figure out what type of 1hdrs are out there with a decent aggro proc on them.<br />
<br />
Given the amount of warriors we have, and Rallos' reportedly stingy drops, there isn't much of a likelyhood I'd ever see a Darkblade.<br />
<br />
So I've been mostly on a search for a decent aggro weapon that would be a bit more of a boost in the AC, Hps, resists department, that wouldn't necessarily require an entire raidforce to get. (Ideally, maybe even one groupable, but we all know what a tall order that is)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the Blade of Carnage isn't bad. However, its not mine, and with the prospects of having more warriors added to the mix, it might also be better served to be passed onto another warrior as well too.<br />
<br />
Since I don't have the keys and such to get into places like Ssra, I'm not sure those are valid alternatives to finding something there either.<br />
<br />
Was considering the Blade of Ornate Symbols as well, but thats something that would really require a raid force on a target that really isn't of high importance since its mostly for flagging or for the few people that will suffer themselves to do the BiC quest.  Wasn't too sure about how useful the proc would be as well since it would be guaranteed to be resisted by just about everything as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Ssra is not keyed in that sense. A Bloodfrenzy is, at least in theory, accessible to you.<br />
<br />
  Lifetaps and I hear mana taps are very low aggro, around DD sort of level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Obsidian Scimitar of War from VZ is decent aggro(i use).  i think agnaar has a decent dps weapon on his loot table(like 17+1/20 or soemthing)...but both of those are raid targets. great blade of storms from bot tower is decent aggro too...<br />
<br />
other than thoes, i really cant say...not very far into EP(been flagged for abotu a week) and just now starting some named in GoD leser zones...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">-200 resist mod means that the mob/player must have above 200 in that resist to even have a chance to resist it.  It's much easier to land spells with resist mods than those without.<br />
<br />
200DD and 200mana drain isn't a lot of agro.  Mana drains are very little agro, so I'd say about even or less than a 200hp DD.</div></div><hr />
