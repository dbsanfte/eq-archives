Right now we do Velks, but the XP is way slower @ 57 than 56.  When we can't find a full group, it's nice to have an easy alternative.  Duoing never takes as long to form as a CY group!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could probably duo at the PoI zin, then pickup LFGs who wander in.</div></div><hr />

PoI zonein kills would be slow as christmas in Israel.  Perhaps certain places in PoJ... me and a 60 shammy guildie solo docks in PoN sometimes, but he has a huge manapool and epic for free DoTs.  Depends on equip really. my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

The lvl 58 heal makes a world of difference, i'd try and get that before going to PoP. I did the fly camp near IZ in PoD duo for a few lvls/AA once your shammy has the heal i'd try that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donvanlot</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once the shaman is 58 and gets Kragg's mending your options will open up to most regular tier 1 mobs.  Your best option is to root the mobs, back off warrior, slow, then move in.  Another option is to have the shaman slow pull, but unless you have kite space this is scary.  The fewer hits you take before slow the better.  With KEI on shaman you will be going nearly non-stop.<br />
<br />
Note: exp is better in a good regular group but like someone mentioned, you can pickup LFGs as they come.  I'd seriously reccomend another healer though.  While a shaman can heal one tank and self pretty well at 58, when you have 6 potential targets to heal it can get scary (especially when 2 boxing like I do! :) )<br />
<br />
poi,pod, poj, pon are all good in the right places.  I didn't like poi because of archaic models and the exp isn't all that great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maultar</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about CT?  Are single pulls possible there?  They have more HP but hit less harder.  PoP has less HP but hit harder.  Maybe CT is the CLR/War Duo choice since the clr can single if they use that one spell you get in OT/FV for spell hand in.  I forget the name but it's an AE Aggro range reducer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say stick to one of the zoned mentioned above til 58 the once you get your &quot;Shaman CH&quot; then go to PoI Zone In or Factory entrance ramp and kill just have shammy slow doT and heal yah. once you hit 60 in PoI i would stop and invest in some AA's before you go on since it has been proven you grow 20% faster in AA's at 60 then you do at 61 so do some AA's get some cool skills to make you stronger from there go to 65 if possible in Tier 1 zones do like 50/50 exp so you get lvls and AA's Get spells for Shaman.  WARNING: Don't know if what i say forward is possible more Experienced warriors please correct me if wrong<br />
<br />
From there go get Flagged for PoV/PoS then Duo in those zones AA's for awhile and if you got a guild take a few guildies to HoH CoD or HoH and exp should be pretty nice not sure if it possible though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />
