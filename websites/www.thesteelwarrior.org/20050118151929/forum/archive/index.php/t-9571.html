<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's been a while, and I honestly don't know what to look for to replace my necklace, which I am unhappy with.  I wouldn't mind suggestions on other slots, either.  However, changing out my helmet is NOT an option right now, as that is where my haste is currently at.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind saving up for upgrades in the bazaar, but those seem to be becoming fewer and farther between and costing ALOT more.  I also raid some in an alliance, often winding up the ST or sometimes the MT.  I wouldn't mind suggestions on what drops to save my points for if you think a drop would be better than a bazaar purchase.   Where I am at raiding wise: Emp kill from VT, Mith Marr kill from Sol Ro, Rallos kill from Earth/Air/Water.  Flags in the magelo are current.  <br />
<br />
GoD trials have been a royal pain.  I'm not sure I am willing to farm them, so please bear that in mind.  I haven't been into Omens much as it was too laggy, but I may consider it since I've gotten myself more ram and am looking a new video card soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terail</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your guild is geard allright and you are working on getting Flagged in PoP, I would Recomend you try out Tallon Zek for his Veteran's Battle Charm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7771) he shouldnt be hard if your guild is at that lvl of progression, and Allso you should try to go for Emperor's Neckles :Torque of the Wyrmlord (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26584) When you do kill Emperor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A really easy neck, if you end up going into Omens, that drops very often is Ornate Inlay Neck Crest (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70260) from Discordling Enchainer Kuruun in Proving Grounds. He spawns all the time and it is his common drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't spend DKP/Merit on either of the necks mentioned above.  If you can get them with just some friends/pick-up sort of deal then cool. If not, then you could get the neck in my magelo free just exp'ing in WoS.  Ornate Inlay Crest Neck from MPG would also upgrade you nicely. Another nice neck that might be an option is the Necklace of the Melodic Dragon which comes from a VP quest. If your guild alliance could do the one raid required for the new VP key, the rest of this quest is simple. Save those DKP for something really nice.<br />

EDIT: First sentence refers to the necks mentioned 2 posts up. Fyne just types faster than me :)</div></div><hr />
