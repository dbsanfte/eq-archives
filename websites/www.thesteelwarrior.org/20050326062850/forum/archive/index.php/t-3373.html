<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mendo</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 65 cleric, warrior and bard all well equipped. they are flagged for PoTactics, bot (like it matters anymore), and poi factory. Is there any place that this trio would stand up well enough to get some aa? I would rather stear clear from groups because leveling all three at different times takes much longer, and /ooc 65 cleric/war/bard rarely works for me. <br />
<br />
Some possibles i have heard are: PoNightmare trash (sounds slow), and PoV (seems a bit better).<br />
<br />
Any input is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You can lull/pull with the bard and pull it to group to fight as normal. Depending on the bard's aa status, you can probably highsun any adds that come.<br />
<br />
Of course, without a macro program, twisting would be kinda hard, but with more and more practice, it becomes easier to run 2-3 characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">See above. Basically, find places in every zone where you can pull singles with the bard or cleric. PoV would work just fine, PoTactics pens would be very, very nice. HoH is another very good spot, because very few of the mobs wander or run. PoV and PoTactics both have the disadvantage of running mobs. Tier 1 planes just don't have very nice exp compared to the others. I'd suggest it in the order of: HoH basements, PoTactics pens, PoV, tier 1 planes.</div></div><hr />

HoH basements etc are very lonely places and you always can pull solo with paci / harmony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mendo</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bard has a toetwister, so 9 times out of 10 the mob will be snared instead of running. I think I might try the pens, if not there then i will go to pov, I never liked HoH for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently crank out AA in HoH.  About 2.5 hours per AA using 65 war/dru/shm 3box setup.<br />
<br />
I know AA can be gained faster by joining a BoT or Tactics group, but 3 boxing is just so damn easy and stress free.<br />
1 minute after i log in i'm buffing.<br />
3 minutes after i log in i'm pulling the first mob.<br />
No hassle trying to find a grp, find a camp, no dying cuz someone was AFK, no ping pong....   HoH always has mobs available to kill - the lack of loot keeps peeps away.<br />
Plus it leaves holes in my grp that get filled by guildies who are LFG.</div></div><hr />

I find it easiest to take advantage of PoV's emptiness. Since you have a bard to slow, I would suggest going to PoV and setting up camp at LC. You could easily trio there with your characters, until you can find some more dps to join you. Just search /lfg for any class thatcan produce DPS. I've found PoV (BC,FC, or LC) to be better for XP than BoT is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heading in from the zone, there's a room on the right after the first intersection, you can single pull Diaku's there all day long with your warrior.<br />
<br />
They give about 6% AA per kill solo, or 3% each if I group my cleric.<br />
<br />
I do it with DS potions, a ToD, primal, KEI on the cleric, a snare whip, blazing vambracers, etc.. Your bard would make it easy.</div></div><hr />
