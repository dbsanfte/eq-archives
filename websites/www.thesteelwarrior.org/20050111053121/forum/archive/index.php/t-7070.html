Respawn in 15 minutes. Group with a bard and cap out MR to resist his proc. Get bulwark of vie / alendor to help mitigation melee and proc damage and it doesnt hurt to have someone Spellshield you if this is your first time going in.<br />
<br />
Other than that, just melee kill him down and have a CH rot. At like 40% he starts chain casting so his melee dps goes way down but dont let the healers stop casting because he will soon spike right back into normal attack mode.<br />
<br />
When he dies the PP will spawn in middle of the room, just send out a kiter to kite the cats on opposite side of the room from you, and get flags and loot then AE tl out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More to add. When fighting him keep your people as close as possible to him and asses on the wall. If anyone wanders jsut a bit to far back they can aggro adds and thats a pain in the ass. For instance see this diagram my guild made!<br />

If your guild is lacking in the dps deparment, or even if they aren't and you have 2 or 3 good enchanters, charm/haste/buff the wrulon's to provide additional dps on the kill they help a ton.</div></div><hr />

Only thing is charmed pets are subject to the crappy auto-gate HoH rule in Temple of Marr. If you've ever had 2 pets suddenly disappear because they gated, then watch the carnage ensue when charm breaks as a train of pussy power runs at you, you may second guess the worth of charming.<br />
<br />
Yes, itd be hella faster with 4 pets, but ya dont 'need' them so np!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to bards AE-kiting huge numbers of mobs in HOH, a special anti-kiting feature was added to HOH. I believe it works like this: whenever you have 9 mobs pursuing the same target, and a 10th mob wants to join the pursuit, the 10th mob will gate to bind point and wipe its hate list instead. Thus you can never have more than 9 mobs attacking a single target in HOH.<br />
 <br />
As a side effect, this anti-kiting feature was also implemented in HOHB where Mithaniel Marr lives.<br />
 <br />
As a side effect, the anti-kiting feature will activate whenever you have more than 9 PETS (of any type) attacking Mithaniel Marr.<br />
 <br />
So your MM fight may be going just fine with a couple of charmed pets, and then someone decides to use their PET SWARM AA for example, which raises the number of pets beyond 9, and suddenly the charmed pets gate to bind point and wipe their hate lists, and everyone says &quot;WTF?&quot;<br />
 <br />
The charmed pets then die at bind point to the mobs around them, and/or sit at bind point until charm wears off, and then you get a big fat train of mobs which arrive just when you thought Mithaniel Marr was about to take a dirt nap.<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, you don't need charm pets to down MM though.  The wrulons are so freaking MR resistant that it's hard enough to mez them (and keep them mezzed), let alone try charming.  Are they good dps?  Shit yeah.  Are they needed?  No.<br />
<br />
LMM does have a shitstorm of hitpoints.  He's got around 1.2-1.3 million I believe, so it can take a while to down his skinny arse.  He also has a *GIGANTIC* agro range, which leads me to say the following.<br />
<br />
Clear his room while the raid is outside of his chambers.  You can hide your raid in the corners, but it all it takes is one person not paying attention to be out too far and agro LMM.  If that happens, you have himself + 2x quad-1100 hitting guards storming your raid.  It's not fucking pretty.  Simply put, clear his room and his guards while the raid is just outside his chambers.  That way no fucktard can agro LMM.  Once his guards are clear, move in to his chambers, either to the left or right, and pull LMM single.  If you're lacking dps, then you may get a wrulon add during the fight, but you can easily kill it and move back to LMM when you're done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jesus no you dont try to charm mpbs inside his room. Those are far to MR. You charm the blue con ones in the hallway right before his room. And like you said, its not necessary but for whoever wants the option you should use those.<br />
<br />
Also it really is not hard to kill mobs in his room. If you do it that way you dont have to fight any respawns outside his room before moving into his room or while clearing his room. You want to kill things so you have the largest window of time to kill MM. The cat respawn is 15 minutes btw. Or you can like i said earlier just mez the 2 in whichever corner you choose to fight in.<br />
<br />
The mob aggro range is 200' as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually if you can deal with the cats (off tankings to prevent repop), fast pulling (need dps)<br />
Or kiting (worked for us once). MM is pretty much dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll add what you DONT need to do:<br />
<br />
- you dont need to lev (a bunch of open raids on Fennin seem to think this is a good idea for some mind boggling reason)<br />
- the tiles in the room have no mystical significance.  There was a warrior on an open raid I was with who seemed to think there was.<br />
<br />
Also when you corner him its useful to leave an open avenue along the wall for subsequent tanks in the tank chain to get in for tank switches...the large object just in front of the corners can make this difficult if a corridor is not left open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OH BTW. <br />
<br />
Since dx9 changes dont corner him. Either walk him along the wall or pin him somehow on it but I STRONGLY reccomend not cornering. I have been screwed over by it to many times thinking each time that it might work. MM warping to bind, regenning to 100% and training allthe cats in the room on you sucks. Also, gettimg to mm with a raid of 28, having him at 17% then suddenly he gets stuck in the wall and you can no longer cast on or hit him and he just rapes everyone is no fun either.<br />
<br />
F the corner and F dx9!</div></div><hr />

A little bit less than that.  I've never gotten a 100% accurate parse on him due to the inability to see other hits / non melee when he gets pushed up higher on the wall, but his hp is less than one million, roughly 750k.</div></div><hr />

He has more than that.  The second to last time we killed him, I clocked 970k just in melee damage dealt to him (the raid, not me, hehe).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yah thats my experience as well. Only after a few moments he  then would warp back to his spawn spot, regen to 100% and come back bringing a train of cats. Sucked. :(</div></div><hr />
