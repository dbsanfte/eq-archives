Unfortunately I won't be able to attend.  I'm hoping that a Warrior representive, perhaps someone like Frodlin, can.</div></div><hr />

Zanetti told me he/she asked about melee balance and they ran like little girls =/</div></div><hr />

ok heavy moded, so nothing got through &quot;isnt it about time you stoped fannying about with all these caster upgrades and finaly sort out the Pure melee, or are ya gonna put it back again to 4 months from next micklemass?&quot; <br />

<br />
For my part i just cancelled both my preorders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope your little dev chat did well.  Now stop thinking about your pocketbooks and start thinking about your GAME.  Balance it.  Right now I can't see how working on EQ isn't an embarrassment for you guys with the state some of the classes of this game are in.  Stop cranking out new expansions and polish your product.  I guarantee you'll keep more accounts that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absor, remember that you promised to come back here to discuss warrior balance issues.<br />
<br />
I'm holding you to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: It's unfortunate that either noone asked, or noone answered as to what they were adding for the pure melee. for any caster, they can point to new toys of spells they're adding... but when it comes to what they've added that's new for pure melees along the same lines... I bet they can't say much, except point to armour and weapons with different numbers on them, which really isn't new at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardly surprising.<br />

They refused to talk about anything related to melee balance because that is not part of LDoN.  Meaning... they have done nothing .</div></div><hr />
