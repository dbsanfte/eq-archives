<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With all the complaints about warrior aggro I wonder how many of us still actually enjoy playing a warrior, or are just holding out for sony to give us an aggro boost.<br />
Myself, I enjoy playing a warrior about 10% of the time... on raids.  Aggro isn't too much of an issue when given 15 seconds to build it.  Of course that's only when I'm MT, SA'ing on the other hand is about as fun as watching paint dry.<br />
As for the other 90% of the time I find myself getting more and more frustrated everyday.  LDoN groups simply can't afford the time to let the war to build aggro and without a proc in the first 2 seconds the mob ping pongs all over the damn place.  Anger3 procs would be nice, but I just can't put up with the 30 or so wins in the hell that is Miraguls to get them.  And then I notice they added Anger2 to Mistmoore and it's fucking type8.  Mistmoore, which seems to be the favorite zone for many, is a walk in the park compared to Miraguls, a zone which everyone seems to despise.  /rude Sony<br />
Anyways, just wondering how others are feeling.  I'm at the point of starting over as an SK, or quitting EQ entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I can get a group, I love playing my warrior.  Sitting in PoTranquility for hours on end with any class sucks.  After 1 horrendous night in PoI and not being able to generate any form of agro I broke down and got a CHoS to main hand and moved my Frosty to offhand.  Agro has gotten a lot better since then.  And when I pull my GSoT out of the bag, its just as good as my dual wield combo.  Getting a Taunt fix so that it is successful more than once in 6 tries would be heaven.  I'd even settle for a 2nd Taunt button on a 30-60 second refresh timer that guarantees you'll get agro.  Make it a skill you acquire at lvl 35 or 40 and make it work on all mobs up to lvl 65.<br />
<br />
I personally prefer Miragul's to Mistmoore.  Probably because my first 6 adventures in a row were in Mistmoore and failed miserably.  Guk seems to be the shunned LDoN theme on D Ro, its the only one that I can't get a group to go to.  Just by mentioning that I'd like to go there I had 4 members of a group say that they would leave if that was where we were going.<br />
<br />
Maybe after I grind out a few more levels my guildies will go check it out with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still immensely enjoy my warrior.  I cant speak for Elemental + warriors who have to compete with knights for MT duties, but in VT and lower tier PoP I can tank just fine.<br />
I'm not saying agro is perfect, far from it.  But it is managable.  When i was leveling up there were no Droga weapons and most of us got along fine.  At level 61 i paid 34,000pp for a GSoT and had exp groups tell me all the time I tanked as well or better than most knights they knew.<br />
As far as the real fun....raids are where it's at for me.  Nothing is more fun than being at the center of it all on a 40+ man raid.  Raids are why I started a warrior and why I keep playing one.<br />
Yeah there are balance issues to work out but imo, the class is not &quot;broken.&quot;   Again, this is coming from a pre-elemental/pre-time warrior's point of view.  I know there are additional factors that arise when you get to that level, but from the wording of your post, I'd venture to guess you're not there yet either...correct me if I'm wrong please.</div></div><hr />

I think we've all been at that point, Malek.<br />
<br />
But you have to remember, that is what alts are for. It is FINE to reroll as another class and see how it is, and how you like it. I have too many alts on too many servers to count!<br />
<br />
I know that i have really thought about rerolling a few times..but it is just too much of a timesink for me =P<br />
So, until i can do a magical /changeclass wizard (or whatever other class i want) i will love my warrior till the bitter end...whether i like it or not :p</div></div><hr />

It's kind of hard to just give up on something you've built up for over 4 years though. That and I still have faith that things will get better. If not.... I have a 53 paladin waiting for me to build up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love being a warrior in EQ when no one give me crap about taunt and agro. When I am allowed to tank. When my group members aren't dying because of me.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, being a warrior in EQ kinda sucks right now. But I still love being a warrior.</div></div><hr />

I like to lead. Warriors do it naturally!<br />
<br />
That's still so much fun. <br />
<br />
I do it for the jumjum, the pie, and the love of the halfling women!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyzz</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, and that's why I canceled both EQ accounts over a month ago.  I'm not going to get on a soapbox and preach about all the problems that exist, because it simply came down to not having fun playing a warrior in EQ anymore.<br />
<br />
I don't have the desire or time to invest in an other class, so now after 4 years of EQ I'm waiting for the next big thing.  Hopefully the pure fighter/meelee class in Final Fantasy XI is worth playing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cant say that I am.  Everytime I log in and look at the character select screen and go through all my characters I stop and think logging on my warrior.  Then I realize that I do not have fun playing Irminric anymore tired of LFG for hours, tired of the frustration of being told let the SK or Paladin tank.  I do not know if I ever will return to him but I can not bring it upon myself to strip, delete or retire him.  So I log on my beastlord instead and wait patiently for that Melee balance they are working on hopefully soon.   <br />

Gnomers is my cross server alt there I should log him on he is only level 24 so it should be fun leveling him up.   The next time I can play is wensday I am off that day so I will send you a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No.<br />
Playing a warrior is too much work even at the equipment level i am at to make it fun.<br />
Being bitched at by clerics in the front row of a rotation for dying (and in some cases there isnt simply a damn thing i can do about it) isnt fun.<br />
Playing dps in ldon in a group with 3 knights(2 pallies, 1 sk) isnt fun either, espcially considered the AA/gear level they are at and short of having chain procs or perma taunting there isnt much i can do to hold agro when VoQ is available (which usually is) to them.<br />
The only character i am having fun with at the moment is my bard.<br />
It is downright frightening how much fun a class can be that is (mostly) gear independent to work, even at level 65 which he dinged yesterday(bard was started october 2000, so not a new character).</div></div><hr />

But then I think am lucky and I have a Group of ppl that want to be with me.  When they are not on i eather  do traid skills lvl up some other toon or make a group and  rotat what dungon I do.  <br />
<br />
I dont get to raid any more.  My guild devided and well I have not  felt like getting into a big one where i can tank.  My gear is ok but i have about 500 aa now think i have about 60 left to get.<br />
so yes I still like my  war most the time. I have no idea what am going to do when I run out of AA's to get. highest  zones I can get to are  Bot and  Potac.<br />

The only thing that keeps me in game is my friends at this point. I've been fortunate enough to play with a good team for the past 3 years, so we all know each others strengths and weaknesses. I don't have to fight the battles a lot of other warriors do in regards to aggro and trying to find groups.<br />
<br />
Yeah I still play my warrior, he was my first and favorite. I do play a mage when my friends aren't online, but I'm basically just waiting on WOW. I've lost all faith in Verant and Sony's ability to keep me entertained. I wouldn't buy another product of theirs if it came with a million dollar rebate and blow jobs for life.</div></div><hr />
