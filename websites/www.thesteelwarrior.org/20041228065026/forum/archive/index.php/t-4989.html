<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VALDMIR</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors Disc <br />
Fortitude = no combat related damage for 10 secs -&gt; use to cost you no more disc for 45 minutes. because of the long refresh timer involved in that disc few if any ever used it. <br />
<br />
But that has all changed ..... <br />
A scenario you as an SA tank have just watched the MA tank die, you can AE Taunt , than hit Incite (new agro disc) now NPC has your attention. hit disc &quot;Fortitude&quot; for the next 12 secs you can attack NPC and not take any damage /with no loss in agro whats so ever...... This also allows those Clerics the much needed time to successfully target you and begin the CCH. Once your disc has expired you can immediately go to normal evasive or stone disc. <br />
<br />
Another scenario is as MA you can go Fortitude than defensive. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another disc that i have recently discovered value in is Resistant disc ...... if you are not MA or SA , use this disc when attacking nasty AE mobs. IT WILL stack with bard song AND has an incredibly long duration with no loss of endurance, which means when its time to go offensive you can click it off and than hit killing machine disc. BTW healing disc will not sufficiently offset AE damage so you are better off with resistant disc in effect. <br />

<br />
By all means this is quite valid, but I encourage you to read through most of the forum topics before posting information which has been considered, posted, and saluted...<br />
<br />
That being said...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree with two things.<br />
<br />
First, if someone makes an observation or conclusion and posts here in an attempt to generate thoughtful discussion I frown upon those who will point out &quot;this has been posted before&quot; and try to make them seem stupid.  If I want to post an observation or thought I certainly am not going to take two hours and search on the related topic in hopes that I won't regurgitate a previously posted idea.<br />
<br />
Second, I disagree with the use of Fortitude.  In my mind Furious is a far superior disc because 1) it also negates melee damage on boss type mob tanking, and 2) it will generate better aggro from increased DPS.<br />
<br />
I am not an elemental warrior and have 8.4k hp buffed.  However, the new discs have enabled me to succesfully tank some mobs I hadn't heretofore.  <br />
<br />
The most recent was Raex Pwodill in the cod high priest ring.  Tag with Incite, disc Furious (which also negates lifetap proc), and then Defensive, and AE Taunt on enrage.  Perfect execution for an Open Raid (and yes, I am in a small guild so we do these encounters on Karana with pick-up raids ;p ).<br />
<br />
Furious is absolutely vital for us on mobs like Rydda Dar where the win depends on DPS and the MT surviving an opening mob DPS spike.<br />
<br />
Furious = build aggro while positioning and allowing time to slow (disease in the case of Rydda...) and cheal rotation to settle in.  <br />
<br />
However, I would liek to hear what the advantage of Fortitude would be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also can't imagine why you'd use fortitude over furious for the given scenarios.  Only advantage fortitude has is that you won't take dmg from any direction, vs only not from the front for furious, but for starting vs a boss mob or tank switches, you oughta be facing the mob. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a fairly valid reason, furious seems to cost more endurance than fortitude.  It might not be as much an issue once they give +end items but as it stands now, endurance is the limiting factor, esp if you are disc'ing defensive right after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most boss fights lately I use furious, stonewall, 2 or 3 incites and still have endurance left to fellstrike afterwards. Engaging with furious is fantastic as it gives your heal chain time to start casting as you engage. You only need maybe 1 patch heal whereas before you were praying like mad that none of the patch healers were going to get aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey Buun! :)<br />
<br />
I actually LEFT the last open RD raid because I was being dictated to NOT using an offensive disc.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, u need to use either defensive er evasive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough they lost all 4 tanks in the first 40 seconds.<br />
A bit off topic, just still be burnt they would nae listen.<br />
<br />
On topic however, I only use fortitude when the cleric dies, I miss evac, and i be hauling ass for the zone :)<br />
<br />
Stonewall?<br />
I kinda retired that disc to cornering only. Sontalak was pushed so bad I lost more DPS in missed attacks than I gained with full DPS on attacks that hit.<br />
<br />
(By the way, ye guys get RD yet? Last I knew they wiped again. Bad healing chain or something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe flurry hits will hit through furious but miss against fortitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewall is the best for say um PoWater where you cant back up anyways and you can't tell if the snare effect is on either. As for fortitude i dont see much usefulness other than the few times I have used it to run past Sontalak.<br />
<br />
As for furious as I posted before i use it all the time. It has made tank switches on mobs like Rapeme, Magmaton, Fennin, etc so much easier now because it gives the clerics time to change the chain over and generates and insane amt of aggro when combines with taunt incite and eb weaps/augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah good idea posting, and to those that didn't know.

<br />
Furious is listed in my disc screen as being 62 upkeep, while Fortitude is listed as being 65 upkeep.  So no go on that excuse amigo.</div></div><hr />

Well...allright, agreed... Maybe I was being too judgemental...Perhaps I felt that this post was less of an observation to be talked about rather then an instruction on how to do things. In anycase, I didn't really try or even want to make him look stupid, just wanted to point out it already was spoken about and you can spend your two hours looking for the similar thread about this particular topic instead of starting a disccussion here which will be in almost all certainty, regurgitated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm .. i always considered furious to be a defensive discipline first.<br />
<br />
furious is to me the most fun discipline. but its also extrordinarily useful on boss mobs. consider .. what do we warriors get more complaints about than anything else? losing agro right? so you do this. make 3 hotkeys for your weapons. they will be your primary your secondary and an open inventory slot. put a very high damage 2h in the inventory slot so it shows on your hotkey. (tantors tusk is a favorite of many). now on the pull you swap the weapons with the hotkeys (no need to open inventory). engage the mob with the high damage looong delay weapon and the mob hits you with his characteristic damage spike. in the 9 seconds or whatever it is he hits you say 15 times but they are all riposted. now make the quick switch back to your favorite agro weapons again using your hotkeys and go defensive.<br />
<br />
the slower doesnt have to slow for 10 seconds. indeed he needs to be instructed NOT to slow for 10 seconds.<br />
same is true for debuffs in general.<br />
<br />
the ripostes did about 2000+ damage. groupmates ooh and ah!<br />
<br />
the first heal wont have to come in for a long time because the mob is slowed just as furious is wearing off denying the mob any spike damage at all.<br />
<br />
you have succeeded in generating huge agro before the first heal or slow was cast. on the toughest mobs this is likely to save the lives of the poor folks who are tasked to be first on the lineup for the debuffs.<br />
<br />
you have gotten past the hardest part of surviving .. the initial engagement.<br />
<br />
... and this is all new. because until now if we went furious we couldnt go defensive. we can have it both ways now. and i love it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knobbie</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been incorporating the incite on pull to furious and then into defensive on all the guilds boss encounters as of late and I wouldnt do it any other way.<br />
<br />
With the BoW and anger3 aug equipt I commonly see a minimum of 3 procs in the first 12 seconds and have seen 5 on FR adding in the incite on pull and more 95% of the time I have generated enough agro to hold the mobs attention for the duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
I also use this tactic because it will help the healing rotation adjust at the start to any unforeseen mishaps that may arrise and we all know they do. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
This tactic has also made FR an easier switch with AT added in if by chance the MT goes down without losing too much healing and allowing the SA to generate a decent amount of agro for the switch and the clerics to get on him/her fast.<br />
<br />
The only time I use stonewall is if we are AoW'ing a mob like the chieftains or PoF pulls. I would never use that in PoW because if I didnt have enough agro at the start and the mob turns after that nasty knockback affect half the healing force would go down before I could do the backstroke to get within range of him.<br />
<br />
In closing I want to say that even though this is my first ever post here I have been an avid reader for going on 3 years now and want to say kudos to everyone. Most of what I know and what I do in the game I learned here and have become, according to some, a damn fine tank for the guild. All that and I am an assling to boot. =p<br />

Thats why i said use stonewall in water because you get the mitigation and the dmg and no side effect.</div></div><hr />

Say a bad pull in VT and you got a ton of 4 arms and hoodies on you. Pop AE taunt and /disc fort.

To be honest, the only disc's I've used since the changes were incite, defensive, healing will (When farming, or after a rezz when cleric wasn't epic or was rezzing self as well), and mighty strike in a grind group where things were getting boring and I wasn't using any endurance. =/  I tried Stonewall once, but with the push the mob was getting I quickly ended up BEHIND the mob and couldn't backpedal to get back in front.    I'm glad this discussion came up, I learned a lot..can't wait till our next raid so I can try this out =)</div></div><hr />

Furious and fortitude are both 12 seconds with 40 min reuse.</div></div><hr />
