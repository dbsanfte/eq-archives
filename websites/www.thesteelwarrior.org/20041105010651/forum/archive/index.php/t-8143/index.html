<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy,  I was just wanting some advice on how to reach that 8k mark that seems to be hardwired in as what seperates bad from good tanks to other nonwarriors.  I feel I have decent equipment for not being EP.  Please look at my equipment and AAs and any advice will be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Given that you have no aa, and great bazaar gear your best bet is AA. Buy ND3, PD3, Sturdyness 1 and you'll be about 8.5k raid buffed I would guess. <br />
<br />
Assuming you're not raiding, I'd check out the 40hp augs from EC ldon, and maybe some EF legs too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your gear is pretty good.  Ornate legs would be a decent upgrade for you, but yeah as Bardeil says, get ND3, PE, PD3 and Sturdiness... Time to grind some AAs<br />
<br />
ND3 and PE should put you around 5.4khps, add PD3 and you'll be over 5.6k unbuffed.  Fully buffing adds another 2.5k so this will put you over 8k.  Do sturdiness 5 aswell and you'll be hitting 6k unbuffed, 8.5k buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nro/EF Ldon armor, Strength of the Elements, another Steel Ring and a Black Plated Collar would up your hp's a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depending on how much you want to spend, there are a few slots you could buy some nice upgrades. LDoN looks like the best route at this point since it will get you the AA you need on top of some upgrades.<br />
<br />
Helm - Helm of Ralloz Zek, RA Helm (put haste here adn you can upgrade belt to Rubicite)<br />
Legs - Ornate, Fierce Heraldic, RA<br />
Finger - Steel Ring<br />
Wrist - RA<br />
Ear - Tear of Rainmaker, Ear Symbol of Veteran<br />
<br />
If you get some defensive AA and can do some hard LDoN, there is a slew of upgrades you can get from drops in there (Cape of Broken Enchantments, Necklace of the Troglodyte, Earring of Sand Tides, Lost Elven Ring, Bloodied Boots of Dark RItes)</div></div><hr />
