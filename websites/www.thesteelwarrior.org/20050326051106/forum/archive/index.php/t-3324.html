<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a warrior's perspective, is the time sinks for Shissar Bane, Emp Key, and VT key worth it?<br />
<br />
My guild is a casual/family/flexible raiding type guild.  We are steadily advancing through PoP content, and someone recently brought up getting VT keys.  <br />
<br />
I've heard the stories about farming shards, VT as a horrible zone, and Emp gankings.  I'm wondering, aside from all the horrible negatives which I've heard expressed, is VT really worth it to raid in if you have Elemental aspirations?  I know some guilds skipped that completely, but I'd like to hear the variety of opinions from you folks which have slogged it through VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lexxe</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its definately worth it. <br />
<br />
The key quest is a huge pain in the ass, but once you finish it, you will be glad you did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decaillin</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible to get to the Elementals without VT gear; but considering the sheer number of upgrades you will get on each trip to VT, it will make things a lot easier for you in PoP. <br />
<br />
In addition, VT will teach your guild how to handle massive pulls, and how to cope with the soul crushing boredom you will encounter on later PoP raids <br />
<br />
Getting an entire guild to work on Emp/VT keys can be a huge hassel, and will test the strength and patience of your guild (people WILL get restless if you focus solely on keys); but the end result is well worth all of the headaches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny, this was one of my guild's discussions as of last week if we should go back now that we're 90%+ elemental level.<br />
<br />
VT in my opinion is worth it is you're all in velious grade and some early-Luclin era gear. besides the mind numbing farming of shards + ssra sub farming/emp; i think it's worth it for ya's to go there.<br />
<br />
the whole conditioning to PoP fights too is good to experience in VT like Lexxe and Decaillin here mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VT as a zone is dull. The first few times it's pretty neat, but after that, it gets old fast. The only good thing is the loot ratio. We dubbed it Candyland. Once you get it down, you can do VT in one evening and the amount of upgrades you get is like the old day NToV raids.<br />
<br />
It sucks, but i would definately reccommend it. It's a great source for any guild to get some upgrades for newer memebers if in elementals and if you are just starting PoP, the amount of loot per hour you just can't compare.<br />
<br />
like Nike says, Just Do It! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a word: Yes.<br />
<br />
There is lots of stuff there that will last till Time. It's mostly Aten Ha Ra stuff that is better than anything in the EP's (neck, mask, earring), but there are a few oddities here and there as well (belt off aten blobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I joined my guild as they were  finishing VT.. I still wished to this day that i would have got to go there.../cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  Very few places will get your whole guild upgraded gearwise as VT will.  It is a bit of a time sink, but with some strategically placed CoHing etc., it can be manageable.  With 4-6 hours of farming, you can come away with something like 20+ pieces of outstanding loot.  And really shard hunting isn't that bad (I'd say that the ME and Deep shards are probably the worst, Deep probably not anymore with the changes), and the hardest part will be killing Emp, and getting the keys and ore to do it.  (UGH!)  But once you get the strat down he's worthwhile anyway as his loot table is very good.  I'm not saying you can't skip VT and go right to trying to get flagged for elementals.  You can, but the DPS/AC/HP/MANA/FT, etc. upgrades you'll get from VT will make getting flagged for and doing things in Elementals much much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh my guild is skipping VT entirely.  There is some desire to go, mainly for some of the really nice high end stuff, but not only is there a lot of competition for it, but we have watched it kill many guilds in the past.  Spending 16+ hours farming a zone isn't for everyone, and from as boring as it sounds, I know I will never set my foot in VT for any reason whatsoever.<br />
<br />
With that said, I would like to add that I can see how it WOULD be the thing for some people; our guild is just not a heavily raiding guild, and we don't like any zone that requires a key so time intensive that it would exclude a large number of our members that don't log on as often as some of us do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some very nice warrior trinkets in there, I think the timesink is well worth it.  Looking at it from the whole guild perspective, VT is on of the best sources for focus effects and FT for your casters which help out on raids in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a word: Yes.<br />
<br />
You can get it down to 7 hours for a clear, for over 30 loots... so a loot every 15 minutes, o rbetter.<br />
<br />
Look at my magelo for some examples of the gear you can get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VT is very worth it, as has been said.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's just another one of those zones to add to the &quot;been there, got the t-shirt&quot; list.<br />
<br />
Lots of caster focus effects, lots of vengeance stuff and fun clickies to be had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another reason to go is that I think on most servers elementals are starting to get pretty crowded - I know on povar pretty much anything that drops loots is dead on patch days &amp; then 3 day intervals after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raun and I are on the same server and the Elemental situation is getting similar to the one described on Povar. There are two Time enabled guilds, two other guilds that have been elemental enabled for a while and two more just dropped Rz in the last couple weeks. One of the more recent entries into the Ele's is an Australian guild, so that adds a whole aspect into the race for mobs.<br />
<br />
The Emp is also pretty contested by atleast two guilds I can think of, with another one very close to their first attempt. <br />
<br />
Its a matter of preference really, or maybe the lesser of two evils. Both places are gonna be contested, just depends on what appeals the most.<br />
<br />
I think VT would be good for you guys, but the time sinks would put its strain on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another reason I thought of.  VT is probably one of the, if not the, best source of 41% haste items in the game.  You'll be able to outfit almost all melee who need one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has come up from time to time since PoP released and I have always been a huge supporter of VT first. Not only will your guild pick up valuable raid experience and strat lessons, there is no better source for high end loot in the game pre-elementals.<br />
<br />
On the old boards one of the first times this discussion came up someone posted that their guild had gotten to RZtW and had never been to VT. They where about 3-4 months behind the guilds that did VT first.<br />
<br />
You can certainly get all the way to time without doing VT, but you will spend a lot more time and effort gearing people up and you will have a much harder time breaking in to farm mode in the elems without VT gear. The FT, haste, effects, and Vengeance you get out of VT will make your PoP progression 10x easier.<br />
<br />
Ask Shik and his guild about this. Their guild leader decided to go the VT route after reading the discussion on the old boards. While a few people where not happy about it at the time, I think it is safe to say that it was a good decision now. They went from being well over an expansion back of the top guilds (AoW/NToV when PoP released) to just a couple of months behind (in elems just after Time was beat).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The old arguments were not is vt 'worth it' (nobody ever argued that I saw that it wasn't worth the time), but was it required to advance in PoP.  <br />
<br />
VT is definitely worth it; reward vs time is hands down one of the best in the game.  It just isn't a necessity to advance in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it depends on how much competition there is for VT and how much competition there is for the elemental planes.  The guilds on Tarew Marr that skipped VT and went straight for the elementals are several months ahead of the two guilds that went to VT now.  If you're looking to move up the ladder on your server and there's multiple guilds in VT already I'd say skip it, but if you are in a position to farm VT without a lot of competition it's probably worthwhile.<br />
<br />
It is a lot of easy loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apoco1</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am working on mine and it definitally is a major...major...MAAAJOR pain in the a....butt &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild skipped VT and it was probably the best decision we've made.  VT does make PoP easier, but tactics and execution are much more important than gear.  A couple of things to note: my guild is large, and we had more or less uncontested control of the elementals once we got there (the other elemental guild at the time wasn't farming for some reason).  If your guild is not large or if the elementals are crowded, you might be better off hitting VT first.  If you decide to go the PoP route, make sure you set the appropriate expectations.  Don't expect much in the way of upgrades until you're in the elementals, and don't expect it to be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is my opinion that Vex Thal is VERY much worth it.<br />
<br />
However, as some have stated, it is certainly possible to progress in PoP if you have not done VT.<br />
<br />
However, I maintain that it takes a significantly larger force to do so.<br />
<br />
If you can consistantly put 72 man raids together, you probably can skip VT.<br />
<br />
If you are more in the 30 - 40 range, then VT will be a requirement to progress into PoP.<br />
<br />
Currently my guild is gearing up in VT, and doing PoP targets when we're waiting on VT to respawn.  We consistantly field 30 - 40 members in a raid, and with strong strategies have been able to complete all Tier 1 PoP targets (Aerin`Dar, Terris Thule, Grummus, Manaetic Behemoth)<br />
<br />
With a few more VT clearings under our belt to bolster our resists and HP/MANA, we should be able to push through to the elemental planes with our current forces.<br />
<br />
If we had tried to skip VT, we'd have had to double in size, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlordbarreck</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VT is probably worth it if your guilds willing to go through the camping and farming required to get into VT.  Progressing through PoP is the same way, its just your farming and camping raid level mobs rather than solo/one groupable mobs to get through.<br />
<br />
The guild I&quot;m currently in just made it into Elementals and we've never killed one named in Ssra or VT.  We average anywhere from 50-65 people on a raid night depending.  A lot has to do with how well you communicate and work together to get stuff done.  And some guilds will work faster than others depending on the drive.  <br />
<br />
The decision depends solely on whether you think taking the time to get to VT and get upgrades then progress through PoP is worth it while, in possibly the same amount of time it takes you to do all that you could just go and get Elemental access and get your upgrades through Elemental planes.  Either idea is good, just depends on what you want to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ecchu</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my guild, Good Guys, on the Seventh Hammer skipped VT and went straight to PoP for elementals.  It wasn't the easiest path to follow, as we were plagued by gear that wasn't up to par, but that being said we made it and killed Fennin a week or so ago with no VT gear and barely any ele armor.  It really is up to the guild which path to choose.  Going to VT will be boring in itself, but going without it will take that much more time.  Just hope you're lucky and that when you do get to elementals that PoFire will be uncontested for your gear lol.   In a nutshell, VT isn't required - do whats fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">key for VT takes 10-60 hours to compete<br />
<br />
VT clearing takes 7-14 hours<br />
after you've done one clearing you will wish to never go back to this zone. I'd say if you choose VT then be prepared for serious time comitment. 100+ hours easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VT is well worth it imo aswell, in the end we got down to about 5 hours or so per cleraing. And when it doenst take longer than that its not as boring anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthious</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, we have 8 Elemental guilds on Lanys, 2 of those in Time, and 2 more that are creeping up pretty fast, VT is the only &quot;sure&quot; thing my guild has pretty much, since we took the time to key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your guild can field 60+ players for elementals every day I'd say go for it.<br />
But even with this number you will be in trouble for some encounters (and we just started hitting elementals).<br />
I remember the profiles of a US guild that hit elementals maybe 1 or 2 months before us.<br />
They cleared VT maybe 5 times or so.<br />
Still the difference was quite remarkable(we cleared a dozen or so times and i got like 12 or 13 upgrades in that time).<br />
500+ hp and 300 or so AC in magelo are quite substantial in PoP.<br />
I dont say its impossible but its quite a bit easier VT geared.<br />
If you have a lot of competition in VT though, it might be worth skipping it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just finished up keying for emp and VT so let me post some of my experiences.<br />
<br />
Emp Key: At 65 ssra is a cakewalk, you can put together just about any group and destroy the place and really ssra isn't terrible xp.  It took me maybe 10-20 hours doing various stuff in ssra to get my key but this was grouping with other guildmates who also needed their keys and rolling on drops.  C1 / C2 are the biggest headaches, pouch is very easy to get and c3 will just take one mini raid to get a ton of insignia.  Honestly the emp key is a nice ring.  I almost would say its worth getting just for the ring itself so getting a useful piece of gear from the quest is a nice side benefit<br />
<br />
Emp Bane: Getting the ore for the bane sucked, it took me maybe another 10-20 hours for the ore.  The good thing is that the mines in ssra are pretty fun and better xp than the snakes.  If you can put together an AoE group down here you can really clean up the place and should get your bane ore pretty fast.  A side benefit is that the ssra shard drops in the mines and isn't too rare.  You should have everyone outfitted with shards by the time you get your ore<br />
<br />
Shards:  I honestly found the shards to be pretty fun.  Half of them are very easy to get and you can two box them very quickly.  The other half require any sort of group with a healer but are really not too bad.  I found it sorta fun to go back ot the old luclin zones like the deep and AC and AR and destroy stuff.  The only bad shards for me were ME and FG but even those weren't terrible.  I think it took me basically 1 week + a long weekend to get all my shards and the shard box.<br />
<br />
Overall keying for VT wasn't as bad as I feared it would be.  Some parts were actually pretty fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow.<br />
If you completed this key in 10-60 hours I need to learn how. I spent 75 hours just getting the emp key alone. ( damn ring took me forever to get ).<br />
I have 3 lucid shards, the dawnshroud peaks one took 5 hours, the Akheva ruins one I got in a raid and the scarlet desert one I got from a guildie who was camping it and got two, so I ran and got it.<br />
total 82 hours for emp key, and 3 shards.<br />
It is gonna take me minimum another 20+ hours to get the rest of the shards.<br />
:PP<br />
Quests like this ruin the game IMHO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a lot about luck and if your groups stick to the camp or someone just leaves after getting the drop.<br />
We had a 7 hour session in com2 once without a single drop then another with 3 drops in 30 minutes.<br />
In 60 hours, probably less i had both my warrior and cleric with emperor key, ssra shard and a green metal drop from mines.<br />
VT shards are another matter, some simply more common than others.<br />
Most time i spent on a single shard was definitely ME with 8 hours or so which prevented me to complete VT for my cleric as well.<br />
Fastest was grey shard where i simply asked a soloing necro if he would tell me when a shard dropped while i was in Ssra camping idol and not even 5 minutes later i had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Emp Key:<br />
<br />
Com 1 - Can be duo'd (my GF and I duo'd with SK and enc for ours) easier with 1 group as you can clear more spawn points.  Spawn rate was about 1 per hour.<br />
<br />
Com 2 - Probably could duo this too.  Did this with 1 group, Spawn rate was approx 1 commander every 30mins.  I think we we're lucky on this one, but everyone had their comm2 bit after about 3hrs.<br />
<br />
Insignia - Usually do these on our way to emp with a raid force, but one groupable, much easier with 2, can get 2-3 named per spawn so 2 every 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Pouch - Usually about 3 pouches when doing cursed cycle.  Most Taskmasters are one groupable, some can be duo'd.  3 every 2hrs and you can farm ore and shards while waiting for respawn.<br />
<br />
Shards:<br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns: Seemed a pretty common drop.  Had guildies farming loot in AC who would advertise shards over /gu for people to run in and loot, drop rate was 1-2 per 30mins.  Wizzy's, Mages and Necros can all solo this easily.  Probably want atleast a healer partner as a warrior tho.<br />
<br />
Akheva: This one sucked for me, could duo it, but was much easier 5ppl to a group.  Drop rate was about 1 per hour but opinion from most ppl I spoke to its usually much more common.<br />
<br />
DSP: Warriors can solo this easy.  Both my GF and I got our shards within 20mins here and I haven't heard any horror stories about bad drop rates so I assume its pretty common.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove: This one seemed rare for me.  Farmed with enc + SK duo, drop rate was about 1 per 2hrs.<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye: This one seems to be accepted as the worst shard to get.  The 2 I farmed took about 1hr each solo'd as an Enchanter, though I have heard of 10 camps not being too uncommon.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert: Can solo as a warrior, got my shard from here at lvl 50 something helping a friend quest the shield of bane warding, saw heaps rot, drop rate was about 1 every 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Seru: Easy to duo.  Spent 4 hours clearing the ring around the top and didnt see any shards.  Got a tip to kill the zone in spawns and have been getting them 1 per 30 mins since then.<br />
<br />
Ssra: About 1 per hour, can be duo'd but would be alot slower.  I found this a hard one to get people down there to farm, but once we got going the drop rate was reasonable.<br />
<br />
The Deep: I've heard this is easier since the revamp, but before it took a group to fight down and over the bridge.  About an hour to clear in and then one per 30 mins after that.<br />
<br />
The Grey: I've heard of warriors soloing this, but reckon it wouldnt be easy.  I solo'd these as a chanter, warrior can duo with a healer easy.  About 1 per 45 mins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering that Drop rate I would say I put about 20hrs into my own VT key, ofcourse what makes it such a time sink is that you have to do it for every member of your guild.  The key to this is your guild's attitude and if you have every member out for themselves its going to be a long road to VT.<br />
<br />
When I did my key we had a regular group of about 8 of us who worked together to complete all of our keys.  This meant that when we started a shard camp, eg Ssra we would stay there until everyone had their shard and if we couldnt finish it that night we'd go back the next day for those who missed out before moving on to the next bit.  There was no selfishness and no only staying until you got your shard then leaving before the rest of the group had thiers, that sort of attitude is what makes VT keys hell.</div></div><hr />
