Since I took about a year and a half off I'm rusty on all the lingo.  So would somebody mind please telling me what these are exactly and how to get them?  Thank you</div></div><hr />

Read the quest info. Everything can be gotten in the bazaar for between 3.5-5.5k. and all peices are usually being sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh, why does everybody assume that everybody else has pp like this to throw around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radalas</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you read through the quest, you will realize the amount of trade skills needed to do the quest yourself, and the only other way is to buy the items at bazaar or have your friends make them for you....<br />
<br />
so considering all this I would say the response Largic gave was pretty solid....  whether one had pp to throw around or not...</div></div><hr />

Because the option is to spend around 500k to master 7 trade skills+fishing. Even at 6k, this earring is solid. You can't buy another earing that compares for anywhere near that price.</div></div><hr />

Good luck.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">essence of sunlights also drops off Sand Giants in Oasis...  I have to say the drops have not been so rare lately either.  The fact the Sand Giants take a while to pop is another issue altogether.</div></div><hr />

Buy anything as an upgrade 60+ and you'll drop at least 5k in it. Warriors get screwed over in the cash department, we (or at least I) work for and save every gp I can scrap. Hell, took my sham 3 weeks of soloing to save for this thing. I wouldn't call that &quot;throwing around&quot;. Keep saving and keep your eye out in the bazz if all your tradeskills aren't MAXED. It's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">5k is easy to raise, and as some others said, the alternative is to GM pretty much every tradeskill or collect the parts and hope you can find a GM tradeskiller willing to combine them for you.  You can raise 5k faster than you can go farm all the stuff to make an earring.  Pretty much anyone can get 5k just by setting up a bazaar vendor and collecting stuff to put on them for a few nights, or even just doing exp in someplace like the mauvin hall in justice that drops a lot of gems/parchments with a friend and splitting the loot and selling it..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate all the advice.  I was really more frustrated than anything when I saw I'd have to pay money for these earrings.  I was kind of hoping I could get them like I did my draconic pauldrons and bracer of benevelonce.  These days I've been questing and camping items alot to save pp.  Doesn't leave much time for leveling or making money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting a BoB or Drac pauldruns is child's play compared to making all the pieces for the Earring of the Solstice solo. You can do the Velious quests you mentioned in mere hours if the NPC's/mobs are not up, minutes if they are.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you'd have to spend hundreds of thousands of plat (and a bunch of AA's) to grandmaster in the various trades (and let's face it, learning trades is all about removing plat from the economy, so they cost...a lot) and spend countless hours farming and foraging for items in order to make the required ingredients for the quest.<br />
<br />
5Kpp to buy the parts in the bazaar is downright cheap by comparison.<br />
<br />
Here's a thought: It's totally trivial, and I'm sure you'd be encroaching on some mid-level's hunting ground, but hill and ice giants still drop a pretty penny, and you'd be able to come up with that kind of money from a couple of days' worth of killing them.</div></div><hr />

Mosquito leg earring comes to mind, although it can take some time to camp them...  CT sewer camp...</div></div><hr />
