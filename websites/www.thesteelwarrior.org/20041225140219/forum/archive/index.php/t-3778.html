<br />
I have always found it annoying there is no success message. Why is taunting a big secret from those around you.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to know when people are taunting, and to know when you or them are successful.<br />
<br />
At this point, whats the impediment to getting a message added? <br />
<br />
I mean they made dots give messages, non-melee attacks give messages to everyone, why not something as important as taunt?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, having some message that pointed when people were clicking it and that it wasn't really doing anything might just point out the deficiency too well?<br />

If you can't hold aggro with a successful taunt then most likely you won't be able hold aggro at all so it's not important for others to know it was a successful taunt anyway.  <br />
<br />
If you think taunt doesn't work then you're never going to have aggro anyway so you might as well give up and not taunt.  It is by far one of the more reliable tools warriors have at their disposal (especially in LDoN) that does not require amazing gear.  From empirical observations (i.e. eyeballing), it feels like Taunt work somewhere between 50% to about 60% of the time and AE taunt and gear are for the other situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like once again I'm going to have to champion the midgame. Not everyone is elemental/time, not everyone has 10k hp (buffed or unbuffed, take your pick), not everyone has hundreds of AAs and can hit AE Taunt when they feel like it, not everyone has EB+ weapons, hell, not everyone has the aggro weapons from Droga. There's a lot of warriors that don't have them because of overcamping, time constraints, whatever. That isn't the point.<br />
<br />
If you think that 50% success rate (an arbitrary number that I'm going with for the sake of argument.) is sufficient while a creature is mushing your casters, I fear for your casters. Disarm is more reliable than Taunt. At least the pathetic amount of hate it generates is more than the nothing you get from continued Taunt failure. Remember that the 50% success rate applies to every single time you hit the button, not necessarily an average. You've got a 50/50 shot of getting a creature's attention every time.<br />

AE taunt is a necessity at level 65.  If you're not at level 65, I do not think the mobs you're fighting is sufficiently difficult, especially given the ease of getting buff/gear today, for taunt to really matter.  I guess if you want to be doing PoP at level 62 or whatever then you might not have AE Taunt, but if you're not at 65 people won't really trust you to do your job anyway so it's not that important either.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone has the option of getting the phat lewts.<br />
If you're not at level 65, I do not think the mobs you're fighting is sufficiently difficult, especially given the ease of getting buff/gear today, for taunt to really matter.You mean sufficiently difficult by comparison to what YOU are fighting. Tell a 52 warrior that just got his ass handed to him by a Froglok Wizard in OS that what he's fighting is a candy-ass and I'm sure he's going to take a little offense.<br />
but if you're not at 65 people won't really trust you to do your job anyway so it's not that important either.One, people don't trust warriors to do their job now, regardless of level. Two, I'm not 65 and taunt is still pretty goddamn important. Three, not everyone is doing PoP and grouping with level 65 players (Who, of course, will not trust anyone lower than them to do their job and wouldn't group with them in the first place. Thus the argument is moot.)<br />
<br />
All I can say is, Phantron, either you had it easy growing up or you've completely lost perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1- I thought the big Taunt Test thread that's stickied showed that 1 out of every 4 taunts was successful. Like clockwork, too, as in ... every fourth taunt was a success. Not a great success rate there.<br />
<br />
2- <br />
<br />
&quot;If you're not at level 65, I do not think the mobs you're fighting is sufficiently difficult,&quot;<br />
<br />
That's bologna.<br />
<br />
If you're level 50, fighting in, oh, say, Sebilis. Odds are you're fighting mobs that are &quot;sufficiently difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope that was just a poor choice of words on your part. Otherwise, it's either elitist, or just plain wrong.<br />

A level 30 fighting in Crystal Caverns is fighting challenging monsters.</div></div><hr />

I remember stuff that hit for 150 when I go from 1-60 was considered pretty tough, which is 1/4th the damage of a PoV golem.  I have 10.5K raid buffed right now.

SUFFICIENTLY DIFFICULT.<br />
<br />
Very bad choice of words, no matter what your hps are now, what they were when you were level 50, or what some level 55 warrior running around in cobalt and fierce heraldic has when he goes LFG in Plane of Nightmare or at one of the adventure camps.<br />
<br />
It's just a bad choice of words.<br />
<br />
Mobs are sufficiently difficult. <br />
<br />
At level 50 you fought where? Sol B? Karnor's Castle?<br />
<br />
Today's level 50s, with their better gear and better buffs are fighting in Plane of Justice or in LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
The mobs are sufficiently difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalantia</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some mobs that give a message when taunted - they tend to be humanoids, and mostly in old world zones..  I believe it's something along the lines of &quot;I'll teach you to interfere with me&quot;.<br />

It's annoyingly uncommon, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wubao, the taunt test showed that 4 'successful' taunts on a speaking mob overcame an initial 'pull' aggro made by a cleric stunning, when neither the cleric or warrior tried to affect the mob in any other way.<br />
<br />
It showed that there is some small extra aggro attribution to the first character that affects a mob, that is firstly not taken into account when placing you towards the top of the aggro list, and secondly larger than the total of the aggro +1 of a successful taunt until 4 such taunts were successfully applied. During the course of the logs taunt 'failed' on a consistant basis (gave no aggro message) and appeared to have no effect whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Bearing in mind this was a low level shroom in FG against a 65 warrior then if level affects taunt success then the success rate was 'pretty damn low' for an outclassed creature. Runs of up to 4-6 taunts without a success if i recall.<br />
<br />

3 or 4 till it worked must be less than 50% success ?<br />

4 seemed the most common.</div></div><hr />

Taunt even when succesful will not always move you to the top of the hate list.Thsi has been proven, read around.<br />

Stuff I fought while going from 1-60 do not do damage, even relative to HPs people had at time, anywhere close to even the easiest of PoP zones.

<br />
<br />
You ,like so many other classes towards this class are making the mistake of basing balance on Gear and other outside means.<br />
<br />
<br />
Skills in EQ should be based of what a character would recieve simply by leveling up and getting what he gets that way,not 100hp droppable items from the bazaar and not lvl 65 Celric buffs or whatever else.<br />
<br />
Saying that mobs don't hit hard anymore because you can get 2k in buffs from some caster 20 levels above you is a ridiculous statement.You do realize that people still level in EQ without running to pok every hour for new buffs right?<br />
<br />
This in no way has any relevance to Taunt anyhow.</div></div><hr />

OS and IS can be pulled by a Warrior all day long with only adds being pops during a pull(long as you know what your doing)<br />
Also,if somerone else is pulling,standing to the side of the path the incoming mob is headed to your camp,and having autoattack already on, will a lot of times grab the monsters attention and keep it. First Hit = Better Aggro</div></div><hr />

Not everyone can or chooses to get those 65 buffs. Believe it or not, you sanctimonious... (...nm...calming down...) Some people actually group up and get buffs from their group mates! *gasp* *swoon*<br />

If a level 15 group of new players ran into something that hit with the speed and a damage appropriate to their level of a PoP mob, how long do you think they'd last against it? <br />
<br />
Some people have probably been playing this game so long they forget there was a point when they were newbs and were still learning to play...you build skill at the game as you go along, the mobs are still difficult at that level, at least for a lot of folks without twink gear, because they're learning the various tricks of their class as they go along, learning their role in a group, or just learning how to play the game, period. If the mobs were that easy, people wouldn't die nearly as much, if at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot believe what I'm seeing here.    <br />
<br />
ALL that is being asked for is a message indicating success or failure of a skill.    There is *no* other skill in EQ that doesn't give a success or failure message, not a single one.   If you can know with intimate detail from 300 feet away how much damage your dot did on a given tick, then it's only logical to know whether your taunt was successful or not.<br />
<br />
The &quot;mystery of the game&quot; argument is amusing to me because taunt is the ONLY &quot;mystery&quot; in EQ, and there's no justifiation for it.   It's MUCH more justified to not have a sneak/hide message indicating success than to not have a taunt fail/success message.<br />
<br />
You are in the face of your opponent, you are looking into his or her eyes, you should be able to tell if he or she reacted to your derision/actions/goose/slap/etc.   I know that if I get into someone's face in RL I can tell a LOT easier whether I pissed them off with a witty comment than if I were to try to sneak up on them being able to tell if they could see me or not.<br />
<br />
Finally, the meat of it.   I suspect that, just like Brutul's post showed, taunt works funny... and our propensity to analyze these things would show taunt failure rates as well as show that taunt doesn't necessarily work the way we want to think it does.   This is very likely the reason we don't see a taunt success/fail message.</div></div><hr />

(a) Get info to the devs to help fix our problem<br />
(b) Piss off the devs (remember soulbinder attacking anyone?)<br />
(c) nothing at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guess would be that it isn't in there because it  does  have a high sucess rate, yet it does so little that the +1 hate isn't enough to get over the current guy on agro.<br />
<br />
That the only reason that I can think of as to why we don't have it. If they do happen to put this in, put the friggan thing in a /say sort of thing so other people can tell when we are taunting.<br />
I guess if they did that though, then group members would be &quot;taunt faster!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right on the money Frodlin.<br />
<br />
For one thing, in a roleplaying aspect it makes way more sense to know whether or not you've succeeded at a skill like Taunt than some other certain skills. Frodlin has a good example with Taunt vs. Sneak. <br />
<br />
But in-game, what makes Taunt so different from say...Begging? Like Taunt, a failed Beg may or may not have a noticeable effect outside of the &quot;Your attempt at begging has failed&quot; message. Sometimes you'll be attacked on top of receiving the &quot;failed&quot; message. Begging (as useless as it may be) definitely lets you know whether or not the skill roll was a success, so why on Norrath would Taunt (as useless as it may be) NOT give the taunter a definitive pass|fail response?<br />
<br />
I envision something like the monk's Feign Death failure message. Normally Feign Death is pretty transparent, but when it fails, there's an actual message that lets everyone know that their monk is probably getting beat on. Why not a public, maybe /say-radius message for a Taunt failure? Maybe one of these:<br />
<br />
<br />
 a_warrior01 attempts to taunt an_angry_mob01, but can't think of anything good to say.<br />
 a_warrior01 taunts an_angry_mob01. an_angry_mob01 says, &quot;I'm busy right now.&quot;<br />
 a_warrior01's enchanter has fallen to the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
A simple failure message could be a step in the right direction...<br />
<br />
Then, when enough people complain about being spammed by &quot;a_warrior01 taunts to no avail&quot; maybe they'll actually work on the skill itself. :eek: But I might just be getting ahead of myself here.</div></div><hr />

When you stun with bash/kick there should be a message to.  After all you see a message when they do it to you....<br />
<br />
Agree though a message (if only to self like Flurry) would be nice.<br />

Just let Taunt work all the time and pallys can keep their stuns.I dont see anything unbalancing about an ability working at least 3/4 of the time,and thats a lot less chance to work than fizzle chances at 65 on spells.Make what I have work in a useful way before giving me new broke toys.<br />
Later that same night during another overpull(not going into the reason for that)I actually watched AE taunt fail.I stood next to two monsters,one who i was hitting.The AE Taunt pulled his attention off puller, but the mob who aggrod cleric did not turn and i was standing next to him.I [thought]AE Taunt is supposed to be no fail.Apparently not.<br />
Not only are we being left in the dust,we are becoming more and more handicapped.I dont ask much, but to do my job.But give me the tools for crying out loud, and ones that arent broke please<br />
(Btw anyone who wants to insert some response that &quot;G0d you must be suxx0rs t4nk n00b,I g0ts n0 aggr0 pr0bs!11!!!  etc, More than welcome to give me a tell and Ive got plenty of people you can talk to regarding my tanking ability[even with broke @$$ warrior skills])</div></div><hr />

If that had been a PoP mob and the cleric was a skirt, they would have been dead before the 4th taunt, possibly the 3rd depending on gear and AA.<br />
<br />
Casters get that nifty AA set that lowers their fizzle rate to zero on spells of certain levels, and though I thoroughly detest the use of AA to fix balance issues (It never seems to help the people that need it most: the ever-forgotten casual gamer. The one that isn't 65 and can't just grind out another dozen AA points.), there is adequate reason for giving us an AA that raises the success rate of Taunt.<br />
<br />
But, of course, they'd give it to everyone that had a Taunt key and maybe even the casters as well. Nothing says balance like giving skirts all of the melee archetype AAs...</div></div><hr />

Level 2 of AFT, all taunts done to mobs under the level of 40 are successful.  Level 3 of AFT, all taunts done to mobs under the level of 52 are successful.  I bet you'll sign up for that skill.;)  <br />

Honestly, the lack of a taunt message is part of the remnants of the original game.  Most of the thigns you have sited as having fail messages, ie-stuns, were added long after release.  If you'd like to see another example of a part of the game that is not represented accurately, look at mana.  Adding a message to taunt will probably be put in as a random bonus to some patch just to make melee happy, much like many of hte other things were.  The walls that were keeping things like that out of the game have slowly eroded over time.<br />
<br />
As for casters getting Melee skills, they probably made out in the deal, but, you did pickup one or two that are very casterish.  They just slapped a new name on them for you.</div></div><hr />

Edit:  In case you were wondering, I didn't mean to imply that you got some amazing casterish skills.  Simply that it is wierd for someone to say something like : &quot;Yeah, maybe they will give more of our melee skills to casters&quot;.  Like it was super painful to share the ones that were given to them or like you had never had an example of getting one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I should be happy that all of the melee archetype skills got farmed out to everyone else and they threw me a gimmick-bone? Yay! Should I ever get to 65 I'll be sure to grind out those proc AAs right along side that level 65 ranger that's nailing melee, spell and proc criticals higher than my own!<br />
<br />
For your information, it was painful to see those skills get handed out to casters. That was just another piece of the melee pie that casters enjoyed while melee still got nothing.</div></div><hr />
