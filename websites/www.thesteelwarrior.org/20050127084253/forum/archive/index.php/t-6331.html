It has been a rule of thumb for like ever that you put the faster weapon into the primary slot. Is there any situations there you would ignore this rule.<br />
<br />
I have Bloodfrenzy and Great blade of storms and thought it may be more effective to have the BF in the primary slot I also have an obsidian scimitar of war but think the gbos is better agro<br />
<br />
any thoughts appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say definately BF main.  3 eb and 1 stun per min &gt; 1.5 eb and 2 stun.  And I would agree to use GBoS over OSoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The faster weapon in primary thing is kinda out-dated, unless you're playing a twink. Nowadays, when aggro-proc weapons are so common, we don't rely on our dps as much to keep aggro. So rather than blindly throwing the faster weap in primary, go with the one that has the better aggro proc. There might be a few exceptions to this, but in general, it's a safe bet.<br />
<br />
BF main, GBoS secondary. The only reason I would MH the gbos would be if you have it anger/ykesha aug'ed, and havent gotten an aug for the BF yet. In this case, the GBoS will probably be better aggro until you aug the BF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For aggro purposes, the only weapon that should replace Bloodfrenzy for mainhand would be a Darkblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, everyone above is right.  I stopped caring about the &quot;faster weapon primary&quot; thing long long long ago... it has just worked out that way for me so far.  The difference between primary and offhand is negligeable anymore with ambidexterity and such... and with Sinister Strikes the gap has shortened still more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The faster weapon in primary thing is for when you have one weapon way slower than the other, like 21/29 compared to 12/19. When the weapons are within a few delay of each other, it's kinda meaning less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even without Aug ment on teh BF i'd still put it in mainhand as it will come close to the proc rate of the aug'd gbos if you do have it.  Only reason i'd put that in offhand would be for an EoE or Darkblade :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With increased proc rate, BF does 2170 hate per minute.  GBoS aug'ed with Anger III does 1200+958 or 2158 (assuming stun is 300 hate).  Roughly the same hate.  However, the GBoS does it in four procs (average) per minute, while the BF does it in three.  And the GBoS has a slightly better ratio than the BF.  Thus the GBoS will have slightly more reliable early aggro, and probably roughly equal long-term aggro, making an aug'ed GBoS probably slightly better to mainhand than a BF.<br />
<br />
If stun is only 200 hate, the aug'ed GBoS does 1958 hate per minute, which is probably somewhat less hate overall (including its fractionally better ratio) than the BF gives.  I'd still prefer to mainhand it, though, as the four ppm makes an early proc more likely than the BF's three ppm.<br />

Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GBoS proc is better aggro than anger2 by a good bit ...  force shock is running at about 500ish aggro per proc, maybe a bit more.<br />
<br />
GBoS = 2200 raw hate per min<br />
BF = 2100 hate per min<br />
<br />
dps is close ... so until you get another anger3 proc or a yak proc to slap on the BF, i would just go with whichever weapon you like better in the mainhand.  if i had a bloodfrenzy i would mainhand the ho in a heartbeat.  i absolutely love the graphic :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This debate about GBoS w/ anger 3 vs BF is not really relevent to this case.  Both weapons are not aug'd for him.  However, I would agree the aug'd GBoS would win against an unaug'd BF.  A BF aug'd would be one hell of a weapon I'd imagine heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before my guildy got a Blade of War, he used a BF+AngerIII (Mainhand) and GBoS+AngerII combo.  He would proc within at least five seconds of attacking a mob every time, and this was before Weapon Affinity.  For clearing, he was second to none as far as holding agro is concerned.  So yeah, it's a really nice combo.  &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
