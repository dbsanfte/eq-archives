How crucial is it? Will I be fine just getting a Fennin Ro bracer to pull with and ditching archery altogether?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groticus</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the exception of a few very rare exceptions like that one pain in the rear mob in CoM you just need something to pull with and something to get onto the rampage list.  Bows are the most common but I see no reason why you would have to use one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats true til you hit certain Tier 3 (PoP) encounters where all you do is shooting arrows.<br />
Tallon Zek is a prime example for this, only MA engages, all other melees merrily shoot arrows and try to avoid agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvil</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, there a few bows out there now that offer some descent stats that make a good range item, add that with the ability to pull with it, and the combo is very good.  The nightmarewood compound bow offers 50hps I believe in the range slot, and a descent bow to pull, fight with at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bows are simply great. I love mine and would never give it up. Nightmare bow doesn't have 50 hp (only 25), but there is a tradeable bow that does. Its name elludes me at the moment though. I used a Twisted Longbow till I got my primal bow. Now I'm using the bow off Agnarr, which simply rocks.</div></div><hr />

I still use when the mob is above or below me by a large amount or when I run out of arrows.  Now I use the Bow of DOOM, nice stats good damage / delay.<br />

<br />
Have someone port you to Emerald Jungle and go to Traknons Teeth and loot a NODROP bow that drops off the frogs that need to be taken down for the OS key.  Most people who are ready for OS let them rot but to most young warriors they are a fine upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the exception of a few high end encounters where the strategy involves melee staying out of melee range the only thing you really need a bow for is pulling so if you've got a different way of doing this you should be set.<br />
<br />
For a long time I was too lazy to buy arrows and pulled everything by proximity agro which worked fine so a bow for pulling is certainly not a requirement, but since I pulled my finger out and took up fletching to make 150 range arrows I am loving that I can pull from huge distances with a bow range of 330 (180 bow and 150 arrows).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roehm</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bow is an invaluable tool that  many warriors overlook. The reason being, we are not rangers.<br />
<br />
Get a bow, skill makes no diff for pulling. Learn fletching to make long range arrows, it's not too spendy to get that high. And use it along with prox aggro and other tools to pull in all situations.<br />
<br />
Later on there are bows that are full time range slot items. The player crafter PoP bows being the prime example.</div></div><hr />
