We tried him again last night for our 3rd time we cleared up to him with like 30ish minutes to spare best we ever did by far.  But as usual when we engage him we get owned like a bunch of noobs.  Question I wanted to ask is what is best way to deal with Bert?  <br />
<br />
Our MA has around 9k holds agro pretty good except last night before we even called Agro we had 3 clerics die which pretty much screwed us.  Just want some tips from guys that have done him maybe something we are doing wrong.  Last night we brought him in one of the hallways which I think was a mistake.  Anyway hopefully someone can give me some tips so I can tell my guild next time we try him :).  Only flag holding must of us from Sol Ro Access :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wudgurorm</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you have to keep Rampage off the Clerics.<br />
<br />
If you don't you will die everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm not sure exactly who was on rampage I figured the best way to get someone on Rampage was maybe have a Pally DA pull Bert to us.  I really hate this fucker though.  Rampage probably is what ate all of our healers because we had clerics and druids dying left and right.  Best we ever him got down to was like 65%.  That was with a Weaponshield Ranger tanking him after our MA died :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bert has laughable hitpoints. Its his rampage and other nasty tricks that make him dangerous. Set up in one of the back tunnels where it ends in a fork. Have your monks pull Bert into the tunnel and sacrifise a ranger with weaponshield to pull him back into the cubby. Have your ramp tank pop him as the ranger pulls him back to you. Pop disc, ae taunt, count to five, and have the raid push him into the corner to get pummeled. With luck your clerics have half a brain and your druids/beasties have mgb to pop off ae heals. You'll have your flags about five minutes after you engage him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild killed him last week. 2nd attempt.<br />
<br />
All the above are good suggestions. I would recommend WS ranger tank while debuffing Bert (resist, dex and atk debuff).<br />
<br />
The WS ranger will more than likely die from Rampage.. but thats ok.<br />
<br />
To give you a better idea of how to get aggro, here is Bert aggro list should be:<br />
<br />
<br />
Order of ENTERING Bert's Aggro list<br />
1. WS ranger<br />
2. RT/MT (doesnt matter)<br />
3. RT/MT <br />
4. all the other tank classes (in case the RT dies)<br />
5. debuffers <br />
6. Healers<br />
7. everyone else.<br />
<br />
If you can set this and keep the MT and RT alive, you win.<br />
<br />
a piece of advice for the RT, its better to have a defensive warrior to take Ramp. Bert hits max 1957 and 1300ish after dish. Use Disc before you engage as you wont have time to react and press disc when you realize you are on ramp.<br />
<br />
Also, CC team be rdy for repop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use ramp tank to pull him to front left corner of his room, mez the adds, rampage tank has rampage from arrow, tank takes over... healing for both.<br />
<br />
We've failed once, succeeded 3 or 4 times now.  Once you get it down it is quite easy.  He hits fairly hard, and if tank goes down the SA better be ready to take over, lest too much dps get mulched and you get slaughtered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do it a bit different.  With our strat, we have everyone except the MA, RT and Suicide Shammy go into the tunnel and set up healers in that cubby back to the left (nearest to Bert room).  The Ramp tank (we use a warrior) pulls and the MA AE taunts so ramp is set.  The shammy is immediately slowing on the pull.<br />
Because Bert's hitbox is so freeking huge, you can NOT pull him to the corner, MA/RT have to go out to meet him.  As soon as the MA calls attack, ALL the melees run out and PUSH Bert into the corner closest to where the healers are behind the wall (to avoid the AE).  Once Bert is in the corner, its like doing AoW.  As long as melees stay at max melee (which is half way across the room) and healers keep the tank up, Bert is cake at this point.<br />
<br />
btw: since Bert is such a pita, to ensure sucess we use a cleric rot and chanter rune rot on MA and well as a druid rot on ramp tank.  May or may not be overkill but we're three for three on Bert using these tactics.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throag</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have your warrior rampage tank pull him in the corner, but make sure the MT is well ahead of the rest of the raid, or given the huge melee range of bert, he will hit someone else before the MT. Doing like this, you won't aggro the add of the room and you'll have rampage well set.<br />
<br />
As for WSing debuffing, I don't think that's really necessary, when my guild first did Bert, I had far less than your MT'hp and I could get the impact just fine.</div></div><hr />
