I've seen posts ranging from 5 to 14% - that's a huge difference and I'm hoping someone can be a little more precise.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people posting numbers in the upper range of what you posted are either:<br />
1: misinformed<br />
2: confusing mitigation advantage with tanking advantage<br />
3: lobbying for knight pity and obscuring facts<br />
4: quoting parses that aren't performed on correct material<br />
5: eyeballing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that's 5% vs. an unstunable mob. A Paladin can make that 5% up rather quickly.<br />
<br />
It also doesn't take into account things like soloing where a Paladin's HP, plus HP's hidden in their manabar, plus LoH, show that without a doubt one-one-one Paladins are worlds better at handling damage than Warriors.<br />

<br />
The only other warrior mitigation/avoidance comes from skill caps.  I have seen links showing these to be around 1 to 3 percent more avoidance from the front only.<br />
<br />
If you add the two you get between 2 and 7 percent less dps.<br />
<br />
To get the higher values (12 to 14 percent) you must equate slightly higher hp (1k at most) into some form of mitigation/avoidance &quot;percent&quot;.<br />
<br />
A paladin stunning a mob will be between 30 to 60 percent avoidance average.  This only helps against one mob, and can not help when there are two beating on the paladin.<br />
<br />
There are no other advantages to being a warrior unless you activate a discipline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IgneousKB</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the mitigation advantage stays at 5 to 6%, the dps intake advantage from the front lands somewhere around 8 to 9%, as lokkak states.<br />
This is (obviously) on stun-immune content.<br />
<br />
On anything stunnable paladin dps intake advantage goes from a slight advantage (only divine stun landing) to grossly obscene (Quellious+Divine+Akera(sp)).<br />
<br />
What would be greatly appreciated, would be a paladin willing to mete out the approximate figures for practical stun avoidance. There's 2 real easy and relevant scenes for doing this.<br />
1: We're well acquainted with HoH and it represents the easier segment of mobs. It's totally stunnable.<br />
2: Next stop PoFire castle 2. Only Divine Stun will help.<br />
Take 60minutes in each place, measure distribution and intake.<br />
<br />
And as many people point out, shadowknights really could use a bone, compared to paladins.</div></div><hr />

A warrior in full raex will tank more than 5% better than a paladin in full Trydan's, because of the higher AC that raex has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something else that is important is the gearing, in time gear is mostly or all the same so you dont get any mitigation difference there but before there warriors have an ac advantage be it slight as it is will provide some mitgation. Of course that is dependant on how they are geared, a paladin with a shield could have as much AC as a warrior in some circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IgneousKB</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Attainable ac for knights and warriors in PoTime and beyond are pretty much identical.<br />
<br />
Only in selected segments pre-time is there a difference, and it's not a big one.<br />
The difference it would make is less than the difference in avoidance due to higher skill caps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I think we could settle a lot of arguments if all 3 communities could come up with a figure they agreed on as the differance. <br />
<br />
That said, incoming DPS is not the best mesagure as then you have to figure in slows. It would probably be much easier to look at 2 different numbers from parces--hit% and average damage/hit and that will give you a better feeling for the differances between the 3 classes and where the reletive strenghts are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on ldon mobs at di 1 it's 1 damage per hit, think it was 15 at di 20, i can't remember my math it's in here somewhere.<br />
say each take 200 hits at di 1 thats only 200 damage in difference. basicly a regen buff made up the tanking difference.<br />
<br />
the big difference comes in the spread of hits. and skills that are hard quantify without long constatnt parases.<br />
<br />
never heard a knight gripe about that part though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 900 seconds on each, over 10 fights, its hard to get parses of those mobs as you know... the difference is just plain visible though so its pretty major in that type of situation.  You can see it in other places to, anywhere with a DI 40+ mob you would be very visible I think as long as the atk levels on mobs are decent.  You can't really deny the fact that dps intake is overall a minor thing and that Warriors handle spikes far far far better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mitigation avantage is about 5-6% due to the DI difference, with an additional oh, about 3-4% difference due to the AC advantage warriors have over knights for most of the game.<br />
<br />
Of note, however, that AC advantage shrinks alarmingly in PoTime. It doesn't disappear, but it's reduced. So the mitigation is less in Time and beyond.<br />
<br />
That's not the whole &quot;warrior advantage&quot;, though- The real difference is the mitigation advantage, avoidance advantage, and HP advantage, which complement each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how the holy fucking hell do you get 5-6% mitigation due to a -1di that is at MOST 1/20th... aka 5%...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, Pumilio.<br />
<br />
There's what, 4-5 people all saying 5-6% from the -1 DI, and you ignore them, but jump ALL over me.<br />
<br />
It just keeps getting more and more obvious that you're attacking anything that I present not necessarily beacause you don't agree with the argument... you attack it because you don't like the person stating it.<br />
<br />
Ask the 4-5 other people, don't bother asking me. My attempting to explain ANYTHING to you is a waste of time, because you'll just keep attacking - whether the argument has merit or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
two said mitigation at 5-6% without them saying &quot;it's from di and then this other % is from ac&quot; you can't say mitigation didn't mean di and better something...<br />
<br />
you however said di takes 5-6% mitigation in addition to wahtever % from ac...<br />

a bold lie that math can't support or logic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until there are some really good tanking parse's of same mob, of a war and a knight with the same AC, seeing if the DI spread is any different, most people will continue to believe what they believe, and really dont have much proof, besides personal experience to back it up, which of course, arnt something that other people will trust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So lets decide on a level of ac and mob to use and parse it. warrior mob in first castle fire at 2k ac, unmezzable kyv in qvic at 2500 ac, pick come up with something we can agree on, parse it for 20k swings and look at the hit distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until there are some really good tanking parse's of same mob, of a war and a knight with the same AC,<br />
there is a post from one month or two here of such parse. it was they both had more than 2000 AC (and only like 50AC diff prior to the pal) with same shielding and avoidance against the same mob (in POF if my memory is not that gooffy) no special class trick were use (no disc, no stun). after some hour of tanking (for both of them) it result that the War took less DPS than the Pal (but the distribution wasn't show I think). If we give 100%  effectiveness in tanking for the war (cause he was the best) then the parse showed a Pal at like 94.5%  of effectivness.<br />
thus the gap was pretty small, and comes from the inate DI reduction of the War only.<br />
The conclusion is therefor that a pal who can't stun tank barely equally to a non disc war, with same equipement (ie same global stat, not same source of gears).<br />
<br />
a more recent post gives the stun mitigation power of a tank in GoD sewers on trash mob. It shows a nice 60 to 70 %  DPS reduction (yes DPS not DI) giving him an insane tanking power to theese specific MOBs (that become numberer as the Pal gets better spells).<br />
<br />
While a def disc war has a much lower DPS reduction fom mobs (or a boss I should have said, as a war can't chain tank mob with it due to its recycle time) ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong again, in your obsession with attacking everything I said. They were almost ALL talking about or replying to posts stating the mitigation from DI.<br />
<br />
Pure mitigation difference is landing pretty dead on 5 to 6%, confirming that the '1 DI' advantage is what we have, and it is as it should be.<br />
<br />
[replying to the above quote]<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that's 5% vs. an unstunable mob. A Paladin can make that 5% up rather quickly.<br />
<br />
The innate 5 percent will be from 1 to 4 percent less dps depending on mob DI to DB ratio.<br />
<br />
Also note that the innate 5% is at equal stats, not equally-tiered gear.<br />

Different thread, same old Pumilio trolling me and attacking everything I say.<br />

Piss off. I'm REALLY getting sick of your constant trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm kind of amused by a lot of this. SoE has determined the inate tanking differences, the &quot;-1 DI&quot; advantage, itemization, existance of Defensive, etc.<br />
<br />
It was reviewed extensively when the Phase 1 Melee Update was made and they gave Warriorrs &quot;-1 DI&quot; as a result of that review. The Warrior tanking advantage is supposed to be exactly the Warrior tanking advantage we've got.<br />
<br />
I think it's one thing to parse to see if the AC softcap really exists and where it occurs so that players can make intellegent equipment choices, BUT<br />
<br />
it's another to parse mob after mob trying to build a case that the difference between Warriors and not-Warriors is too big/too small. It's small enough that with a little extra attention Knights can MT all of PoTime/it's big enough that with a single healer in a group Warriors rightfully survive getting mauled by hardhitting mobs better.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Let's focus on the Warrior/SK FD gap. Lessee, when Warriors FD it's so convincing that they can make a naked beer run in Freeport and everyone in their previous zone is fooled! OMG Warriors FD better!!!<br />
<br />
It would be nice if some players could play their own class and not be all tied up in knots because &quot;Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.&quot; or Warriors have a small innate survivability advantage against melee damage. Where is it written that Medium Tanks/part casters should tank like the Heavy Tank?<br />

What can't you tank that you contend you ought to be able to tank?<br />
<br />
More AC, more HP's, more Avoidance, more Shielding, etc. benefits all classes. If anybody wants fewer spikes/less spike damage, they need to gear-up.<br />
<br />
If the observation is that because of Defensive/Stonewall/Evasive Warriors take less spike damage - well duh! That's how Warriors are designed. We've had Defensive for four years.<br />
<br />
Spike damage isn't the end all or be all. We all die because our HP's reach 0. Some of the named mobs in Q'Vic put out a lot of damage with 760DD AE Effects in fights that last 10 minutes. Spikes don't kill me in such fights, healers going oom kills me.<br />

<br />
Since Paladins get massive, so much more than defensive, damage reduction on stunable mobs (70 percent less dps taken), why don't more shadow knights support the warrior side?<br />
<br />
I mean, if I were a sk, I woudn't be supporting anything paladins asked to get, since I didn't have their stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I HIGHLY doubt the DPS is reduced that much in any but the best possible situations. I think 70% is only in the most extreme cases, if it's true at all.<br />
<br />
The mana usage is just too extreme, and they'd have to be devoted to ONLY stunning.<br />
<br />
At the moment, they'd have to be using on the order of 115 mana per ticks, pre focus, to maintain that level of stunning. Even if you were only fighting HALF the time, you still need 50 mana per tick regen to keep that up.<br />
<br />
On top of that, you've gotta account for resists, account for fizzes, both of which drop the amount of time stunned...<br />
<br />
On top of THAT, you've got all these paladins pissing and moaning that they can't channel through getting hit in melee, so if you believe them, they can't get the stuns off to begin with.<br />
<br />
On top of THAT, Paladins generally heal themselves and their group as well, which takes even more mana away from what they need to cast enough stuns to keep up that much mitigation through stuns.<br />
<br />
And on top of all the above, that stun ability is ONLY on mobs that are level 65 and below, of which quite a few places have few to none of in the zones.<br />
<br />
No, I think the reality of stun mitigation capabilities is that it is far, FAR less than what's claimed by that post on a day to day basis. Not saying that it doesn't affect balance, it certainly does, but it's just as intellectually dishonest to parse ONLY a warrior under defensive vs a knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the truth is that we're talking about 3 different classes. The only pupose in comparing them is to see if Knights are infringing on Warrior territory. Otherwise the comparisons should be class vs. mob given roles.<br />
<br />
Don't discount Paladins or stunning. A Paladin stunning and a Monk stunning with a SoT is a pretty strong foundation for an experiance group. Add in group heal after a Cleric DArbs and you potentially have a very strong fast heal capability. Add in Hopebringer and a Cleric proc'ing heals as well and there be a lot of healing going on.<br />
<br />
Yes, SK's have been shortchanged.<br />
<br />
But focusing on one aspect of what the three plate tanks can do, the one where Warirors MUST excell since they doin't do anything else, is a pretty transparent ploy.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
When not using a discipline (which is most of the time in groups or addtanking), Warriors and Knights are virtually indistinguishable.<br />

That's my point. To get that, you've got a pally, druid, chanter, beastlord in the group, add a bard, and that's 5. only room for one more of any class. <br />
<br />
Groups that have all, or nearly all, of the classes that are cpable of increasing mana regen are the exception and not the rule. Most groups have SOME, yes, but only a very few have all. As well, hybrids with max FT are the exception and not the rule in anything up to Time+ level players.<br />

This goes to my situational comment earlier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can do that sometimes, but not all the time. Hybrids will also get some buffs, but I highly doubt they'll run over the place to find every mana buff they can before the group. Additionally, not all the buffs will last the duration of a group, and if the hybrid dies, they're all gone.<br />
<br />
I can see a pally getting c3, sure. But ALL pallies getting ALL buffs they can, have them last as long as they're in that group, ON TOP of all the other things I've detailed in previous posts? No way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, but then you get into lack of room in a group.<br />
<br />
Many groups have a chanter, they won't grab a bard. Same as if they already have a bard, they don't NEED a chanter... because after all, bard and enchanter roles overlap to some extent or another. And that's also assuming you have the FT15, which most paladins won't until they get to Time, or at the very least Elementals.<br />
<br />
And remember, this is ON TOP of all the other conditions and considerations stated earlier.<br />

Stuns have an effect, I'm not arguing that it doesn't. I just don't think it's nearly as big as the 70% that was stated in this thread.</div></div><hr />

Brael  - when you talk about a warriors ability to handle spike damage are you referring to the use of discs or are you only considering the tanking advantage achieved via the -1 DI, increased skill caps, and increased hp?  (or something else entirely?)<br />

You're taking about expending nearly 175 mana PER TICK. You're talking about zero resists and fizzles. <br />

Warriors don't always (in fact I never) have all the buffs they need either outside of raids. Now that Paladins and SK's get their class buffs without being overwritten with other buffs (I think, the posts on this keep flip-flopping) they are pretty much guaranteed to close the AC/HP gap as a result of buffs.<br />

I tell ya one thing that's really nice about a pally...<br />
<br />
A pally can notice his health get really low, get worried, and start stunning the everloving crap out of the mob to get him through the low health time, so that the healer has time to heal, and the pally can survive. Course, to be fair, until OoWar comes out, that only appliesto mobs that are level 65 and under.<br />
<br />
A warrior can notice his health get really low, get worried, and.... pray. Most he can do is back away from the mob in hopes of getting out of melee range and causing a few hits to not land (and hope for a non summon), OR pop his FORTY MINUTE refresh riposte disc in hopes that a: he actually needed it this time and didn't just waste it, and B: that he won't need it in the next 40 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brael is not wholey incorrect.<br />
<br />
He tends to minimize the fact that AC limits spike damage - Knights DO have a way to combat this: their self buffs, buffs they ask for, equipment, using a shield (supposedly), and augment selection.<br />
<br />
He's correct that Knights need some active way of controlling/limiting the damage they take. But Paladins having two or three stuns they can chain or Knights having a substantial burst mitigation ability with a fast reuse time both can lead to a situation where they almost always have greater mitigation than Warriors on any blue and most yellow mobs - that's the heart of experiance group viability and would make raid Warrior #3, 4, 5, etc. virtually useless.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, limit the capability to stun lock by having 2 Paladins in a group by putting a recourse buff on the mob or providing Knights with a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; with a much shorter duration than Warriors get with no better than the same reuse time and the situation in well under control. Knights are able to &quot;burst mitigate&quot; in an emergency, are incapable of replacing Warriors where our one and only capability is supposed to shine, and experiance group desireability remains unchanged.<br />

That would more than make up for the combined HP/avoidance/AC/-1DI advantage that warriors have, making pallies the superior tank on any mob that's level 75 or under.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior at 2271 AC<br />
http://www.grumpsrage.com/parses/warror%202271.JPG <br />
<br />
Look at the spike damage area (DI20) its very low and comparable to the rest of the values, 2.78% (still a little bit higher but not hugely)<br />
<br />
Paladin at 2066<br />
http://www.grumpsrage.com/parses/paladin%202066.JPG <br />
<br />
<br />
about 2% higher with 200 ac difference<br />
<br />
Compare again to<br />
<br />
http://www.grumpsrage.com/parses/shadow%20knight%201861.JPG<br />
<br />
200 less AC, and the about 1% more of hits are DI. <br />
<br />
Then compare to a warrior with 1380 AC, or about 400 difference,<br />
<br />
http://www.grumpsrage.com/parses/warrior%201380.JPG<br />
<br />
Less then 2% more spike damage, with a difference of 400 AC, going from a knight to a warrior.<br />
<br />
None of these are great comparisions, because they bounce around too much, so they can easily be disputed by saying thats just the way the curve works, and that could very well be true.<br />
<br />
However, what it I (and i beleive brael, but i'll leave him to say that for himself) means, is that warriors have a reduced change to get spike damage, (DI20)<br />
<br />
However this is all personaly conjecture, based on easily disputed personal experience, and data, so I dont really exspect it to convince anyone, which is once agian why I think that some good parse's of Knight vs Warrior hit distrubtions need to be made, to see if they take damage differently, at same AC values.</div></div><hr />

All of this PALES in comparison with the triggered 100% mitigation (or avoidance, however you chose to think about it) that pallies can now, and will be able to generate on demand (with OOwar and stuns up to level 75).

<br />
These Warrior mitigation advantages are assuming identical equipment, AA abilities, etc. and do not take into account the use of spells or disciplines.<br />
<br />
Obviously comparing any given lvl 65 Wariror with any 65 Knight,  equipment, the types of damage a mob can produce, it's DI and DB and the actual use of spells and/or disciplines will make actual mitigation vary greatly from this innate difference. This variation can be much much greater than the percentage of innate difference.<br />

<br />
Three things:<br />
<br />
1: the warrior skillcaps are not mitigation, they're avoidance. They don't reduce damge taken on a hit, they remove it all together.<br />
<br />
2: The skillcaps make up for more than 1% of hits. some say 1.5%, some say 2%.<br />
<br />
3: The skillcaps, being avoidance, make up for more than 1.5%-2% of damage. 1% avoidance accounts for the same damage not taken, than 2% damage, mitigated down by half.</div></div><hr />

If Warriors excel in one tanking job (Boss tanking) then Knights excel in one, thats the way it works if you don't blur classes, you get 16 classes all 100% needed for a raid.  Would be so much easier to balance EQ if they balanced by archetype and blurred classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors are by nature focused on a role, and Knights by nature are not.    Knights have many more choices of playstyle and roles to fulfill than warriors EVER will in groups, in soloing and even on raids.   <br />
<br />
It's not very often you see warriors on pull teams, but it IS very often that I see knights on them.   It's not very often I see warriors doing group heals or cures or battlerezzes or spam heals.     I don't often send warriors tells when I get low on health, nor do warriors get grouped often with casters/priests/DPS to increase their output.<br />
<br />
Your classes are pretty blurry to begin with, that's the whole point of them.   Mine is not, mine is clear cut as can be.  We tank and we do damage.   We dont' do a lot of damage, but it's pretty damn good.    We are not capable of performing ANY other function in Everquest.   We have no choices of what to do or where to do it or anything else.   If we're not tanking, then we're waiting to tank.   <br />
<br />
On raids,  the vaunted &quot;warrior DPS&quot; has ground to a screeching halt for most warriors at our level of play, BECAUSE we need to be tank ready.  We have no way of shedding aggro in any way shape or form, and thus if we're 'tank ready', we do so much aggro that we're a danger to ourselves and the raid by living up to our potential.    I do less DPS on raids nowdays just to remain alive when I'm not tanking than I did in Vex Thal over 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />

Yes your class does that one thing and only that one thing but thats part of the problem with tanking balance.  Although sadly not one thats likely to be fixed :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's generally a lot more roles and overlapping of roles than classes.    Of those 16 classes, 4 get to claim &quot;Best in Role&quot; (Rog/Wiz/Cleric/Warrior), 7 get &quot;Specifically Needed many times&quot; (Shaman/Enchanter/Bard/necro/druid/beastlord/monk), 4 get overlapping roles (Mage, Paladin, Ranger, Shadowknight) and one is completely worthless and shoudl've never been made (Berserker).   <br />
<br />
Just because those 5 classes have overlapping roles doesnt' make them useless, each of thsoe 5 classes is SIGNIFICANTLY more versatile and self sufficient than the rest.   So what if mages dont' do as much DPS as Wizards, when they do much more?   So what if Knights dont' tank as well as warriors when they can do so much more?    The only class I feel is in limbo at the moment is Rangers, who are still sufferring from the stupidity that is called the &quot;Stonewood Compound Bow&quot;.</div></div><hr />

But when ya's ask for &quot;burst mitigation&quot; with a very very short refresh when Warriors don't use D/S/E add tanking, you lose a little Warrior support.<br />
<br />
Plan B, three &quot;equal&quot; tanks two of which have spellbooks and unrivaled versatility and one that would suck beyond belief once it lost it's defining class ability or other classes shared it kinda finishes off any remaining support I might be inclined to give.<br />
<br />
You don't seem to focus on things like the fact your Class Description dwells on your ability to cripple a mob nor the fact it focuses on your ability to do damage in a wide variety of ways. All you seem to be able to think about is that Warriors have Defensive and tank brutal mobs. It appears unless you can somehow eviserate Warriors, no other raid roles and no set of class consistant abilites matter in the least.<br />

What I don't understand:<br />
<br />
Since Paladins get massive, so much more than defensive, damage reduction on stunable mobs (70 percent less dps taken), why don't more shadow knights support the warrior side?<br />
<br />
I mean, if I were a sk, I woudn't be supporting anything paladins asked to get, since I didn't have their stuns.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Because they know you talk about papertactics and nonsense.<br />
<br />
The situation now.<br />
<br />
Stunmigration only work for trival stuff. There we can really migrate damage. But this is that useless for this situation that only warrior can find it usefull. This cost us mana and usually in this situation i save mana for groupeheals and only care about aggro. I dont care if i migrate more damage with stuns because the healer in groupe simple dont have a problem to keep me alive. It allso dont make it more effectiv. Because if i us stuns i simple have the effect that the healer need to heal me less but the healer simple dont have a manaproblem and so if i do it or not we will kill mobs at the same rate.<br />
<br />
As higher the mobs get and as harder they get as more and more useless stunmigration get because level restriction resists etc. So when it really help us it get less and less usefull. So the effect of stun only look great on paper when you mix up stuff. Like you take the migration from trival stuff where you dont die and can fall asleep and then take this migration and think in the highend you can do the same.<br />
<br />
The situation in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
If they give us this stuns. And they work. Lol they break the game on that many ways it isnt funny. They break it for knights because we will die a lot more. Healer can not 'plan' this stuns. They can chainheal us and waste a lot of healing when we stun the mob or hope we stun and see us die when we get resists. But the fact will be that when stuns work we will tank better. But effectiv we will have it harder because we can only pray that we dont get resists etc. So it is not controlable and like taunt very, very bad tool because the fact that it is not controlable. But it will give us a bad taste because we effectiv can tank better then warriors even when it lead to more death paladins because you tank worser overall but you can stay alive this worser tanking the full time where we simple die to the speak damage which get created from resisted stuns etc. If stuns are notresistable which will make them usefull because then we can controll it they are total overpowered. Stun in OOW will not help knights. It will create the situation that we are total overpowered and they will nerf us to heal a week later or it will give us a tool which is not controlable but sound good on paper and so they can say 'but you stun the mob etc.'.<br />
<br />
Every knight will tell you the same. To balance us with stuns will not work. Go listen to the post on the knight board and you see 100 reasons why it dont work. Stun migration only work on paper and every knight tell you this. Like taunt aggro only work on paper will stun migration only work on paper but never in the game because both are not controlable or to powerfull when you make it controlable. <br />

If you look on the Knight boards you'll also see 100 reasons why Paladins can't cast while tanking. Of course we know that hogwash too.<br />
<br />
Stun mitigation worked so effectively in GoD that apparently SoE actually increased the number of stun resistant mobs. It was so effective Paladins complained when they found out. Borrow a friend's Paladin and tank virtually any blue mob in Kod'Taz. Fire off a stun. Whee, you just saved your healer having to heal maybe 1K of damage. Fast wasn't it? Do it again. Whee! You can easily &quot;stun mitigate&quot; 10% of the mob's damage.<br />
<br />
The puller's going out for another mob. Time to touch up heal yourself and watch FT, KEI, SD, and bard song visably move your manabar to the right.<br />
<br />
Arbosch, stuns and heals are most valuable on yardtrash and in experiance groups. Knights aren't intended to MT red mobs as easily as a Wariror. This fact seems to confuse you greatly. As add tanks, plow tanks, or in experiance groups stuns, heals, Root, and buffs give you some very nice advantages. Advantages appropriate to your class and the role you perform and have performed on raids for 4 years.<br />
