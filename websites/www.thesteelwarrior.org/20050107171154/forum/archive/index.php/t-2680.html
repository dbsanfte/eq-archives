<br />
GM's are no longer allowed to de-spawn any warder for any reason.<br />
<br />
This means that if you kill a named and try to continue, and there's a warder that has not de-spawned, you're screwed. Gm's will not, indeed are not PERMITTED, to help you with this bug that they have often admitted is a known bug, any longer. They will not de-spawn the warder for you.<br />
<br />
What a load of crap. So now not only to they know about the bug, they refuse to fix it even on the as-it-occurs level.</div></div><hr />

I can't count how many times a GM has told someone &quot;we are not allowed to fix &lt;insert problem here&gt;&quot; when it has been posted all over that GMs are fixing &lt;insert problem here&gt; for people who petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was posted over at the Safehouse, and several people have reported the same problem on that thread. So unfortunately, it wasn't just as ass of a GM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until just this last week, I and many others have had GM's able to come in and de-spawn the proper warders for us.<br />
<br />
And yeah, i know, it's been bugged for a year or more. All this time, and they can't be bothered to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Up until recently GMs DID despawn warders if you cleared up to Aten and they didn't depop.  They won't anymore.  At least not on Mith Marr.</div></div><hr />
