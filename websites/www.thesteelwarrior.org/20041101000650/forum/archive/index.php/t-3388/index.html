<br />
When you add an augmentation to an item, the stats on the item change.  Does that mean that you can then hold two of the items in your inventory?<br />
<br />
For example .. you have a Greatstaff of the Four Winds, which you use as your main DPS weapon when you aren't tanking.  If you add an augmentation to that GSo4W, does that mean that you could then hold another GSo4W in inventory?<br />
<br />
Why would you want to do that?  Well, maybe you want one GSo4W for DPS, when you aren't tanking, and another with an aggro augmentation, for when you are tanking.<br />
<br />
Same would be true for armor slots .. you could have different Vindi BPs in your backpack, with different stats .. one for tanking (with a HP augmentation), one with extra SVM.<br />
<br />
Just curious if anyone knows whether that's possible or not.</div></div><hr />
