<br />
Mi current magello can be found in the left bit, but I currently use a SoTB and SBoL. I was wondering whether to switch one out for a fleshgrinder now that I have hit 51, or whether the stats and DMG/Del on ym current weapons would make it not worth while.<br />
<br />
Please no suggestions about the CHoS I have 13 skill in 1hb and don't have the time to train it up yet.<br />
<br />
If not fleshgrinder any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Skill level has no bearing on procrate, buy a CHoS and offhand it and deal with the loss of dps.  You're doing yourself a disservice by buying a lesser weapon.  As for saying you don't have the time to train your 1hb skill, thats like saying you don't have time to level, its just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maxing combat skills shouldn't take long at all. I agreee with Jaqyl; that is stupid to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The swords you have now are superior to fleshgrinder. Don't bother with it, as it's barely going to serve you for a level or two and even then you're not gaining much of anything to justify paying platinum for it.<br />
<br />
The hammer, however, would be a nice addition. And since you have the other two, pretty damn good swords, you can mix the hammer in and skill up at your leisure.<br />
<br />
If you don't want the hammer, don't get the hammer.<br />
<br />
But, the fleshgrinder's not worth buying considering the weapons you DO currently use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're not getting the hammer, don't bother with the fleshgrinder. Pick up that 0-second stun sword (Rock Smasher? What is it? I can't remember)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rocksmasher is correct, it's 13/21 with some other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rocksmash is the proc. It's not the name though. It's something like Reinforced Sandstone-Hilted Sword or something like that.</div></div><hr />
