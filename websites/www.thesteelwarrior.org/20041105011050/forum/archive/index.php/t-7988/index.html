<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I picked up a SoBS real cheap in the bazaar, but can't decide whether to use it secondary or primary.  I had the CHoS in primary, but the SoBS has a slightly shorter delay.  The proc on the CHoS is much higher though.  Which should I do? or does it matter much.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't matter much but CHoS main hand seems to be the norm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have tried it both ways and find that the proc on the SoBS will go off more often in the main hand, that being said the proc is a stun up to 65 ... makes a lot more sense to me to have that one proccing. Also I dumped my CHoS and put in a Reinforced Sandstone-Hilt Sword as I have seen it resisted just the once and the stun is great agro. <br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used the CHos mh because of the proc, I did a bit more melee damage with the blood main but over all a bit more dps with the Copper, but really it makes little difference.  Both weapons have the SAME PROC RATE there is NO DIFFERENCE, the Blood does not go off more then the Copper or the other way they  are both the same.  I dont really see what difference the stun lvl makes the agro is the same no matter what and thats the reason we use them.<br />

Just my two coppers<br />

  The stun matters as much or more than the extra DPS. Interrupting level 65 mobs is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

This is the most sensible comment.</div></div><hr />

Ya know its funny I just never seem to see that message about their casting being interrupted, but I do see 358hp (2 * 179) non-melee damage message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whether you interrupt their casting is irrelevant.  Stunning a mob delays its next combat round, so every stun proc is a source of damage mitigation.  In many situations it is more valuable to mitigate damage than to inflict damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Stunning the higher mobs is useful no doubt.I thought the CHOS had a tiny bit more aggro so i mainhanded it as all our warriors ended up doing until we got better than the droga weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a 0 sec stun though, it doesn't delay their next combat round at all does it?  I wouldn't think so anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if only a stun would ends a combat round (a little like interrupting a caster's spell) it would be valuable even at 0s. But it doesn't so we have to use them just for aggro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I used SoTBS primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm, I thought the stun on SOTBS was 2.00/65, but now I see it's 0.00/65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use ChoS primary, mainly because of the 179dd. If i can proc it twice in one minute compared to one sotbs proc per minute (in the offhand) it's better dps. Kick and bash or more reliable for interupting mobs than praying for a proc to go off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think what you should take from this thread is....put them in whatever configuration you like, you can make a case for either way and they're pretty close to equal so don't worry about it much :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agro is the same either way, no real difference.<br />
Dps, favors the chos mainhand( although some sites report +25 resist check on force shock, which i seem to agree with, because it always seemed like force shock got resisted more.)<br />
I alway prefered sotbs mainhand, because i liked having the stun actually stun bot mobs etc and break casting.<br />
<br />
if you have ambi dexterity, it makes almost no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use the SotB mainhand and CHoS secondary.<br />
<br />
My reasoning:<br />
The extra 104 hps of damage 2~3x per minute from the hammer isn't going to make that big a difference in whether we win a fight or not. However, 2~3x stuns a minute from the sword might, especially if it happens to interrupt a complete heal or a gate.<br />
<br />
I'm happy with how it's working out so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">12/19 is better dmg than 13/20 in mainhand as well ... and 13/20 is a better ratio for offhand use than 12/19 ... SOOOOOO .... make use of the dmg bonus perk and just mainhand the SoTBS.  <br />
<br />
More melee dps &gt; potential 200dmg more per min from procs<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Force shock seems to be resisted more than the other.  The difference in dps is remarkably unnoticable ... i had some parses a few hours long on the katta banker (if i can dig them up) from a long time ago showing that the CHoS was actually slightly less dps in mainhand.<br />
<br />
/shrug it matters not ... toMAYto/toMAHto ... either will get the job done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't think there's much differance.However if you're gonna be picky force shock has about 100dd more on it's proc.Yeh 100 dd sux for aggro,but,it's something and I was only really concerned about aggo when I used them.I think the CHOS is better aggro main handed ,although,the differance is minimal.I swapped them  around and I felt the CHOS was better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm only level 52 atm so I'll keep with the CHoS in the main hand for now.  In a few levels I might switch it out to have the 65 stun proc'ing more.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
