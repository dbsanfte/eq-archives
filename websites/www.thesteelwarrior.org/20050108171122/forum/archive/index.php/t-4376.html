<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethor</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a SK point of view. Now, I don't know about PoTime gear, I'm not flagged for that yet. It might be that the picture looks different there.<br />
<br />
I will give you one SK profile, which is my own, authentic Magelo. The other is of a warrior who was in my guild for a while (left some time ago, but that's beside the point here).<br />
<br />
Me: Aethor (SK) (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50990)  5185 hp<br />
<br />
Him: Kadah (War) (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=658667) 5123 hp<br />
<br />
Both profiles have almost the same hp, so you will say that a knight can get the same hp as a warrior. WRONG.<br />
<br />
Compare the gear and see what difference is there.<br />
<br />
Boots of the savage (him) vs Boots of the Wind? No comparison really.<br />
Champion's greaves (him) vs Ancient wurm hide leggins, and augmented at that<br />
Heavy tooled weapon belt vs Ssraeshzaen blood cord? Not on the same level<br />
and so on and so on... Barbed dragonscale pauldrons vs Mantle of the Rainmaker? bwahaha<br />
Bracelet of quickness vs Umbracite bracer? Laugh.<br />
He got better arms and gloves - for just 15 hp each. <br />
Helmet of Raldukan vs Crown of Narandi? Cant compare.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, what is my point here?<br />
<br />
My point is that the warrior has the same hp as me - with gear that is bought from bazaar, or drops in normal level LDoN mission, grand total of his raid drops are 4 items, and he has less aa on top of it all - no planar durability.<br />
<br />
Warriors complain that knights have almost the same hp. Now, in order to actually achieve that hp, I have drops from Vex Thal, Ssra, and assorted raid level encounters. In order to have the same or nearly the same hp as a warrior, a knight has to have gear that is leaps and bounds above what the warrior has. <br />
<br />
And that gear takes time and effort to get. <br />
<br />
Imagine the same warrior, with gear on the level as SK here? Probably easy 6k hp. To get this low 5 k hp on a warrior, that's extremely easy. Much easier than equipping a knight. Warriors are gear dependant in sense that they need 2 agro weapons. Knights don't need agro weapons - but they need every other slot filled with high level items in order to be considered for tanking at all.</div></div><hr />

Your right you don't know what your really talking about so until you do shut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At lower levels your point might have been correct. Look at the posted Magelo's of a time warrior and time paladin. Most of the gear is wearable by both.<br />
<br />
We are looking at the current expansion not the older ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethor</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case, hp being almost the same is a Plane of Time itemization problem, and not a class problem. <br />
<br />
LDoN is not worth discussion, to get a full set of Royal attendant armor, and to augment it (it's crap before you augment it fully), it would take such a mind boggling amount of time, repeating the same thing over and over again, that whoever actually does it, he can have as much hp as he likes, far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
Now the question is, what level of play concerns most warriors and knights involved? If this is PoTime limited, then only a small percentage. Even the level from profiles I posted, which is Vex Thal beginner level, is not something that most people will see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's funny, I just did a quick compairison of that &quot;crap&quot; armor to yours and found it to be superior in almost everyway un-augmented. Hell, most of the pieces are better than my Ornate.<br />
<br />
edit: and even with my nearly full set of ornate I only have 350hp's more than you do with a little less ac, but lets not forget your 4k mana pool. It should count for something.</div></div><hr />

Not that it matters since ripoests totally cancel that out.<br />

Just an observation.<br />

And yes the main problem is itemization imo regarding the HP gap.</div></div><hr />

Its becoming far too popular on this board to quote someone else's 3 page post and then put a one liner on the bottom and theres your post.  Whats even worse is when the 500 word post you are quoting is either on the same page or is the post immediately above yours.  I read it the first time and you quoting it doesnt make it worth reading again, especially when all you are going to add at the bottom is &quot;well said&quot;.<br />

Brik is a Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
Knights will always retain their hate causing advantage just as warriors will always retain their HP and AC advantage. Shadowknights are DESIGNED with spells that cause ONLY hate... you cannot tell me they are not supposed to cause more hatred than warriors.<br />
<br />
A reasonable timer is dependant on how much hatred the ability adds.  It needs to be properly tested what is fair and what isn't.<br />
<br />
My terrors are 1.5 seconds to cast, cost 60 mana for 600 hate, and have a 6 second recast on top of the 2.5 second cool-down that all spells have.  The warrior ability will be insta-&quot;cast&quot;, not interruptable, and should be just as unresistable.  They also will have no cost save their recast, so it needs to be longer than the 10 seconds that terror takes between casts.<br />
<br />
Uhrlik<br />
Have you ever soloed a Kunark Dragon with a knight?<br />
(obviously not)<br />
<br />
lets put it this way...  I still have to run from normal BLUE XP mobs in order to solo them. (with 8 slots worth of Time gear)<br />
<br />
Why the hell should I be running?  Why the hell should a warrior have to run from a low dark blue or a light blue mob?<br />
<br />
Sooner or later, the warriors crying &quot;im broken&quot; might actually grow up out of their green-eyed fits of knight jealousy and figure out whats actually wrong, and why knights aren't really the problem.  Until then, the intelligent warriors and knights will test, parse, and actually do the work to find the truth.<br />
<br />
You can go ahead and claim how godly knights are...  each time I log in I know from experience how wrong you are.<br />

<br />
 Oh, a statement of Brik's I almost agree with.<br />
<br />
 It's too bad for generating aggro they use spells that they got back in Paludal and have as much chance of sticking around as a Milli Vanilli reunion, instead of level-appropriate ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Shadowknights are designed to have agro, this is known.  SKs also have spells that give other characters improved agro capabilities (the voice line), this is known too.  The fact that most shadowknights shun these spells designed for agro in preference of much lower level spells with 1/4 the mana cost that do more agro is a bad situation that I hope the devs correct.<br />
<br />
Due to this, several people don't mind so much that Shadowknights are better at agro, which is why a good amount of warriors are targetting Paladins instead, who have not only incredible agro (can beat shadowknight agro even), but groups heals, heal over times (HoT), roots, innate procs (although warriors may not mind that so much if more proc buff items were available), and almost 1800hp in self-buffs even if no other class is around (technically it's 1799hp).  If they're lashing out at you, it's not your class...it's you and the attitude you bring.  If you think otherwise, go right ahead, there's an ignore command for this board that I don't mind using if I need to.  I don't believe I'll be missing much.<br />
<br />
The problem is just about everything, you realize tho.  Itemization, spell setups, lack of abilities for melee, lack of controllable agro for warriors, skill caps...all of these work against Warriors even though they're billed as the best tank.  A warrior may have 600hp more, and slightly better avoidance...the agro control of Knights makes up for that completely, IMO, even goes over it, resulting in level 65 people who have no idea how to manage agro with a warrior.  As long as warriors are made out to be the best tank in the game bar none by SOE itself, you will always see problems when the other two plate tank classes are just as capable, and make things worlds easier for all other classes.  I don't mean &quot;sufficient&quot; in tanking, Knights are beyond that.  <br />
<br />
Like I said in another thread (or probably a whole 'nother board), either they follow the &quot;warrior is best tank&quot; idea and make warriors the best tank completely, at the scale the game is currently at with hp/ac/agro, or they make warriors/Knights equal in tanking and give warriors capabilities that rival the Knight's spell book and then you'll see REAL competition.  I'm game for that, are you?<br />
<br />
You can go ahead and claim how godly knights are... each time I log in I know from experience how wrong you are. I know from my own experience just how right they are...even with the now-gimp equipment on my SK, I know just how powerful she is.  But my problems are with Paladins, not Shadowknights.</div></div><hr />

If i linked it right one is a 65 SK the other s a 65 warrior same gear same AA's<br />
kinda cool how the warrior has max INT and WIS and a 5K mana pool he can't use<br />
But the warrior does get 550 more hitpoints and 1 more ac <br />
<br />
from what i can see knightemization is F.U.B.A.R.</div></div><hr />

Its only more than 500 hp because they refuse to get upgrades in several slots to preserve FT or a focus.  Well knights, I don't have a spellbook of spells to focus at all.<br />
<br />
More hp has diminishing returns anyway.  I have clerics that like to count the number of max CHs they land on me in exp groups.  Not to mention if you picked up a paladin instead of a warrior, bss and crusader would eliminate the gap completely unless the warrior had a paladin in his group.</div></div><hr />

Until you go and play a warrior in the 60's, you don't know jack shit.  I have a 62 warrior with 40 aa's who can't get a group.  I quit playing him and started a shadowknight, who's now almost 60.  <br />
<br />
My impression of playing the SK is that I'm just disgusted by what they can do.  If you aren't godly, then that's your fault not the fault of your class or it's abilities.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough I had the enchanter in my group last night say &quot;Oh my god I've never seen anyone keep agro like you, not even other shadowknights.  I just chain cast alternating level stun blasts after tashing, crippling and slowing it ... I'd never try that with anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd say she just made the point for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm probably pretty close to your gear level.  I haven't hit Ssra, or VT yet, but We're getting there soon, and I have PD3, etc.<br />
I have about 6100 or so before buffs. <br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=489623<br />
<br />
Before gear, I have 700hp on you Looking at the (Base) numbers.  After gear I have 900.  After Buffs I'll have about 1K.  I get more per STA point, but you get a lot more STA points off of Boar.<br />
<br />
700 hp of 3500 (Just to be generous and make for easy math...) is 20%.  1000 of 8500 (where I'm at raid buffed) is barely more than 10%.  Equal HP gear, and Equal HP buffs to the tune of almost tripleing our HP totals cuts the innate HP gap in half.<br />
<br />
700hp compared to grind mobs that double, triple, and quad 700's is a rounding error.<br />
<br />
NOW you know the foundation for the problem with tank HP's.  Now toss in your agro generation, and your self healing from life taps...(I'm willing to bet the lifetap &quot;heals&quot; more than make up for the miniscule hp gap we have now during grinds....) and it just gets worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a 60 warrior that I have leveled up from scratch...(untwinked btw.. he is on a different server than my Shadowknight, and the highest level on that server)<br />
<br />
I have access to numerous time-equipped 65 warriors on my regular server.<br />
<br />
I have played the game since beta...  since knights were once in the &quot;log your knight and log in this warrior so you are useful&quot; catagory, I would imagine most knights of sufficient age have played warriors to a much greater extent than most warriors give them credit for.<br />
<br />
I would say I am in a much better position to say which class is better at what.  I have little trouble getting groups with EITHER class.  The problem doesn't seem to be with my skills, or with either class.... what does that leave us with?<br />
<br />
<br />
My equipment arguement has not been challenged with anything except a magelo of a knight in warrior equipment.  With over 3 months of time/quarm farmage, the average knight has 1000 less HP than the average warrior (with 40% or higher raid attendance)<br />
Reality and magelo are two different things.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note,<br />
I actually eagerly await the melee changes...  I simply hope they don't overpower warriors again.  Some variety would be a good thing...  but it is too early to tell the effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Valeris, why post if all you are going to do is tell us you have nothing to say?  Just wondering of you understand that each time you do that you only validate my points by proving YOU have no point.  My laughing at your expense is becoming too much of a good thing...<br />
<br />
Just a little RL tip...  don't open your mouth (or wiggle your fingers) if you have nothing to say.<br />

<br />
 Congratulations! You've found that magical place where 65 SK's can tank 'well enough' for all situations that they can instead get items with FT/Focus instead of raw HP/AC. And after 3 months of Quarm farmage, I'm betting that outside of 1 or maybe 2 items, your magelo is set thru at least the next expansion.<br />
<br />
 Guess what?<br />
<br />
 The difference between you and a Warrior in HP with similar gear is &lt;= ONE HIT from a mob up there. Not one round - one HIT.<br />
<br />
 If that was 'balance', and they wanted 'balance' all down the line, then I guess at 20ish, where my Bard is currently meleeing, Warriors should have about 60 HP more than Knights  - 'cause that's ONE HIT from 20's mobs.<br />
<br />
 Your 'credentials' != protection from logical fallacies.</div></div><hr />

Your getting jealous arent you?<br />
Actully due to un proper augments on my profile I actully range to about 5250hp atm. And I got rid of the barbed dragon paldrons for a shaded armice. <br />
<br />
And Aethor your profile shows you at 5339 <br />
Where mine is at 5145<br />
So yes you do have more HP then me you dirty lieing bastard. <br />
<br />
Dont come into my fourm and use my magelo to make a case then lie through your teeth rickshaw.<br />
<br />
Also a final note, You come into a balance fourm and then start making jabs at me, About how my &quot;raid&quot; gear isnt even close to the level of your own, Yet you then cry like a pussy because my un-ubar gear brings me within 150hp of you. <br />
<br />
What point are you trying to prove, That because I bought gear smartly for the long hall to give me better duration then a quick fixer up that I am in someway worse then you?.<br />
<br />
Your pathetic, Your just anther Shadowknight scared that this up coming change is gonna hurt your group options, And to top it off, your jealous that lil Kadah found a better guild that treats its members with respect , and helps them out more so then your's.<br />
<br />
Boy get the fuck outta my fourm. <br />
<br />
(PS. To the moderator's. I do take Aethor's comments about me as a personal attack and thus have given him words back, if you feel this should be moved to the outhouse then cool. Im sorry to see that BS drama that should be done being taken to this fourm.)<br />
