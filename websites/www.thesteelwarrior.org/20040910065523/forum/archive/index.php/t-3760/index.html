<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was in the Korean Beta, and can say that it's shaping up very well. What they really need to do is put some bonus for grouping, because I noticed none whatsoever in there. Griefing was sorta common, but that's normal for a beta I guess. The English beta is coming out at the end of the month, and guess who's going to be in it? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talic Moore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't been too impressed with World of Warcraft, from what I've seen. It looks interesting but... still not enough I think. We'll see.<br />
<br />
I'm still full of optimism for FF11, which apparently makes me some kind of gamer heathen, or something, but there is nevertheless the constant appeal of riding around destroying the wicked with my chocobo. Named Shikarii.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chocobos &gt; all.<br />
Well, there's 3 games i'm looking forward to: WoW, FFXI, and Lineage 2. FFXI is coming out in a week or 2, i can't wait. Being a huge FF fan i just have to at least give it a shot. WoW looks very nice, all blizzard games look great. But i'm worried about the playerbase. If you've played Starcraft or Diablo2, you know that there's lots of very very annoying people, PKers, cheaters, assholes, etc. The type of people who in EQ would be a training, kiting druid in a zerg guild who doesn't know a thing about the game, talks in 1337, thinks warriors suck and uses paladins as tanks, and got to level 65 very very fast. And has an alt in bazaar who rips people off. Imagine a game where almost everyone is like that. As for Lineage 2...well, i don't know much about it, but i did play the first one and it wasn't too bad...Heck, the first Lineage was my first MMORPG. Problem is most people i know will be playing WoW or FFXI, so i'd probably play with them instead. <br />
Then of course there's Everquest 2...i don't know if i will ever give it a shot, but who knows...maybe they'll have a totally different team in charge of it who would be working to make a better game and not a bigger wallet.</div></div><hr />

I'm with Dima.  Last thing I want to do is blow another 5 years of my life on some new game.  When I'm done with EQ I'm done with online RPGs.<br />
<br />
As far as non-life-absorbing games go though, I am really looking forward to Call of Duty (http://www.callofduty.com) :cool:</div></div><hr />

back on topic though..i was beta'ing Uru:Ages Beyond Myst  (http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/oct03/uru.html) and it's downright gorgeous.<br />

<br />
very social game it's going to be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I tried Ragnarok Online back for a few months after it was pay to play. I really enjoyed that game because my Swordsman could tank and deal insane damage. <br />
<br />
I liked how they let you place stat points as you leveled, some Swordsmen went for max VIT which allowed you to migate tons of melee damage, great for when you're in the middle of a train.<br />
<br />
Other Swordsmen went for AGI which increased attack speed and  avoidance which was great for fighting bosses because you'd be doing more dodging that Neo in the Matrix, heh.<br />
<br />
I personally made a Swordsman that was a hybrid defense, and mostly STR. This allowed me to migate some... and avoid some... and deal out thousands upon thousands of damage in a minute.<br />
<br />
The reason my build worked was because the other Swordies with high migation or avoidance needed such high defensive skills because they hit like french tennis players. Well, maybe not that bad but they generally hit for 60-110 damage a swing on mobs that I hit for around 450-530 damage. So needless to say, I ended most of my fights before I could take that much damage.<br />
<br />
The only reason I quit RO was because their GMs could barely speak English and because there were so many hackers/bots to deal with and the GMs did server rollbacks instead of rollbacks on single accounts to fix their problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally am going to try FFXI and see how that is. If anybody would like to play on my server in FFXI leave me a message on these forums and I'll buy you a world pass.<br />
<br />
I'm not planning on canceling EQ but I don't expect I'll be playing it much after FFXI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I played during the horizon's beta for a while and the game could be interesting but it just didnt interest me at all.  The major turn off actually was that the developers have said that monsters will NEVER EVER NEVER drop loot items (i.e. swords, armor)  Monsters will only drop tradeskill items and / or patterns or recipes for tradeskills.  Coming from EQ this was just too much of a turnoff to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ohhhh I am digging the new UXO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zerapheus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I beta'ed FFXI, and i have to say i was very impressed.  Movement is definitely a bit awkward to get used to at first after playing EQ for so long, but that's my only major complaint.<br />
<br />
Graphics = kick-ass (Square as usual comes through to the fullest)<br />
Sound = dunno, I have a problem with my soundcard so I had to disable to play<br />
Gameplay = very smooth, pretty easy to level at first<br />
<br />
Your bank is your own MOG house that you can decorate and furnish... plus, damn, you have your own Mog in the house!  How sweet is that?<br />
<br />
Chocobo's aren't available immediately because you have to do a quest at level 15'ish to earn your chocobo license.<br />
<br />
And honestly, you could devote eons of time to FFXI and still not be completed with the game.  6 classes to start with (Fighter, Thief, Monk, Black Mage, Red Mage, White Mage), then after level 18 and a quest, you can take on a subjob (i.e. Fighter/Monk, Black Mage/White Mage, etc)... however your subjob can only be 1/2 of the level of your main job (i.e. lvl 20 warrior could have a max lvl 10 subjob until you level up your main job... BUT you only gain exp in your main job, so you have to switch between jobs to level up).  Also once you hit 30 in a job and do a quest, you can open up 9 more jobs (Samurai, Ninja, Ranger, Dragoon, Dark Knight, Paladin, Summoner, Bard, Beastlord).  Max level is rumored to be 60 atm, so you could have a character that has ALL jobs at max level 60 if you truely wanted.... though, most of us beta'ers couldn't do the Samurai/Ninja/Dragoon classes in Beta, because they were with the Shadows of Zilart expansion that was given to those who were 46+ towards the last month of beta.<br />
<br />
FFXI will be released with the Shadow's expansion so that'll be nice.  Tetra Master (the card game from FF9) wasn't bad but not worth spending time on unless you have a LOT of time on your hands.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm going to stay with just EQ for now, but I am going to purchase FFXI and play it whenever I can't get an exp/LDoN group... which is rather often nowadays.  :D <br />
<br />
btw, check out http://www.shadow-dragons.com/index2.htm for some info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think that games should move away from the &quot;set class&quot; aspect, and go back torwards DnD where you would choose your path, rather then just picking 1 class and doing the exact same thing for the duration of your gaming career. <br />
<br />
<br />
I make my warrior to take hits, you make your to avoid them, that guy over there makes his to deal asstons of damage etc etc. That kind of class  system would be harder to balanc... but I think it would be pretty sweet in an EQ type world. Maybe except for grouping or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda makes me want to go play bauldurs gate, it was actually a pretty fun game.</div></div><hr />

I wished I had stopped with EQ.  I tried AC2 - lasted 2 months.  I tried SWG - lasted 1 month.  Tried something else that was so bad, I cannot even remember the name.  Would have been better off spending all of that money on beer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MythicaRealms.com: Do you see 'Private Realms' and the like as the future of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs)?<br />
 <br />
Matt Wilson: I think that question is already being answered—after we announced Mythica, everybody kind of jumped on board with the concept. I certainly think it’s the future. The tricky question is how much implementation each game will do, and I think most teams will be focusing on just solving the problem of camping. Our goal with the Private Realms is to deliver that single-player, enjoyable adventuring experience. So while a lot of people will say they’re working on private realms, the level of what they actually do will vary from the basics—private camping spots, private hunting grounds—to what we call our playscapes, which is really the high end of the experience. <br />
<br />
MythicaRealms.com: So what is the difference between Private Realms and playscapes? Are playscapes another kind of Private Realm? <br />
<br />
Matt Wilson: Yes, we have two different kinds of modules. (A long time ago, our industry took the name “modules” from TSR’s Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D), but the underlying concept is much older, and can be applied to many types of games.) So, we have the linear module model for Private Realms, which is like a standard D&amp;D linear module where you start with a specific objective in mind, and then pursue it. Whether the subsequent gameplay is completely linear or branches, at the end you achieve some primary goal such as “kill the monster” or “save this person.” And you get rewarded all the way through the module, which could be anything from a thirty-minute to a two-day long campaign. <br />
<br />
Then we have our concept of playscapes, which are almost taken from the real-time strategy (RTS) side of the world. In these, you’ll have one or two primary objectives, such as to take out a certain temple or something like that. Then we’ll put “levers” all around, sprinkled throughout the area, which will react to you. And the AI side will grow over time, pursuing its own goals, which are, you know, to win!<br />
<br />
Playscapes will be a little bit different from Private Realms—they’ll be far more replayable then the linear modules, so that something totally different might happen each time. This gameplay model lets us build content that can be replayed and still be interesting. Of course, we’ll include some objectives that are really easy to achieve, and some that make you think hard about possible solutions, work well together as a team, or even return once you advance to a higher level. <br />
<br />
MythicaRealms.com: The playscapes and the Realms, you mentioned that it can take a long time to complete them. So say you wanna log off when you are playing in one of these, do you log off straight from that realm?<br />
<br />
Matt Wilson: Again, this will be variable. In some of them, if you log off, you will have to start over, but with some of your objectives already achieved. This is similar to, say, Diablo. For logging off, your penalty is to fight all those monsters again, but your completed quests stay completed. We’re also doing a bunch of things with linked realms so players won’t have to worry about “If I pop out, do I have to kill all the monsters again?” The really long quests, the ones we expect to take two days or even a week, will all be linked realms. It won’t be something that you have to pound through and do nonstop. You should be able to achieve a handful of objectives and then say, “Hey, let’s call it a night. Let’s see if we can get to the next one tomorrow!” <br />
<br />
Levers include troops, special equipment like siege engines and .. stuff :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>AnielaCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I been playing Horizons beta a bit... It was fun for the first 2 days or so, but then I just lost interest. Tradeskilling is very big part of the game, I haven't really seen many item drops, just formulas and components for tradeskills. Dragons are very much not finished yet. 1st person view seems rather awkward, the default view is 3rd person from behind the character.<br />
<br />
It looks like it's gonna be neat though, but I'll probably wait for the finished product until I decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Anyone have any info about warriors in FFXI?  They supposedly get some kind of defensive ability... don't know anything else atm... been reading about the game all day.  <br />
<br />
Can they solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">From what i read Nobody solo's beyond the first few levels as far as i can tell - grouping is much more beneficial xp wise and you also get a bonus if you keep up with killing mobs of at least the same level continuously. I'm not sure if any class solo's well, but  if you want and their are any you can just level up a 'soloer class' on your same  character - see below.<br />
<br />
Warriors get basic abilities as part of the class, additionally they have access to all weapons and high skill caps - the better your weapon skill the more special abilities with weapons of that type you can perform. Plus everyone will have at least one secondary job which (once you've levelled it up) is also in operation at half your primary jobs level and you can switch between jobs depending on what you want to play - if you put in the time you can theoretically be maximum level in every job and switch between them (in a town) whenever you like - all on one character. Flexibility is the core of FFXI.<br />
<br />
Hmm,<br />
<br />
Given this system and that most combat abilities are skill based rather than class based FFXI is probably less prone to 'balance problems' as seen in EQ since any character can have any ability so long as he has advanced the correct skill/class. Equally, the primary/secondary job system also restricts things so that you don't get 'super characters' that excel in every situation....</div></div><hr />

You still aren't then :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">About 80% of my guild is playing FFXI atm.  Our usual Time crew is around 80ish, last couple days we've had about 15 online during prime time.<br />
<br />
Too bad my comp is too slow for FFXI and I don't want to pay over $300 to upgrade it atm.  Restarted my UO account for a month.  Been fun so far, shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">OK gonna get a good overview written. During the last few days I have been at work and unable to raid during the day (normal for my weekends), and so I have been exploring FF at night. For a little background, I have never played any FF game prior to this, I had no intrest in this game at all until Micah told me to pick it up and play with him. <br />
<br />
The installation is long and boring, expect between an hour and 2 hours to complete it fully. Realize this game has been out one year and so its patching up, just like you would from a complete reinstall of eq and every expansion. The game itself is close to 6 gigs. I recomend getting it going, then popping in a dvd, check on it every once in awhile. You can also surf the net and stuff while its installing still so that can keep you busy as well. <br />
<br />
Before running the game, RUN FFX CONFIG!!!, and set up your graphics settings. You cannot do this mid game, also this is where you set up your controller. I highly highly highly recomend you use a controller to play this game, remember it was designed to use a controller, not the keyboard and mouse. You can use any computer controller, 15-25 bucks, or you can get an adapter for your ps2 or xbox controller to work in it as well. The config program lets you map the buttons any way you would like, regardless of the controller type. Works real nice. <br />
<br />
The logging in and out process is a bit long, not time wise, just key stroke wise. They built Playonline to be able to support many different games, so they can expand. Thinking of the future so to speak, it comes complete with mail, messaging, etc. The easiest thing to do is follow the &quot;how to make a character&quot; walkthrough in the manual. Micah and I both made characters on the Slyph server, and we started in the city of Tarutaru. You can start with any race/class in any of the three cities. If you want to play with us let me know for a world pass for the server, and then start in tarutaru, I am going to be getting a linkshell set up soon so that we can all talk wherever we are (guildchat basicly). <br />
<br />
The creation process is cake, pick what you want to look like, pick your class (irrelevent really) and go for it. You can change your class at any point in the game back at your mog house in the city, so if you dont like a class or want to try something new, just swap. You retain all your gear, and your skills (they lower to the cap for the level of the new class, and as you level will raise to next cap and so on). Once you get to level 18 you can do subclasses (no not there yet myself). <br />
<br />
Once your in the game you will notice one thing very very quickly. The detail. Graphics in this game are pretty badass. On my p4 1300 with 512 ram and a gforce fx card the game runs on high everything, all details, and no lag or framerate drops whatsoever. Simply put, the game is beautiful. For those of you who have NOT gotten a controller (fools!) you should hit the minus sign on the numpad and bring up the main menu, hit right on the arrows to swap to the second set of options, go to config and you will see two settings you need to change. First, put the keyboard option in compact mode, the one and only bug I have found in this game is that in full mode when you try to move the chat box comes up, so you cant use awsd to move in that mode for example. So once in compact mode, then right under that is the option to map your keyboard. Set it up however you like. <br />
<br />
The rest is going to be from my perspective, of a blackmage (go figure). The game is not cake like eq is, its more difficult like eq was. When you start out you cannot go up and start beating on things even con or higher. You have to start small and as you get a few levels start picking on the guys 1 level below you for the best xp. Just like in eq, its more efficient to safely kill 2 guys that are a tad easier than it is to kill a single guy thats bigger. It does have a con type system. Use alt-c, or with a mob selected use the check option in their menu. <br />
<br />
Easy prey = 2 or more levels below <br />
Decent challenge = 1 level below <br />
Even match = you guessed it <br />
Tough = 1-2 levels above you <br />
Indredibly Tough = 3+ levels above you <br />
<br />
Easy guide there for ya if anyone picks it up and checks it out. <br />
<br />
As I said though, dont come to FF with your uber geared level 65 mindest, remember your a newb again =) Expect to die as you get used to it, look for home points (blue crystals in cities near gates) near where you will be fighting. For level 1-3 there is no penalty to death other than just getting sent to bind. When you die at any level you get 2 options, wait for a raise as you look over your corpse, or repop at bind. Raise is lvl 25, so just like when eq started dont expect one lol. When you repop you repop with all of your gear, in full health and mana. Once you hit level 4 you will start loosing xp as you die and repop. It is 10% of your required amount for that level. So if you require 1700 to level and you die, you lose 170... hard math. <br />
<br />
This is another thing about ff, they give you all the numbers. Your health, mana, experience, skills, etc. There are even tradeskills for you tradeskill nuts (fucking psychos I tell ya). The leveling scale is pretty straight forward, 500 xp to level 2, 750 to level 3, 1000 to level 4, and so on. When you &quot;ding&quot; which is cool as hell, your xp starts back at 0, adds any overkill xp to it, and your new goal is set. <br />
<br />
For levels 1-5 its pretty simple to solo for any class, 6-10 all classes can solo but duoing seemed more efficient as you could kill bigger stuff and faster. <br />
<br />
Looting is different in this game as well. When a monster dies, it tells you the xp you gained, the money it gave you, and the item it had on it. If you solo it automatically goes to your inventory. In groupage it goes to what they call a &quot;treasure pool&quot;. You can then go to the treasure pool and &quot;roll&quot; on the item by selecting it and casting a lot (random 3 digit number). Whoever gets highest it will auto go to their inventory. Or you can let it sit in the treasure pool and after a few moments it will automatically do the lots and distribute the loot. This method is the easiest as you never have to do anything and there is no random spam. You can also as the group leader designate someone to loot and they loot everything then you can split after, just like having an ML in eq for your group. <br />
<br />
Combat is pretty nice in the game. Mobs roam just like in eq, and there are some static spawns, or spawn areas. Where certain mobs only pop in the general area, similar to orc hill in gfay so to speak. The system is set up so that when you make a successful hit, or you are hit, you gain TP or technical points. Once you get to 100 TP you can make a special hit move. If you let it go to 200 it will be higher power, and if you let it max to 300 before using it, it will be at its highest strength. During non combat, or periods of not hitting anything, your tp will go down automatically, so its not something you can store forever. Once you get to grouping, you can do TP combos with other players, by TP's going off in succession each one will do more and more dmg, and then when the mob dies you also get bonus xp for the skill chain. Another way to get bonus xp is to kill multiple decent challenge or higher mobs in a row. Up to 4 can be chained for a bit of bonus xp, which in groups is very nice. <br />
<br />
The spell system is pretty neat, with the TP and spell effects looking very awesome graphicly especially as you level for higher stuff. When I cast fire on a mob it glows red then bursts into flames... that look like.. flames... heh. To attack anything you select the mob then chose attack, cast a spell, or check. Check cons it of course. When you select attack, you will draw your weapon automatically, generally you do this from a distance, then you rush in or cast a spell and bring them to you, sucker punching owns. Certain spells have a recast, and it tells you in seconds how long till you can cast again, when you highlight the spell. But you can chain multiple spells pretty easily, just gotta make sure that the first one is completly cast before you start the second. Another nice thing as a caster that I like, with a decent weapon you can actually do respectable melee damage to suppliment your casting damage. In all groups I am in, I am up there fighting next to the tanks and casting between swings. <br />
<br />
When you are done with a fight you can &quot;heal&quot; which is just like medding, you sit down and regen both hp and mp. There is no standing regen of any kind for either. You have to heal to regen. Its also much faster than in eq, with 100 or less mp and hp (basicly anyone under level 10) you will get 10-15(scales a little as you level) of each back every 6 seconds (so just like a tic in eq) so you can be fully back in action in 1 minute or so. <br />
<br />
You also get passive and active job abilities/skills. Passive ones come at later levels ( i got my first at 10 to raise spell damage) and they are always on, similar to a spell casting mastery, it always works. The active ones depend on your class, you start with a single 2 hour active ability. Mine is Manafont, which gives me unlimited mana for 30 seconds, you have never seen a spell caster so happy as one with unlimited mana! Its nice to go on kill frenzies with, or to save for a time of need as you run oom. <br />
<br />
The auction system for selling stuff in FF is very easy to use and better than even the bazaar. You go up to an auction counter, select bid, and then choose your category. It will then list every buyable item in that category, with stats, and if someone is selling it. This allows you to plan what you want to buy maybe a level or 2 ahead as well, very nice. All items you can currently use are highlighted, and all items you can use within 2 levels are in white, those you cant are a bit duller of a white almost greyish. Once you find an item you like, you select it, and click on price history, it will list the cost, from whom, and the date of the last 10 of those items sold. Prevents the need of price checks and it stabilizes the prices fast. Then once you know the cost, you can go and bid on the item, it is still an auction, the seller (who you don't see the name as they may be offline) could of put a lower or higher price on it, so play with it a little to get the best deal. If more than one of the item is available it could be from multiple or the same sellers, but their prices may be different. If lets say you go to buy staff A, and its price history shows it to be in the 200-300 range, with multiple sellers start at 200 and work your way up. The way it works is this. If you bid 300, and 300 is higher than all sellers, whoever has had their auction up the longest gets the cash. If you bid 250 and one seller is at 250 the other at 300, you get it for 250 and that seller gets the cash. Its really badass how they set it up. <br />
<br />
To sell anything, find out the going price through the bid section, back out and then click on sell, select your item, and then it will calculate a fee for hosting the auction based on the average going rate of the last 10 of that item sold. You pay the couple gil(the currency in the game) and then set your price for the item, click sell and it will tell you that the auction will go up for 9 weeks (game weeks) and if bought, the money will get put automaticly into your house bank. If not bought, it puts the item back in your house bank. Its all automated so it doesnt require you to be online, or in vendor mode, or anything like that. Like I said, its really badass. You can sell up to 7 items at a time. <br />
<br />
While hunting some items stack, but not automaticly as you loot them, but you can go to your item inventory, and click the auto sort button which will then stack all items up of the same kind. Stacks in FF are in 12's. As you level up, dont make the mistake I did and sell everything you get. Go to an auction house first and find out if its used in tradeskills, you can make a lot of money selling items for tradeskills there. <br />
<br />
The story in FF is pretty badass as well, each city is vieing for influence over zones, and this is reset every month. So whatever your home town is, thats who your fighting for. When you go out to get xp you can get your signet cast upon you by the door guards, this signet then adds points to your city's influence for every thing you kill in that zone, by having your city &quot;own&quot; a zone the guards there can bind you etc. There are also expeditions (once over 25) that you can go on behalf of your city to raise its influences. <br />
<br />
There are also rank missions you can do as well, similar to LDON style stuff, but on a much grander scale. You get a mission, and go complete it for rank points and conquest points. Rank points are like xp, but only obtainable through missions/expeditions/ and turning in crystals. Higher ranks get you access to more stuff. The conquest points can gotten through rank missions and through errands from the guards. When you aquire enough you can purchase gear for your character through them as an additional way to progress beyond just buying stuff at the auction house. <br />
<br />
Then on top of that there are also quests, just like in eq certain npcs for every level range give out quests for xp, gil, and items. One I do is collect 4 yagudo beads and turn them in for 200 gil. Easy to do as I killed lots of yagudo to xp, and it was nice bonus gil. There are also more elaborate multistep quests like in eq also. <br />
<br />
Oh and in all of this, did I mention as you get, during, and as you finish missions and certain quests. They do cut scenes adding in story and depth to the game play. Again, all I can say is it's badass. <br />
<br />
That should be a good quickoverview, if ya got any other questions feel free to ask.. <br />

Also grouping is viable under 15 and very productive, with the right people and at the right spots. If you started in Tarutaru, by going north through east saratarbuta you can get to the Thagoni canyon. There are Akaba birds there which are GREAT xp for level 9-11 groups with each clearing worth 600+ xp. Repop is pretty fast as well, just watch out for ghosts at night (go hunt smaller mobs during hte night) Then go back and clear the birds for good chain xp if you kill in succession, and do skill combos. <br />
<br />
Once everyone is 12-16 you can get good xp killing the ghosts, the Wild Dhameles, higher con Yagudo birdmen, and crawlers.</div></div><hr />
