<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">would like someone to do some tests for me, since i have zero defensive skill mods on me, only a 3% 1h slashing mod which gives me a wooping 6 atk.<br />
<br />
if someone would be a gent and parse against some PoP exp mobs, alone with a shammy to slow/heal and let you beat the mob down by yourself, it would be great. using skill mods like charm of defense (parry mod), bloodfrenzy/helmet of shadow (riposte mod), cloak of combustion (dodge mod), etc, and doing parses with/without these on the same type of mob, and/or using combinations of all the skill mods you got. yes, i know mods of the same type doesn't stack.<br />
<br />
though i have already guessed that they are all equally worthless, but would like some hard facts to back it up.<br />
<br />
also if you intend to do these tests, make sure you post what defensive AA's you have, if you do not have them all.<br />
<br />
on beforehand thanks,<br />

I am not familiar with parses and tools you need to use, but I am ready to try parsing this... in a PoG clean for exemple (half with, half without).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no reason to believe the mods don't work.  It's certainly not something you can notice and maybe not even easily noticeable by parsing.  Over the long run, the effect of such mods probably amounts to having low tens if not single digit effective HP versus melee attacks.  It's nothing to get excited about but if instead of say dodge 5% it has something like &quot;+10 HP but only good versus melee attacks&quot;, would you say it's useless?  Of course not.  It's an extra 10 HP that you didn't have before, even if it's a situational use.<br />
<br />
Or, to put it this way, if +8% dodge or whatever doesn't matter, would you be fine if next patch warriors dodge suddenly goes down by 8%?  After all if getting an extra 8% doesn't matter to you, losing an 8% shouldn't either.<br />
<br />
The effect of mod items is pretty minimal.  That said, nothing else would've been there anyway if the mod wasn't there, so there's nothing to complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mod % affect  skills that have a small impact on combat :<br />
<br />
Thus 2 things :<br />
* Skill mod impact is absolutely minimal.<br />
* Skill mod effect can not be parsed. Impossible.<br />
<br />
Ex :<br />
You parry like what ? 5% of attacks ? Thats with 230 skill.<br />
Going to 240 or 250 wont get that 5% to 15%.<br />
At best you will get 5.5-6% ? <br />
And since going from 5% to 6% is very very small you can not<br />
be sure if you had a lucky parry or its the mod.<br />
<br />
Skill mod = Minimal effect. But its there.<br />
Its not much, like phantron said. but its better than not havint it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you assume chance to use special skill is just a linear function, then let's say you parry 5%, and you got a +5% parry mod.  That means you'll parry 5% X (1.05) better, which means you now parry 5.25%.  This is well within deviations just due to random chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kriegartorv</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont think its 5 % of your chance to parry... it's 5 % bonus to your current skill capped at 252... like all other + mod items...<br />
<br />
so skill at 240 + 5 % mod would give you 252... no idea how that effects your actual percentage of parrying...<br />
<br />
but .... everytime i go unconstious right before a heal... i just like to think my skill mods saved me... even tho they most likely didnt... =D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why I said I assumed it's just a linear function.  I.e. if 230 parry gets you 5%, then half of that (115) will get you 2.5%.  If you can somehow get to 460 parry, then you'd parry 10%.  This seems to be a fairly safe assumption since it's impossible to test it without someone being totally bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, so basically skill mods do nothing, SoE just ran out of stuff to put on loot so they started with the insignificant skill mods to make it look like the actually made the stuff worth wearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No they do something.  Without that mod that's an extra .25% avoidance that you wouldn't have.  And don't pretend it's not important because if next patch warrior parry went from say 230 to say 210 (about 10% decrease) you'll sure be complaining about being nerfed.  And yet you say you don't care if an item gives you parry +10%, and yet losing 10% suddenly hurts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haldin</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a nice thread on the PoN message board about this.  A couple people brought forth some interesting concepts.<br />
<br />
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2082.topic<br />
<br />
One of the most interesting posts in that thread was by Kether Am I.  Long story short, if skill rates improve linearly with skill level, a 10% dodge/parry/riposte mod equates to about 25-35 additional HPs.  Far from worthless, but far from amazing.</div></div><hr />
