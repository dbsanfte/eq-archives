<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ginara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello and thank you for your time.<br />
<br />
I'm currently the MT for a small family based guild on Brell..   We haven't done any major boss-mobs yet, mainly small things like the Chardok Royals, Priest/Guardians of Zek etc.  We're looking to start doing harder things and I'd like to get my weapon confusion out of the way so I've decided to come here.<br />
<br />
Here's what I have:<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Sword fo the Bloodsworn<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
Jagged Blade of War (Epic)<br />
   Blade of Strategy<br />
   Blade of Tactics<br />
War Marshels Bladed Staff<br />
<br />
I'm really confused about what I should be using and when.  Dual wielding seems faster using the CHoS and the SoTB, but i'm concerend that as a MT I'm doing it wrong, I've ready posts saying to use the GoT when MT'ing...  Can someone please shed some light on this topic for me and also maybe suggest some alternative weapons to what I already have?  I have about 100k in the bank so anything super-expensive is out of the question right now (BoC)  I have access to a Splitblade of Destruction also and am considing putting an Anger 2 aug on it.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dual Wield the CHoS/SoTB when tanking for aggro.<br />
<br />
When not tanking, use the WMBS for dps.<br />
<br />
Split blade of destruction is not worth a hate aug - hold out your hate augs for weapons with innate hate procs.  Honestly, CHoS would be more choice for a hate aug than spit blade of destruction - the ratio on SBoD is nice, but as far as aggro over time goes it sucks.<br />
<br />
After Droga quality weapons i would suggest saving your plat for gear.<br />
<br />
Depending upon how big and what lvls people in your guild are you might be able to pull off a bot towers raid.  Great Blade of Storms drops in the towers, and this would be a good upgrade that doesnt take more than  a pickup calibur raid to attain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The main reason folks talk about the Great Staff of thunder is that it's both decent aggro and unbelievably cheap. If you're lvl 56, dead broke, you have a weapon option that alows you to play the game. <br />
Your 1H weapons will generate a bit better aggro. Keep the GSoT around for nasty riposte mobs if you find they're giving you trouble (though you can also simply turn off autoattack on the two 1H weapons until a heal arrives).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>pisco_ssour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uhhh... how about Bow, BoC, and cord hilted spikedriver? my guild's MT uses the BoC and the spikedriver and i've never seen him lose agro other than when he dies, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm because he cant obtain a single one of those with his guild atm?<br />
<br />
they are doing epics and starting velious, hardly a chance for them to get a BoW, or the xana hammer, chances are it will be a while before he sees a dropped BoC too<br />
<br />
dude im using the copper hammer and fabled yak both with anger2 and i rarely have aggro issues, and when i do its usually not my fault :)</div></div><hr />

good point but he could always buy the BoC. Do some EF ldon for the anger augs. and i'm sure theres an open raid channel on his server ( i'm only saying this because 95% of the servers i've been on have them ) and from there he can get a xanamech hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Woojed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agian, He is from small guild, chances are he won't be able to afford a BoC.  Which are still upwards in the 350k line.  Best combos for him would be SotBS and CHoS.  Get some anger augs for them and you'll be set bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>pisco_ssour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ur right but if he were to do a few open raids he'd be able to get some pretty good gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Woojed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Open raids are a very fickle thing.  Usually people who are the raid organizer or their friends get the loot.  Which is kinda understanable since they put the raid together and allowed people to come and help.  Best bet for him would be to get his guild capable to raid BoT lords.  Clearing all 4 towers yield 8 pieces of lewt atleast and it takes about 2 to 3 hours once you get the stratigies down pat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats situational Pisco.He started out by saying a BOC was out of reach at this time.Perhaps the CSHD off of Xanamech in POI,or, GBOS from bot towers are  not too far away and could represent his next likely upgrades.<br />
<br />
I would tank with the CHOS and SOTB they did the job fine for me.Augs these days make a huge differance as well.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think by the time riposte is a real  issue for you when your raiding you'll have better weapons.Aggro on the droga pair will be better especially auged with wa aa and that is whats important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ginara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks everyone, pretty much confirms what I thinking.  BoC's go for about 400-700k on Brell, way out of my reach right now.  I'd like to get my guild started in on doing the Kael bosses (Vindi, statues, AoW) but i'm not sure we can do it.  We're going to try Vindi soon I think.<br />
<br />
I failed to mention, I'm 64 and will most likely be 65 tonight, I have pretty decent gear, some Ornate mixed in with droppables.<br />
<br />
Since augs will soon be removable, I think i'm going to buy the anger 2 aug and put it on my CHoS as suggested and use the Droga weaps for MT'ing (like i have been) and the WMBS for when DPS is needed.  Thanks again everyone for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Woojed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you ur gonna tank Vindi and such, Id work on ur hp a lil more.  Best thing would be to hit 65, and get ND3, that will bump up ur hps nicely.  Shoot for 7k to 8k buffed on Vindi, but this really depends on how many clerics you have able to be in a CH Rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ginara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fully buffed i'm at around 6800, going to work on getting those AA's as soon as I get 65 tonight and a little xp death buffer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok just a thought<br />
Anger 2 = 400ish hate<br />
and<br />
Stuns = 450ish<br />
<br />
then wouldn't a Yak aug be better PLUS you get the bonus of a wee boost in DPS to boot</div></div><hr />
