<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dxkj21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With riposte damage going up so much with high hitting mobs, should my wife be using a 2hs instead of dual wielding 1hs at the minimum delay?<br />
<br />
<br />
CHoS + SotBS vs Windblade.<br />
<br />
<br />
obviously way more aggro in the 1hs's but for the number of ripostes on mobs.. what say ye?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Riposte damage these days is generally a relatively small percentage of incoming damage, after the great riposte reduction of early PoP. Thus, it is not such a large  factor in choosing weapons. <br />
<br />
Look at it this way: Your warrior can take 10% extra damage. Or, your cleric / wizard can take 400% extra damage. Which is better for your group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whatever your wife wants to use!<br />
<br />
And don't buy a Windblade, it's an overpriced piece of crap. War Marshall's would provide equal DPS and probably better aggro for like......1/5th the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If she's the MT then yes stick with the 1 handers. If not go to the dps with the windblade. Riposte damage is nothing to lose sleep over. keeping aggro is key to group survival.<br />
<br />
That said, I use the old ugly stick with anger 3 aug. no problems with riposte or keeping aggro for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When im tanking, i either usually use a Copper Hammer with a Zek Crested Buckler.  The ZCB generates more agro than dual weilding, and it cuts down on ripostes.  The downside is that it does cut down on DPS, but how much im not sure because when i dual weild i use the CHoS and a Sword of the Bloodsworn, and i miss A LOT (due to soulscream belt and spell/song haste).  I miss much less when im using hammer and sheild.  So far i like the hammer and shield combo better, and it will be even better if i can get my hands on a Bloodfrenzy, BoC, or other anger weap for primary and a Stormrider Carapace (which has FB 4).<br />
<br />
When im not tanking, i use a Runed Lance of Gryme that i picked up from a grummus raid.  NICE weap, 32 dly 37 dmg with 3 disease dmg and nice stats.<br />
<br />
But its up to your wife for what she uses, although i agree with everyone else in NOT reccomending a 2hander for tanking, or a windblade.<br />
<br />
Check me magelo profile, its pretty accurate.</div></div><hr />

Ok cool. I guess I was overly worried about Ripostes now that we were tanking mobs that hit for a load.  Last night she went from 50% health to 20% quick on a series of random ripostes.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to knock it down.  Dual wielding anything in offhand will generate more aggro then a shield for a warrior.  FB has been broken for war's since i can remember.  Personally Dual Wield is the way to go. Ripostes everyone makes to much of a big deal over. If you parse them out, they're really not as high as you'd think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Really?  I guess it might be different for some people because i generally hold better agro with the shield...plus i can take agro back quickly if someone else takes it, the FB works even if bash misses.  Whatever floats your boat i guess :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Really?  I guess it might be different for some people because i generally hold better agro with the shield...plus i can take agro back quickly if someone else takes it, the FB works even if bash misses.  Whatever floats your boat i guess :cool:EQ code is the same for everyone. There is no way in hell that a shield generates anywhere near the amount of agro as a 2nd weapon, particularly one that has some sort of agro proc on it. Also, a little FYI - you don't miss a lot because of haste. You miss less when you equip your shield because you swing less. Your miss % stays the same however, so while you get more misses while dual weilding, you also get more hits. Not that it matters because agro is generated by potential damage done, not actual damage done so even a miss make the mob hate you a little more than before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess i learn something new every day lol.  Oh well, ill decide which i want to use eventually.  If i go with dual weilding again, i can sell my shield for more than i got it for most likely, i only paid 1500 for it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For MTing, go with your best weapons.  You can always get Slippery Attacks to nullify offhand riposte damage if you so choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Concerning ripostes: think of it this way. If the warrior uses max aggro weapons the fight will be shorter, because the dps folks in the group/raid can ramp up their damage. On a per mob basis, you might actually take fewer ripostes because the mob dies faster.<br />
Of course, the warrior takes no ripsostes at all if the mob is beating on the shaman, cleric, necro, etc. So, the ultimate in riposte reduction is not optimal. Go with the best aggro ya got.<br />
If you are aiming at a really scary mob--say one that has in fact splatted the warrior with ripostes--you could try something like a GSoT with a hate aug on it.<br />
Beyond that, it's time for the healers to see if they need to work out a bit different healing strat for the bigger mobs you're meeting.<br />
I don't mind getting healed at 20%. It's better than not getting healed, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Riposte damage really isn't that bad.  I was curious how much Slippery Attacks would reduce the amount of damage I take during a normal exp grind.  <br />
<br />
I found that I average ~2 offhand ripostes in an normal exp fight (parsed it with a 15/19 offhand) so it's not a significant amount of damage taken.<br />
<br />
Over time it adds up, but per fight, it's not that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
If you're really that worried about it, spend 15aa and get slippery attacks 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea i think im gonna stick with the CHoS/SotBS for tanking, but i will keep a FB shield on hand if i face a mob where ripostes are a huge problem, though that will be rare.  Though i think ill sell the zcb, i am short on cash atm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">CHoS + SotBS vs Windblade. <br />
<br />
I actually ran this exact parse somewhere during PoP, and they came out nearly equal on a 65 warrior.  Use what you prefer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you are worried about DPS, Aggro, and Ripostes in some combination have your wife try tanking with a Greatstaff of Thunder.  Your dps may go down slightly, but it generates decent aggro and 30 delay 2 hander shouldn't worry you much about ripostes.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I don't know what you are fighting, but it would seem odd to lose 30% of your health to a &quot;string of ripostes&quot;.  I could understand maybe 30% from one boss mob ripo in the EP's or not getting attack off before enrage, but I have never seen a mob do a string of ripos before.<br />

I will try to dig out the log... but i didnt make a note of it at the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
6k hps<br />
<br />
<br />
30% = 1800 hps<br />
<br />
mob hits for 544 max<br />
<br />
Soandso ripostes<br />
Soandso hits you for 544 damage<br />
Soandso hits you for 544 damage<br />
Soandso ripostes you for 500<br />

<br />
I think it probably just coincided with a nice double and a few non dodged hits. These guys are red to her so they dont mis a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I always liked 2handed agro. <br />
<br />
used Marshals blade .. Great staff of 4 winds .. now BoW, being main MA all the way into elementals.<br />
<br />
When I played around with weapon combos, to me it appeared, without considering procs, 2 handers give more agro then 1 hander.  The benefit of Duel wielding however is you can proc 50 %.</div></div><hr />
