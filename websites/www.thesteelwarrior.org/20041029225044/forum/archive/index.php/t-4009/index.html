<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is currently in VT farming mode (we just killed aten for the first time a few nights ago), and I'm in the market for a haste item, since, frankly, RBB just sucks at the point where we are.  I'm trying to keep my neck slot haste-free in an effort to end up with the aten neck, so other than the gorget that drops of TVX, what items are there to look forward to?  Off slot haste would be preferable.  ;) <br />
<br />
The stuff that comes to mind is Cord of Midnight, BP of speed (a long shot since I'm wearing erad), and MM belt.  Anything I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ever think about adding ldon 36 percent haste augment to face slot?<br />
<br />
If 36 percent makes you feel inferior(even though with buffs you would still be maxed), I would go with Cord of Midnight. It's low HP, only 85, but it's huge AC...35AC plus an additional 12 or so AC from the 50Agility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cloak of Black Winds from aten blobs is decent, 100hp 15ac tho. Your best bet in my opinion is probably the cord of midnight, unlike others here i'm not a big fan of BP of speed. Unless you're direly hard up for haste i'd rather have aten / seru in my chest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BP of Speed &amp; Cord of Midnight.<br />
<br />
Stay AWAY from black wind, while its a great overall cloack<br />
you will regret the shitty AC on the long run.<br />
<br />
AHR neck is great, but if u had to choose just 1 AHR loot<br />
go for the gloves, you will never see a better deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Need info about this augment pls. What dungeon theme and points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mistmore 1150 pts.  Its a type 3 so you will need to buy a LDoN item to mod.  A nice neck piece comes from Mistomore for 1492 pts...with mods you can make it approx Ac22 110hps with 36 pct haste...not VT lvl but not lousy either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty sure the usable slots for that augment are Head, Back, Waist and Range<br />
<br />
That being said I bought the Royal Attendent helm and was going to add the haste augment and 40 hp augment,<br />
<br />
Figures the same day I bought the helm we finally got a chance at VT due to the euros slacking that day and I looted the Cord of Midnight so I still got a decent helm out of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mmc 1150 Aug3 Gravestone Fragment of Flailing Dead<br />
Lore, Effect:Haste(worn)  War, Pal, Rng, Shd, Mnk, Brd, Rog, Bst Head, Back, Range, Waist <br />
<br />
Yes maam you are correct.  My mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">VT does have a lot of decent haste item drops, but most of them aren't on 100 hp items, which is kinda sad.  The chord of midnight I believe is quiet common since it drops off TVX.  TVX respawns in I think 3 days, there are two of them and they always drop 4 loots so you will probably see more chords than any other haste item out of VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Always 4 loots? You mean always 4 between the two of them. I never saw more than two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's 4 a piece. 8 loots between the 2 minis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shadow Footpads.<br />
<br />
They're no envenomed moccassins, but they're foot haste.<br />
<br />
AC 30, 65 HPs, 7 STA.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I was looking to upgrade from a cloak of flames and it was a nice addition.<br />
<br />
But then again, monk boots are all kind of eh until Ton Po's sandals, so it was easy for me to take what for a monk is a HUGE upgrade in AC and a really nice upgrade in HPs.<br />
<br />
Warrior boots are a tad heavier overall, so they might not be as good a choice.<br />
<br />
But I throw them into this thread since you asked, and no one mentioned them yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">4 each off bottom thalls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thanks guys.  I'd consider going for the haste aug, but I don't have that much time to run adventures outside of raiding and schoolwork, so all the time I can put in goes towards anger.  Seems like CoM is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Becker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cord of Midnight can also drop rarely off EoM's.  We have gotten a few that way.  Actually, we have seen more CoMs drop from the EoMs than bane weapons, heh.</div></div><hr />
