<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ballzo Steel</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another basic weapon question for you weapons aficionados.   The issue is more a matter of curiosity than anthing.  Btw, my warrior is lvl 61 and just starting to build AAs (6 atm).<br />
<br />
I've enjoyed the traditional CHoS and SotBS combo for some time now.  However, I've looked at the 20k price on the wind-worn handblade as compared to the 11k price (average prices at bazaar on Rodcet Nife) for the SotBS and thought the WWHB must have serious advantages over the SotBS.<br />
<br />
I've asked in OOC why the price difference.  Someone responded that the proc is better on the WWHB.   However, it appears that the reverse is true, the stun &amp; dd on the SotBS should create much more aggro than the 60 dd proc on the WWHB.  <br />
<br />
So if that is correct, the almost double price can only be because of the slightly better dps and stats on the WWHB.<br />
<br />
This week I saw the WWHB for sale at 15k, I couldn't resist.  I'm now using the CHoS (primary) and WWBH (secondary).  But I don't really see any difference, positive or negative, in my ability to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
With CHoS in primary, is the SotBS or WWBH better (more aggro) for the offhand?  If clearly SotBS, then I might as well pick up another SotBS next time they drop to 8k and sell the WWBH.<br />

CHoS+SotBS would be a better combo. Sell off that WWHB and switch it up for a SotBS<br />

<br />
The supply is higher, therefore the price is lower.</div></div><hr />

I paid 34k for mine and it was worth every copper.  Of course now they drop like candy and i have one priced for 275pp on my trader that hasnt sold in 2 days.  /shrug</div></div><hr />
