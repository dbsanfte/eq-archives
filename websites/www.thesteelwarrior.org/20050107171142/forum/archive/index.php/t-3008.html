<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, as the title says, I'm trying to find some DPS here. I'm level 65 with about 93 AA my offensive aa include combat fury 3, flurry 1, punishing blade 1, and tactical mastery 1.<br />
<br />
When using 1handers I generally use Great Blade of Storms in primary and Wicked Shank in my offhand. When using 2 handers it's kind of a toss up between my Twisted Steel Bastard Swoord, for pure damage, or my Greatstaff of the Four Winds for lesser damage, but greater speed and proc.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about trying to obtain primal, but that takes a bit of time and effort as my guild doesn't currently do ST or the Key mobs. I'm not even sure how much primal adds to DPS for that matter, so I'm wondering if it's worth it.<br />
<br />
I also considered working more on offensive AA, but... the role of a warrior is to take damage, not deal it... so I'd like to finish my defensive AAs first, yet I'm finding in LDoN if you don't have the DPS, you fail, simple as that.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would help me alot, thanks.</div></div><hr />

That seems high to me, but that is what I have always heard.</div></div><hr />

Yes it does, unfortunately Im at work and have no parses =/</div></div><hr />

Not by a flying mile does it.<br />
<br />
I have a Norge`Tal, same damage/delay as TSBS and a GSo4W and there is no comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have either one, but I find it very hard to believe that TSBS outdamages GSot4W.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff has better dmg/dly ratio, bet DB/delay ratio, and a DD proc.  It just doesn't add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, that was sorta my opinion too, but I don't have a 53/45 to compare to my GSo4W</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a GSo4W.  <br />
<br />
With Avatar, Bih`li, Spirit of Predator, Strength of Tunare (Hey, BSS isn't always available), and Speed of Vallon I push over 1600atk.  Against mobs in BoT, I usually do 85-95dps tanking and upwards of 110dps from the rear.  I have no idea how much the proc dps adds up, but I wouldn't imagine it would make up for more than 3-6dps at best.  I have no Offensive AA's.<br />
<br />
Btw, I use Yalp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll try to dig some parses, but from what I remember It does.  Recall bagging it because of crappy stats, not because of the dmg/dly ratio.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  the great staff proc was not included in my dps total since my parser doesn't add non-melee damage to my overall dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You sure you're not confusing GSo4W with GSoT? <br />
<br />
41/31 totally and utterly owns 53/45 by 10-15% in dps.<br />
<br />
Just do the math... <br />
<br />
41/31, damage bonus 36. Modal hit is 118.<br />
53/45, damage bonus 46. Modal his is 152.<br />
<br />
118/31 (3.81) &gt; 152/45 (3.38)<br />
<br />
<br />
I do around 100dps with Norge'Tal in well buffed exp groups and about 115 with GSo4W.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now you are making me doubt myself :P  Well, no matter what.. the stats and proc alone make the greatstaff superior regardless.  And 5 times easier to obtain.  Images of treking through ToV at 3am in the morning on a weeknight are still haunting me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, 152 a normal hit with TSBS? I often get 230+ and when I have nice attack buffs I see alot of swings ranging from 300 to almost 400 with crits at 530 I think? I seem to have to taunt less when I use my TSBS because I'm doing so much damage the mobs actually notice me. <br />
<br />
I don't really have much parsing to show any of this as I have yet to find a good parser. Can anyone suggest one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I banked my TSBS for the GSot4W.<br />
<br />
TSBS is great and with the 53 damage you really write some nice numbers ( 900+ crippling without disci ) but over all its not the damage of the GSot4W. <br />
<br />
The GSot4W is one of the best reachable great damageweapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gain An'Sydnor</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you duel wield ambidexterity is a sizable increase in dps ( i got around a 30% increase from it ).  If you primarily weild 2 handers then go with punishing blade.  In exp groups I average around 100dps and on raids im closer to 150dps.  My weapons combo can be seen in my magelo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30% dps increase from Ambi?  Ah....what are you main-handing?  A rusty short sword?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From reading other posts on offensive AA, it seems to me that Ferocity or Ambi or both will add some DPS.  Typically around 4-5% each.  I've read that Tactical Mastery 3 will add around 10% DPS, but only workable from the front.  Punishing Blade will also add nicely to DPS but only if you use 2hs. <br />
<br />
Personally, I've gone Fero3, CF3, Flurry3, TM1.  I'm going to finish up TM and probably pick up SE and FoTA.  Then I'll complete ID (yeahyeah, yell at me, I was bored stiff of defensive AA!) and finish up on Raging Flurry, Ambi and PB. <br />
<br />
I think Primal is worth your time if you don't have shaman buffs.  I didn't hear 20%, I heard 10% DPS increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks alot Vigdis that's the type of info I was looking for. Actually I just got an insane LDoN group and I plowed out 5 aa from midnight until about 10am, heh. So I'v enow got Ferocity 2 and I'm working towards 3 now. I'm also then finishing TM, but one thing though, I think the dps increase isn't just frontal. Because mobs can block parry or dodge from behind if I'm not mistaken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, you're mistaken.  Defensive abilities don't kick in from the rear.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Defensive abilities do affect attacks in about the front 180 or so degrees of a mob.  It's a larger radius than their attack arc, because you can be riposted, but the mob will be unable to hit you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">None of them? I could have sworn I was parried when I was attacking what looked like the rear of a monster before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep parry dodge work from the rear, even i parry dodge from the rear.<br />
<br />
edit: do to video lag chat box lag it sometimes appears that you or a npc defend from the rear. spent 2 hours letting a giant bat attack me from various angles. used various camra views to check angles. <br />
<br />
only defence took place took place on what visualy appeared slightly greater then the front half of the body. possibly due to old ogre size hit box position. i would say prolly 200 degree front arc. past that point everthing was a hit or miss.<br />
<br />
sorry if i misslead anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay we've got one person that says mobs do parry/dodge from the rear and one who says they don't. I'm really not able to check this much myself because for some stupid reason when I try to run around behind then and backstab with my wicked shank I always end up spinning the mob around. Stupid mobs, don't they understand woodelf warriors are damage dealers too? Bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following things help:<br />
<br />
Haste, Bard over haste, Attack, maxxed stats, all the offensive disciplines, Strike Through (so I hear - don't have it), a great DMG/DLY weapon, and positioning.<br />
<br />
At this time the best 2Hdrs crank out more damage than the best 1Hdrs. You might want to plan your AA accordingly.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what top numbers look like, but I've parsed 180 DPS+. I'm certain 220+ is possible. With the Y'Kesha augmentation (or another unknown augmentation) I'm sure 240+ can happen.<br />
