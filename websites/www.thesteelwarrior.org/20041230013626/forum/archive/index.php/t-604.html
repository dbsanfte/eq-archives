<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krunt</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=196388) <br />
<br />
Getting a Bloodmetal earring soon (now that prices are dopping like mad) to replace the spider fang.  <br />
<br />
Also im going to be giving one of the valor rings back to my guild when i get the 9th coldain ring later.  Will be a small hp drop but someone else can make use of it and I won't have to keep subing one out for the click.<br />
<br />
Other then that I think i will try and pick up a heavy rubicite girdle and sell the turtle belt.  The regen and atk is nice, but I could use the ac hp on the rubi belt.<br />
<br />
Haste wise I am also going to either get a Cowl of morality or a CoF, if I get the cowl I will but a hierophiants cloak on. (its in my bank)<br />
<br />
Shoulders I will improve when I can.... maybe do the strength of the elments quest or some of those War only shoulders from tier 3 (forged or something)<br />
<br />
Lastly the bracer of fortitude.  I can put in another brellium bracer but i loose about 58 hp (before sta buffs) for the 21 ac gain.  I don't know if its worth it yet.  Maybe a bracer of benovolance or somehting to meet half way? <br />
<br />
What do you guys think.  Sound like a good plan or am i missing an easy upgrade?  My guild is HoT level and it is realy realy hard to find a named up on our server.  We do manage to spend allot of time in CT though.  So any mobs that you can think of that a guild working through HoT can deal with that I may want to ask to raid?  <br />
<br />
Ignore the weapons, i use the tae ew when i can but go to the frosty combo if i am not holding agro, going to get EB from some mob some day.....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Basically just looking for someone to tell me im on the right track or not.  For some reason i feel that my AC is too low.  Only buffs up to 1230 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do either Dragon or Giant quest armor.  That will help your AC.<br />
<br />
If you do dragon faction:  get BoB and Draconic Paulderons<br />
<br />
If you do Giant faction:  colar of the storms<br />
<br />
if you are in a guild that can raid NToV, there are more upgrades there.</div></div><hr />

It took me about 30 mins to do with a cleric, druid, and ranger friend of mine.  Pretty good shoulder item for the time invested imo.</div></div><hr />
