<br />
<br />
This kinda came up a few weeks ago.. knights can decide whether they take tank gear with AC HP and mods or gear with sweet focus effects, which sounds fairly reasonable.<br />
<br />
But now loot like this drops<br />
http://www.amentaguild.com/images/godloot018.jpg<br />
<br />
the opinion of a warrior in my guild on these is<br />
[Sun Mar 21 21:11:13 2004] Doden tells you, 'Sick legs for sk's'<br />
[Sun Mar 21 21:11:19 2004] Doden tells you, 'Just good ones for war!'<br />
<br />
can't really disagree here?</div></div><hr />

Certainly no one has ever felt guilty for taking a +endurance item so I don't see why a warrior should feel guilty about taking items with Fury of Solusek.<br />
<br />
I mean it's not like you're taking the Burning Magic ring in Ikkinz raid 1 or anything like that.  Fury of Solusek is a good but it's also a pretty staple focus effect.  <br />
<br />
So this leg has a good focus effect, maybe the next upgrade one won't have it.  Who knows?</div></div><hr />

As for the mana that warriors cannot use. When exactly does a paladin gain from endurance?<br />

I do agree SKs would get the best of both worlds from these though.</div></div><hr />

Well, it's pretty clear if Knightimization is going to continue the widening of the survivability gap between Warriors and Knights occured just in the nick of time.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness they don't have any piece of Defensive. Guilds just entering PoTime could find fully MT capable and flagged Knight transfers from busy server more than willing to make their services available. <br />

You really need to stop being a complete putz. Assuming that's even possible in your case. <br />
<br />
The fucking things drop in Ikk where hmmm last time I READ you keep pointing out are the areas knights CANNOT tank. Or do you think warriors are going to tank them, then drag a pally to loot it over them? Oh, and what exactly will prevent guilds from enlisting fully GoD decked warriors from other servers to their guilds to replace their gear lagging behind knights? <br />

The point dork, is that it's not like paladins are going to go solo the fucking things. Oh wait, they also drop in higher end GoD where a warrior not even in PoTime gear has a better chance of tanking the mob then a fully PoTime geared paladin.</div></div><hr />

Warriors have not and will not forget their tanking advantage was so narrow not too long ago that end-expansion Knights could MT all of PoTime. Now feel free to point out, so could &lt;insert other class here&gt;. I'll feel free to point out Knights have been asking for half-Defensive and a Plate wearer's mitigation bonus (which I have agreed ought to happen).<br />

PoTime+ quality gear plus half-Defensive and a Plate wearer's mitigation bonus could in fact find some PoTime Warriors displaced as MT's in PoTime.<br />

<br />
I agree with the statement above. But want to add to it.<br />
<br />
Think back, to when you were a complete newbie. Remember how amazing it felt to get that first piece of stat loot? Like Agility +1, or STR + 3 or something?<br />
<br />
Remember how amazing it felt to get a magic weapon to hit zombies and the like?<br />
<br />
Well these days, you're looking at AC 70 pants with way over 100 hit points.<br />
<br />
Stats are gaudy and meaningless today. (I've said this in a different thread, it's sort of my mantra lately). <br />
<br />
I just look at the new gear coming out of Gates or whatever, and it just seems like it's trying to squeeze just another inch of toothpaste out of that tube of Everquest. And it's not doing a very good job of it. With everything as maxxed as it is, and as insanely overdone as it is ... I dunno ... I just can't get thrilled about yet another tiny upgrade to hit points even if a shadowknight might get a small DPS boost from the same item.<br />

What the fuck kind of rebuttal is that?  Warriors can solo themselves a Raex BP now?  Take a debate course or something, soloing has nothing to do with anything.  Furthermore, there has ALWAYS been knight gear on mobs that knights couldn't tank first time around.  Hello Ssra?  <br />
<br />
I'm still just completely boggled that you think knights should tank the same as warriors and that justifies the fact that their gear is better than ours.</div></div><hr />

Just because YOU are not going to see them (and 7 months for FRo is really slow progression) they can be totally out of whack?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact of the matter is you COULD use &lt;insert other class here&gt; to do the same thing. Also realize that it didn't mean that warriors were not MT'ing those mobs anymore. The ONLY way this was achievable is because you could get the resources there to heal the non warrior tank. This is not the case when content is limited to 6 ppl. <br />

In other words, is the issue that you want to see more gear which is wearable by all which focuses on improved melee specific stats/effects while either penalizing or neglecting casting specific stats/effects, in essence requiring knights (well, hybrids in general) to make a choice on their area of focus?<br />
<br />
I agree that'd be cool, if that's your aim.  <br />
<br />
I see the proliferation of War/Monk/Rog/Ber gear as a significantly bigger issue in GoD than anything else, as in order to prevent the less tanking oriented melee classes from receiving an overabundance of certain things, they've in essence made the gear for the most part, completely undesirable for warriors.</div></div><hr />

Those legs drop in the Ikkinz RAIDS, no the single group trials, where a Knight could tank everything.  However, the last few days the raid mini-bosses have been getting beefed up (who didn't see that coming?  They were too easy...), making it harder for Knights to pull that off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're a fucknut.  No one could one group anything in Ssra when it came out.  That's called a valid comparison.  GoD when it came out = Luclin when it came out.  I'm not talking about a mudflated group killing 3 expansion old shit dumbass.  You're saying that knights can't tank anything now, I'm telling you that they never could tank anything the first run thru.  Now how about you try to follow the train of thought here and desist with the mental Amtrak incident you're displaying here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He was speaking of the bosses in the zone that dropped the loot. I was reflecting that the comparison was idiotic because they're not 1 groupable which allowed for both warriors and knights to be there at the same time to have access to loot.<br />

So in other words both warriors and knights will have access to them at the same time. Yeah, I can see warriors passing on them so a sk can get it. :)</div></div><hr />

ok SK and War in same guild know e. other IRL. the War is 150pds, the SK 200 (assuming thats not coming from body fat)<br />

THIS is why I said from the start  to STOP combining paladins and sks within the SAME group. IE: I can't USE the effect either therefore I'd use them for the SAME reason you would.<br />
<br />
Oh and Partha, you can go take a flying leap off the EW bridge if you're implying you'd pass on the 25atk + 5hp regen EFFECT on the legs BECAUSE it also has a % to DD dmg. Sure, huh huh, yeah ok. BTW. How many BoWs did the warriors in your guild get prior to ANY knight (sk or pal) have a chance to bid on them.<br />

<br />
<br />
Let's see. Effect is +30% to DD spells. Last I checked stuns weren't a DD. And even if it did affect stuns, you honestly believe I'm going to start chain casting QWoS for an extra 30dmg at the cost of 1/4 bub of mana per cast? <br />
<br />
As for our undead DD's,  just like my live DD the value of my undead DD doesn't come CLOSE in damage to me actually swinging my sword, so no, I wouldn't use the effect.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to play the *just cause you'll never use it doesn't mean you don't have it* game. Might as well just not reply.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I'm saying if you work by loot council, the loot council will more than likely award to a guild SK because of the focus effect. I'm also saying if you work by DKP, that the guild SK's will bid more than the Warriors will unless the Warriors in question have a LOT of points built up and are REALLY hard up for legs. It's NOT very likely.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is, but its not that bad when you consider we had to reform the guild twice, are on our 3rd guild leader (last one left to form his on guild), and have been competeing w/ 6 othe ele guilds, and the 4 other time guilds for the god pop.<br />
<br />
So if they dropped the focus effect they would be better as they wouldnt be &quot;knightemizated&quot;?  In my guild these would go to a war as an upgrade first over an SK (unless said SK was wearing something like Cultural as an example).  High HP items go to get the wars the most HPs for their job.  I understand that and agree w/ it.</div></div><hr />

Sorry. I've been trying to turn over a new leaf lately. Less flames. More coherent content.<br />

:-)<br />
<br />
&quot;well guess what, I'm still enjoying GoD and wiping in Ikkinz!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's cool. I'm sure it's a good expansion. It was just a tiny straw on my camel hump of EQ-ness. It just happened to be the last one for me. I bet if things were different for me, I'd probably enjoy the expansion too. The carrot chase just finally got to me. It gets to everyone eventually. I'm no different.</div></div><hr />

I'm saying if you work by loot council, the loot council will more than likely award to a guild SK because of the focus effect. I'm also saying if you work by DKP, that the guild SK's will bid more than the Warriors will unless the Warriors in question have a LOT of points built up and are REALLY hard up for legs. It's NOT very likely.<br />
<br />
Hard up for legs? You're kidding right?<br />

arent you the SK that prefers doing dps over tanking anyways ? =P  <br />
<br />
Yippers.  Pulling and tanking get....not boring but to much of a rut every so often.  I'd drop my ornate pants for those in less then a heartbeat given 1/2 the chance too :D</div></div><hr />

Yes it is, but its not that bad when you consider we had to reform the guild twice, are on our 3rd guild leader (last one left to form his on guild), and have been competeing w/ 6 othe ele guilds, and the 4 other time guilds for the god pop.  <br />
<br />
Thats SOE's fault and verant before that. This game has set players against each other to slow progression. EVERY PoP encounter AND Plane of Time could be instanced. To slow people they could flag you so you can only do it say once a week. But they aren't! World of Warcraft hopefully will be different. I am a beta tester for another new game coming out, I am still leveling, will see if they get it right, but I WILL suggest they do that!<br />
SKs are a DPS class, and darn nice to have in a group, even if you have a Warrior tanking. I will go find casters to pull for the SK to tap mana for the group. That is if I am allowed to pull, I mean train the group. If Paladins get even a partial defensive I want a pulling tool! Then they could make our healing discs they we got and didn't ask for work WHILE fighting also!<br />

Think back to PoP, 2 sets of class armor, the better set of it was only the 2nd best in the expansion. why will it be any different for GoD?</div></div><hr />

you're in the same guild as Lejina? No surprise you didnt get many CT legs yet, seeing how little time you spent in potime so far, and since when are resists an issue ? Just get a bloody bard in the MT group.</div></div><hr />
