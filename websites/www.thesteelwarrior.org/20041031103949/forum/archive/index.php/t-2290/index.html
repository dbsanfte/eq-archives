 Sick and tired of loosing agro to ranger  sk and pally's   was told by many people to get the windbalde  2hs  be cause it was a good agro weapon   but  now that I have been using it for some time  am finding it is not so good  and now  need to upgrade once again...     I was wondering thru  bazaar and web sites  finding weps..   and noticed  the copper hammer  of striking and sword of the bloodsworn  was  wondering if these are  good warrior  agro holding weps  or  if another combo would be beter..  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't comment on the Hammer/Sword combo even though I'm tryin myself to get my hands on those.  I would suggest getting a Greatstaff of Thunder for the moment.  Can sell your Windblade get a Greatstaff and still have money left over.  I used to love my Windblade until I couldn't hold agro in HoH/BoT with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes. Get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">GSoT, Copper Hammer of Striking/Sword of the Bloodsworn seem to be the pre-Taunting Blow/Enraging Blow sweetspot.... good DPS+awesome aggro(well, the GSoT for me has been shit, but i am still working on it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where does the Hammer drop and the Bloodsworn as well..??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Both drop in Droga, Copper Hammer is from the King, from what i hear an uncommon spawn.  The sword fo the Blood Sword is near the king, coming from the earthseer guy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everything you need to know about getting a hammer and a sword. (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2185)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">got a similar question, and thought i'd put it here to not clutter up the baord witha nother equipment post.<br />
<br />
Okay, I'm a 58 warrior in a small &quot;family&quot; guild.  I've been away for awhile, so I'm not up to speed on the current weapons.<br />
<br />
I have a frostbringer, wavecrasher, and bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
The wavecrasher is main hand only, which is annoying.  I was going to sell the frosty and the crasher and by a GsoT (along with some other upgrades).  That make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">except that wont work cause the gsot is 2hb.<br />
<br />
rats.<br />
<br />
probably gonna equip the bloodsworn and frosty until I get a copper hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can probably sell the Windblade and pick up a GoT and War Marshal's.  Use the GoT for aggro and WMBS for dps.<br />
<br />
Ash, I'd say keep the blood/frosty combo and sell wc.  Try to get a hammer or GoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless you have an assload of money and can afford SoD+BoC, then the best 1h agro combo you are going to get is CHoS+SoB and for 2h get a GSoT. Both combos are awesome agro with pretty good DPS. If this is SOEs answer to the warrior taunt problem, it's lame they are bandaiding it with equipment, but at least it works.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, FYI - IF you can get into BoT, don't buy a GSoT just camp it. They are super common, you should get one in a few hours. If you are level 55+ then don't buy hammer+sword, the camp is easy and the drops are not that uncommon, one night camping should get you both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sell the WC and FB if you have to and get a GoT and WMBS, you should be able to get both for 20k or less (at least on CT). This will take care of you agro and non-agro weapon needs.  Then camp the King for the Cooper and Blood.   This is the weapons set I use and have not had my Red and Blue out in a long time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks all for the advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If prices on your server are anything like they are on mine, you can sell your Windblade, buy a GSoT, and have about 45K leftover. :)  For some reason GSOT goes for 4k or less on Innoruuk, but Windblade still goes for 30-50k; I suppose it's because Windblade is somewhat better DPS and usable by more classes.</div></div><hr />
