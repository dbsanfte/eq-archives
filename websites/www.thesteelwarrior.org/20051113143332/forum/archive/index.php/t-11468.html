<br />
So, what race would you pick for an alliance warrior and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">04-28-2005, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnomes look cool and have escape artist which is nice. Night Elves have shadowmeld, which is also nice. I think they also have +dodge. Humans are boring and their abilities aren't the greatest imo. Not even sure what Dwarf abilities are, but they look good.<br />
<br />
In the end, it won't make much of a difference which race you are. You should just go by whichever race you think looks the best. But, Night Elf racial abilities are probably the best if you really want to go by that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">04-28-2005, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dwarves have bonuses to guns and can find chests like miners can find deposits.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I agree, Alliance racial bonuses are nice but nothing is overpowering. I'm a fan of Tauren HP bonus and War Stomp, but yah that's Horde.</div></div><hr />

Being that darned small has to be an advantage in PVP. Short grass and the disappear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stylzz</div><div class="date">04-29-2005, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">+ 10 frost resists (for dwarf that is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">04-29-2005, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a gnome warrior, he's lvl 40 now, and is weilding the Whirlwind axe...which is like twice the size of him :) Gnome warriors are cool, and the escape artist skill has saved my butt a few times, also confuses casters who think they rooted you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-03-2005, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Human is not bad.  +5 swords is almost useless since most Arms warriors will go axe.  If they ever come out with a obtainable slow endgame sword comaprable to reaper though, I would go sword spec.  Human perception can come in handy and lets you get some charges off on unsuspecting rogues at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-03-2005, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are on a pvp server NE's shadowmeld is pretty nice.  It's saved my bacon a bunch of times.  Its good for setting up ambushes as well, they get charged outta no where all of a sudden.  That and it's good for duels too.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I would just pick the race that looks better.  If you are a min/max type of person then taurens are the winner, but not by a lot.  Search around for pics of each class in full plate, check out their mounts, and then make a decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-03-2005, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RoboChicken is too cool for words.<br />
<br />
In discussing racials, undead have 2 good ones--will of the forsaken to break fears and I understand on PVP servers underwater hunting is popular to avoid ganking. While not unlimited time, undead don't breath very much either.<br />
<br />
Skeletal horses FTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thengel</div><div class="date">05-03-2005, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warstomp is absolutely godly in pvp.  Nothing better than trashing a Tauren Warrior until he uses warstomp and completely turns the battle around.<br />
<br />
Shadowmeld is nice for ambushing, but you have to stand still to use it.  Gnome's escape artist is probably the best racial for any alliance warriors, but alas, you have to be a gnome to use it.  I'm a dwarf simply because in my opinion they look the best.  Stoneform is really nice for places like the plaguelands since it breaks all bleed/disease/poison and there is a lot of it up there.  The +armor really adds so little it's not noticable.</div></div><hr />
