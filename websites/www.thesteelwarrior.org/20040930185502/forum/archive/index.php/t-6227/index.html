<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Myself and my normal group of friends are now Sol Ro flagged. Are there any good exp camps there that you recommend? Is it better exp than chain pulling in the Tactics pit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go up the left stairs, and into the very far left tower.<br />
<br />
Bunch of mephit and rock things.<br />
<br />
Low HP, low DPS.<br />
<br />
I three box there alot.<br />
<br />
With Pacify, it's easy single pulls, and the caves go pretty deep.<br />
<br />
Only thing I don't like is the long respawn of Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
It's lined my pockets well though. 275k in 3 days owns.<br />
<br />
a pumice collector spawns there, can be sorta rough if he catches you offguard.<br />
<br />
Hits little harder i think, but dispells and slows and has a wicked stun that hit my cleric. He's also a little more resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes sol ro is better xp than tactics. Once you are ready to roll go up the left stairs, clear you way up. once you are up those stairs you fill face a huge room. Pull the 2 mobs up the very fisrt stairs you see on your left upon entering the room. Go up those stairs and you will be at a fork, either go straight or go left. Go left, clear mobs and go all the way up that narrow alley. 2 more mobs are at the end of the narrowed path. Once dead open the door click on the torch and you will be ported in a room preceding some caves. Pull to that room then move up some as you want. Mobs arent lvl 65 anymore in the caves but they die way faster than the flamming ones.<br />
-ANY mob can drop ANY ornate but chest piece. Yes legs do drop.<br />
-There is NO zone out.<br />
-Mobs before porting into the caves have HUGE aggro range.<br />
<br />
If you have anymore questions feel free to post :)<br />
Hope that helps<br />
<br />
ohhh and there are way less noobs in Sol ro to train you than there is in Tactics too.</div></div><hr />

Not true!<br />
<br />
Too many guilds in Sol Ro now, to say that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the fact is that I can use a lfg tool and get a sol ro group together is actually disappointing hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Were in the hell do they train to ? Not like there is a Zone out or anything. unless you mean Train as in I want your camp train and I have agro let me run to this group train</div></div><hr />

When noobies panic, they run, its what they've been accustomed to for 65 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With a skilled FD puller, you could take a single group into any of the 5 wings.  If you do that, just be prepared to reach spots you can't beat, and either turn back or gate out.  But for efficient XP, you will want to camp either the 5-staircase area killing guards, or else the far left wing (Xuzl caves) as mentioned above.  The Xuzl wing could be called Sol D, it is easy and fun, and the worst thing that can happen is that another group is already camping it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
xuzl tower can support 1-2 full groups, depending on their dps.</div></div><hr />

heh... they don't even have to run in solro to train you.  The mob's assist ranges are generally large enough that if you are pulling the right stairs and a group doing the left stairs wipes you are likely to inherit their pull.<br />
<br />
An Aside... Jiva's tower (staight up the center stairs) is a pretty fun romp too.  Couple of name with some drops (one of them at least NOT nodrop) and a pretty easy set of pulls to do.  <br />
<br />
Couple of Red non-named along the way which aren't too bad, and a red and yellow pair of wyvs that like to AE but are still are wimps.  <br />
<br />
Good place to go when Xuzl's tower is camped (mephit caves)</div></div><hr />
