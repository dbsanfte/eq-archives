<br />
I just completed my first successful oow groupage, and find myself the surprised owner of a lesser muramite rune.  why do I want this stupid thing?  i thought runes were for casters, the pale skinny fellas in the dresses.  What skills can i earn with the lesser, minor, and muramite runes (no expectation of earning the 69, 70 runes as yet, and 3 months till i even need em im sure)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the advice and knowledge, Im wondering if i should hasten my rise to 66 to utilize this goofy thing or just hang onto or sell it for any upgrades i might need.<br />

<br />
We get the following abilities for the rune turn-ins:<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 66 (Minor Muramite Rune) - Aura of Runes Discipline<br />
Level 67 (Lesser Muramite Rune) - No Ability Gained<br />
Level 68 (Muramite Rune) - Savage Onslaught Discipline<br />
Level 69 (Greater Muramite Rune) - Bazu Bellow<br />
Level 70 (Glowing Muramite Rune) - Shocking Defense Discipline</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is Aura of runes (and leveling to 66) worth losing any meaningful experience gain in any non OOW/GOD zones in EQ (as 66 is reputed to do)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, gotten numerous runes and sold em all or gave them to guildies, except of course the one 69 rune i won. Much &lt;3 for bazu bellow. Seriously, arrow + bellow on pull is more than enough aggro to keep slowers safe, and a few procs locks down aggro nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i got bazu bellow, which is great, and aura of runes which is nice to use in a long fight after defensive wears off. not really been fussed about the rest, better to let your caster friends fill out their spell books first imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the only disc we get worth anything is bellow at 69, wait on the rest till the group doesn't need them then you can grab. They are pretty worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breako</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like a little clarification on what exactly the Level 70 (Glowing Muramite Rune) - Shocking Defense Discipline dose. I don't quite understand what its effect is. <br />
<br />
So if one that have this Disc can kinda put it in lammins terms for me i would greatly appriciate it. <br />
<br />
Sorry if this sounds like a retarded question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For shocking defense, whenever you get hit, there's a chance you proc a stun that stuns either up to level 71 or 72.  But if the mob's already slowed, the length of the stun (3 seconds I think) is about as long as it'd take them to get another round ready anyway.  It's not clear if it stops a round (i.e. mob gets stunned on his first out of 4 hits, does the next 3 hits still happen?), but if it does it'd at least mitigate some damage.<br />
<br />
Realistically I have never found any use for it besides wasting endurance.  Maybe you can pull 20 green mobs and sort of chain stun them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't suppose that stun adds any hate does it?<br />
<br />
Also only reason to get aura runes is to use killing mobs like in DS or on raids if you don't have a clicky proc item. The rune effect overwrites stuff like the AHR gloves and VT orb of sky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Helped just enough on a few quick multi named pulls, and having used other discs early. 66 cleric goes near oom and Aura helps enough for shammy to do the trick.<br />
<br />
I'm happy with it. It has its uses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
really other than the 69, they're wasted.  <br />
<br />
*************<br />
<br />
regarding going to level 66.  Level &gt;&gt; all, But. <br />
<br />
If you are in a guild with the majority of folks below 60, if you don't have gear that is high end luclin, if you don't want to hunt eplanes, Ferubi, sewers / mts, KT, and most of OoW regularly, then you're gonna have problems with exp. gain. <br />
<br />
But mostly, after grinding to 70, I've had fun with it. <br />

Sometimes you're caught with your primary defense/offense disc down with extra endurance and something is better than nothing because if you die, all that endurance isn't going to do any good anyway.<br />
<br />
Shocking Defense, however, I haven't been able to find any use for it at all.  I don't know if the stuns add hate because it's rare to get any stuns to proc at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how is its proc rate up to you ?<br />
 * is it dependent on mob's haste or is it constant ?<br />
 * is it the standard 2ppm or is it more ?<br />
 * do you think that CE has an influence on it ?<br />
 * bla bla bla ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I had to guess I'd say it's a standard procrate, but it's kinda hard to test.  So on average 1-3 400 point runes per disc.  Not exactly game breaking.   They aren't useless, but in a guild/friends group I wouldn't take anything but a 69 over your caster buddies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was speaking about shocking defence not Aura of Rune ... but thanks Brutul</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gask</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have all of them but our 66th and Ive been rather unhappy with them all save bazu bellow, the defensive discs all seem like downgrades to stonewall imo save that you can move around easier.  And savage onslought is just sad, id rather use mighty strike or fellstrike over it any day.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm shocking defense stunning multiple targets? It seems like it only effects the mob you are currently attacking to me.  Also does the rune disc stack with rune3 and does it add a bit of aggro in itself? Only then would it have some merrit id think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 66/68 discs are for when your primary def/off is down.  They're not meant to be an upgrade over the existing ones.</div></div><hr />

How do you trade runes?<br />
<br />
69 rune is no drop correct?</div></div><hr />

<br />
most people carry the droppable ones ones around so when  NO DROP one, err..., drops in a group, tehy can offer the winner multiple lower runes for loot rights on the higher rune. Bugs the hell out of me, but thats what they do. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikotine</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bazu is great for warriors! the aura of runes is also a great addition once the stonewall/defensive is down.  Good secondary disciplines but not to be confused with primary desciplines.</div></div><hr />
