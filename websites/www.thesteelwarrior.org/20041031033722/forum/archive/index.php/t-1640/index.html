<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I've reached the end of my bank plat limit on the amount of items I can buy.  It gotten to the point now that it seems like I have to spend thousands of plat to upgrade my gear, and its only a small upgrade.<br />
<br />
I'm talking droppable or MQ'able stuff atm.  BoC, SoD, Boots of the Storm, Zek Helm all costs mucho money and are nice upgrades . . . But I dont foresee me getting them anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Have about 55k in the bank and gonna use most of it to get the GSoT again.  After that Im really outta cash and it seems like Im stuck.<br />
<br />
Where do I go from here?<br />
<br />
[Should I just lvl and raid whenever I can to get items piece by piece?  Seems like Im at the end of the road unless I start making a lot of plat somehow or raid 5 nights a week]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only upgrade you seriously need is levels.  Over 4k hps  and 1200AC pre 60 without AA's is more than sufficient.  Better gear will come but you will be hard pressed to find it.  Finish your epic and level is the best advice I can give you.</div></div><hr />
