<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Upcoming for August 6th, 2003<br />
It's been a little hectic around here lately, with all the Live, Legends and expansion work going on. We're busy in that good way, where you get a lot done every day but tomorrow there's just as much to do.<br />
<br />
New adventure unearthed in Lavastorm! In the depths of the Lavastorm mountains there is only one ruler. But even his burning breath and power have their limits. Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach. These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden. Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value. Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself. But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted. Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<br />
<br />
We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank. In order to allow folks to transfer money between characters on the same account in the same way that they can now transfer items, we will be adding a spot in the Shared Bank for placing platinum. <br />
<br />
New filters and chat message options will be added. We have separated pet melee messages into their own category. You will be able to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the Options window. We have also added the ability to send /random messages to any chat window you'd like. There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, you can't claim that you didn't see the /random that you lost just to force a re-roll).<br />
<br />
New fletching recipes will be added. We're adding a few new fletching recipes. The resultant items will only be usable by Rangers that worship Karana, and will be comparable to their Tunare counterparts.<br />
<br />
Guktan Illusion will be implemented. Yup, the long-awaited new illusions will be available. While the old Illusion: Froglok spell is just as popular as ever, folks have been asking for an illusion based on the new Froglok models. After our next update, both will be available.<br />
<br />
Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal. Four new summoned items with the new Burning Affliction focus ability will be introduced. This rounds out the Magician's ability to create summoned focus items.<br />
<br />
/memspellset command will be added. This new command will allow you to memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from the command line or from a hot button.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br />

EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml<br />

In some of the new zones, there are decent new agro weapons for the mid-tier guild warriors. So someone there is making something that helps. But that alone is not enough.</div></div><hr />

Hey on the plus side the copper hammer and sword of the blood sworn were added...and they are very good for 1 groupable (if all are 60ish) weapons. Certantly in the same legue as WS. And  consider one of them procs planer strike.<br />
<br />
Add to that the dagger bard/rogue dagger with vengance on it and I think, maybe someone is getting a clue. Slowly. <br />
<br />
One of these days they will realize that magic getting more powerful means that melee needs between 1.5 and 2 times the increase of any other class (other than maybe wizards who are the only other 'pure' class).</div></div><hr />

Is this a joke? What do you expect them to do? Listen to Level 52 Warrior with zero aa and 22 days played? I'm sorry but they need to listen to the &quot;big dick #1 guild&quot; because the &quot;big dick #1 guild&quot; knows what the fuck is wrong with the warrior class.<br />
<br />
I don't get it. Do you pretend to know more than some of us who have been playing EQ for over 5 years? Who have seen the tides change repeatedly in and out of our favor?<br />
<br />
The issues of the Warrior class have been beaten into the fucking ground from as you say the &quot;big dick #1 guild&quot; to the dumbass who is still endorsing Beg as a viable way to taunt. From all of the threads I've read, the top/end/old game warriors generally agree on the issues. The same issues that have crippled a lot of the game that they don't even participate in anymore (the LFG War syndrome) et al... That is to say, they are on your side and whatever 'dickslappin' you see going around is a made up illusion in your own disgruntled little mind.<br />
<br />
This is a class board, and just like any class board it has its fair share of dumbfucks. And just like any class board, those dumbfucks are generally the newbies/people with the least amount of experience playing the class and the game. That's life guy, deal with it....<br />
<br />
As a whole, the older warriors are probably the best group of players around. They freely and willingly answer questions and often times start thought provoking threads. Try going around to the other class forums and reading the crap flung around on them - i.e. monks, sks, rangers, etc...<br />
<br />
In short, have a little respect. It's not our fault that Sony designers are completely incompetent and thoroughly corrupt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever read a damn thing I've posted about warriors? I didn't say you don't have a right to voice. I say our voices are diluted because of the mass of know-nothing shits who seem to have personal vendettas out against every single group who ever denied them a spot or replaced them with a PAL/SK. <br />
<br />
I am an advocate if not the #1 advocate for warrior change, especially in the low - mid level game. That's my stance and has been my stance for quite a long time. Sure the high end game could use some work to make us more mutli-dimensional but my main focus is on those very people who are bitter and disillusioned with the class in the lower ranks. When most of the people here didn't even know what the fuck a Warrior was in EQ, I was sending off letter after letter to the EQ Devs to get Rubicite removed from CT entirely and to get WAR specific armor put in the game (Crafted). This was before Planes, before 5 expansions. I assure you that in the early days being a Warrior was 100x worse than it is now - some of us don't forget shit like that... <br />
<br />
The point I'm trying to make is that 'uber hate' generated by a lot of you is unfounded and TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR CAUSE. <br />
<br />
End of rant...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Geez, and people wonder why I hate lots of the uber people....<br />
<br />
Just because someone plays the high end game of EQ doesn't mean they've been around awhile. They never saw a warrior without innate critical hits, a hp bonus or innate MR. Most of them never played a warrior fiending for lustrous russet when we had no class armor of our own. Many of them are just as short sighted as a lot of the people Furor's talking about. <br />
<br />
Most of the warriors I talk to on a daily basis are old school. They remember the issues we've had for the past 5 years and know what will and will not work in Everquest. Guess what? They want warriors fixed from the ground up. They aren't so short sighted to only live in their worlds.<br />
<br />
Say what you will - but i guarantee you my perspective on the overall game is greater than Joe the level 54 warrior who's upset he can't solo velks as fast as his necro friend. You have to remember we didn't login one day and become level 65 and at the point in the game we are. We worked to get here (most of us). Stop pretending like we don't give a fuck, if anything it's the naive low level whiners who couldn't care less about our concerns. We've all been there, and we haven't forgotten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*squints at raaj*<br />

I don't remember lusting after lustrous russet armor. To my recolection, Crafted was the frist of the quest armors in the game, and came as a huge relieif as I would not to either get lucky and actually LOOT som Rubi, or but the Steel plate (which at least looked awesom on barbies).<br />
<br />
As for uber hate, I have never had it, though, I can see how it come about though warrior twinks of ubers from other classes (who don't have to usually do things the hard way).  I have rarely felt that the ubers have dround us out. <br />
<br />
I remember protesting because warriors had nothing unique and VI adding beserk (and some HP) as part of the patch. Don't know how many times that lack of a death march saved me in Unrest.<br />
<br />
Most of the time I find the ubers and I are not playing the same game and have completely different issues. Just as I have no clue what it is like for a true newbie now.</div></div><hr />

In short, have a little respect. It's not our fault that Sony designers are completely incompetent and thoroughly corrupt. <br />
<br />
That is my exact arguement minus all the innane rambling and cursing i added out of frustration to seeing and reading day-in-day-out about how &quot;VI will address the melee class&quot; yet every single patch has added more caster krap than they even know what to do with. The class is about as workable as it can be in the eyes of VI; the carrot on the stick ( aka EB, disciplines ) is enough of an arguement for VI to have to justify their noncomittal towards ever fixing or taking a serious look at it in the first place; and until the day ever comes that the dev's of EQ would decide that &quot;hey maybe we should make a warrior class model ourselves and see just what the fuck is up with all their bitchin and complaining&quot;...there's nothign short of just doing what most people do which is either save your warrior for raids and play another toon...or just leave the class altogether.<br />
<br />
I agree, they don't listen to anyone of the Warrior Class. Top dogs like yourself down to the measley *sword wielding asshat in misty thicket getting his ass handed to him by a_large_rat; the ignorance is the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Slightly off topic: You know, I started about a month or two before Kunark. I researched things (but missed a couple, of course. Live and learn) because I didn't want to suck. Anyway, to my point. I remember in my searchings coming across what in my mind at the time was the ultimate weapon: Bladestorm. Man was I pissed when I found out they were removed. I'd still love to have one even today, just for the sheer novelty and cool factor. Plus the proc owns AE! Hey, my MR can handle it too. ;) Also too bad only one ever dropped on BBane (slackasses)<br />
<br />
That ranting aside, yeah.... where the hell is the melee balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree that incoherrant screaming does no good at all. But, well thought out logical analysis seems to accomplish very little as well.<br />
<br />
VI doesn't seem to understand that they have design problems.<br />
<br />
One of the most intuitively obvious is the effects of soloing and 2-boxing. If people can get great Exp and loot without including others and never spend significant time /lfg, they will. Those that are almost entirely group dependant (Warriors for example) are going to level, AA exp, and loot a lot less for time spent in comparison. It looks and feels like a huge built in class disadvatage.<br />
<br />
When the only viable roles for Warriors are MT and general melee, you can bet that they are going to be very concerned about the availability and effectiveness of aggro weapons, HP advantage, and holding and maintaining aggro. I'm amazed frankly that since Warriors don't always MT, that there is very little said about DPS or flexability.<br />
<br />
I don't have a vendeta with soloers or Knights. But I really want to log on, find a group, and enjoy playing the game even when I'm not raiding. Turning on my /lfg flag and advertising my Fish and Chips stand in PoK is not my idea of fun.<br />

Perhaps I'm off on this, but I'm pretty sure the people Shikarii is referring to are the folks who, unlike you Furor, come on this board, and some others, who are in some of the top guilds, and for one reason or another have this odd self-image that if things aren't just peachy for them that they suck.   <br />
<br />
I've seen some of the craziest things imaginable on this very board, particularly moronic statements such as &quot;Warrior taunt is just fine, you just need to get a Blade of War and all is great you lazy bastards&quot;.   <br />
<br />
This then gives the impression of a class that can't even agree that there's a problem cause some people feel that if they actually admit that taunt is screwed beyond comprehension (See Brutul's analysis for example) that their penis shortens by two inches, they feel worth far less if they actually admit that there's a problem with warriors.   <br />
<br />
Clearly you have been among the few voices of reason on this issue, as have I and Raaj and others, but there's a lot of examples of people around here who can't separate &quot;I'm a good player&quot; from &quot;My class is broken&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, Furor also made a point that I've been making for a while: Our problems do not start at 65.<br />
<br />
Oh, and imo the reason that some people think that warriors aren't broken is because they have good players they group with that know to walk on eggshells around them.</div></div><hr />

The spell enter the spelldat under the name &quot;Frost Comet&quot;. not so long after, wizards on Graffe start to discuss, beeing happy because they requested a big cold nuke missing in their spell book (they don't have any after the 49 ice comet). but they show a lot of scepticism about the name, starting to think about new names...<br />
30 mins later, the name change to &quot;Kind of Cold comet&quot;. Dev. show that once again, they read wizard boards, like they have done with the draugh of thunder last patch. <br />

Ya know, it's hard for me to work up sympathy for the poor Wizards being outnuked by the Druids by a whole 300 damage when I'm sitting around in the game groupless knowing that if I even do bother going into PoP and try to get a group I'm a death sentence for some poor slower when my taunt fails 3 or 4 times in a row.

That was Solinar(sp?).  I still have a little hope, but am getting more and more skeptical all the time.  Maybe it is just that it is a difficult issue, and it is taking longer than coding in a simple spell.  Or maybe the devs are too busy coding in new spells to work on it.  Who knows, other than a few people at SoE?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol if they are too busy coding in new spells then they need new devs any moron can make a new spell. the way they have it coded it's easy to put spells in the game, not so easy to fix warrior issues. Basically spells have a template you just fill in the template and make a name for a spell and viola you are done. (well not quite that simple but it really is simple for them to put in spells or change spells). <br />
<br />
So I would not give up hope yet on warrior changes or in my case knight nerfing. :)</div></div><hr />

The devs care not about warriors, fixing us would mean they actually have to do work. CS does not care about warriors, we are a thorn in their side and nothing more. SOE doesn't care about warriros because we still give them our monthly subscription fees.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Brel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Agro is broken, plain and simple. We were tossed weapons with agro generating procs (via pure hate or stun etc) and it was left at that. While some people may think thats fine and dandy its hardly anything more than an insult in my opinion. So Sony gave the crippled warriors a cruch, but you know something? A crippled crutch weilding warrior still falls behind the spell using hybrids and pure casters, in a manner of speaking at anyrate. <br />
     Also I have to agree that warriors problems don't start at 65th, though around that leve is when they start becoming more and more evident. Agro managment and tanking ability just aren't up to par with knight classes anymore, hell, rogues and rangers with elemental gear can tank tier 2 and 3 zones all they want for the most part, same goes for monks (i've seen it first hand). And while granted in elementals you need someone thats tougher, why bother taking the warrior? Going deep into solro towards jiva? Get the pally for group heals! Need a split in fire or earth? Call in the shadowknights! <br />
    VI / Sony by design made warriors fairly single in their focus, but the problem is that over the years while the focus has stayed the same they have slowly lost the edge they at one point had (mostly with the advent of pop). They need to rethink and rebalance the warriors, and then work from there on the rest of the melee in my opinion, because unless they fix the foundation of the melee classes I don't forsee anyway they could NOT screw up the balancing on all the others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Most of us agree that warriors have issues.  Right now, I've just started taking an almost masochisitc glee in playing my warrior.  A paladin friend of mine played my warrior on a Tunare raid while I was on vacation because he didn't want to kill his goddess.  I come back and he starts telling me how bad warriors suck and how he kept looking for his stuns, heals and LoH.  This guy doesn't suck as a player either, kicks ass with his pally and doesn't use the low level stun bullshit.  More than anything, what he said made me think that yeah we kinda kick ass.  Why do we kick ass?  Because every time we are in a group and tank our asses off, keep the softskins safe from harm, we are doing it without all those bells and whistles that the knights have, we are doing it with SKILL.<br />
<br />
Any numbnuts can play a knight and even then I hear complaints from friends and guildmates about knights who can't hold aggro.  We rely on the RNG a ton, but damn, there are days when I'm in a groove, using the patheticly small number of tools provided to our class (taunt, AE Taunt, /shield), the xp flows and the casters stay alive, when I absolutely kick ass and I can look back as I log say &quot;yeah, the knights can kiss my ass because I'm doing this shit without their toys and doing it well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then again, as satisfying as it is to know that I CAN do this without EB weapons and all the fun toys knights get handed, it pisses me off that as a class we get so consistently ignored.  Same with monks and rogues.  Pure melees are getting the shaft like a 170 pound male model in prison.  I keep a vague hope that someday SoE will stop throwing bandaid weapons at us and actually make substantial and valuable changes to the class.  But I'm not to hopeful, not anymore.  Hearing that they are examining the problem every few months is just cruel.  Either create some some fixes or stfu about looking into class balance.  Either way, I'm gonna keep playing my beat up warrior and taking some kind of sick pleasure out of knowing that I can still kick ass with an obsolete tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're an idiot.  Here is why you're an idiot.  I never indicated in any way Wizards, or any other class, should be nerfed.  I merely expressed a perfectly valid frustration over the fact that while Warriors are closing in on a year with a pretty unacceptable in game situation, they have found plenty of time to line up new spells for Wizards, and all the caster classes, hybrids included, for the next expansion.  They can't be bothered to fix the current playing situation for Warriors in particular, and pure melee in general, but they seem to find plenty of time to fix small issues with spells, toss out little fixes and upgrades here and there, and line up new spells.  And what we hear are ambiguous little snipets about how they're &quot;planning on looking into the situation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, this pisses me off.  This righteously pisses me off.  Because I pay my fees each month in the hope, the so far completely unjustified hope, that they're going to correct the situation and make my Warrior worth playing again in PoP.  You, in all your self righteous glory come along and tell me I should stfu and stop whinning, because I might get someone nerfed.   And you also insist that &quot;things aren't all that bad, I haven't had a caster die in tier 2, blah blah blah blah&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which means that either you know something that 95% of the Warriors in this game don't know, you haven't played in tier 2 long enough to really have a sample of the problem, you're an incrediably lucky SoB, or you're full of crap.   Me, I lean towards the last option at this point.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not going to stfu, for you or anyone else.  If the dozens of Paladins and Shadow Knights who have come to TSW to tell us we don't know what we're talking about haven't convinced me to stfu.  If the more &quot;uber&quot; Warriors who claim that once you get a couple of EB weapons everything is roses haven't convinced me to stfu up.   If after a six month long running battle with the Paladins over on Paladins of Norrath in which primarily Frodlin and myself have convinced a fair number of Paladins of the legitimacy of the issue haven't convinced me to stfu.   What makes you think that you, with merely your &quot;concern&quot;  that someone somewhere might maybe get nerfed because I am pissed off about how fubared Warriors are currently is going to convince me to stfu?   <br />
<br />
My recommendation to you is this.  If you don't like it, move on and stop reading the threads.  Because I'm not going to stfu.  And if you don't like my use of so many potty words, you egotistical self important blow hard, then you can fold it until it's all corners and insert tab A into slot B.<br />
<br />
Now, have I made myself clear?  I think I have.</div></div><hr />

The REALLY bad thing about this ? this issue is recognised by EVERY class board. Even wizards who don't have a clue. Even casual players that don't read boards, they all know : Warriors need an upgrade. not a balance, an UPGRADE. But SOE is afraid to change the code, we may become more powerful than intented and they cant modify us with adding a lazy spelldat change we can buy for 34pp at shady in EC.<br />
<br />
I still have faith they can do something, considering the nice changes they showed lately. But I don't understand why there is NOTHING coming. do they have some orders like &quot;you can add content but NEVER ever upgrade melees&quot; ? Honestly I don't understand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh no, you are mistaken.  When I cry for a nerf it's extremely clear.  I said manaburn needed to be nerfed, you betcha.  I said that charm in PoP was overpowered, no lie.  I even said that prior to PoP Monks mitigated too damn well compared to Warriors and even Knights and that needed to change.  If I felt Wizards needed a nerf, I wouldn't imply it.  I'd have come right out and said it. <br />
<br />
You dont like the fact that they have different teams working on different things? Go to a smaller MMORPG then where 1 guy does everything.<br />
<br />
I'm sure they do have different people working on different things.   So what?  This is a significant problem, pulling the caster fix guy off caster fixes for a couple of weeks to help out the warrior fix guy doesn't seem like too much to ask.  After all, I pay my fees just like all the casters.  I have as much right to have a class that works properly as they do.  Most of them are in far far better shape than warriors and have been for some time.  Charm alone allowed enchanters to rack up AAXP like nobody's business for months.  <br />
<br />
And by calling me a liar you dont make your very flawed point look any better <br />
<br />
I didn't say you're a liar, I implied you're a liar.  For all I know you could just be one of the luckiest individuals in the game, I just have my doubts about that.  But the fact that you personally haven't experienced the problem doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  All you can say is that you personally haven't seen it. Which is fine, yet many Warriors have seen the problem.  Many Clerics have.  Many Shamans, many Enchanters, and so on.  So to imply that it doesn't exist because you personally haven't experienced it seems to give your personal opinion a great deal of weight over the opinions of a pretty big portion of the game.  Why should your opinion and experiences have greater weight with me than my own, particularly when my opinion and experiences are backed up by a pretty significant portion of the playing population?  This is what I call hubris, pure ego.  Expecting people to change their opinions based solely on your opinion is the height of arrogance.  You have to do better than that, you have to give a better rational.  And it would help if other people involved agreed with your opinion and rational.  At this point, you are in the minority.  <br />
<br />
Dont shut up man, but stop bitching and whining and crying about everything you might come across anywhere<br />
<br />
You don't know me.  You don't know anything about me other than what I've posted on boards you may have read.  And the only topic you'll see me really getting uptight about is the current Warrior aggro generation issue in PoP.  So your statement above is based on pretty much nothing.  You define my comments as whinning and bitching.  I define them as pointing out a glaring gigantic problem within the game which urgently needs to be addressed.   Again, why should I take your opinion over my own?  There is no reason, particularly when again you are in the minority in that opinion.<br />
<br />
yes, you have made yourself very clear. I am quite embarrassed to share this class with you by now<br />
<br />
You say this as though I should care whether or not you're proud or embarrassed by my sharing this class with you.  Apparently you're confused.  Allow me to clarify the situation for you.  I don't care whether or not you're embarrassed to share the Warrior class with me.  All I care about is seeing the class fixed.  You're not part of the solution, ergo you're part of the problem.   Now, you can lead, follow, or get out of the way.  It's up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I find the idea that you cannot comment on another class 'cause you're 'just being negative' rather narrowminded.<br />
<br />
I have never advocated a 'knight nerf' from jealousy or a desire to 'hurt' knight players I simply cannot convince myself that the level of aggro they can garantee is justifiable when they can take the level of damage they can. The fact that so many of my fellow warriors are totally sidelined by this knight superiority (I have EB and do 'ok') is simply the reason that I have noticed the problem and spent so much time analysing it, not the reason I believe it needs adjustment. <br />
<br />
Warriors without access to the bandaid shouldn't be totally gimped as they are (although new itemisation seems to be addressing that to some extent) and should have some innate form of ability that gives them the tools to do the job without 'special crutches' but overall warrior taunt with EB to me appears 'acceptable' when NOT being compared to what i consider is the unbalanced ability of knight's to trivialise aggro management...<br />
<br />
A fix that trivialises warrior taunt to a similar extent as knights spells do is not in my mind a proper fix. I don't want to hit a couple of buttons and then watch TV for the rest of the fight.</div></div><hr />

It's make all other weapons on the market worthless. Good going SoE...you fixed the warrior taunt problem (kinda) by making EVERY OTHER TANK USABLE 1H WEAPON COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY WORTHLESS.  12/19 weapons in the bazaar that surpass the DPS of the epic are selling for 15k, and they're only gonna drop further.<br />
<br />
They can't fix one thing without breaking another, this time they kinda fixed warrior aggro at the expense of the economy.  That's fuckin great.  Better start checkin vendor prices on shit before you throw it on your trader..might be worth your time to take the 4pp and run.</div></div><hr />

I played a wizard but I never manaburned kunark dragons down. So 5-6 wizards did what high AA players can do in groups of 3? omg the nerf. You, Mr.Asshole have cried and whined for another class to be nerfed and it happened. out of all warriors that suffer from us being broken atm, YOU truely deserve it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, now you're proving you're a dipshit Trondir.  See, we got this problem in the game called Mudflation.  It happens when everyone keeps increasing in power and content becomes triival because of it.<br />
<br />
Sometimes some classes get ahead of others, and there is 2 ways to fix that to keep the game balanced.  You can either increase everyone else's power to the ridiculous level that they're at, or you can nerf the living shit out of them and put them back where they should be.  Option number 1 is not the right option all of the time, and your stalwart defense that all nerfs are bad is just as big of an indicator that you're a complete dumbass as the opinion that everything needs to be nerfed.  The situation requires a different solution based upon the problem.<br />
<br />
Manaburn NEEDED to be nerfed because it was fucked up powerful.   Hitting 1 button in unison with 5-7 other players is NOT SKILL.   Monks also needed to be nerfed because it was fuckin ridiculous for them to have the tanking capabilities that they did with the damage output that they have. <br />
<br />
Yes, you could have increased everyone else to their power, or left the game as is, but the bottom line is that if you want a good game, sometimes you need to reduce the power of items/classes, and the reason that this shit doesn't happen more often is fuckin dumbasses like you who whine and cry and petition about every nerf so that SoE doesn't even wanna put up with it.  I'd be perfectly happy if they nerfed the living fuck out of all the imbalances from the last patch in the next patch every month.  That's what they SHOULD be doing to make a good game.   I know what's fucked up, I know what needs to be done to fix it, and I'm perfectly happy with them doing it, rather than letting shit spiral out of control and make a game that's completely pointless to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.  So if they had come out and said something along the lines of, &quot;We realize there is currently a fairly significant issue with the Warrior class and truly want to address it as quickly as possible.  However given the possible negative consequences of any changes we make, we want to be particularly careful before introducing something to one of the core classes of the game that might have far reaching unanticipated results.    Be assured that it is a concern, it is being looked at, and something should be forthcoming in the weeks ahead,&quot; I'd feel better.   I might not be completely happy, given that eight months have gone by since this problem really became evident, but I'd feel better.<br />
<br />
Instead we get little notes about how they're &quot;planning to look into melee damage.&quot;  This, to me, indicates that 1) they haven't really investigated the situation, 2) it isn't even necessarily Warrior aggro control they're talking about, and 3) there is no telling if or when a change might be forthcoming.  There might be something the patch after next.   There might be something three patches from now.  There might be something when LDoN is released.  They might completely drop the ball and do nothing at all.  There is just no freaking way to know.<br />
<br />
The very fact that they won't even acknowledge there is an issue nor give us a timeline within which we might expect to see it fixed pisses me off even more.  It's like trying to tell the gas company that your pilot light is out and you smell gas.  They tell you that they're &quot;planning to investigate issues regarding gas utilization,&quot; which doesn't even tell you they understand the problem with your pilot light, and then they won't tell you when a repair tech might come around to fix it.  Meanwhile, you've got natural gas leaking around your house. <br />
<br />
But we have at least had another customer come out and tell us that they've seen some tests that the repair techs have been doing with regards to pilot lights, and we're going to like what they're doing.  Which is nice and all, but damn, shouldn't the gas company be communicating to us??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use your first man.  (amendment that is)  Keep in mind what you say can and will be held against you.  Little late for that now though.<br />
<br />
Manaburn was way over powered.  Enough said on that.  And that you call it most useful shows your complete lack of any high end experince.  I raid with a couple 65 wizards, summon magnets, who are able to easily clear 5-6k on crits, a lot.  If a wizard were to empy their mana bar using their nukes (even before PoP), they could easily do more than 19k on a mob in one bar of mana.  Wasn't 18k the highest MB crit?  MB was pretty much useless unless it was a long enough fight for the wizard to MB, then med back up and nuke during the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, melee balancing is a pipe dream.  Until then, we just have to make do with what we have.  Like someone said earlier, it is pretty damn impressive that we can hold any agro now with our crippled status.  It makes me proud that I can keep an xp group flowing quickly, and keep all the casters alive in the process.<br />
<br />
What do the smart epic'ed clerics say?  Heal cost 400+ mana, but clicks are free?<br />
<br />
If you can't understand the crap that warriors are stuck with, then time to go back to KC.  There's no need for someone to go and give warriors a bad rap in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">That's good Trondir.  Completely ignore the rest of the logic in the post and reiterate how you think manaburn shouldn't have been nerfed.  Can 6 warriors drop a Kunark dragon?  No? Then why the fuck should 6 wizards? You obviously never saw the results, nor thought about the ramifications of what manaburn really was if you don't think it was overpowered.  Hell, half of fuckin Graffe's thought it was overpowered.  Oh, and manaburn points were COMPLETELY refunded, even the Pre-req's...so no one has ANYTHING to bitch about. Nerf the shit out of stalwart endurance, I don't give a fuck.  I got plenty of other places to spend AA points.  The difference is that stalwart endurance doesn't enable me and 5 other warriors to 1 group 32khp mobs.  Keep coming up with flawed analogies and faulty logic tho.<br />
<br />
And maybe EQ doesn't involve skill, but it should involve risk.  And there is zero risk standing at max spell distance away from Gorenaire and all hitting your MB button at the same time.</div></div><hr />

But thats anther story for my holy nerf avenger. <br />
<br />
Do you have access to BoT. oh wait any idioit above 62 does. Do you xp in bot? Can you take a hit from a kriger and keep coming?<br />
Thats the bread and butter in tier 3 you know. A kriger that does 4k damage in 4 seconds. <br />
<br />
Thats a reason our class is so broken, Knights whom have our same HP get called in to tank tier 3, While 65 warriors with supposedly better hp sit and twiddle thumbs because the knight has snap aggro and that kriger wont turn his lil 4k a round ass on the poor enchanter or shammy and splat them. <br />
<br />
I've seen it happen. I dont have EB weapons and I sit when friends of mine that play 62 knights that couldnt get taged but got let in with the free exp key take spots I could have simply because they have innate aggro control.<br />
<br />
However to that end GSoT's are now a warriors best friend, Since on the Nameless they go for 2k... (thank you god)  I wont even go into that hidious BS but Im readvocating the nerfage of all tier 3 zones. <br />
<br />
ABSOR MAKE IT STOP. PUT RESTRICTONS BACK ON BOT AND HOH PLEASE!<br />
<br />
But back to the orgnal subject at hand. This patch coming up Casters will become more powerful, a friend did a test on a shammy and mage and their DPS due to the mage chamrs will be going from 74 to a 100 with these new items.<br />
<br />
And warrior monk rogue dps will be going up... Ummm from 54 (my dps with a GSoT 41% innate haste and vallon) to umm 54.  Now I fail to see WHERE THE JUSTICE IS.<br />
<br />
Druids more powerful, Shamans more powerful, Shadowknights more powerful (yes SK's casts DoT's) Necros more powerful. <br />
Guys this is where we stand, This is no longer a warrior problem. This melee patch is a problem for rogue's monks and warriors. <br />
<br />
Our DPS needs a serious adjusting. Our Disc's need to be fixed or set into catagories. OUR AGGRO CONTROL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR ALL CLASSES! <br />
<br />
Intill then we poor shmucks whom proudly trudge on, Wearing the proud tag of &quot;Warrior&quot; As our class sign will countinue to fight the good fight. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">The lower end warrior aggro problem is mostly a problem of group incompentence and based on the stories people have given, I doubt anything short of changing Taunt to guaranteed enraging blow is going to affect the lower end very much.  If you've a group used to a Knight tanking with their broken amounts of aggro a warrior's aggro will never be enough because by definition a warrior should not produce more aggro than a Knight because he tanks better (yes, we still do, especially if you're not in the high end)).  Warrior producing even near Knight level aggro would render Paladins completely useless, and SK mostly useless since a lot of SK actually believe they're supposed to do damage with their mana as opposed to using their ridiculously overpowered Aura of Hate &amp; Zevfeer's Bite.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, Blade of Carnage was the top end item and the most uber of casters obviously have to work with the aggro that a BoC gives and that was obviously enough to raid effectively.  But nowadays it's not unusual for your pickup caster to steal aggro from a Blade of Carnage, and I highly doubt that your average LFG tier 2/3 caster is just so oozing with firepower that he can't help himself getting aggroed, especially when you consider the average LFG tier 2/3 caster rarely has better gear than a high end Velious caster.  Some people play in a way to get themselves killed and there's nothing you can do to stop that unless you happen to be a Knight.  The game isn't going to change so that your lower end LFG warrior can grab aggro from a wizard bent on commiting suicide, which is how a lot of pickup groups operate.  I don't see a patch that'd compensate for stupidity.  You can't tune the game for people who want to get themselves killed.  You shouldn't be able to save someone who have no idea how to stay alive.  <br />
<br />
But I don't see why people are crying about the HPs of a Knight at the lower end, especially with the change to Sol Ro, Warriors once again have a solid lead on HP/AC like they're supposed to due to Ornate armor.  Besides, whether that Paladin is within 100 or 1000 HP of you isn't why you were replaced by a Paladin to begin with.  You are replaced by that Paladin's complete aggro lockdown and nothing else.  A Paladin brings nothing to a group except complete aggro lockdown because there is nothing else that is needed when you have 100% aggro control.  Even if a Paladin gives up over 1K HP to a warrior, as long as you can slow with impunity that 1K is easily made up by the efficient CH anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Phantron, I'm not going to really argue with your points, because I believe that to a degree you're right.  I don't think it is predominately the problem you believe it is, but it's certainly a factor.<br />
<br />
However, I find in my experience the groupmate most likely to die isn't the over nuking Wizard.  It isn't the Druid laying down all their serious dots.  It isn't the Necro laying down all their dots.  It's the slower.  I grant you that many classes can change how they opperate to accommodate the Warrior's weaker aggro.  I don't believe that the slower really can.  Not if you're fighting things that are of a level that you should be fighting, within 5 levels of yourself and you're not uber Warrior with HP up the wazoo.<br />
<br />
And if all the things you say are true, then you've basically explained why the Warrior will slowly but surely cease to exist as a predominate class.  People don't want to live with the restrictions that you say they must, just to use a Warrior.  Shadow Knights work fine in most cases.  Paladins work fine in most cases.  Why would people go out of their way to include a class that requires them to think a lot harder and to be a lot more careful in their playing and yet brings nothing to the table that they can't live without?   Does anyone NEED a Warrior?  Not if a Paladin or a Shadow Knight is available.   Do people WANT a Warrior?  Not if a Paladin or a Shadow Knight is available.  If people can get by just fine without the extra tanking that a Warrior represents, why include the Warrior at all when letting them tank just makes things more dangerous for everyone else?<br />
<br />
People are stupid, people are smart, and people are lazy.  If you're going to make them play smart and work hard, you better be offering something for that extra effort beyond more risk.   The stupid people can't use us, because they die if they do.  So forget the stupid people wanting us.  The smart people won't use us because we represent more risk and don't really bring anything to the table they can't live without.  And the lazy people won't use us because we represent additional effort they don't have to expend if they don't want to.  And they don't want to.<br />
 <br />
Therefore you're basically saying that we should get used to the idea that in the end we won't bring anything to the table that people can't live without.  That's a pretty bitter pill to swallow.  Four years of my playing time should basically be made worthless because Warriors, rather than representing less risk like they did once upon a time, now must accept that they represent more risk.  And it has to be that way.  There isn't anything anyone can or should do to change it.<br />
<br />
That seems pretty grim, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
So other than as tank number 6 for raids, where do Warriors fit in?  Given that people are going to regularly try to do things in the easiest possible way if given a choice?  And Warriors most definitely don't represent easy any more.  Where do we go?  Should we demand solo abilities?  Should we demand some form of buffing ability?  Should we be healers in some way?  Since we're going to be the least desired tank, our only significant role, what's the point?<br />
<br />
Why use a Warrior at all if you're not doing something that needs defensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Knerf knight aggro to acceptable levels /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I think Paladins and Warriors walk a very fine line of dominance versus obselete.  Currently it looks like Paladins are on the dominant side (at least for xp groups).  You're right, slowers dying is the most frequent problem related to aggro management.  But if your lower end warrior aggro is capable of dealing with tash &amp; slow back to back like a lot of enchanter do, which gives even me using a Blade of War considerable headache to deal with, then that means all warriors can pretty much deal with any amount of aggro short of some suicidal caster.  Then where will the paladin be?  Get him for buffs?  Brells lasts 2+ hours and if for some reason you don't have a cleric, can always try to buy Virtue.  Stuns?  Heals?  Root?  Why would any of these be necessary if you can keep the mob on warrior?  Don't forget that despite all the claims of doom and gloom, we still have more HPs and AC than a Paladin, and we still do more damage than they do (unless on Undead).  Then you'd see Paladins complaining (and rightly so) that they're totally obseleted by warriors in xp groups and then either we get nerfed or they get boosted, but either way nothing would've changed.  <br />
<br />
I think the biggest source of problem in xp groups is the back-to-back Tash &amp; Slow.  Tash &amp; Slow is an unbelievable amount of aggro and yet so many enchanters insist on doing it.  This forces a group to get huge amounts of aggro to counterbalance the aggro associated with Tash &amp; Slow.  Like I said in another thread, I think people are too afraid of PoP mobs.  There is no reason a cleric can't keep a tank up on an unslowed mob.  If you can't, then it doesn't even matter who's tanking.  At some point the slow is going to get resisted and you will all die anyway.  So a cleric has to be able to keep up a tank versus an unslowed mob, and it can't cost more than 2k/minute to do so (chain CH nonstop).  While this sounds like a lot, I have seen clerics burn far more than 2k/minute trying to keep people alive, usually due to resisted slow and the associated aggro.<br />
<br />
In an ideal world, every cleric would CH at around 60-80% and every slower would slow at a time late enough not to get aggroed, knowing that the tank is not going to die even if the mob stays unslowed and that they save the cleric more mana by not getting aggro prematurely.  But I know that isn't going to happen, and I don't have a good solution to this.  There should be no reason a cleric has to spend more mana than CHing nonstop to keep a group alive but it happens all the time, and I don't think you can blame any one person for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Think it would be easier if warriors had a short-range summon for party members (think a /corpse command that worked on living players)...that way they could force the slower to stand right next to them.<br />
In a group recently, the shaman kept trying to stand as far away as humanly possible while slowing...was pretty pathetic looking as the two monks and the warrior went chasing after it again and again and again.  <br />
<br />
I still think the beastlord pet is your best friend...1-2 procs (quite often too) and that pet can hold agro through 2 slows, which means you'll hold it through two slows if you're the only person with the pet.<br />
<br />
Valeris: /agree<br />
<br />
Or you could bite the bullet, give warriors a mana pool, and make a second taunt ability work off that.  I prefer the nerfing paladin view tho...:D<br />
<br />
Phantron: If you saw how small some of these cleric's mana pools are, you'd be scared at mentioning a 2k/minute expenditure of mana...I'm talking 55+ clerics exp'ing in PoStorms who would be oom after spending that much mana (true story).  It's sad and scary at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Where are you getting this AC/HP Advantage? Ornate armor didnt give us a advantage at all  The HP Diffrence between Knight and War Ornate is a total of 150 base HP. Where do you get 1000 hp off that? The AC diffrence is 40-60 points. <br />
Where is the gap? Knights have virtually the same HP and same tank abilites as ANY tier 3 war. <br />
<br />
Maybe the high high end is. But the harsh reality is those whom arent in Uber_Guild_01  will never match those whom are in Uber guild. Dont compare them.  Also any decent compatent caster has better then Velious gear. They can solo and camp things to sell.<br />
<br />
The validity of your comments being you have a BoW and are fine. Thats great maybe 10-20 people per server are in the aggro state you are.   <br />
<br />
Look at this situation from people whom cant get into Sol Ro. Whom arent elemental flaged and even so whom are. Aggro for warriors as a whole is worth crap.  However I agree with you its mostly due to shaman's and enchanters that are now ingrained with the idea of. A knight has snap aggro so I can Tash then chain slow till it lands because I wont ever get hit.<br />
<br />
Thats stupidity but thats what the general cenus of slow classes have.  I can do this because this class has guarented aggro lock. Thats why I advocate the nerfing of knights so they will no longer have snap aggro. <br />
<br />
There isnt anything we as a class can do anymore. Knights have ingrained it to 90% of the rest of the classes that they can tank just as good any mob with guarenteed aggro and better xp rate. Honestly if I didnt play a warrior i'd agree  Why bother to get a warrior even with a BoW when NToV_Equiped_Knight can hold aggro better then you?<br />
<br />
Maybe it dosent happen in elementals but it sure happens everyday in Tier 3 and below. and thats where the problem is.<br />

That depends on the knight and the warrior. My previous guild had knights with more hp and ac than me due to their ability to always get a group. They were in a competition to see who get the most AA's while I sat in PoT /lfg.<br />

<br />
Sure we do.  And it doesn't mean anything.  No one cares.  No one says, hey lets get a Warrior because they have more HP, AC, and DPS than the Knights, and who cares if our slower gets whacked a couple of extra times as a result?  We really need those advantages....<br />
<br />
Add to that the fact that HP,AC, and DPS are the areas that are most variable within the tank classes, and you've diluted the Warrior &quot;advantage&quot; to non-existance.  Do I know that Joe Warrior has more HP, AC, and DPS than Joe Paladin?  Not unless I know exactly what gear they're both wearing.  It's entirely possible that Joe Warrior actually has lower HP, AC, and DPS than Joe Paladin, if he happens to not be in a raiding guild while Joe Paladin is.  Ergo our advantages aren't always advantages.   And you can't insist on comparing only players at the same point in the game, because we don't compete for groups with only players at the same point in the game.  The raiding Paladin will go looking for a group and with his gear not only can he match the non-raiding Warrior in all the Warrior's class advantages, he can cast as well.<br />
<br />
What we need is something that makes us attractive as a class that equals the Knight ability to generate aggro.  We don't have it at this point, because the advantages we're supposed to have vary far too much.  If you pick a Paladin you know for sure they'll pretty much have X heal, X stun, at  X level.  While you may not know their HP, AC, and DPS, you don't know the Warrior's either.  And you know that the Paladin can allow the slower to slow asap, thereby negating the need for that greater HP and AC anyway.<br />
<br />
Something needs to change.  I can see we disagree on what.  But that doesn't remove the fact that something needs to change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it would the problem is not warrior aggro it's balance A nerf to knight aggro would bring the 2 classes closer to the balance the warriors seek.<br />
<br />
So I am not sure what logic you are using but aperently not normal logic or perhaps you are looking down at the issue on not on a level playing feild *shrug*<br />
<br />
There are 2 ways to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
1. Nerfe knight aggro to be in line with war aggro and bring about balance.<br />
<br />
2. Make war aggro on par with knights.<br />
<br />
no matter how you cut it thoes are the simplest form of bringing the 2 classes back into balance.<br />
<br />
tehre are other less obsure ways to bring about balance but logic dictates the shortest route from one point to another is a straight line any otehr fix or nerf would not be as straight a line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">The prob as I see it is that in exp groups people know that a knight is much better at holding argo and because of this they pick knights over warriors and its seems to be getting worse all the time. <br />
<br />
As to the comment about they have not been playing very long and therefore do not know what they are doing, or its all the groups fault. Please you may think they do not know how to play but the truth is they know what they are doing they are killing faster with a knight in the group. They do not get argo with a knight in the group witch maxamizes there exp gain. So you may think its them but in truth it may be you holding on to the old way when in reality their is now much less danger if you just get a knight as a tank. Oh and before you flame me about how long I have played I started just before knark came out.<br />
<br />
I do understand that tanks are a very important part of raiding but it now seems that is all we are good for. I for one think that stinks. It needs to be fixed. For those who have all the toys more power to you Im sure you worked to get them but rember their are many who will never be able to get them. should we not have the same chance to get a group as everyone else. I hope this is fixed but I wont hold my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Everyone makes judgements and guesses on what would happen if the gap between agro control became smaller than it is.  Honestly, I don't believe anyone actually knows what would happen.  It might ruin hybrids, or it might give warriors a much needed boost in their primary (and pretty much singular) role without causing much problems to hybrids.<br />
<br />
I'm sticking to my idea that as long as hybrids can continue to tank the mobs at all (not even bringing warriors into the picture for comparison), then things won't be as drastic as some doomsayers are speaking.  The dark days were times when hybrids were not only much worse than warriors, but (if not even considering warriors) they couldn't tank the mobs by themselves. You NEEDED a warrior, the hybrids just couldn't tank it at all.  <br />
<br />
Hybrids have since recieved improvements (and it wasn't only in their ability to hold agro...hybrids have had this ability for quite a while), and have now proven themselves capable of tanking these mobs, I don't think anyone can disagree with that.<br />
If they do not touch the tanking capabilities of the hybrid, then I don't believe decreasing the agro gap by one of the two methods will hurt the hybrids as much.  They have proven themselves worthy tanks, and people just flat out know more about each tank than they did back in those dark days.<br />
<br />
To reiterate, I don't believe anyone absolutely knows what would happen if either warrior agro control was upgraded or hybrid was lessened...(well, other than a lot of bitching, of course).  The solution would have to be carefully considered, and given enough time to see true effects, not the knee-jerk reactions that are going to follow any change.</div></div><hr />

If you like a challenge Apothes, shouldn't you be playing a Warrior rather than a Paladin? :P<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, why do people get better gear?  Why do people spend time earning AAXP?  Why do people level as quickly as they can?  Is it to increase or decrease the challenge?  If people are systematically using every device at their disposal to decrease their risk and increase their return, why would they suddenly work against that process by including a Warrior when they didn't have to?<br />
<br />
You know what I think is very likely to happen if they nerf Knight aggro generation down to Warrior levels?  More groups focused around pets.   Seriously.</div></div><hr />

As far as me being lazy I dont mind warriors tanking in groups when I play my shaman, but part of the reason is I also play a warrior and know the probs we are having. If you dont have the latest toys you feel worthless like an exp spounge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">What do we want?  An equal playing field.  When a Paladin and a Warrior are standing side by side, both in nearly identical gear, both known to be capable players, we want people to have to sit back and think about it.  Which of the two should they take?  It should be a tough choice and be decided in the end by small personal preferences or perhaps the environment you're planning to play in.  The choice shouldn't be an easy one due to a huge glaring inequity.<br />
<br />
What will it take to make this happen is where people disagree.  Some say, nerf the aggro generation of Knights.  Others say increase the aggro generation of Warriors.  Still others say increase the mitigation of Warriors in some significant fashion.  Still others say give Warriors more skills and versatility to bring to the group.  <br />
<br />
We don't agree on the proper course and hell, even some of us disagree as to how severe the problem is.  So we can't give you a short sweet answer, because we don't have one.  At least not one upon which the vast majority of players agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">OK, well, I am big on the whole role playing aspect, Not that verant has even come close to staying in line with that or anything, but I still look to it :).<br />
<br />
Magic should IMO always with out a doubt out agro a fat bassin dude calling my mom a dick head or what ever we are supposed to be saying when we taunt.<br />
<br />
Keeping in line with my roleplaying standard, and sorry I have not read boards in so long or this would have been said sooner :). When Ithink of a warrior, I think of nothing less then power, a beast of a man/woman, who above all else is a in your face, no crap taking, shit talking, bad ass. So why not have warriors have a higher str cap than any other class. Seems only fair and we are totally physical in nature and only use combat by means of our 2 hands, with an occasional kick. Even if it is 1 str per lvl above 50, it would be more then others, this would be fine with me. This would increase dam output and increase agro even if by a little, in the end it would be a great difference.<br />
<br />
Taunt to me is a joke, I know what they were going for, but it is a bit silly, If I am in a fight, I am hitting the mofo that is causing me the most pain, no matter what scrawny boy is saying in the background. BUT.......... since it is already here, then go with it, but lets add something else. Something only warriors can have and something that makes since, in the roleplaying way. Battle cry, A skill only warriors get at say lvl 50. can be used every 60 seconds and in creases hate, depending on lvl X amount. Say at 50 increase hate 100 point, get 5 skill ups per lvl in it, so add 1 point per skill, so at 50 it starts with a skill of 1, doing say..... 100 to hate and ends up doing 105 as cap at that lvl, I know it isnt much, but 5 per lvl from there out would be  150 at 60 maybe double point per skill and cap at 200 at 65, add some AAs that can increase this on a % basis and it would be a nice addition to gettig aggro. I invision a absolutely terrifying yell from the warrior as he charges into battle which in any case would get the attendtion of any mob :)  I would want this on a time with any other skil or Disc.<br />
<br />
I read that poll and saw some good ideas in there too, thanks for pointing me to search, never saw it before :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Imagine that there is a class call Warrior2.  They're exactly like a warrior but does not have disc.  Their HP is like... oh, a Paladin, and they use any Knight usable items.  They don't even have spells, but their taunt button is replaced by AutomaticEB (6 second refresh).  Now, if you need a tank for an XP group, you'd definitely pick Warrior2 over Warrior, and possibly even over a Knight (utilities are meaningless if you've a class that will never mess up on aggro).  This hypothetical class, in reality, isn't too different from a Knight class in terms of aggro generation.  Of course Warrior2 is better but fundamentally both classes can lock down a mob 100%.  If warrior's taunt button got changed to a guaranteed EB, most people would say that's broken (especially if you're not a warrior) and an automatic EB rightfully deserves to be nerfed.  So why is it okay that Knights get something that's essentially the same as EB every 6 seconds?  <br />
<br />
If you look at the SK spell, Terror of Thule, it generates 600 hate for 60 mana roughly every 6 seconds (if constantly recast).  Since Terror of Thule does nothing but Hate, it'd stand to reason that this is supposed to be the most efficient way to get aggro.  So it should take a SK 60mana/tick to sustain 600 hate/tick aggro output (could be higher if he mixes up multiple spells).  Further, since SKs are master of aggro, it stands to reason that a Paladin has to produce less aggro than a SK for the same mana.  Now, if a Knight actually has to spend 60 mana/tick to sustain their super aggro, there would be no issue with picking Knights over Warriors at all.  Yes that Knight can lock stuff down... for a short while, and then he'd run out of mana and be an inferior warrior.<br />
<br />
The problem is that Knights currently can put out aggro comparable to the best hate increasing spell, Terror of Thule, for a trivial amount of mana.  Spells like snare and stun (even if it can't possibly effect the mob) produces an extraordinary of aggro for very low mana.  Knights get aggro basically for free.  That is not how they're even designed.  You're supposed to use 60 mana/tick even for a SK to get aggro, and it should take much more mana for the Paladin who's not supposed to be as good as the SK at aggro.  Knights have great snap aggro, that's fine.  But snap aggro is supposed to be costly.  A Paladin casting Cease &amp; Desist can basically cast those forever without even losing mana.  That's why it's wrong.  I don't know how cheap SK snap aggro spells are but it's not really meaningful since they have Voice of Thule anyway, and Voice of Thule on a warrior is a better than either just the SK tanking or just the warrior tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Glatius put it very well I think.  We all know that there is a problem, and the problem is that knights bring more to an exp group than we do, in terms of tanking.  Therefore knights are favored for the tanking role.  There have been endless threads debating how to fix it(I support raising taunt success and lowering the interval between taunts, along with some nerfs to knigh agro generation myself, leaving knights able to generate more agro faster, but not nearly as big a difference as is currently), and the biggest thing we can agree on is that we do not all agree.</div></div><hr />

Good lord.  Nobody said that a decision had been made, or that it would be in the next patch.

Of course they're going to say 'we're looking into it' when you ask if they're going to do anything, like just about any other company says when the fan base brings up a potentially legitmate problem.  They know the problem is there but with limited resources it means things don't always get looked at right away.  They never promised you a date.  It's your problem to think a solution is supposed to come the next patch or the patch after.  Frankly the aggro issue doesn't even affect the game as much as Command of Druzzil, and look at how long it took before CoD was fixed.  I remember when I was not wanted in a group because a pet is better than ANY tank, and that includes a Knight.  You think being told a Paladin aggros better than you is bad?  How about being in a group where the only thing you do is turn the mob around when it enrages because a hasted CoD pet can taunt the mob off someone chain casting Strike of Sol Ro in around 3 seconds, not to mention he has twice the HP of the best warrior and 5 times the DPS of the best tank?</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry for all those people who seem to think that warriors are ok the way they are, but it's just not true.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing my warr, but some things I don't love.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone here has been in that situation where you're in your little xp group and you pull a mob that hits for ooh, I don't know, a couple k every few seconds.  Now I don't mind this, I can take that damage, but when that squishy little shaman tries to land that slow on said mob that is currently beating my ass into the ground, the mob resists and decides to go run over and have a quick Shammy triscuit, I can't help but feel a little scared.  As I go running over to said mob, that was just moments ago tenderizing my fragile body, I can't help but beg, plead and scream to the taunt god that my meager little aggro getter will decide to work.  Cause I know if it doesn't work that first time, there's a good chance there won't be a second for our plucky little slower.<br />
<br />
This is a 'slight' cause for concern for me.  It gets even more fun when that same mob decides he wants to complement that shammy with a little cleric on a stick.  Now, if I'm screaming to the taunt god for the shammy's sake, when it's the cleric I can feel the whole group collectively trying to will my taunt to pull it's weight just that one time.  Just this time, we won't ask again, we promise.  But oh no, there's always a next time, and that is the main reason that us warrior get looked over IMO.<br />
<br />
I mean, if we look at it rationally, why do these groups prefer the Pally's?  Well, it's safety.  They're there to gain XP, not lose it and then sit by the GY, playing grab ass, rebuff and trek all the way back out.  I mean, the scenery might be nice, but there's a limit to how much walking people want to do.  So these xp groups think to themselves, do we want to play russian roulette with the warr tanking, or let the pally do it and continue to work their way through those lovely lvls and aa's that bring oh so much fun to the game.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, it's not like we are always dropping the ball when it comes to aggro.  In fact, with the right gear and good timing we can do plenty fine, but unfortunately not everyone can get their hands on said gear or have played as long as others and know all the nuances of their class.  Now I know there are some out there that may say 'well if they don't know what they're doing or aren't equipped they shouldn't be there' bu this is a game to be enjoyed by all.  Whether it's naive doe-eyed newbie or jaded battleworn vet.<br />
<br />
In closing I'd like to thank my friend warrior Drashinki who inspired this lengthy rant when he told me (jokingly) that while on one of his xping runs he tried to taunt a mob and he swears it just pointed at him and laughed.  Sometimes I wonder if this does happen...<br />
<br />
And to SOE, just one thing &quot;Where's the Love?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">There isn't some caster favoritism conspiracy going on in the background.  The delay behind the fix on CoD was quite simple.  They needed to come up with a way that make the spell still useful but not overpowered, and I think the fix is a pretty good one.  Good fixes take a long time to come up with.  The slow 1% + changing CoD to no resist adjustment was on Test server at least 5 times and taken off 5 times.  That fix would've easily solved the CoD problem and make the spell useless.  Instead of slapping a cheap fix, the fix to CoD made CoD stop being a super XP tool but still useful in many situations (raids, and even xping it's often quite good).  <br />
<br />
SoE isn't obliged to listen to what you think is wrong with the game, let alone fix it.  Most of you don't even seem to know why you're not needed in groups.  Most of the warrior demands are just downright ridiculous and/or game breaking (or both).  Whatever imagined grouping problems you have as a warrior, I can assure you it is not worse than the CoD days where there is no reason to have any tank whatsoever in a group except to flip a mob around when it enrages (and you really don't need a tank to do that anyway).  Even then, I was able to find groups even while all enchanters are in their own super XP groups and all the shaman seem to be soloing stuff somewhere.  I don't have sympathy for your grouping troubles when I end up using a druid as a healer and 4 other typical LFG reject type characters (since all the popular LFG classes are in Enchanter's private groups) and still crank out tolerable XP.  At least it sounds like some of you can find real groups willing to take you in.  <br />
<br />
Be thankful you even have a slower that you can kill due to your lack of aggro.  Some groups don't even get the chance to try to kill their slower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A rumor is a statement that has not or is not able to be shown to be true or false. To spread rumors and have no intent of verifying the truthfullness of the statement is rumor mongering. <br />
<br />
Until Solinar's statements are proven true or false they are only rumors that he chose to start. <br />
<br />
I hope his statement is eventually shown to be true, however, so far there is absoluty no corroborating evidence except your word that he is making a truthful statement ergo you are perpetuating his rumor as welll.<br />
<br />
Right now emotions run high among us, there is no need to incite them further with statements that can not be corroborated. Time will tell if Solinar's word is the truth or false. However, for this patch, he was shown to be false. And things don't look all that great for the next patch or the next expansion. <br />
<br />
So if you can prove to us all here, and by prove I mean something that can be corroborated, that Solinar is correct, I will back down and eat my hat. Until such time as that, I will gladly grill anyone who brings statements that are only mere rumors to the table as absolute truths.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please, useless?  That is just flat out not true.  Everyone knows that a hybrid brings more to an exp group than a warrior, but warriors are by no means worthless.  I hold aggro better now than I did back in the KC basement when I was using a jade mace and a jarsath trident, and epic monks would tank all night if they didn't FD every 20 seconds.  What was worse, nobody really cared if the monk tanked, because it wasn't much harder to heal him than me.  <br />
<br />
Are warriors and hybrids unbalanced?  Yes.  Are warriors useless?  No.  I go play my warrior, and it's the same as it's always been, or better.  The only thing that's changed is that they made Paladins and SKs effectively equal to warriors tanking, and that's what's wrong with the game in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
If you ask me, the reason they haven't done anything is because they don't know what to do.  Short of improving our tanking ability considerably(which would unbalance all of the raid content), or nerfing knights (the current dev team is pretty much afraid to nerf anything, even for the good of the game), the only idea anyone has is to give us aggro spells.  They would call them &quot;abilities&quot; and limit them with timers or something else instead of mana, but effectively, they are just aggro spells, and I don't think they want to go down that road with a pure melee class, so they don't do anything becuase they don't have any good ideas.</div></div><hr />

Is there anything, besides DEFENSIVE that warriors are truly better at, in an EXP group than Knights?<br />

Is not the rate of EXP higher, and the DOWNTIME lower in EXP groups with a knight over a warrior?<br />

The answer to all above is no...<br />

So In effect, you get LESS with a warrior, sure it is not WORTHLESS to get a warrior, but WHY get a warrior? <br />

<br />
Solinar has done some great parsings around here, but what does that mean?  It means he can interpret data.  Does that mean he has a inside connection with a Dev? Not necessarily.  Did he say he did? No.  Did he say he had any other information which would make him a more reliable source of information than say Joe Idiot in the tavern saying &quot;I heard the Fungi is now no drop?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not doubting what he's done for the warrior community as a whole, but for fucks sake..if you're gonna come here and get us all riled up right before a patch only to have us get let down AGAIN that there's nothing in there for us, that's gonna piss people off.  It makes us believe that if they REALLY had a solution ready to roll that it would be in by now, someone from SoE would have bothered to let us know about it, or someone wouldda came here and said &quot;Hey guys, we heard your concerns, we got a fix ready to go on XX.&quot;  As it stands right now, you and Solinar may feel comfortable with what's going on, but how do you expect the rest of us to take your word for it when we've got NOTHING other than your word to substantiate those claims?<br />
<br />
I'm not upset with you two, i'm upset with SoE, because if they really had what you claim they have, they should have fuckin said something about it by now.  Since they haven't, i'm inclined to call bullshit on the whole ordeal, based on the track record of this company.  And I don't think that's unreasonable.<br />

Not to mention he keeps talking about it as though he stuck it to SOE by selling.  SOE doesn't give a crap if you sell your account.  They still get their $13 a month either way.<br />

And unless your warrior had 100+ AAs and elemental flags, you either found a complete moron to buy your account, or you're lying about the $960.  The highest bid I can find on Playerauctions right now is $650 and that's for an enchanter with 397 AA and full elemental flags.  Accounts just aren't worth that much anymore.  I'd probably be lucky to get $200 for my TM warrior, and maybe $100 for the current one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps you should reread my post, if I thought warriors would be fixed by now I would not have posted that I don't think they will be fixed in the next patch or even the next expansion. Solinar could be correct, however each new patch day that comes and goes with out so much as a snicker from the devs adds to the evidence that his statement was at best a rumor.  <br />
<br />
Of course, 4 months from now, warriors could be thown a bone and it could all be attributed to Solinar's statement, but by then it could only be loosly tied to his comment. after all, anyone could say that the devs will eventually address our problems sometime in the future. Solinar's comment rather was directed at the near future than the more vauge and distant one. <br />
<br />
I'm certainly not angry at Solinar, but I wont just take his word for it that the devs are doing something about it.  Not because he hasn't earned a good reputation here, he has a good one, but  addmitedly he isn't a developer or Absor.  Rumors of possible fixes and upgrades sometime in the future will do no one here any good today.  And I will be happy to grill anyone, reguardless of reputation, about  rumored facts they have of fixes to our class. <br />
<br />
I want to be be able to play again without worry of being a liability to the group as much as anyone else here, but I wont allow my chain to be yanked by half truthes, rumors and false hope. <br />
<br />
It certainly isn't a sort of personal vendeta against Solinar that some people would like to perpetuate. I have nothing against Solinar personally,  he made a statement he wasn't willing to back up. I'm sure he believes his statement to be the truth, and I don't think that he was trying to decieve any one here in the least.  I will admit, my &quot;I told you so&quot; statement was juvinile, if not so far correct. Solinar, I am sure, wants us to get fixed just as much as I do.  We just disagree as to how and when the devs are going to make that happen. <br />
<br />
As far as this stuff being unimportant, compared to real life, of course it is unimportant.  Sure I could choose to give up, go play something else,  start a new character, what ever to make me happy. But knowing I gave up just because I didn't get my way wouldn't sit well with me either. If it did, I would have given up a year ago at the first sign warriors were in trouble.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;taunt test&quot; or whatever that thread was called really points to some broken behaviour.  But to do that (and get warrior taunt behaving correctly) would be real work.  Requiring the expenditure of real $$$.  Snow balls chance in hell w/o prodding.<br />

What they did with the &quot;weapon fix&quot; has completely destroyed the itemization of 13/19 weapons everywhere.  The fix needed is INSTRINSIC not EXTRINSIC (NO MORE EQUIPMENT BASED FIXES!).<br />

Why do we see casters fixes more often?  Because their framework isn't broken.  The incremental cost of adding new features is low.  Why they keep adding zones?

Then where will the paladin be? Get him for buffs? Brells lasts 2+ hours and if for some reason you don't have a cleric, can always try to buy Virtue. Stuns? Heals? Root?<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
You bet. Even if a Warrior could hold aggro like a knight, they (knights) still have a bucketload of utility. The Warrior dies and they can MT. The Enchanter dies and they can do crowd control. The mob is threatening to gate? Stun stun stun stun. Who would you rather have pull a Warrior or a Knight?<br />
<br />
Even with a Warrior being able to hold aggro like a Knight, their greater utility is a tremendous advantage barely offset by Defensive and more HP's should the mob you are killing hit especially hard.<br />
<br />
IF I can hold aggro consistantly and get it back quickly then my deeper HP pool makes me worth including in a group. If Monks and Rogues in my group have to interrupt their DPS to give me back aggro, the slower dies consistantly, and the whole group have to walk on eggshells when I'm the MT I will be /lfg endlessly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">Knights would have 0 use in XP group if warriors can hold aggro as well as them, especially since most groups have no idea where a SK's DPS comes from.  If you can't see that then you obviously have no idea why you're not wanted in groups.  There has never been a compelling reason to want a Knight besides the aggro they bring to group (since most groups don't know how to get the mileage out of their SKs).  Utilities are not important when you never mess up on aggro.  Gating mobs?  For one zone in PoP that is also a train central and not even very good for XPing?  Get a Paladin because they can root something if an Enchanter dies?  When is the last time anyone was picked for a group because they can root?  Why would the Enchanter die in the first place if a warrior has Knight-like aggro short of grossly bad pulling?  You don't get people in a group because they can bail you out if you do something horribly stupid, and even if people did that, an evac class will be infinitely more useful after your Enchanter has died to whatever that killed him.  <br />
<br />
Backup tank?  If a warrior has Knight-like aggro, whatever killed the warrior will just kill the Knight next because if you have no aggro issues then obviously the mob either hit too hard or the cleric wasn't healing, and either way there's no way a Knight with inferior HP/ACs can expect to survive in either of those situations.  I guess you can say you want a backup tank for your cleric sucking, or you could just stay away from a group with a cleric that's sucking, since a cleric that can kill a warrior with Knight-like aggro sure is quite capable of killing anyone else, and that includes the Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u158"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p158">I guess we'll have to disagree.<br />
<br />
In my experiance, my 52 Paladin (I also have a 65 Warrior) outperforms any simularly equipped 52 Warrior solo and in well-balanced high-DPS groups. The Pally never spends significant time /lfg. A raid would have a spot for either.<br />
<br />
At level 65, it is rare for a Warrior to get a group unless he's the MT. A Knight can MT in many zones or because of his utility fill a general melee spot. On my server there are many many more 65 Warriors than 65 Knights. The result is 4 times as many Warriors are looking for one-half as many group slots as Knights (very rough estimate).<br />
<br />
Because of the fast experiance in PoEarth and the fact that the mobs hit hard, Warriors are wanted to group MT. But pre-planar groups look for any advantage that can speed the experiance flow. The aggro abilities of Knights make them very highly desirable in such groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors have little (0 is so extreme) use in XP groups when Knights can tank better than them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Warriors and Knights have defined raid roles already. Different Raid roles, but they have them. <br />
<br />
During exp, groups can do more damage with a knight locking aggro on mob, the group can unleash all ther dps with abandon without worries. <br />
<br />
With a warrior, they have to hold back, lower their dps and be extra careful with aggro. <br />
<br />
Both knights and warriors mitigate the same.  With the difference that warriors get hit a bit less. Which pallies make up by stunning a mob(reducing ammount of hits from exp mobs) and Sks can lifetap(partially heal some of the hits from exp mobs). <br />
<br />
Knights have useful abilities for exp groups : Buffs, heals, LoH, HTs, FD, root, stun, snare, Rez, dots and so on.<br />
<br />
Warriors have disciplines we dont use in exp groups at all. You never know when an emergency can happen. Slower/healer/mezzer dying that might require us to pop defensive or evasive. We cant snare a mob and kite it around if things go wrong, we cant rez our cleric or healer if shit hits the fan. We cant root/park adds. We cant FD a bad pull.  We cant heal or lifetap.<br />
<br />
We can only pop defensive for 3 minutes and hope the mob dies before we do. Thats it. <br />
<br />
You say Warriors having knight like aggro would kill their spots for groups? How in the world would that happen? <br />
Wouldnt that put us on EVEN ground for exp groups while the spells of knights compensate for warriorr difference in skillcaps and disciplines? <br />
<br />
Warriors with a competitive aggro, close to knights(as close as they are to our tanking) would simply make us EQUAL choices. <br />
<br />
People would either pick the warrior or the knight. Both will do good. But right now, they dont wanna bother with warrior because we hold back the full potential a group can achieve with a knight tank. <br />
<br />
Kinda unbalanced dont you think? that a Pure melee class whos purpose is to tank, not even considered a DD class(pallies can be undead DDs too) is placed as a second choice over a hybrid tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
This subject has been beaten to the ground and still pallies that want their cake and eat it too always cry that &quot;It will kill our spot in exp group!&quot;<br />
<br />
It has been killing ours since PoP came out. Show some sympathy.<br />
<br />
Bold comments from paladins that have it good and still want more are the reason the Outhouse exists.</div></div><hr />

I dont think dps is the answer unless its massive.</div></div><hr />
