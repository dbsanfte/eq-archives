<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are the actul effects of the furious bash sheilds?<br />
<br />
-i assumed that they made hate procs x2 there normal (i.e. boc would proc for 1400 hate)<br />
-also that they make bash mave much much more aggro<br />
<br />
are these true/false, or close?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">According to Lucy:<br />
<br />
Furious Bash I _<br />
1: 	Increase Spell/Bash Hate by 10%<br />
<br />
Each furious bash level adds 10% to Spell/Bash hate. So Furious Bash 3 is 30%, 4 is 40%, etc.<br />
<br />
The way its worded makes me believe that with Furious Bash 1, you would have 10% more hate added onto your EB procs, but Im not 100% sure since i dont have a Furious Bash shield to play with it. Maybe someone with more knowledge in that area can answer that part of the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Furious Bash shields are odd.  I have been testing out my stormriders carapace recently and everytime I bash with it, it glows ( as focus items do when their effect is being used) but when my SoD procs the shield never glows as if it isn't doing anything.  I wonder if that is because Furious Bash just doesnt work with the SoD.  Can anyone confirm whether or not it glows when used with BoC or bloodfrenzy or another EB weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No focus item I have worn ever glowed on a proc or a clicky item spell.  I think it's safe to assume they don't work on procs or clicky spells, for warriors at least.  Furious bash would be much more useful if they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My stormrider carapace does not glow on procs from my CHSD.  It has a message when I bash though.  I use the shield in &quot;ruatha swap&quot; mode and it seems to be adding more agro than just plain dual wield (CHSD/Red Epic).  Works real well once you get agro on a mob too and just swap it in (defensive tanking) on a hard mob.  All in all nice utility but not earth shattering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehehe, nice to see some people still remember Ruatha.  She actually posted something over on the CR warrior board a couple weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually this brings up a good point. How many warriors out there ghetto bash with a FB shield?<br />
<br />
And if so, how is the aggro from doing that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ruatha ghetto bash'n on vox was the shit, only time I ever used a shield past level 13 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye I used to be a regular on the old Eq.stratics warrior board (pre-cursor to steel warriors that basically died after year 1).  Ruatha, Fitty, Kailyn etc. all did alot of the early work on how the mechanics of the game worked.  I call it &quot;ruatha bash&quot; cause I literally learned it from screen prints put on that site.<br />
<br />
Been lustin after a FB bash shield since I first learned about em just to try it with the bash trick (I used it for years pre-lvl 55...skill was at 225 I think).  Sure enough with the new &quot;monty hall&quot; loot tables on the BOT tower bosses I was fortunate enough to get the FB4 model on Sat.  <br />
<br />
I seem to see additional agro from using it....it also saved my bacon the other night in an exp group while tankin a rare (swapped shield in for turtle mode).  Still I wish they'd add a &quot;you have bashed a %t...it reels in pain!&quot; message so you can actually see what you have done.  Sigh we asked for that years ago...no hope its gonna ever show up now ;-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have been testing this out, and talking to a few that have the Stormrider Carapace, last night a warrior with Fleshgrinder / SC was pulling and keeping agro from warriors with BoC / PoI hammer.<br />
<br />
As for the agro, each step of Furious Bash is 10%, up to the FB5 one i've seen from either time or one of the 4 elementals. When a bash hits OR misses the shield glows, increasing agro each time by X %.<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy / Zek Crusted Buckler wasnt holding solid agro for me last night, but, once agro was pulled from me, and then shield procced, I gained it right back.<br />
<br />
Now if they add that innate chance to block with shield.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been fiddling with this now for a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is that FB shields are only truly useful as a &quot;hate pump&quot;; i.e. if you swap it in to proc it on bash when you need hate/agro.  I have found that leaving it permanently equipped is really not an option; at least with a CHSD in main hand.  There just is not enough hate generated to &quot;pump up&quot;.  However, when using shield swap or &quot;ruatha&quot; there is a BIG BIG difference to me in the amount of hate I have...to the tune I had two wizards try to knock agro off me (as a test) and I held it fairly consistently (red epic offhand).  <br />
<br />
Of course these are subjective observations.  Unfortunately there are no empirical experimentys I can think of to back it up (ideas?).<br />
<br />
My conclusion:<br />
- With &quot;ruatha&quot; bash: a significant upgrade<br />
- Alone (i.e. keep equipped): not sufficient</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got the Stormrider's Carapace tonight, then we went and killed Terris Thule. I experimented while clearing with agro and found:<br />
<br />
* SoD + SC = kinda sad agro<br />
* CHSD + SC = really sad agro<br />
* SoD + CHSD + ghetto bashing = great agro<br />
<br />
I ended using the last on Terris and agro didn't move off me once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've had my Stormriders Carapice for a few weeks now and I've played with it a good bit.  With the red epic blade in main I hold agro just fine.  As wells as running with Blade of Black Dragon Eye in main and Red Epic in off.  Now, it's a little slower off the blocks kinda like holding agro with a 2hs, but once you have it, you're gtg.  However, in xp groups it's not really worth using, it cuts your DPS in half (not exactly half) and if you're in a pickup group people don't really like to see a warrior with a shield.  However, when MTing raid mobs it's fantastic, the added AC/HPs, plus the reduction in Riposte damage really makes it idea for this kind of circumstance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anecdotal on FB Shield Inc...<br />
<br />
Had a chance to do some playing with a Cord Handled Spike Driver and Stormrider's Carapace on Vakshiz the Shade in PON a couple days ago.  <br />
<br />
Had 2 warriors in a guild group, killing this guy. I started MTing  Vakshiz using DPS aggro from my Greatstaff of the 4 Winds. When my disco dropped, the other warrior AETaunted to gain aggro, discoed,  and used his CHSD and SC combo. I backed off for about 10-15 secs to let him get a cushion then attacked from the rear, at max range. I found I was continually drawing aggro back (not just rampages), so I'd have to back out for a few secs, let him go and then come back in.<br />
<br />
What the other warrior related is that the mitigation is nice for add-tanking on raids, etc but it won't generate the aggro that another proccing weapon in his off hand, the way he is set up. I have been watching for feedback from guys like him (in game) and here... and I haven't seen a lot that would encourage me to use an FB shield over a good 2H weapon or dual wield combo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have used my Stormrider Carapace and have atleast noticed no loss on aggro vs. not using it. But, I also haven't noticed any gain in aggro.<br />
<br />
I am not totally sure what SOE's intent with this effect is, and whether they plan to address this effect more or not. I am certain it relates to aggro in some way, but I know it's not in their intent to use it for ghetto bashing.<br />
<br />
Maybe when they address shields in general they will address this as well. I am not totally convinced the effect is fully live.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kohen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Focus items once  worked  with Right Click and  proc effects but SoE nerfed them do to it making  some  of the other  click effects out there work too well for SOE's tastes. For example it  gave donals bp CH a decent cast time. Its about that time  they aslo nerfed it so you couldnt get AA effects on right clicks either. Unfortuantly i bet who ever designed FB didnt realize this and expected it to help with our hate procs too. But in reality only helps with bash. And in the case of non warrior FB shields gives  Pally/SK even better aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hrmmmm....did more thinkin on this:<br />
<br />
SRC adds 40pct &quot;hate&quot; but to what:<br />
<br />
1. To EB procs?  If so which EB proc (as the FB procs with bash and not at time of EB proc)?  Possible adds to EB procs within a certain previous time period (or last EB proc /shrug)?<br />
<br />
2. On bash only (i.e. increases bash agro by 40pct?)?  If so thats kinda a small agro +<br />
<br />
3. To aggregate hate compiled to that moment?<br />
<br />
4. Something else?<br />
<br />
- I'm guessin that it was designed to be used equipped full time.<br />
- I'm also observing that the shield really only holds agro in shield swap mode (or &quot;ruatha&quot;).<br />
<br />
So I'm guessing its option 2.  The sad part is that &quot;ruatha swap&quot; clearly wasnt considered in the design of this weapon but appears to be the only real way to get it too work satisfactorily (gimp to have to rely on a workaround to make an item work for you but /shrug what can you do?).<br />
<br />
Not sure we can ever concretely answer the question above with available data (can't parse &quot;hate&quot;  or is there a work around to get at it?).  <br />
<br />
I hope someone from Sony reads this thread and reconsiders the design.  I would think some variation of option 1 would make more sense.</div></div><hr />
