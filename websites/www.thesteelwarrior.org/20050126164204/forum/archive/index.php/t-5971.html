Background: I am always grouped with a shaman (my wife's character) of the same level, thus have access to shaman buffs.  I am usually grouped with a paladin and enchanter, both a couple levels under my warrior, as well.  I plan on playing up to low 50's, but probably will never end up joining a large guild/raiding.  I'm a casual player that has simply benefitted from having a lot of old friends in EQ (from previous online games).  I played pre Velious, but I have no experience with a warrior.<br />
<br />
1) Is it worthwhile for me to upgrade my haste item (SCHW) to something like a Soulscream belt.  I'm currently benefitting from quickness (30% haste) and my item (22% haste) and was under the belief the haste cap under 50th or so was 50%.  Is this correct?  If so, there probably isn't any point in upgrading my haste now, right?<br />
<br />
2) I like keeping my warrior's strength up, but I'm trying to plan around higher level items (rings and earrings, noticably).  Should I try to sell off my Bracelet of Might?  If so, should I get another Helanic Tundra Bracer (25 AC 5 Sta 50 HP 5 on all saves)?  Seems like a good choice, especially since she'll get some very nice buffs at 39th - 49th.<br />
<br />
3)  I have 40-45k to spend.  I was planning on getting a CHoS as soon as I see one 12-14k or so.  I was planning on holding off on rings until 46th (Valorum Ring of Gallantry), but I'm undecided on Earrings.  20-25k for the Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement is a good deal of money.  I'm more concerned with the Sta/Dex/HP side of things.  Any suggests for saving some platinum?<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions/opinions?</div></div><hr />

helanic tundra will get you to 65 esily for a non-raiding toon. your stats will go up as your wife gets levels/spells and buffs ya. <br />
<br />
but to go forth and sell your gear to replace what you got now?  naaah, use it and just keep killing monsters. the gear availability will come with the levels you 2 gain. what you have now will hold ya over but to sell off that UP bracer and go for a helanic one will do ya good. can prob get most of the coin you need to get a CHoS with that alone if you got time.</div></div><hr />
