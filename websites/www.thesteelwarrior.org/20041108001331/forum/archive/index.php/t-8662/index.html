<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Perhaps it's just getting late, but I was going over some of the numbers in the table there and had a few questions. I was having a difficult time calculating the average hit based on the mitigation % that was given, then I noticed something else. The HIT% and MISS% numbers don't correspond. Totaling all the numbers does not equal 100%. I assume this is because misses from punch attacks vs bash/kick/etc were not or can not be differentiated in the logs?<br />
<br />
See here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5868):<br />
<br />
CLS  AC    SHLD AVD  DB   DI    AVG    MIT%  ATKS  HIT%  MISS% BLK% DDG% PRY% RIP% | DMG<br />
WAR  1380  0%   0    102  21    273.2  64.5  1854  48.1  43.1  NA   4.9  5.9  5.5  | 131.4<br />
<br />
CLS - Class<br />
AC - AC with virtue<br />
SHLD - Amount of shielding on items<br />
AVD - Amount of avoidance on items<br />
DB - Damage Bonus of the mob. This is modified by shielding.<br />
DI - Damage interval of the mob. This is modified by warrior innate 5% reduction of the DI.<br />
MIT% - 0% mitigation would be max hits every single time. 100% mitigation would be min hits every single time.<br />
ATKS - Total number of punch attacks<br />
HIT% - Hits that landed divided by total punch attacks<br />
MISS% - Misses divided by hits that landed plus misses not including blocks, parries, dodges, or ripostes<br />
BLK% - Blocks divided by total punch attacks<br />
DDG% - Dodges divided by total punch attacks<br />
PRY% - Parries divided by total punch attacks<br />
RIP% - Ripostes divided by total punch attacks<br />
DMG - Avg damage taken per punch attack, basically AVG * HIT%. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just wanted some confirmation, otherwise it would appear that the numbers are off, some by a large margin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its just the way the math is done.  If the same % numbers are derived for each class the same way, it won't affect the final number, DMG.<br />
<br />
Lets make up some numbers:<br />
<br />
2000 total &quot;swings&quot;<br />
<br />
1000 Hits<br />
700 Miss<br />
100 Dodge<br />
100 Parry<br />
100 Repost<br />
<br />
Using the math in that post, you get:<br />
<br />
Hit% = 50%<br />
Miss% = 41.2%<br />
Dodge% = 5%<br />
Parry% = 5%<br />
Repost% = 5%<br />
<br />
Total = 106.2%<br />
<br />
Miss% should be 'Misses' divided by total swings ('Miss', 'Punch', 'Dodge', 'Parry', and 'Repost').</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, plugged those %'s into a spreadsheet, and made up some math relations...<br />
<br />
To get a hit% of 48.1% out of 1854 hits, you must hit 891 or 892 times to round off to 48.1.<br />
<br />
Then, to get 4.9%, 5.9% and 5.5% for dodge, parry and repost, the minumum number for each of those is 90, 109, and 102.<br />
<br />
Now, to get 43.1% miss rate using &quot;Miss% = &quot;Miss&quot;/(hit+Miss) excluding dodge, parry and repost, the minimum number of &quot;Misses&quot; would be....675.<br />
<br />
Now, Hit% using the MINIMUM numbers for each HIT, DODGE, PARRY and REPOST, giving the maximum amount of swings possible to be MISSES, there still isnt enough swings to account for a 43.1% miss rate.<br />
<br />
In other words, using the minimum numbers for everything else, there isnt enough swings to account for a 43.1% miss rate.<br />
<br />
These numbers are fudged.<br />
<br />
Edit: Attached XLS spreadsheet so you can mess with the numbers and see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Miss% should be 'Misses' divided by total swings ('Miss', 'Punch', 'Dodge', 'Parry', and 'Repost').<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you are saying. Miss% is (#attacks - (#hits + #dodge + #parry + #reposte))/#attacks<br />
<br />
In your case 35%. <br />
<br />
As per:<br />
<br />
MISS% - Misses divided by hits that landed plus misses not including blocks, parries, dodges, or ripostes<br />
<br />
I read this as misses / hits + misses - (dodge + parry + reposte)...oh, wait a minute, I get it. Doh! lol<br />
<br />
How is that an accurate potrayal of misses? Well in any case, I'm still not sure how derive the average damage. I guess I just need sleep. I'm quite sure my miscalculation has something to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed some rounding errors elsewhere in those numbers earlier, maybe that has something to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, read that again, maybe a few times even, its not worded well, and its contradictary to common sense with the formula it uses.  It says:<br />
<br />
Miss% = &quot;Misses&quot; / ( &quot;Punches&quot; + &quot;Misses&quot; )<br />
<br />
It says that Dodge, Parry and Repost are NOT counted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, got cha. Sleepy time errors are fun. Alright, yeah, that puts #misses/#punches at a leave that I'm used to seeing. ~36.4%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think that original post needs to be deleted, as it is a worthless pile of crap.  Monks like to point at it when they say everyone needs nerfed, and they need a boost.  They point at it, and try to claim that druids and beastlords out tank them, which is FAR from the case.  Its total crap, and completely misleading.<br />
<br />
Its full of rounding errors.<br />
<br />
Its full of unfair comparisons.<br />
<br />
As you stated, the Miss% formula is not even the right one to use.<br />
<br />
If I get &quot;Missed&quot; 50% of the swings, that should be Miss% = Misses/everything else.  Discounting dodge, parry and repost is stupid.<br />
<br />
Here is what needs to be done, to be an accurate cross-class parse:<br />
<br />
Level 65 of each class, maxed AA and skills, NAKED.  1 hour parse.<br />
Same thing, Attain 1000AC within 2AC of 1000.  1 hour parse.<br />
Same thing, Attain 1200AC within 2AC of 1200.  1 hour parse.<br />
Same thing, Attain 1400AC within 3AC of 1400.  1 hour parse.<br />
Same thing, Attain 1500AC within 4AC of 1500.  1 hour parse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note, this parse would need to be on semi-trivial mobs, so a naked toon with Virtue and a cleric healer would be able to withstand the DPS.  Tier 1 PoP mobs would be good, since they have a decent range of hits (50-270) and are DB to a 65, and have a reasonable attack rating.  PoN blood ravens maybe?<br />
<br />
Now, the last two will be harder to do, as say, 1500AC is a lot for a leather wearer, but the first two can be done with bazaar gear on all the non-silk classes, easily.<br />
<br />
No shielding, no avoidance, no +% skill mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm inclined to agree, but even after looking over those numbers I have a hard time understanding why monks would use that parse as justification.

According to this, they mitiage like crap, but due to thier avoidance, they end up taking less damage.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure that this is the case and its hard to find good data to work with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait a minute here, I posted this same exact idea in the outhouse and was told I apparantly don't comprehend the point.<br />
<br />
Now you don't seem to be comprehending the argument either, what gives?<br />
<br />
Monks need a mitigation boost.  Remember your die hard stance here.  We can't be waffling around on the issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still think that monks mitigating worse than druids is &quot;fucking retared&quot; if thats what you mean. It just goes against common reasoning. However, even this suspect data used to support monk mitigation improvements doesn't show that monks need any kind of tankability improvements at all. I had a few opinions about monks that were unsupported by any kind of data at all, except a glance that these numbers. After analysing these numbers, I'm not so sure about my earlier opinions.<br />
<br />
Its not impossible for someone to have a stance that is totally one sided, Haass. This is one of mine.<br />
<br />
However, despite my little side track/derail there, this thread is about the accuacy of this data, not monk mitigation. I'd like to continue discussion that.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, I really think most of you would benefit by playing some of the other classes you are talking about...<br />
<br />
Monks mitigation sucks...plain and simple...do monks avoid damage better than any other class?  Not a chance in hell...casters do, because they can do damage at range...Rangers do, etc...even warriors can avoid damage simply because they can still do some damage at range...<br />
<br />
Monks cant....<br />
<br />
But to be more realistic, Monks mitigation and avoidance should only ever be compared to the two other pure melee classes...because these classes have no option but to be in melee range in order to do damage.  They have no pets...no spells, etc.<br />
<br />
I dont need to hear any whining by rangers or SK's or even Pallys...<br />
<br />
Now, why does monk mitigation need fixing?  <br />
<br />
Simple...the RNG...<br />
<br />
monks do avoid better than warriors and rogues...and yes, their avoidance combined with their current mitigation means that they take less damage over time than any character but a warrior, <br />
<br />
But, two factors conspire to make this not work...<br />
<br />
1) They have lower HP than a warrior.<br />
2) When they get hit, they get hit damn hard<br />
<br />
Now, reason 2 alone would not be an issue, if it were not for the streakiness of the RNG in EQ...but that streakiness combined with what seems like effectively zero mitigation against some of the harder hitting mobs basically spells a death sentence to monks.<br />
<br />
If monks had an option of ranged damage, or a much more significant incentive not to take damage (like rogues do), then I would say it was justified, but currently, the incentives are just not really there to play a monk.<br />
<br />
If monks had always been designed that way, then i dont think monks could have a reason to bitch, but since this nerf happened way after the original design of the monk, I think they have a legitimate grievance.<br />
<br />
No other single nerf has had more impact on any one class in the game than the nerf to monk mitigation that happened just before the release of PoP.<br />
<br />
I would invite any person that doesnt agree to create a monk and attempt to level them (level, not powerlevel).  I am quite confident that they will eventually agree.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If monks had always been designed that way, then i dont think monks could have a reason to bitch, but since this nerf happened way after the original design of the monk, I think they have a legitimate grievance.<br />
I agree with your assessment, Gnarled, except for one thing: I think monks were designed that way all along.  In the early days of EQ, monks indeed had the best avoidance, and inferior mitigation enforced through itemization.  Bad itemization through three expansions caused monks to became progressively imbalanced.<br />
<br />
At the time of the nerf, most monks were so concerned about their uber gear being nerfed, that most of them preferred a nerf through game mechanics instead of a gear nerf.  Until they actually saw the nerf, that is.  Today, many of them probably wish that they had agreed to have their Flayed Barbarian Leggings nerfed to AC25 +75HP instead.  The world has moved on from NTOV and VT, but the nerf remains.<br />
<br />
The important thing most monks are unwilling to admit is that monks WERE imbalanced more in Luclin than they are NOW.<br />
<br />
But I freely admit that I thoroughly enjoyed my monk twink during that era.  I enjoyed the god mode very much.  I essentially soloed for a year straight, and I confess to laughing at the equally-equipped warrior twinks who could neither take a hit as well as me, nor hold aggro nor do my DPS, despite their gear costing far more in the bazaar.  I recall that at one point, my soloing monk had not died in 15 levels, despite doing absurd things like visit Nagafen at level 36 and Vindicator at level 41.  I recall successfully tanking spiders in Velk's lab at level 38.  It was some of the best fun I've had in EQ.  But it was not balanced at all.</div></div><hr />
