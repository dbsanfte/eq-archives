<br />
I\'m a level 60 Warrior with a question as to which weapon to mainhand.<br />
<br />
I have a Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn... which one should I mainhand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its up to you. But most people tend to put CHoS main.<br />
<br />
However, I'd sell it, make 10 or 12k, and get yourself a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">do as you like, you should have less than 1% diff from one combo to the other ...<br />
however, SotB stun up to 65 thus putting it main would give you more chance to interrupt stunable caster; but as Baadan said, everybody put CHoS main so you will cross lots of dumbass to tell you to switch your combo if you follow my advise.<br />
<br />
BTW, don't sell your DW combo AND get a GSoT. they are both usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumdaor</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My current weapon lineup also includes...<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
<br />
Velium Gemmed Greatsword<br />
<br />
War Marshall\'s Bladed Staff<br />
<br />
I also have issues about what to use, and when to use them... any suggestions are welcome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CHoS / SotB for big aggro<br />
GSoT for when you become a mana sponge with your DW combo<br />
WMBS when you aren't tanking (dps purpuse).<br />
VGG same as above with lesser dps I thing thus unusefull.<br />
<br />
NOTE : augment your aggro weapons (CHoS, SotB, GSoT) with A3 or Ykesha ; and augment your dps weapon (WMBS) with either a DM aug or a DD aug or a lifetap aug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your melee dps and melee dps aggro will be greater (though not by much at all) if you mainhand the 12/19 and offhand the 13/20 thanks to the damage bonus the primary weapon receives. <br />
<br />
*12/19 puts out more dps and dps aggro mainhand than 13/20 does mainhand<br />
*13/20 is a better raw ratio therefore making it the better offhanded weapon<br />
<br />
On the flip side, however, the proc on the 13/20 is 179dd + stun while the proc on the 12/19 is only 75dd + stun (higher level).  So the tradeoff about equals out dps-wise.<br />
<br />
For raw aggro purposes I'd think the SotBS primary and CHoS secondary would be overall better, as the 100 more damage per proc does not equate to much aggro whereas with the afformentioned setup you'd have both a more efficient offhand and primary ratio setup.<br />
<br />
In the end though the difference is teenie-weenie.  Do what you want, they are roughly equivalent weapons.<br />
<br />
PS- Sell the VGLS.  It serves no purpose in your backpack.  Use the money to buy something useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK... explain this!  <br />
<br />
The rest I can understand, thanks guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT puts out comparable aggro and imo superior dps.  More and fasters swings you have (duel wielding) more chances the mob has to riposte on you (counter your attack and return one of their own).  If mobs are tearing you up, swapping to a 2hander can reduce the amount of damage you take.  Increasing your survivability for a tradeoff of aggro/stats/whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morf</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was referring to the riposte dmg you'll be taking from low delay dual wield weapons.   TBH at level 60 this damage will most likely be superficial and you probably don't need to worry about it.  Often times, people overestimate the importance of riposte damage:  If you're fighing mobs in pov, ripostes will hit for 500 max, if you've got 6k hp at level 60, that's not a huge difference.  However if you're tanking time+ mobs and are constantly getting riposted for 3k+ - it becomes significant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumdaor</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aha... pretty much what I\'ve been doing then.<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking/Sword of the Bloodsworn for normal tanking duties.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder when I take riposte damage when tanking.<br />
<br />
Warmarshall\'s Bladed Staff for those times when I\'m not the biggest tank there and just on DPS duty.<br />
<br />
Wow... gonna take a LOT of LDoNs to get these things auged.  Hope they stay with me for a while!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i were you i'd eventually go for 2 anger3's and a yak ... or 1 anger3 and both yaks if you don't want to spend very much.<br />
<br />
I always had anger3 in my duel wield combo's and Yak on my dps 2hander both for more dps and to allow me to be a dps-tank in low aggro groups.<br />
<br />
I'd concentrate on auging the duel wield combo first though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumdaor</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I start hammering out LDoNs... God I hate those things and so does my girlfriend.<br />
<br />
I got burned out on those playing my main, a cleric.  I was excited when I could finally heal on a hard though.  Maybe they will be more fun for us playing on our alts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the CHOS better in mainhand.Differance was small and hard to judge tho.If you find it easier to swap out you can use your Veluim in mainhand when dps'n.I liked to keep it to swapping a single weapon.Either a 2 hander aggro/dps, or, I used the mainhand to swap when dualwielding.Just less hassle/faster to use on your hot key panel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stun aug from Bloodfields might be worth trying for. Easy to get to, and could be very useful until you rack up some LDoN points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebast</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note...on tanking mobs in PoTactics Riposte does make a pretty big difference in your survival rate.  If you have a cleric who's timing Cheals (normal at level 60ish) and you take 2 riposte hits you just lost 1/6 of your health that wasn't expected.  Bad for you :).  I now only use a 2 Hander unless someone is really pulling agro from me A LOT.  Once your grouping with a cleric with the mana pool and regen to move away from Cheal it doesn't matter so much.  (The only time I use Cheal anymore is on a very few raid mobs)</div></div><hr />
