Have checked a few progression charts and cant while one says RZ is necessary another says its not.</div></div><hr />

*is* required for PoFire access.</div></div><hr />

RZTW = need for Sol Ro Chamber <br />
<br />
Sol Ro (the god) = needed for PoFire<br />
Sol Ro 5 mini = needed to zone into Sol Ro Chamber<br />
<br />
But if u have 40+ people with the full 5 mini flags you can ghetto your way into Sol Ro Chamber.<br />
<br />
1) Make  FULL mini raid  (and have a rogue as single group leader)<br />
2) Have the FULL mini raid zone up to sol ro chamber<br />
3) Abscond the the rogue<br />
4) Have him invite X not full mini people and get them to zone into Sol Ro Chamber.<br />
5) Have the X not full mini people disband from the raid<br />
6) Camp &amp; Reform the raid<br />
<br />
Rince &amp; Repeat</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juraveil</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well depending how ya do it you can get into fire WITHOUT RZ.  You can get sol ro flag without rz if you get in as an unflaged in a raid.  I was xping in fire before i got RZ flag for a few weeks.  But you do need everything else.  Once i got RZ i was able to zone into everything of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was not aware u didnt need rz flag for fire. you sure someone didnt get the flag for you?<br />
<br />
i know we had 1 person missing just rz flag and they couldnt get into fire or any other ep. maybe they just needed to talk to the seer and librarian dude to fix things but im betting someone else got you the flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juraveil</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes im sure no one else got me the flag, cause i dont give info out to anyone, but it took a while going back and forth making sure i had ALL the pre/post flags also from npc's in Pok/PoTrang.  Finally i was able to xp in fire without RZ, but i had every other flag even Sol ro which i got as an unflaged.  About 2 weeks later we killed RZ again and that gave me access to everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Juraveil is right. The last round of reflagging we did, one of our wizards could zone in to Fire, but no other elem planes. He was just missing either TZ or RZTW, but he had been raided in to a Sol Ro kill.</div></div><hr />

Sol Ro 5 mini = needed to zone into Sol Ro Chamber<br />
 <br />
Which is it both or one.  If both, how does one get into the chamber.. grp click up like in BOT minis or raid click up like in Agnar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juraveil</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for sol ro chamber, just like any other zone unflaged wise.  Once there is enough flaged in it, the unflaged can zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both RZTW &amp; The 5 Sol Ro mini are needed to zone into Sol Ro Chamber.<br />
<br />
Things might have changed/bugged , but thats how its supposed to be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juraveil</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes for the chamber both RZ and the 5 mini's are required to be flaged for it.  sorry i didnt word my other posted better, i was refering to entering as an unflagged without the 5 mini's or rz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;well depending how ya do it you can get into fire WITHOUT RZ.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't need Agnarr for PoFire access.  You need RZ, at least from the combos I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juraveil</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about agnarr, think hes needed for all ele planes, but i do know for sure that you do NOT need rz for fire.  As i said before i had ax groups going in fire for 2weeks before i ever got RZ flag.  Rz is not required for fire, but IS required for Earth, Air, Water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need Agnarr for PoFire access.  You need Agnaar for Water/Earth/Air.<br />
<br />
We have people just missing RZ (they have shared flags up to Solusek Ro, and have all other flags), and cannot get into any of the planes.<br />
<br />
We have had people who had everything but Agnarr, and could zone into Fire but not the others.<br />
<br />
(assuming all other flags)<br />
Agnarr == Air/Water/Earth<br />
Solusek Ro == Fire<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is intentional or a side effect of sharing flags, but that's how it has worked in all cases that I have seen.  And I've never seen anyone able to get into Fire without RZ... I'd be curious to see the seer's flag list for someone who can do that.  In fact, I know of at least one guild member who has all but RZ (including Sol Ro); I will double check to see if they can get into Fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">niin there is a flag from the drake at the pof portal, make sure they got it and unlock memories. from the above, it sounds like they should be able to zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, he has that one (I just double checked).  He has all flags except Rallos Zek (including Solusek Ro) and cannot zone into Plane of Fire.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a bug, really, that you'd be able to anyway... You need RZ to even get to Sol Ro without flag sharing, and you need Sol Ro for Plane of Fire, so, at least before flag sharing, RZ was a prereq for Plane of Fire, so I'm sure that is what was intended.  It might have something to do with the order flags were obtained, I dunno.<br />
<br />
The person who can zone into fire without RZ, did they first zone in from his chamber?  I don't remember if that gives you any flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juraveil</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually yes that might be why i was able to get in without RZ, when we had killed sol ro and i was unflaged i HAD &quot;attempted&quot; to zone into fire since i was told you have to zone in from the chamber in order for it to work in tranq, alot like how bot worked had to zone in from storms first before you could outside.  Anyways at the time i didnt work due to i didnt have other flags, but it must of remembered me trying and maybe thats why once i had EVERYTHING but RZ at the time.  Other than that i dont know why others cant, i also know atleast one other person who said they had everything but rz also and couldnt get in.</div></div><hr />
