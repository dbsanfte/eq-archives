<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlordbarreck</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey All, I just got flagged for HoH yesterday and was wondering if it would be possible for a 65 shaman and warrior to duo in HoH, and if so, where would be the best places to hunt.  Any input is greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No its not going to be possible.  Well, technically I suppose it could be, but it would be a lot more work than it's worth, and would be faster for the shaman to just solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to find a spot in PoP that I can duo and get anything close to the exp of the average half-decent PoV group.  Pretty tough to do anything without a CHer and a slower and if you don't have some DPS your exp rate is gonna be pretty crappy.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate druids btw.  I have had some great groups in BoT with druids.  They can keep up with tier 2 mobs with their heals, snare, DS, and even throw in a nuke once in a while.  If I have a shaman in my group I'll take a 65 druid with his spells over a cleric (assuming someone in the group has access to a rez bot hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chongo</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me and My Druid aggro kite the zone in mobs.<br />
<br />
Yes, the black armored thingies.<br />
<br />
I just have her snare/dot/nuke and keep agro, while I whip out the 2hs and just pound on the mob while she's kiting it.<br />
<br />
Works pretty well, 3-4% aa for the each of us. and takes roughly 5min a mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, a shaman and I have duo'd in HoH for pretty good exp.  I prefer this zone to PoV, primarily because it's a lot quieter, and there are less annoying people to deal with.  I don't know why you posted this twice though, I've given my input already on the other thread you started about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlordbarreck</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for some reason I couldn't see any of my posts after I posted them, so thought somethin went wrong and reposted .. I can seem em now though .. kinda wierd, thanks for the input though =)</div></div><hr />
