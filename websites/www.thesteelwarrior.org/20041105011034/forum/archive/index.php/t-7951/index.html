<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigdung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my first 3 AA's and put them into Run3. What should I do with the next 3? Thinking regeneration or stamina maybe? I don't really have high stamina so that may be a waste. Wanna get going on defensive AA's so I figure regeneration is the way to go because it's only 3 AA's and then I can move to the next level. Any advice would be great.</div></div><hr />

Concur.  If you're using stat-boosting food or drink, get this.  I waited until somewhere around 300aa to get this.  I was an idiot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jakazzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i would totally go with stamina or regen... that is unless your poor and cant afford the stat food... not like its expensive and its a lot easier to get pp nowadays...  the stamina is good, esp. for non ogres, because it will help you get as close to max sta as possible unbuffed, every 60+ warrior should prolly have max stamina buffed, even with planar power AAs, but unbuffed is very important too for comparison's sake.  when you are being compared to other tanks in a raid(usually open) situation many times your unbuffed hp will come into consideration<br />
<br />
its a bit of a stretch, but many fights must be done buffless and that extra hp can make a huge difference,  plus if your in ldons with no shammys or bsts it will be invaluable.<br />
<br />
yes eventually your gear will put your stamina at 305 unbuffed and then those 3 AAs will only help when your naked, but think of how much it will help you up until then.  also by the time your gear puts you that high you shouldnt be worrying about a couple hundred pp every once in a while for stat food, at least i never have...<br />
<br />
the regen can help too, esp once you get all your regen AA's(which have prerequisited of previous regen AA's, so your gonna end up getting it eventually)  you can get a hella lot of regen, which means that much less healing which makes ya that much easier to heal : )</div></div><hr />

i regret my 3 lost AA to regen /cry  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">regen 3 ist da must at lvl 51 but unnoticable at lvl 65<br />
meta 3 ist not that useful at lvl 51 but saves alot at lvl 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">not like its expensive and its a lot easier to get pp nowadays... <br />
<br />
BBPP's are pretty fek expensive and hard to make.  Not to mention the time it takes to get baking up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Depends on your gear.  I don't use stat food but my stats are usually maxed with a few simple buffs.  I'm too cheap to spend the money on food that will just get used up.  I forage on my druid and put it all in the shared slots to feed the other toons.  But like I said, I'm cheap.  <br />
<br />
I would go sta if yours is low, or regen if you try to solo.  No matter where you put them you'll have plenty of chances to regret that decision later.  And since you can get 3 AA's in one evening of grinding.....it's not that big of a loss.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LUMMP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Have to Concur on the metabolism3. I waited until i was around 350aa to get it and Kick myself all the time. It so owns whether you use stat food or not. And makes protecting BBPP SOOOO much easier with forcefeeding as you can forget for long periods of time and still not loose one.<br />
