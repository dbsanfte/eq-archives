Daabu says to buy PB or Ambidexterity (or both) before Flurry, because: &quot;While flurry in and of itself is going to be a better skill once its maxed out, it requires you to get CF first, then has 6 levels to work on. You'll get more bang for your buck, and sooner, if you do ambidex or PB (or hell, do em both! 2+4+6+9 &gt; 2+4+6+3+6+9+3+3+3)&quot;<br />

Sit aggro will pull a mezzed mob to the 'chanter when the mez breaks, even if the warrior has hate prior to breaking the mez.  Casters should know how bad sit aggro is, by the time they're doing Hard LDoN missions.  Ping-ponging off mob from tank to caster and back to tank is caused by the caster auto-standing when hit (which removes sit aggro and puts the warrior back at the top of the hate list).<br />
Enchanters should stand during mez breaks; good enchanters will stand relatively near the mezzed mob during mez breaks, to minimize ping-ponging.<br />

Base range of /shield is about 25, 30% more with Extended Shielding.  Range with Extended Shielding is about 36.  All measurements in &quot;loc units&quot;.<br />
Sassinak translates for us: &quot;36 units is probably similar to the typical radius of an average LDON-type XP group (one third the range of CH). That will be much more useful than the default range of 20 or so.&quot;<br />

Daabu demonstrates his delightful case of OCD by providing a summary, by type and point-efficiency, of every.  Single.  Warrior.  AA.  In.  The.  Game.<br />
It's a bit of a read, chilluns.  But we're here for you.  So here's your summary:<br />
&quot;Read the first post of the thread; it contains everything you need to know.  Nice work, Daabu!&quot;<br />
There were a couple of alternative theories in the comments that didn't make it up to the official post, and I'll summarize those here:<br />
Hastened Instigation should be moved up on the list, given the importance of AETaunt.<br />
A whole big discussion on lvl 65 vs. AA's, splitting XP vs. pure levels or pure AA, etc.  Editor: Sounds like there may be a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where old-world mobs are still dark blue, but badly out-leveled.  My gut says it's around 62 or 63.  A reasonable course might be to stop at that level and AA in Chardok/Droga/etc. before moving on up to 65.<br />

Rampage list may be set when the mob first rampages, rather than when the mob is first engaged.  Thus if the mob rampages after the MT attacks, but before the MT takes aggro, the MT may end up at the top of the rampage list, and the RT may end up second.  Since mobs won't rampage on the person they're aggro'd on, the mob ends up rampaging on the RT as planned--until a tank switch, at which point the MT (who is still on the top of the rampage list) starts taking the rampages again.<br />

Don't use Finishing Blow for runner control: mobs start running at 20% (Editor: greenies run at 50%), and Finishing Blow doesn't kick in until 10%.  For runners, get WA5 and a weapon that procs snare.  Also, Finishing Blow levels 2-6 do not increase how often it happens, just what the level cap is.<br />
Payn, however, reports getting Finishing Blows as soon as the mob turns to run, even when it turns at 23%, and asserts that the AA description is wrong.<br />

It's two, two, two threads in one!  First thread: importance of stats vs. AC/HP.  Second thread: DPS vs. hate procs for holding aggro.<br />
Thread 1:<br />
DEX adds aggro (more procs), STA adds HP, AGI adds basically nothing, STR increases DPS slightly.  Leave regen for the necros.  ATK is more useful than stats, but much less important than HP/AC.  CHA is essential for a raiding warrior.<br />
80 AGI gives you 1% more avoided hits.<br />
Some debate over the importance of resists, but most people say they aren't critical for the MT.  Unless you don't have a bard.<br />
Buffs make maxing stats easy, even with Planar Power.  But maxed stats unbuffed are also useful, in that they free up buff slots.  Don't worry about STR/DEX, because you'll have Focus up anyway.  <br />
Make sure you have 35% haste or better; haste is essential to aggro.<br />
Thread 2:<br />
There is MUCH debate on DPS vs. procs as the key to aggro.  DPS weapons may have a small reliability advantage early in a fight, but hate procs are better for lucky snap aggro, and seem to win in the long term (i.e. after proc rates average out).<br />
Haass says that hate procs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DPS for holding aggro, and that ripostes are no longer a good reason for using two-handers instead of dual wielding.  He's usually right about things.<br />
Brabble says: &quot;It's possible that an aug'd dps weapon might be a reasonable choice when, as Var points out, you know that the fight is going to last a very short time, since until the RNG decides to smile on the DW set up, a really good dps 2-hander will have the aggro advantage. Obviously, early procs on the DW would really lock down aggro, but those fights would be balanced by some number where the DW didn't fire off for a while. And of course, an Anger III proc on the dps weapon is nothing to sneeze at.&quot;<br />
Brabble (who is very quotable) also says: &quot;Given the number of variables here, I'm not sure how you could avoid comparing a bunch of apples to a bunch of oranges, some watermelons and a kitchen sink in this equation, let alone eliminate all variables from in-game fight situations.&quot;<br />

No way to improve Taunt success rate.  Lathen says: &quot;One of the developers stopped by in the past few weeks and confirmed that the only factors which affect the success of taunt are 1) your skill level in taunt, 2) your level, and 3) the target's level.&quot;<br />
Plumppoopsie says: &quot; BARD Mez, Taunt (fail or success), incite, break.<br />
CHANTER mez, Taunt (fail or success), incite, taunt if first failed, break (so if 2 fail in a row, the agro generated from the incite,will give you agro.)&quot;<br />

Lots of different theories on which raid AA's to get first, but no consensus.  Lots of people like Health of Target's Target, others like the +50 ATK to every melee in the raid, others like the +100 HP to everyone in the raid.  They all sound good to me.<br />
One point that was made: since *everyone* buys HoTT first, it might be better to buy something that fewer people choose, to minimize useless overlap.<br />

There is no AC/HP number to be a &quot;good tank&quot;.  It depends on the level of content in question, and defensive AA's matter a lot more than a few hundred HP.<br />
If you must have numbers, Sassinak says (all numbers are unbuffed): <br />
&quot;For LoY, I'd say 1200 AC and 4k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 2 or easy LDON, I'd say 1300 AC and 5k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 3, I'd say 1400 AC and 6k hp.<br />
For PoP tier 4 or hard LDON or GoD tier 1, I'd say 1500 AC and 7k hp.&quot;<br />

You can only flurry once per round, and only off the primary hand.  With maxed Flurry AA's, you flurry on slightly less than 3% of all combat rounds.<br />
Flurry appears to happen only on rounds where you double-attack or triple-attack, and only on a percentage of those rounds.  Raging Flurry may either be a straightforward increase in the chance to flurry, or an increase only in the chance to flurry following a triple attack.  Sassinak reports that Flurry always adds two attacks, not sometimes adding one and sometimes adding two.<br />
As per Sassinak's post (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=109690&amp;postcount=45), you can both triple-attack and Punishing Blade in the same round, without flurrying.  You can also PB and flurry in the same combat round.<br />

More discussion of &quot;good&quot; AC/HP.  1350/6000 unbuffed is more than enough to do hard LDoN.  1300/7000 buffed is enough to do hard LDoN's, according to Thraxnor.  1590/8200 buffed makes hard LDoN start seeming &quot;easy&quot;.  <br />
10AC invisible-armor-slot LDoN augments are great (and cheap).  The Loyalist Shield of Honor quest is good AC fast (50/75 on the back slot).<br />
Tribute is a great way to get that last bit of AC/HP.  150 HP costs 120 tribute per hour, 47 AC costs something like 180 tribute per hour.   <br />
Editor: it's a 10-minute round trip, with slow zoning, from the Nexus stone to the tribute master and back.  And it's not hard to find things with decent tribute values--try the LDoN armors that people make to practice smithing, or the Centi weapons.  There may also be better deals I don't know about, but those are easily enough to make tribute a reasonable option.<br />

Derrict: &quot;Your weapon and offensive skill is what determines your hit rate. Attack only shifts the average hit damage higher. With ~ 250 skill in weapons and offense, you will hit a mob approx 59.5% of the time regardless of it's level.  …beastlords, who cap at 225 for 1hb/pierce/2hb, leaving them at 56% accuracy with those weapons versus 59% with h2h. &quot;<br />

A boring thread rehashing AC/HP/stats, with one shining moment:<br />
Ducky222: *asks the same old question*<br />
Haass: &quot;Man what the fuck, there's a thread 3 goddamned lines down that answer this question. You couldn't be bothered to look THAT far?&quot;<br />
Brabble: &quot;LOL.<br />
I have a special program that translates Haass.<br />
Let me run it here...okay:<br />
The translation of his post is:<br />
Good morning, sir. For further information, look at the other AC/hp/stat thread in this forum. It is always a good policy to read up on issues that concern you, and it is very likely the case that a good deal of information on those issues will be somewhere on this site. Although it may not be entirely obvious to you, AC/hps are critical at every phase of the game, whether your stats are maxxed or not, just as that thread implies.<br />
<br />
What's lost in the translation is another bit of information that almost every Haass post has behind it: to be a very good warrior pay attention to everything around you and, particularly in your own actions, stand for no slacking, tolerate no errors, let no one do your work for you, and above all get the job done. If Haass didn't hold himself to this standard, his sig would say something else, and you'd only be able to see it in old posts.&quot;<br />

Behold, the newly updated summary!  (through 2004-06-09 9:51 am)  <br />
<br />
It includes your thread.  Nice thread, btw!  :-)<br />
<br />
I do think someone should experiment with actual AA per hour in a &quot;standard group&quot; (cleric, warrior, enchanter, DPS, DPS, DPS) at level 62 or 63 in old-world content, and then at level 65 in BoT.  Anybody have a bunch of level 62/63 toons they'd be willing to play with for a bit?<br />
<br />
My gut feeling on this is that old world mobs are so weak compared to PoP mobs that even if you get much less XP per mob, you're going to kill so many more mobs that the XP may be better than it is at 65.  And the scenery is certainly better at 62 than at 65 (far more zones provide good XP at 62).  But I'd like to see some numbers to formalize the debate.</div></div><hr />

I play on a pvp server and occasionally want to avoid the constant 20 min exp session interrupted by pvp, win or lose, restart with buffs, rezzing people etc, then exp another 20 min before the next pvp assault. At those times, I find old world content to be more often than not empty, and well worth hanging out at for a few hours, because yes (I have no parses to back this up) the rate that mobs die can make a lower amount of aa exp per kill still grant you an AA point every 1 1/2 to 2hours. I'm not ep flagged, but compared to a lot of the Drunder, Fortress of Zek/ Bastion of Thunder groups I've had, this is not really that far off the mark for how long it takes to get 100% aa exp.</div></div><hr />
