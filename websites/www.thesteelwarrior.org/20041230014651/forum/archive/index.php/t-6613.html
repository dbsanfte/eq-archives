<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't be agnostic, be Rallos Zek. Halflings get innate sneak and hide, but cannot be used together like rogues can. They can corner tank. Put all stats into charisma if you plan on raiding, otherwise put them all into stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus they level really fast.   I agree with Payn too, make your warrior follow RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agnostic vs Rallos Zek - Agnostics get minorly better faction with most old world stuff, however, who cares about old world anymore as it doesn't affect you in day to day things.  Rallos Zek allows you to use Fierce Heraldic armor at 45+ I believe.  It is cheap, and very high quality (better than Velious quested by a good bit, many slots even non visable).<br />
<br />
Halfling bonuses - Sneak is an amazing skill.  It allows you to get indifferent faction with anything you are behind.  This means better prices from Apprehensive merchants, being able to use KoS / dubious merchants, able to do quests that require indif without needing the faction.  And being able to walk past KoS mobs if they are looking away from you.<br />
<br />
- Hide is also useful.  Since you won't be a rogue, you can't hide / sneak and be able to walk around invis.  But you can have an unlimited duration invis as long as you don't move.  It can fail though, so you should have a mob targeted that you know is a faction other than Indifferent and doesn't see invis.  That way when you hide you can test if it does work (by the mob becoming indif).<br />
<br />
- Small race.  You don't need a shrink device to travel in dungeons.<br />
<br />
- Exp bonus.  Warriors have a natural exp bonus (5% I believe).  But also, Halflings recieve a bonus (again, 5% I believe).  Leaving you with a 10% exp bonus which makes you the fastest leveling class / race combo.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages - You'll be an ugly assling =(  .... oh wait, redundant there, sorry.<br />
<br />
Starting Points - Depends on what you want to do.  As was mentioned above, if you are gonna be a serious raider, go for Cha.  If you are going to be casual, go for Sta.  Reason for cha if you're a raider - in higher end raids you will be getting Divine Intervention cast on you a lot.  It is an instant heal if you drop below 15% health.  But it can be either full / partial / or fail.  The result is based on the cha of the person who has the spell on them.  305 cha and it will rarely, if ever, fail, and almost always full.  Also, at the higher end game, sta gear comes easily, so the points are kinda wasted if you can get the gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really care about the great cultural armor debate. My guy's got some ok gear as is, so I'm not gonna whine.<br />
<br />
But being a halfling is great. The XP bonus helps. The size is great for corner tanking. The hide/sneak abilities have saved my buttocks so many times.</div></div><hr />

Pffft, halfling = sexy unless you use Luclin models. &lt;3</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll also have good starting agi/dex, though gear nowadays can raise most stats to reasonable levels.  Gear will be able to bring the str/sta up easily.<br />
<br />
The sneak/hide is capped at 50 so it'll fail often so you'll need to target a mob and hit the hotkeys til it works.  The sneak can be handy for some quests or turn-ins if you don't want to deal with factioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The exp bonus is an extra 5% incase you were wondering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thyll</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My very first warrior (march 22, 1999) in the LIVE version, yes I was a warrior in Beta but that didn't count, was an AGNOSTIC HALFLING. I still have him, just for posterity. I really enjoyed playing a halfling warrior, especially now when I have to get shrunk on raids.<br />
<br />
I chose agnostic back then because I really didn't know, none of us really did, how factions were going to effect everything. If I made another halfling warrior now, I would most likely not be agnostic since so many things are diety based unlike before when there were hardly any.<br />
<br />
I pull him out every once in a while, just to run around with the noobs, I even have 2 hard level wins with him in LDoN. :LOL<br />
<br />
Halflings are fun, sneak is great, exp bonus is good, agnostic anything sucks now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would put all of your starting points into stamina when making a halfling. The other nice thing about being a halfling warrior is that most warriors are barbs/ ogres and it is nice to stand out when raiding.<br />
<br />
Just make sure when you name your toon, it is not a cheap ripoff of Tolkien. I may train the next Frodoo Baggins I see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whether or not you put a bunch of starting points into stamina should really depend more on how you plan to play your warrior in the long rung. Also remember, max STA is much easier to come by without reaching end-game these days, through much better and more available gear and commonly dropped LDoN augments. Instead of typing it out again, I'll quote Hussar:<br />

He's also my main and only level 56.  :)  I haven't focused much on leveling. I didn't know which stats did what back when I created him but he now has 200+ in strength and stamina. I think they make a great race/class combo.</div></div><hr />
