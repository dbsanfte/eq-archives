<br />
everyone tells me to make a paladin or SK but really, i dont want to play either one<br />
<br />
so warrior it is.<br />
<br />
I will never be uber, I will never tank Cazic Thule or some planes god, i just want to fight and not get my ass kicked. And I want a a dwarf.<br />

I am also the MT for an elemental guild, dwarves tank as good as the rest, shouldn't be an issue, if you want a dwarf, play a dwarf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im a fan of dwarves, yes gotta love the jump roll. After reading another thread I saw to make sure my AGI was at least 75 is this true?<br />
<br />
then dump rest into stamina since CHA wont be a factor since I will never be the recipient of that spell lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, you take a big AC penalty if you go under 75 AGI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dwarfs, statwise, are actually the best race for warriors besides the Big Three (Barb, Troll, Ogre).  I'm a warrior, I do just fine.  And the former MT and GL of my guild was a dwarf and tanked every boss up through Time phase 4 (when he left the game)<br />
<br />
So Dwarf is not only exceptionally viable just for fun, but if you decide to go to the high level, it would be perfecly usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all about the dwarf roll...seriously.  You'd be surprised how much it impresses the girls =D<br />
There's only one down-side...NEVER use a 2-hander, or you will get &quot;BSS plz&quot; tells non-stop...so much h8.  Yea...don't quest the wood-elf mask either..you'll get the &quot;SoT plz&quot; tells.  Dwarfs have their hardships...But it's all good.  I refuse to play any other race.  I am MT of my guild, and do just fine~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually there's nothin wrong with Dorfs, I have known some good ones (mostly clerics though).  Dorf paladins are all bad but that goes without saying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can choose Brell or agnostic only I believe.  There is no big difference between the two.  Brell worshipers can get the cultural stuff that has the wisdom on it, whereas agnostic gets all the stats except wisdom, so it isn't a big difference.  But, Brell is the best god /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck yeah dwarves are viable hommie.  We're easily the best race in the game.  Ok so you can't get that FH armor, no biggie you ROLL when you flip I mean what more can you ask for?<br />
     Really IMHO races don't matter, just play what you think looks cool.  Sure some people will say ogre cuz no frontal stun but in the end all thats really gonna matter is what you look like.  <br />
     I realize you said you won't make it to end game and honestly I prolly won't either but dwarves are super freakin cool and trust me you won't regret playing one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skarab</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a dwarf cleric (62) and am levelling my dwarf warrior up currently 51... I tried playing a taller race and was constantly looking down to see where the mobs were.  Dwarfs are great cause they never have to get shrunk and for darn sure they will always see their targets.   And the Roll ROCKS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dwarf&lt;all<br />
<br />
This is still correct.<br />
<br />
But anyway, the best race for warrior is any race that can be a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">65 dwarf warrior here.  I raid main tank, I group tank.  I can do it all.<br />
<br />
And the ladies love my roll =)  Speaks of &quot;other&quot; athletic abilities /wink!<br />
<br />
If you wanna make a dwarf, make one.  If you wanna make a elf, make one.  Don't listen to these fools here, any race is good, except ogres and barbarians.  They really suck =P<br />
<br />
Make what you want to play.  I made a dwarf because my favorite D&amp;D character was a dwarf battle cleric (wanna-be fighter).  Do I regret it here in this world of RZ twinks?  Not with the new LDoN stuff...  Would I go back and change?  Nope.  I'm happy with my dwarf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gottrek</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, dwarves are best of the best of the best ;-)<br />
Just not choose agnostic.<br />
Gott</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atilette</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, Dwarfs sux almost as much as human warriors, I fear :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I'm not seeing that much of a difference between the non-deity dwarf armor and the deity dwarf armor for a warrior.  both have the same hp/mana/ac and only some very slight stat differences (like some str on the greaves).  Non-visible pieces have some bigger differences, but there's other armor you can get that's equal or better hp-wise (such as a hierophants cloak or a Crinose Cape of the Werewolf for the back instead of the cultural cloak).<br />
<br />
  Maybe you don't want to do without all that wisdom that the deity part adds.  On Veeshan they're both available in bazaar for around the same price (some pieces are cheaper on one side than the other).  Going deity would definitely give you more options, but so far I can't see much of a difference for dwarves.<br />
<br />
Deity is Underfoot Platemail (Brell)/Mischevious Platemail(Bristlebane, but cleric only I believe)<br />
Non-Deity is Brellium Platemail</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There isn't any difference whatsoever between diety and non-diety dwarf armor melee stat wise. Brellium is just Underfoot Plate without the wis or mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im a Dwarf, and It's nice not to have to shrink every raid heh.<br />
<br />
<br />
But, the only reason why I made a dwarf in the first place was, of course, the rolling jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the ONLY sucky thing about dwarves is the lack of really nice looking one-handed Axes.<br />
Not stats; but looks. Dwarves need axes. There should be a whole line of Dwarf-Only Axes with insane looks.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing my guild is missing is a Gnome Warrior. We got all the rest and most all of them ( excluding me teh sandbag ) carry their weight and tank just fine.<br />
<br />
even that gimp rolsdar the blind human :D</div></div><hr />

Been a shorty since before anyone realized gnomes could make decent warriors.  Through much ridicule and superior ability the shorties are feared!!<br />

No shrink = teh win!</div></div><hr />

All right them's fightin' words.  You can say I suck, but for the love of God don't lump me in with Ogres.</div></div><hr />

Ayup that right I run 2 Warriors I love them!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate being short. Ever try going up the stairs near the bank in Kael wwhile dorf short? Sucks.<br />
<br />
I like being an Ogre, the no stun thing is amazing, Tried playing an elf warrior on Test (/testbuff) and when I went to kill a mob, the stuns would drive me bonkers.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just spoiled.<br />
<br />
And one thing that pisses me off, I haven't seen any Ogre be MT on a raid... except for ONE time when our zerg guild used one for AoW. It's always those damn dorfs and elves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think he got his head stuck in the forge trying to make something :( or lopped off his finger in his fletching box making my stonewood bow :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play an L62 Dwarf Warrior.  I'm in better stat shape than a human warrior friend of mine, but equipment will be making up any differences. I am just under 1200 AC and good HP for the level (can't remember it off-hand). I run around 1350 AC and 6-7k HP with full raid buffs. I am in mostly Thurg plate, Radulkan Helm, Hate BP, Lodi shield for back.<br />
<br />
Most of my friends are &quot;good&quot; race players and so it made sense for me. Haven't seen any problems other than the stun and that is more annoying that anything.  I've been able to go places pretty easy and I think being too big (hence needing shrink potions) would have been more annoying than getting stunned on occassion.  What does amaze me is a wimp mob can stun you in some cases, but it doesn't last long and you are just more determined to pound the mob's face into a cherry ooze of bloody pulp. <br />
<br />
It also depends on whether or not you are going to end game, and how much twinkage you want to do. The other small races have advantages too, like exp bonus or hide/sneak (dwarves don't get those). At L62 with ok equipment, I max out on STR/STA with raid buffs. Close to max on DEX. AGI is around 200, so it's all good. The catch is that at the levels getting there, I needed the STR/STA, so I really don't think how you put those points is going to matter a whole lot. <br />
<br />
I chose Agnostic, and it hasn't hampered me that I've seen. Choosing Brell might help in The Hole, but I really haven't played there much and once you do, you mess it up anyway, so it's not a factor. As far as cultural there isn't a noticeable difference.<br />
<br />
I have a Hate BP, and the HP from it was close to the HP from a Brellium BP. The Hate BP gives better offensive stats and the Brellium has 16 more AC.<br />
<br />
If you want to solo at all, then I'd go for a Troll, but warriors are NOT solo classes. If you really want to solo, go with a hybrid and twink it out.  The best combo is warrior/druid or warrior/cleric.  Find a good healing partner and you can level fast and have a great time exploring the zones.</div></div><hr />
