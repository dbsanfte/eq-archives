<br />
I think we are. There are some defensive AAs that are more than worth it to any warrior, but I think we can be as well, or better served, perhaps using a more balanced approach?<br />
<br />
If our current biggest issue is in fact agro generation, should we not be looking more at our offensive abilities? Or ones that strike a balance?<br />
<br />
I wish I could say I familiar enough with the improvements our non-defensive AA give to say what alternatives are good. At only 24 AAs (and 62nd level) I am not encouraged by 'being a good warrior' and dumping many AA defensively for raid tanking, when I expect that the 65 knights will do a better job because of agro.<br />
<br />
So what AAs give the most bang on the offensive side?<br />
<br />
Is Tatical Mastery worth it? It looks like a nice combo AA--reducing the damage you take from reposts (and even one attack that does not hit will be worth at least 200 HP) and increase your own offense by letting you land more hits.</div></div><hr />

The only thing TM does is allow you a chance for your attack to do damage when the mob ripostes, instead of having it automatically be a miss.<br />
<br />
It's a decent AA, but it doesn't lower your damage taken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly Tuscan is right about Tactical Mastery, all it is is a slight DPS upgrade when attacking from the front.<br />
<br />
As far as offensive AAs go, I find that I am tanking in the majority of groups I'm in, and of course warriors do 95% of the tanking on raids, so I'm getting defensive AAs first.  The offensive stuff is definitely worth doing though, and you could probably make a case for getting them prior to some defensive stuff depending on your situation.  I will leave it to people with more AA than I have to reccomend which offensive stuff to get first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think PB is the way to go then. More double attacks should mean more tripple attacks which should mean more flurries (eventually, wehn you spend the boad load of AAs).<br />
<br />
Anyone have a snippet of log with TM showing what happens with a repost?</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of my RL friends plays a warrior, and since we obviously don't need 2 MT's, I went defensive because I play more than he does, and he went up and got Flurry first so he could add a little more DPS while he wasn't playing the role of a warrior.<br />
<br />
I still tank everything, and I'd assume I'm not the only one.  Even thru all the talk about knights and how superior they are, it's not like there is an extreme amount of them and all warriors are obsolete.  If you have a regular group and you're not MT, then don't put points there.  If you tank, then CA/CS is gonna do more for you faster than offensive in my opinion</div></div><hr />

No one really gives a shit about that +40 dps(thats probably extreme) you doing once you max all of your offencive AAs. There will be always much easier to find rogues and wizzards for dps who will be doing close if not outdmging you with all of your aa. We are expected to tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not yet seen an answer here to this part of the question, and it is one I have been mulling over myself.  I have been looking at PB and thinking that maybe dumping a few points into it might in fact increase my agro a bit, and make me more desirable from that standpoint.  Defensivly, I am at a point, where unless grouped with high end people(who have different standards), my tankability is never an issue.  I am at best SA on raids(and frequently further back), so don't tank a whole lot there.<br />
<br />
Would it be best to drop in a couple offensive AA's(more for agro than just for DPS) in the midst of filling in all the defensive ones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO the agro increase that you will get from AAs is minimal.  I think that you are much better off going with defensive AAs first.</div></div><hr />

Not only that vut return from those AAs highly dependant on your weapons. Warriors are expected to tank not do dps. Ofcourse u wana be a rogue thats your choice. Hell at high end even all of the casters max out nd3/ca as soon as they get crutial aas as warrior defense are our priority AAs not offence. I do not know of any guild that would recruit a warrior so they can do dps... something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to think about ...<br />
<br />
It's your character.<br />
<br />
Your time investment.<br />
<br />
Your AA path.<br />
<br />
Your enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Choose whichever you like.<br />
<br />
And don't stress it so damn much.<br />
<br />
Natural Durability 3, for instance. It's damn useful. I'm sure almost every warrior here plans on getting it.<br />
<br />
But Combat Stability 3 versus Combat Stability 2 ... that's 6 AA points. Maybe they actually WOULD be better spent with 3 points in Ferocity 1 and 2 in Punishing Blade 1?<br />
<br />
While some AAs stick out as much more useful than others ... there is no WRONG path to take.<br />
<br />
And sometimes I think people stress about their AAs way too much.<br />
<br />
Of course, now you all can feel free to crack on me for my chosen AA path.<br />

<br />
I find punishing blade to be very helpful in maintaining aggro.  More hits = more aggro, which does tend to capture the mob's attention.  And I am assuming, without any parses to prove it, that more hits = more procs on the GSoT, which also would translate into more aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm currently debating the same thing that you are.  I have CA 2, CS 2, PB 1, and I'm trying to figure out which to upgrade next.  I've been leaning toward CA 3 or CS 3, simply because that's what everyone expects you to do, but PB 2 is definitely still in the running.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, more swings may (may) increase proc rate, but more hits does not. You can (and do) proc on misses. Proc rate, on most weapons is set in terms of 0.22 X delay for a percent chance per swing to proc. Note that delay IS modified for haste...so the faster you swing the less likely you are to proc. I don't know if the proc engin is smart enough to take into account PW. That is a question to post on Shaman's Crucible, as they have a VERY nice test on this there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding Combat Stability versus Combat Agility ...<br />
<br />
And this is only my opinion, however worthless that is ...<br />
<br />
I tend to feel in me gut that getting hit less is a tad more useful than getting hit FOR  less, if you're talking defensive bang for your buck.</div></div><hr />

Oh and I too would definatly go CA before CS. My thinking not only is not being hit better than being hit for less, but that the game is designed for a cap on this, reletively unchaning part of AC (unlike mitigation AC which has been steadaly rising) so its more likely to have unintended consiqunces. Hopefully they are good consiquences.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you without any graph that ca3+lr5 is HUGE improvement. There would be no way I could survive tanking unslowed mobs in tactics and bot without this while 2 boxin. <br />
<br />
As for getting 2 lvls of something and not maxing it.. Its dumb if you look at most of AAs as cost increases so do the benifits directly proportianly except in rare cases where its connected to regen be it mana or hp. IE ND3 is 1.5 better then ND2 and ND2 twice as good as ND1.  You should always max the stuff you choose. Except for toy AAs like proc criticals.</div></div><hr />

It's not clear how much offensive AAs effect aggro but clearly they do help as opposed to defensive AAs which do not help at all.<br />
<br />
If your problems aren't aggro related, the AAs you get depends on what kind of roles you want.  The defensive AAs have roughly the same returns anyway but you can get avoidance first if you're too lazy to parse.  I got all the defensive AAs first but that no means is the only way to do your AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my point, which people keep on coming back to:<br />
<br />
Aren't we wearing blinders as to the roll we are playing by ignoring that in most XP groups, if there is a knihgt around, that we are there for DPS?<br />
<br />
That for non-uber guilds, raid tanking soon will be (or should be) taken over by 65 Knihgts and paladins (who bring a lot more to the table, IMHO, than a 60th warrior  on say Vindi).<br />
<br />
Here we are, saying that agro lock makes us the least wanted MT (or maybe 3rd from the bottom, after Rogues and Monks :p) while we are not changing our position on AAs?  By the time you are 65 AAs go fairly quickly, or so is my understanding, so if there is a dramatic change in balance, we can respond fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
Should people wake up more and use knights to their full potnetial, that we will be poorly serving those coming here for advice by maintaining the traditional defesive &gt;&gt; ofensive. <br />
<br />
Does this mean I am not happy having gone Run3, Stm3, ND3, AE taunt? Nope. But do I think I will be best serving myself and my guild by getting CA, CS, etc when really, the only thing our 65 knihgts are missing is defesive?<br />
<br />
And isn't this type of thing going to be true for most warriors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if our tank roll is gone, we really should hang it up or pl up a rogue or wizard unless you just like playing a warrior for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
agro is only an issue on vindi type mobs the first couple of seconds of engagement and if you must you can use a weaponshielded ranger to let a warrior build agro. but its always going to be easier, safer, and less mana to keep up a defensive tank than a knight.<br />
<br />
i dont blame anyone for maxing ferocity and pb/ambi first though, dps/swings is important to agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point, I have 27 AA points, ND3, AE Taunt, CA1, CS1 and I am starting work on PE.  My gear is mostly Kael/NToV/BoT stuff.  I haven't bothered to use 1h weapons in 3 levels because they sucked so bad.<br />
<br />
That said, I am planning on a balanced mixture of AAs now that I have AE Taunt.  Essentially I plan on mixing the CA/LR path with offensive AAs, PP and PD.<br />
<br />
The way I figure, I can pretty much tank anything in an xp group already and focusing entirely on defensive AAs isn't really going to change that, nor will it significantly change the number of times I get healed per fight.  But the offensive AAs will boost my dps (which is pretty good already with a 41/31 2hb) and also help me keep aggro better.  As for raid MT, well, that isn't usually me as our raid leaders prefer dual wielders over 2h tanks and I am the 2h heretic of my guild.  When I am raid MT, I hold aggro fine and since most of what we are killing is not terribly challenging the defensive AAs won't help a whole lot.<br />
<br />
p.s. I'd take CA/LR over CS/ID as I also feel that not getting hit is better than getting hit for slightly less.</div></div><hr />

But for whom? The healing circle or the raid? Or is it easier to shave a minute or 2 off the lenght of the fight and use a non-defensive knihgt?<br />

Defensive warrior maybe the easiest to heal, but the trade off is that is the longest you have to maintain that pace for.</div></div><hr />

I rarely find myself in this situation though.  And the day I think my primary role in groups and raids is DPS, is the day I will park my warrior and start leveling my mage.  Warriors may be less desireable than they used to be in exp groups but I don't think our role has changed that drastically.  If Vindi is a challenge for a guild, they are better off with a defensive warrior tanking.  If aggro is really a big issue, then as someone else said use a weaponshield ranger to build aggro and hand it off to your MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also think that you get much more bang for the buck by increasing your defensive AAs.  The offensive AAs are a dubious in increasing agro, while it is well known what the defensive AAs do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I addressed this point, you apparantly missed it, so i'll say it again.<br />
<br />
I TANK EVERYTHING.  XP groups, raids, everything.<br />
<br />
If you regularly group with paladins or shadowknights who tank (and bear in mind, that these guys are still extremely rare compared to warriors), then yes, it might be worth your time to focus on non damage AA's.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER if you tank even 50% of the time, going defensive first is probably going to give you more bang for your buck because it is crystal clear what defensive AA's do when you play your own healer too...and trust me, they work.   Offensive AA's are a lot of points for a small increase in DPS.  Ambidex let me quad more...great, those extra 2 hits from my offhand for 4 really helped me out here.  Combat fury 3 supposedly makes me crit more, and yet i'm standing right next to the pally in my guild with CF2 who's matching my number of crits every time they come around.<br />
<br />
I don't think offensive AA's are the way to go if you want to build a warrior.  If you don't tank, then FFS, roll up a monk or a rogue, because no matter what you do for your warrior, they're ALWAYS going to be standing in the shadow of those classes in terms of damage output.  It's nice to improve your damage dealing capability at some point, but first and foremost, WE ARE TANKS, and if we're not tanking, then we're dead weight, no matter how many AA's we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For non-trivial content, warriors do still have the lock on raid tanking.  For most pre-pop content, raiding means keeping the MA alive while DPSing the bad guy to death.<br />
<br />
A typical heal in a CH chain lands at half health, so the only risk is in a damage spike killing the MA.  Warriors with defensive smooth the damage spikes, making a MA down - and a potentially failed raid - less likely.  The game is now all about minimization of risk, and a defensive tank - for non-trivial content - minimizes the risk. <br />
<br />
Ergo, raids still require defensive tanks, and pretty much always will for non-trivial content. Until they remove the CH chain this will always be the case. I'm fairly certain that the guilds that are doing the 5th set of time trials are NOT using knights for tanking the bosses (Bertoxx, CT, Inny).<br />
<br />
Now, if you are not a raiding MA, then offensive AAs may be a better idea. But the perception remains that you could be a raid MA (and defensive/evasive is still huge for raid content). So defensive AAs seem to still be a good idea.  But if you don't raid, who can say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I certant don't disagree, but I have tanked, for example the West TOV named, from begining to end (7-10 minutes) because dealing with me non-defensive was easier than dealing with a tough agro transfer. <br />
<br />
If I could do that at 60, what's for the new sets of up and comers, who are likely to have better gear (after all we have new expantions), and more levels and better agro control.<br />

As a thought, who would you rahter have as second tank (back up to MT)? Knight or warrior?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me, that either we have such a narrow definition of raid tanking as to be silly, or we starting changing our arguments and admit that we don't hold significant advantages in raid tanking. Even the majority of 60+ warriors are not in uber guilds where you really (maybe) do need warrior tanking, but have been progressing more slowly though content, and accuing reletively more power when they hit most high end places over the ubers.<br />
<br />
Trak easier at 65? ToV? Areana? So--if we aren't pushing the edge on healing power, don't knights present a real and viable threat to most warriors tanking?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No maybe about it.  The top guilds use a warrior tank sequence. Knights are way deep in the tank order, like, &quot;if he goes down the ranger is tanking&quot; deep. You have defensive or you don't. It's really that simple. If you have defensive, you tank the tough bosses.  If you don't you may as well be an enchanter.  You might stay up longer than one, but you're not tanking.<br />

<br />
That's always been the case actually (I remember this exact discussion from the other side early Luclin).  The point, however, is that warriors have defensive.  And if you are trying anything remotely difficult (not trivial, whatever), defensive WILL save a raid.  So, given that, do you risk a wipeout, or use a warrior tank - unless you're guild has no warriors, I know what the answer is. So warriors establish a lock on raid tanking, snap aggro or no snap aggro, because there will come a time when you will HAVE to deal with warrior's aggro, so most guilds want to get used to it early. Therefore knights get shoved aside from tanking on raids. <br />

Been happening forever, isn't going to change, unless they get rid of defensive (I amend that, or radically change the nature of encounters, and even the new PoP encounters haven't changed that).</div></div><hr />

The poster above is right the key is still defensive.  Ask yourself this question.  When you tank vindi, for example, do you still use defensive?  Sure vindi is a wuss these days but I still use defensive everytime I tank him.  Defensive / evasive always has and will always be the king of tanking mobs.  Defensive / evasive lets you do a mob with fewer healers and less risk of death than without defensive.</div></div><hr />

One of which (if you use 2handed) is Punishing Blade.  It increased my aggro quite a bit, enough that my guildies could tell when I had bought each level of it even without telling them.  Though, after PB I believe defensive is the way to go.  Crits do not increase aggro, fero wasn't a large increase, and flurry just costs too many points.  Flurry is my plan right after I finish up defensive though, but with the cost to get it, you could buy large increases in defensive that help more imo.  The only aa I've seen that really increases aggro is PB (and flurry supposably does, once you max it (12 aa for CF3 which does jack for aggro, 18 for Flurry3, not sure how PoP Flurry scales)).</div></div><hr />

1.  There is a huge difference in having CS3/CA3 in PoP.  I'd do these first (LD is about 1 pct decrease per lvl per a quote on this board and below Tier 4 ain't the largest bang for the buck)<br />
<br />
2.  Ferocity and PB and Flurry all add nice DPS.  Ferocity increases double attack, PB adds a &quot;triple&quot; on 2 handers, and flurry adds 2 attacks on main hand..with all these and a good 2 hander its ~happy happy joy joy time.  <br />
<br />
However, I have seen the greatest increase in agro not from AAs but from equip; the GSOT is a godsend for pallie agro chain stunning.  Also 2 EB weapons comibined with a FB shield ONLY in Ruatha Bash mode also do the trick while in raid mode (FB shields acting as agro pumps).<br />
<br />
3.  Paladins tank old crap real nicely (they also tank new stuff quite nicely in exp groups).  The problem is that there are still in general a surplus of warrs in the game and for the most part there is always a warr around to tank.<br />

/shrug my opinions only yer mileagae will vary</div></div><hr />

From my viewpoint it's painfully apparant whenever a warrior without the offensive AA skills is tanking as compared to a warrior with them.<br />
<br />
Regarding AA skills, it's hard to tank reliably without the defensive skills as I've noticed from playing a healer, and it's hard to get solid aggro without the offensive skills is what I've seen from playing a wizard. The obvious answer would be to get them all :D Although, I have no idea in what order.<br />
<br />
Back when I was exp'ing Sscaley, I always maxed the defensive skills first, but I went back and got the offensive skills just the same, because with them the raid-dps (or group-dps) could be raised quite considerably compared to without them.</div></div><hr />
