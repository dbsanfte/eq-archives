Since the +6 and lower augs can't be sold, I'm assuming other droppable augs can't be sold either.</div></div><hr />

Been said a number of times, if the item doesn't have an &quot;adventure point&quot; cost, you can't sell it back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN normal dropped augs (+6 stat) - 25pp<br />
510 point cost aug (brilliant blood ruby of prowess, etc) - 500pp<br />
1150 point cost aug (marble sphere of ire) - 1000pp<br />
<br />
These were the only ones I bothered checking, but at least gives an indication of the final costs for some aug removals.</div></div><hr />

That is how you sell back augments and ldon gear.  <br />
As a pointless side note, it cost me 150p at 110 CHA to move my 12hp dropped augment. =p</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they're change this, currently they still aren't being bought back.  Looks like augment values have adjusted some, when i was switching around my augs I noticed that the 12 hp type7 augs that drop in ldon were class VI and the pre-nerf ones that were type all were IV.   Now the type7 ones are class IX and the typeAll ones are class VI.  The type8 version that Dible in sro traded out (not sure if he still does this after changes) are also class IX, not sure what they were before.   Kind of strange that in each case the all type aug is lower class than the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The solution to which of course, since they can't reassign a point value to prenerf RA and similar armor or else it'll pop back up on vendors, would be to allow turning in an unaugmented prenerf version to an NPC (Dible in sro works) and getting back a postnerf version to sell.</div></div><hr />
