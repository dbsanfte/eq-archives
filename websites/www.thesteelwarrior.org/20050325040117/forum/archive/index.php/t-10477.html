<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The dev's spoke thusly:<br />
<br />
In addition, while our tests have indicated that players are getting the intended 5% miss rate while using a single max-skill weapon against even level enemies (yes, we've tested this exhaustively, and cannot reproduce the 9% miss rate you're reporting for normal swings)<br />
<br />
I think we can all agree that we are no where near 5% as a miss rate. So I would like to get a testing thread going so we can get a good number of tests.<br />
<br />
Tonight I was in Felstone Field fighting the 50-52 undead there, with 4 54 Jibbering Ghouls in to dirty the data. <br />
<br />
Skill is 259 thoughout the sample. This is only for the default attack. No other attack types are considered. Screen shot can be provided.<br />
<br />
1172 swings<br />
154 misses (13.1%)<br />
35 Dodges (3.0%)<br />
18 Parries (1.5%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">remember that the dev said the 5% miss rate was for EVEN level ! he said nothing for its scaling to the +1-5 levels.<br />
BTW, what is your sample size ? (1172 isn't a huge number that permit RNG averages).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to say I don't know, as it was done real time and not via log parcing. I don't know of any log parcers or, in fact, if WOW creates combat logs. <br />
<br />
Given is pass/fail nature, you can speak with a high degree of confidence with 1000+ tries. And of course I know it was on even levels that the dev said that, hence the warning saying that I had a small number of level 54's in the sample. Given the drop rate on Minion's Scourgestones, and that I collected one stack, I would guestimate a mob sample size of 60.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.  I'm sure they're going to somehow roll some added miss rate on top of the base 5% no matter what the mob is.  It pretty much sucks, but I don't think it's worth fighting over at this point until the changes go through.  The tweak to the skills miss rate will hopefully help a lot.<br />
<br />
As for a mob that only dodges, sign me up. ^^</div></div><hr />

I believe /combatlog will turn on a combat log which goes into your WoW directory.  Not sure on the format or anything (haven't played with it yet), but I suspect a parser would be fairly easy to write for it.  I think getting that parser (may mess with it tonight) would be a great step in the right direction.<br />

<br />
You know if in the 2300+ swings that  I  have been tracking now, I had actually gotten my 2h skill to 2 god damned 60, I would parsed at 2 god damned 60. Sorry that in the first 40% of  52 I have not been able to get that last skill point.  If you want to tell me how to get it some other way that swinging the god damned sword I would be happy to &quot;make sure my weapon skill is maxed.&quot;<br />
<br />
259 Skill, 2h Sword again 50-52 Skelletons at Felstone Feild. The Majority of the sample is against Skeletal Flayers, level 50-51. There were 2-3 zombies in the sample (hence the parries). No mobs higher than 52 or lower than 50 were attacked. Did run from the @#$^ jibbering ghoul a couple of times.<br />
<br />
1202 swings<br />
141 Misses (11.7%)<br />
5 Parries (0.4%)<br />
48 Dodges (4.0%)<br />

Oh and thanks about combat log, that did work...now I just need to find a parser....</div></div><hr />

Ask and you shall recieve. Does not cover nearly all we can do, but a small sample to get you started. As a note, the log file is not written (or wasn't writen) until I quit the game (though I did not try just going to the character select screen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you realize this is more of the game lying to us. Its not really a miss but that is what we tell the client... <br />
<br />
How did you ever become one of the reputable people during EQ's early days making bullshit statements like this?  Lying to us?  You mean like those other &quot;lies&quot; (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=10346) you claimed were happening and you ended up eating shit on?<br />
<br />
Here's a fucking idea.  Stop using cosmos's goddamned parser.  There's no fucking way that thing is accurate, at all, fucking period.  Create a combat log and either analyze it yourself, or look for something reputable to do your tests with, or stop fucking doing them.  All you're doing right now is making yourself look dumb by creating faulty data sets and making up conclusions based upon them.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the last point of your skillup for your level will always come in the last 40% or so of your level.  You'll sit at 259 until you get over the halfway hump, and then you'll see it go up to 260 somewhere after that.  You'd think with all these astute observations you've been making lately, you could notice something like that in 50 some odd levels.<br />
<br />
And if you think I'm being pissy, or harsh, or whatever, then so be it.  You've been on a tyrade about some nonsense for the last month with absolutely ZERO proof of any of it, just minute data sets that you think proves something.  I've got zero issues with forming hypotheses or doing actual testing on in game scenarios, but stop with your bullshit conclusions of everything being broken or you being lied to unless you're 100% sure.  This game has been in the works for YEARS now, I don't think you're the one fucking person who's so far been able to see what everyone else can't.</div></div><hr />

me thinks you already know this, but I'll say it anyway.  swinging your sword would be the one and only way to skill up.  Yep, that last ones a major pain in the ass to get.  I'll bet you a wooden nickle they did that on purpose.  I can tell you that everytime I've finally got that last kill point my miss rate got better.  Of course I dinged a few bubs later =O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Haass in my book telling me I get 2 stamina means I should get the regular benefits of 2 stamina--otherwise its dishonest.<br />
<br />
You are right, though you don't say it, that I don't provide a context for the lastest one. Here it is: the devs speak again (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=1123852&amp;P=2) .<br />
<br />
When fighting against mobs that do not dodge or parry, those events still actually happen, but are translated into &quot;misses&quot; by the UI. While there are some other subtle but important differences between humanoids with weapons and/or shields and other types of enemies (like beasts, elementals, etc), the translation of &quot;dodge&quot; and &quot;parry&quot; into &quot;miss&quot; is an important factor in ensuring that fighting a giant spider is relatively equivalent to fighting against a humanoid of the same level that is using a weapon/shield.<br />
<br />
and a bit later<br />
<br />
Another key factor players should be aware of when considering the 5% base miss chance is their position relative to the enemy. If your character is positioned in the 180 degree rear arc of the enemy, any of the times that the enemy would have dodged/parried if you were in front of them are translated into &quot;misses&quot; instead. This can often lead players to believe that they're getting more then their expected number of &quot;misses&quot;, when in actuality it was a combination of misses, dodges, and parries. <br />
<br />
So yeah, we get lied to. Past that I haven't drawn any conclusions. The tighter testing of the second sample may help. Miss rate still looks high to me though--but the sample is probably too small  to say. Assuming parries happen at the same rate as dodges (about 4%) leaves me at 7% miss rate against mostly 50-51 mobs. I am inclined--pending more testing--to agree we do seem to have a 5% base miss rate. Not that you can tell from testing yet though.</div></div><hr />

I think you are being more than a little harsh on Blizz in light of how they were forced to push WoW out the door before it was ready.  I really dont believe they are intentially lieing to the playerbase.  They aint talking a lot (and thats been getting better of recent) but tis better to be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt.<br />
<br />
I'd rather they focus on server stability any day of the week, and twice on Sundays (where it seems to be most needed lmfao) than work on their doc's.  I do think they need to give us a clearer detail of how exactly things work.  I hated the stupid guessing games in EQ when it came to how things worked.  But I'd rather wait until they are ready than force them into another rush job simply to appease the masses.</div></div><hr />

The dodge thing is huge. I love overpower. I have talent points spent to give it a 50% crit rate. I have points spent to give crits dots. I have talent points spent to in crease the amount of damage on a crit. It feels (and I I am fairly sure that testing would bear it out) like I kill things that dodge faster than things that don't.<br />
<br />
Oh but you are behind the mob... it would have dodge it you were in front, but...well the clinet wont let you know that that miss was really a dodge. With 2h an over power can hit for as much as a low rage exicute.<br />
<br />
Being EQ trained, if I am not the MT, I would generally not put myself in front of a mob. Heck I woudl assume--like EQ--that hit rates were higher from behind because mobs can't dodge or parry, when in fact you fuck yourself if you move behind the mob--because you still pay the penelty of a dodge/parry/block, but don't get the benefit of it (overpower, retaliation, the rogue disarm talent).</div></div><hr />

Yea I love Overpower too.  i'm almost to the point where I can hit it without looking at my keys when i see the 'Dodge' go up over the mobs head in white.  I cant recall ever seeing it light up on a 'Miss'.  More evidence to game bugs it would seem.<br />

They'll get fixed, eventually.<br />

<br />
While it has many issues with producing actual DPS figures ( this isn't unusual, doing this is neither as obvious nor as straightforward as you might think at first glance ) I haven't run across any evidence that cosmos miscounts the number of 'hit' and 'miss' events for default attacks. Getting an 'all' summary is misleading as, for example, it's impossible to miss with a shield spike hit or a shield bash silence, but the individual categories seem solid.<br />
<br />
On the second point, I got most of my last points of weapon skill immediately after dinging the next level ;p. While I would like to suggest that this was because they like 'rubbing it in' I'd suspect it's more than the chance to skillup depends primarily on how far your skill is from max.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I think forcing you to miss more on mobs that don't have dodge is a fairly nasty kludge. Just give them more hp - if this screws casters who cares ? I don't see any complaints about how low resist high AF mobs are unfair to warriors ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm loving the mentality here.  People still expect things to be exactly like EQ, including the whole &quot;stay behind the mob for higher DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way, from the way it seems to be designed IMO, you'll have the same DPS no matter what angle to come from without counting special attacks.  If the mob cannot dodge from behind, and the game will instead translate that as a miss because it can't be a dodge, then I guess you're just going to have to get over the &quot;from behind&quot; mentality and change your tactics.<br />
<br />
They are allowed to deviate from EQ, you know.  Just because you want it to be the same as it was from there, doesn't mean they're lying to you because they don't explain every little aspect of the game for your perusal so you don't have to learn anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the &quot;shadow dodge&quot; misses from behind were NOT obvious or, in my opinion, discoverable without developer revelation.<br />
<br />
In EQ, riposte was a game mechanic that was obvious and observable. It isn't in WoW (cheer!) and we will adapt. I'm not sure who you find in this thread that is exhibiting this &quot;mentality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, I didn't stay behind the mob *because* of EQ's riposte feature. I stayed behind a mob because it would then be obvious to the main tank that I've overaggro'd and he should probably taunt it off me while I stop attacking... not to mention obvious benefits of flanking due to cleaving mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has nothing to do with EQ and everything to do with it being counter intuative, illogical, stupid and mean. Are you saying that if you were in a 2 on 1 fight in real life that you would not try and get behind your opponent because you thought there was an advantage?<br />
<br />
Not everything has to be EQ. But things should be logical--and in the case of attacking from behind EQ is logical. And WoW is not. Or do you like the idea of what should be an intuative advantage, is for warriors actually a disadvantage?</div></div><hr />

I'd rather they focus on server stability any day of the week, and twice on Sundays (where it seems to be most needed lmfao) than work on their doc's.  I do think they need to give us a clearer detail of how exactly things work.  I hated the stupid guessing games in EQ when it came to how things worked.  But I'd rather wait until they are ready than force them into another rush job simply to appease the masses.<br />
<br />
The guessing game is a whole meta-game in itself. The developers know this, and for this reason, I'm sure that they likely hold those cards close. Many people, myself included, find the decipering of game mechanics to be fun and challenging way to play to the game. It is the definition of powergamer. If everything in the game was explained completely and fully then part of the magic in these games goes away. Mystery is a very powerful tool that game developers use to make thier worlds more interesting. I, for one, agree.</div></div><hr />

To some extent I agree with you but there are limits.  How many times was the &quot;How does taunt work?&quot; question answered on these boards?  People arent gonna guess, they are gonna ask and most likely someone will answer.  So unless you are going to ignore what other players have found out, there's little guesswork involved these days.  What little information the dev's try to hold back gets parsed anyways.<br />
<br />
The mystery spell descriptions and hidden &quot;features&quot; of the spells in WoW are kinda gay.  Not kinda, very.  Quite a few players I've met had no clue the &quot;I Win&quot; button paladins get is a massive debuff self dispell castable by while silenced.  Sure couldnt glean that from its description.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there is one constant on this board, and in life, it's that I'm an asshole.  Of that, I will not hide.<br />
<br />
However, I've also done everything in my power to keep TSW what it is -- the class site where actual game KNOWLEDGE is traded and discussed, rather than bullshit class envy/whine rants are &quot;/signed&quot; by every idiot who plays the game.  Whenever non factual information is posted in a manner which clearly is designed to be factual, that's where we need to reel shit back in.  Blatantly saying that the game lies to us, on anything, with a data set as small as levels 1-3 of the rogue class, is unnacceptable.  That's not the way to go about finding information, nor is it the way to be displaying theories.  <br />
<br />
Many of us put up hours of our own time in game to discover and test the way game mechanics work, in order to verify the truth of our statements, and to start all that over with knee jerk reactions to everything that doesn't look right at first glance is just a disservice to this board and this community.  You wanna go thru and chart people's hit points from 1-60, or if you want to beat on mobs the exact same level with you for 5 hours with a priest, that's one things, but this crap posted with insignificant data sets isn't doing us any fucking good at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So there's this debate going on among body parts of a human as to who should be the boss. The brain has obvious superiority and it wants to be the boss cause it knows everything and figures out everything for the rest. The heart claims it pumps blood and is vital for life. Then the liver, stomach, kidneys and other body parts start explaining about their importance. Sitting quietly all the while, suddenly the asshole speaks up. The asshole demands to be the boss but for no real reason. Everyone else mock the asshole and tell him to shut the fuck up. The asshole gets angry and goes on strike by blocking itself up as a protest. As time passes all other organs start to get sick. The brain above all. So the brain steps down from his authority and humbly requests the asshole to take charge.<br />
<br />
Moral: It doesn't really need to have the brains as boss, any asshole will do.</div></div><hr />

Are you saying that if you were in a 2 on 1 fight in real life that you would not try and get behind your opponent because you thought there was an advantage?<br />
<br />
In real life, no.  But then again, I don't have an ability like Overpower in real life.  This changes things, you realize...<br />
<br />
If I had an ability like Overpower in Real Life that gave me an advantage over someone who could dodge my attacks (that was a higher benefit than what I would receive from behind), and I knew they wouldn't be able to dodge my attacks from behind (being as they couldn't see my attacks and therefor couldn't actively dodge them), then yes...I would try not to get behind them.  That would put myself at a clear disadvantage, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that logical and intuitive enough for you?  Abilities like this change the rules.  This is a game, where things can have rules that don't follow in Real life.  (Really now, a gun/bow that doesn't disable/kill a human in 5 hits from an expert hunter, even naked?)  The point is to learn how the game works and adapt.<br />
<br />
Everything Kalgan said specifically states that you should have the same overall DPS from every angle.  The game will just turn the dodges, parries, etc into misses to make sure this happens.  Okay, that's what was decided on.  Learn and live.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there limits. Your right people aren't gonna guess, even if that means someone has to sit down and do hours of parsing to get the answers, but someone did have to do that before it becomes community knowledge. Its the reason I come here. I know that if I have a question that needs an answer i can look here or post my finding and they will be reviewed with a critical eye. I'm sure thats why many of us come here.<br />
<br />
That and to watch Haass tear into some hapless noob, or Glatius... but he can do that, because he's an asshole as much as he's right, which is kinda frightening...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More on topic, I think you will agree somewhat with the people complaining about Warrior miss rate. You will experience this soon on your own once you're past level 50 and fight even con or +1 lvl / +2 mobs with higher dps weapons. Fighting in Tanaris everything is right, the miss rates aren't obvious, until you move to higher level zones. I experienced this in plaguelands last night fighting lvl 51 / 52 undead mobs (as a lvl 50 with 255 weapon skill). I was missing like 15 times in a fight on an average while dual wielding Thrash Blade and Sword of Serenity. I have a ring that gives me +1% chance to hit (unequipping which made the miss rate a bit worse). Although I didn't parse I was missing like 30-40% of the time while dual wielding. It was disappointing to see strings of misses, lots of missed Thrash Blade double attacks. Then I switched to my 42.5 dps 2hander (Blade of the Titans) and the miss rate was just gone.<br />
<br />
My theory is that its an inbuilt dps limiting mechanism. It makes sense to me because Thrash Blade is a crazy weapon and when coupled with another good offhander it can very easily out dps my Blade of the Titans. I don't have time to actually parse but this is all according to my observation. Seeing this I feel it was a mistake to put talent points into flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DW miss rate IS a balancing factor put in by the devs. They have said so (I beleive its in the long post, where they talk about balancing the weapons). <br />
<br />
Here is the dev quote:<br />
<br />
With regard to dual wielding, I'd like to clarify how it works and its intent. First, we do obviously realize that DW has a significantly higher miss rate, and that the offhand weapon does not deal its full damage. This is done to keep DW in direct DPS balance with using 2h weapons, and to ensure that both 2h and DW are well balanced in total effect against 1h+shield.<br />
<br />
Everything Kalgan said specifically states that you should have the same overall DPS from every angle. The game will just turn the misses, parries, etc into misses to make sure this happens. Okay, that's what was decided on. Learn and live.<br />
<br />
Not at all. (And rogues would be quite surprised to hear they are supposed to be able to do as much damage from every angle.) Then again what he said was:<br />
<br />
1. When fighting against mobs that do not dodge or parry, those events still actually happen, but are translated into &quot;misses&quot; by the UI. While there are some other subtle but important differences between humanoids with weapons and/or shields and other types of enemies (like beasts, elementals, etc), the translation of &quot;dodge&quot; and &quot;parry&quot; into &quot;miss&quot; is an important factor in ensuring that fighting a giant spider is relatively equivalent to fighting against a humanoid of the same level that is using a weapon/shield.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall him saying that they did not dodge/parry from the back so that players wouldn't feel cheated, but I can't find that myself. <br />
<br />
At the core, Kaesorn is that you and I disagree as to what should be obivous, assumed knowledge in the player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to recall having put in something about Rogues being the exception due to Backstab...must have accidently removed it.  Anyhow, I'm referring to the &quot;miss&quot; rate, or rather the &quot;attack failure&quot; as it should be put.  The &quot;avoidance&quot; of the mobs.  I'm sorry if I wasn't clear on that.  Kalgan has already stated that special attacks have a higher miss rate than intended due to a bug, so I'm leaving that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO there is something wacky going on in eastern plaguelands which isn't really explained by the miss = parry explanation. <br />
<br />
At 60 with 300 weaponskill, fighting mostly level 56-58 mobs my miss rate ran around 11.5%, even though all of them can dodge, the dodge rate was only 1.3%. <br />
<br />
That they are invisibly parrying more than 7% of all hits seems somewhat implausible. If it includes invisible block as well it's still oddly high compared to dodge, and plus that *is* grounds for feeling cheated given I am hitting the little buggers for 400 damage a whack, getting a miss instead of a block for 40 seems a little off ;p<br />
<br />
P.S. Yes I realise about the banshees and the ghouls - not fighting either of them this run.</div></div><hr />
