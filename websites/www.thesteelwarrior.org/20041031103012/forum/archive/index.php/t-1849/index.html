<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm sure it's not really an aggro reducer, i seem to remember the spell description for enraging blow when BoC was first discovered was something like &quot;reduce aggro multiplier by 700&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Breogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They changed recently the way aggro modifiers work.<br />
<br />
100% is the base modifier. Anything under 100% is an aggro increasing (100 - Buff %) and above 100% is aggro decreasing, so that would be a 15% aggro buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NorokFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's 3% more than Voice of Thule, the highest aggro buff SKs have... add to that the fact that its worn so it is a permenant effect. it's pretty impressive.</div></div><hr />

For those of you that cry about the loss of stacking with VoT, you really need to look for problems elsewhere if you cant maintain aggro with EoA and weapons at that stage of the game.</div></div><hr />

I think all the complaining is crazy. Anyone of you know dam well you love to have that BP and would wear it with pride so why not admit its nice and be happy for once.<br />
<br />
I agree HP and shielding should be bumped some but that isn't a complaint about the BP at all. I would certainly have it in its current form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because a piece of gear is nice and would be an upgrade to what i'm wearing doesn't mean that it's not a complete piece of shit based upon other gear in the game.<br />
<br />
People at SoE have ADMITTED that Enraging blow was a bandaid fix to warrior aggro issues...they put it in the game and then intended to look at it later down the line.  Now some retard did the exact same fuckin thing with yet ANOTHER piece of gear that 98% of the warriors in the game will never see, and pretty soon retards are gonna be saying on this board &quot;Well, I hold aggro fine with a Raex Chestplate and a BoW, maybe you just need better gear&quot; and then i'm gonna have to ask them if they ate a lot of paint chips as a child or what.<br />
<br />
Second, you just wait and see what the Knight BP is, and you keep telling yourself that you're 30hp better than they are.  Just keep ignoring their manapool and what they can do with it and HOW WE GAVE UP A MANAPOOL TO BE A GODDAMNED TANK.<br />
<br />
This is garbage, complete and utter garbage.  If you don't see it, you're a fool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you read my post you will see I agree it could be upgraded, maybe 275hp which is what I thought it would be anyway having seen the monk 2hb from time so long ago.<br />
<br />
I am just saying the complaining and bitching isn't needed. I think this BP could have been MUCH worse than it is. The fact that it has an agro effect on it at all is a good thing and of course like you said most will never see it but its the best war BP in the game. Surely you dont expect every Tom, Dick and Harry to have one. You dont get to the point in the game where you can get one of these without alot of time invested and hard work. I think that should account for something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am just saying the complaining and bitching isn't needed. I think this BP could have been MUCH worse than it is.  <br />
<br />
Just because something isn't bottom of the line doesn't mean it's not garbage.  The effect is nothing but yet another bandaid for a broken system.  Compare the HP to the Hp on the bard BP and tell yourself that you give up all that utility for 30hp.  That riposte mod won't do shit, and the shielding is pathetic compared to other shielding items being farmed out of time.<br />
<br />
Yes, I guess it couldda been ac 20, 45hp, but i'm not grateful that it wasn't, and that doesn't make this incarnation of it any less of a slap in the face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You guys seriously need to stop looking at every item that drops as &quot;this is all we get to balance warrior??!?!?&quot;.  No, this breastplate is not the fucking warrior balancing package.  It's an item, and as a breastplate it's a huge upgrade to any breastplate out now.  The effect/mods are far better than any of the other melee breastplates so far.  Bard and Rogue breastplates have no worn effect that compares with this.  As far as the AC/hps go, well they're in line with the rest of the Raex gear.  The gap between other classes is too small, but this is an issue across all high-end items and I wouldn't really expect this one to be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well i'm sorry Brutul, but until they balance us correctly and stop giving us shit like Enraging Blow, Furious Bash, and Echo of Anger to attempt to keep our minds off our inherent problems,  then i'm gonna bitch, and i'm perfectly justified in doing so.<br />
<br />
Balance warriors and those become nifty little effects to grant a bonus above and beyond our capabilities to those uber enough to acquire them. Until then, the top 2% of the server benefits and the rest of us sit around with our thumbs up our asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Raex armor doesn't compare to Plane of Time armor.  There must be another Breastplate down the line somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I hear your frustration Haass when did they ever say the elemental BP would  fix any classes problems?<br />
<br />
Every class has been a little disapointed with their elemental BP/robe thus far. Bards complaining about the instrument mod, rogues saying Dodge does nothing and so on. I believe they will change these to but maybe the reason we are the redheaded stepchild of Sony is because everytime they try to throw us a bone we bitch and complain. Whats the point is their take I would imagine and I have to agree. I dont think any dev could make something that would be praised by all because people want to complain, its human. Be happy for every little thing they do to make us better even if it isn't the &quot;Ultimate End all&quot; fix.<br />
<br />
I agree all warriors could use a boost in the mid game but I also think I should be able to drive a BMW and yet I drive Chrysler. Those who drive BMWs worked to get that and I didn't so how can I expect to have the same thing. <br />
<br />
A little bandaid is better than no bandaid at all is my point bro.<br />
<br />
More weapons should have hate procs on them and be easier to get with lesser stats for those who don't raid but things you can get with 6 people should never be on par with things that take 60 people to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">all that is needed to understand why this item, among so many others, is INFURIATING to many warriors - is to look at class BPs over time.<br />
<br />
how many hp advantage did a warrior BP have over a paladin BP throughout the expansions?<br />
<br />
The answer will surprise and disgust you.  I made up a neat little table, but html is not allowed here, so make your own.<br />
<br />
But I will summarize.  Early BPs gave paladins how many hitpoints? ZERO.  they got mana INSTEAD.  all pre-pop class-specific BP's gave warriors a HP advantage of between 50-150 hp over paladins (and if you express this as a % difference, a better comparison, it becomes even more apparant).  In other words, back when getting 50 hp on an item was incredible, paladins got ZERO (crafted vs. ro).  and when getting 75 hp on an item became incredible, paladins got like 30 (indo vs. valorium).<br />
<br />
Then PoP hit, and someone at SOE decided &quot;fuck class balance, fuck warriors&quot;.<br />
<br />
And now we are left with a BARD BP having only 30 hp less than a warrior one.  I predict the paladin one will have only 10 hp less than the warrior one.  (Compare this to the Indocilite vs. Valorium comparison.  Then once you finish crying, as am I, over what verant has done to warriors, re read my post.  When did we move from having a MASSIVE gear-based hp advantage to having almost none?)<br />
<br />
Hey, whevers in charge of this stuff over at Sony?  just die.  seriously, there is no advice you can take at this point that would make you see the light.  just die.<br />
<br />
To be in keeping with the gear that has existed in the game prior to this, the hybrid BP's need to have, at MOST, half the total hp from the warrior one.  make the best hybrid BP 15 sta and 120 hp and I'll accept this one.  leave the hybrids BPs as they are, and why do we have warriors again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
                 Get a gripe jesus the bp is perfectly balanced compared to other bps. You have 30 more hp and 13 more ac  than the bard bp which is in line with the rest of the elems set. Paladin bp will guess what? have the same hp than bard one. The effect on warrior bp is the best out of all the BP, so you consider an effect that increase your aggro by 15% permanently a joke? <br />
<br />
                  Honestly its great to read that some warriors are at least a bit real when they post because some of you lost contact with that thing called class balance. Bard bp doesn't even have a fucking effect at all. The only thing I would change on that BP would be to give 5 or 6% shielding because 2% is sad but then 2% shielding totally own the 7% stun resist that is on the bard BP. Ya warrior class need fix but what you are asking for is completly unbalanced. <br />
<br />
                  PS: Warrior fixes are coming(in theory) I m sure if you are in thedojo channel you know what I m talking about.<br />
<br />
                  PS2: During Velious bard BP had 30 less hp than war one, eradication had the same stats. During luclin there was no class only BP so there was 0 advantage, what are you complaining about again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">everyone loves them ambiguities..&quot;it's comin it's comin see you should know what i'm talkin' about i gots the l33t b3taz inf0z&quot;<br />
<br />
lies i tell ya. lies. :D<br />
<br />
the BP is...OK at best. nothing eye-opening but depending on what is worn pre-PoT ( usually 60AC-80AC or so ) ... i guess it's about right. Pretty much every step up in gear from ye auld crafted BP up to Raex's ( crafted with sta+hp's, indo with more AC+more stats, cobalt/thurg/ss/kael that has the first click effect, VT with lots of stats and innate modifiers, Elem with allegedly the best in all mods+stats ) has been about 20AC and 75 or so HP's + other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ignore the other BPs and effects.<br />
<br />
I won’t even bother with the HP% gap.<br />
<br />
What is revolting about this BP is simple.<br />
<br />
This BP will screw over everyone that does not have it, and those that do have it and eventually want to upgrade it.<br />
<br />
Even if it is not intended to do so, this BP will be a balancing factor for the warrior class.<br />
<br />
Contrary to some people’s opinions, the high end of the game is not vacuum-sealed from the lower end.<br />
<br />
The game is shot at the lower levels of the game because of shit like this BP. You may think &quot;wtf I never had this shit when I was lower.&quot; And you would be right. You also did not have the possibility or the code changes that went along with such items that do effect everyone, despite the fact that not everyone gets said items.<br />
<br />
Just ask engineers what happens when you try and add on to a tower that has its foundation cracked.<br />
<br />
I'm done explaining this, if you don't have the idea now you never will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will this fix warriors ? No<br />
Will this make VI retards think &quot;Warriors are fixed&quot; ? Yes<br />
<br />
And please Kinu dont give me any &quot;its balanced&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting 3 more ac, and 10hp over paladin bracer is bullshit.<br />
Specially considering her gets 130 extra mana.<br />
I wont mention IH4 &amp; MP4 focus on arms/boots<br />
<br />
I get what ? 20ac 100hp over a hybrid ? While he get all those nifty focus<br />
And what ? 1500-2000 mana ?  (PS  With Shield+1H he wins)<br />
<br />
Hybrids have gotten insanely overpowered once they get a hold<br />
on elemetal armor. Dont pretend its not the case.<br />
<br />
When i see hybrid armor i get shafted. <br />
When i see PoT loot feel i'm getting shafted.<br />
When i look at the stats on this BP i feel i'm getting shafted.<br />
<br />
When i look at the effect, i'm happy, but i know on the long run.<br />
I will get shafted because of it. (hence there is no class balance issue)<br />
<br />
When i look at the Shield 2. I know i'm getting shafted (see CT legs).<br />
<br />
When i got BoW i was &quot;Oh shit this is nuts&quot;<br />
When i saw RZTW blade i was &quot;Dear god, this is insane&quot;<br />
<br />
That was looking at the game on a micro level or a macro level.<br />
<br />
Raex BP is great, almost insane on a micro level.<br />
But once get a global view, it looses its aura.<br />
<br />
Take out the worn agro effect, which i am convinced will end up<br />
as another &quot;EB prosthetics&quot;  that BP is rather disapointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the point of the game where you get this BP, 30hp is nothing. And since bards can wear everything a warrior can (minus BP and main hand slot) there isn't a big enough increase to make us stand out as the &quot;premier tanks&quot;. Face it. We're getting shafted on this. And while the effect is the best we've seen on the BPs, that doesn't get rid of the fact that it's a fucking crutch for us. SoE isn't trying to fix us, they're trying to make us forget there's a problem in the first place.<br />

<br />
This is absolutely ludicrous to say. More shielding isn't that much to ask for. If you think that's unbalanced, then it seems like you haven't been paying attention much.<br />
<br />
Warrior fixes are coming(in theory) I m sure if you are in thedojo channel you know what I m talking about<br />
<br />
Sure they are.<br />
<br />
During Velious bard BP had 30 less hp than war one, eradication had the same stats. During luclin there was no class only BP so there was 0 advantage, what are you complaining about again?<br />
<br />
Back during Velious, everything was worth more. Every HP counted, because no one was at the maxed HP yet for CH to not fill you up all the way. And I bet if you made the dream magelo for a pally and a warrior with only the armor available in each expansion, I'm almost positive you'll see about a 15-20% increase in HP from a warrior over a paladin. In Luclin it'll be a little bit less. Now since we're in PoP, Furor said it best...<br />
<br />
&quot;PAL/SHD can now fill every SLOT on their characters with IDENTICAL TO WARRIOR gear except for the BREASTPLATE which has 15 fewer HPS. <br />
<br />
That means that a WARRIOR has a FIFTEEN (15) HIT POINT advantage in GEAR over a HYBRID TANK.<br />
<br />
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? *does some Sign language*&quot;<br />
<br />
15 hp is balanced? About as balancing as Oprah on a pogo stick.</div></div><hr />
