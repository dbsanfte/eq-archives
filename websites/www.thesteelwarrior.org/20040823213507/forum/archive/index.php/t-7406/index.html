<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
Since I'm probably going to spend either tonight working on RZtW or clearing Vex Thall, I'm really keen to know how the mob-in-wall and collision problems are after the patch on 6/2.  I'm still at work so I won't find out first hand until I log in and try to tank something.<br />
<br />
So, what's the scoop peeps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure how relevant it is, but on Test last night we did a backflagging run on Mith Marr and didn't have any issues with walls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems ok so far.  I tanked Magmaton, Babnoxis and the birds away from walls to be safe then tried pushing the odd mob into the wall at the castle and they didn't go through, cornered Reparm, he went into the wall briefly but was easy to remove - so seems ok so far if not perfect.  Not had any mobs half under the world either.  Finally!  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VT seems fixed - DXXT gave no problems.<br />
<br />
Emperor went into the wall once but could drag him back out without getting summoned to zonein etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">XPing in PoV w/ my bot crew still left mobs half stuck in walls =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killed mephits in PoN and cornertanked Guardian of the Seal with no problems today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killed mephits in PoN and cornertanked Guardian of the Seal with no problems today.<br />
<br />
That's good to hear since I'm about to head into the Hole myself to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the wandering mob near DXXT went into wall and summoned me to zone, then we cornered DXXT in his room without problems, also walled cursed earlier without problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Observed no walling problems in Uqua so that was nice. <br />
<br />
Did have 3-4 people(out of 50) complaining about getting stuck on walls running through KT though, and claiming /rewind didnt work. <br />
<br />
I had no problems myself other than climbing some staircases as a tripple shrinked ogre was slightly annoying. Hard to describe, but it felt &quot;bumpy&quot; and I could see through the stairs between &quot;bumps&quot;, sort of breaks any immersive feeling you might otherwise have, when you can see through the geometry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The mobs aren't so much the problem as where it puts the melee. I had to use rewind to get out of the corner in the Hole after the GoTS kill aswell as the pally who got in the corner with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did Grieg tonight. One bodyguard in the wall, waited for it to pop out.<br />
<br />
Grieg's knockback made it a bit irritable, seeing thru walls. I was sitting stunned in one corner and got hit with his knockback again, I repopped at the next lower corner on the stairwell.<br />
<br />
I'd say that was alot better than zone in.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I keep noticing that i tend to crouch/duck whenever i stand right next to a wall. Gets annoying fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you can turn that off in options i beleive because the same thing was annoying me about a week ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, we corner tanked everything in VT tonight, no problemo.<br />
<br />
Fixed in my mind until proven otherwise :)<br />
<br />
~Ernie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did get stuck in the wall once tonight but /rewind got me out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In time tonite mobs were still getting into the walls where u could not hit them.  We were able to pull them out.   Corner tanking was somewhat problematic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Babs got stuck in the wall in fire tonight.<br />
<br />
People were getting stuck all along the wall in Fire, moving to tables from birds.<br />
<br />
Cornering/walling in Fire is still broken for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agnarr got pushed into wall where he couldn't be hit, we were able to pull him out but not before he summoned me and I fell through the world and died. Pretty much everything on the Saryrn event was cornerable though (Torment).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Corner tanked in VT fine tonight. No issues with mobs warping etc..<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
Almost all the melees were getting stuck on those ledges halfway up the wall during the aten and mini-aten knockbacks. /Rewind fixed it but it was still a nuisance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only thing I've done since the patch was a low level LDoN with troll SK alt. Had no problems, but realized part way through that positioning things in the middle of the room has become oddly automatic, heh. Anyway, there was no need to corner anything.<br />
However, I was pulling and a few times the doors between rooms would close on me. Before, I could get stuck when that happened; last night, though, had no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">guild had problems with cursed last night after patch too.<br />
<br />
Apparently got stuck in wall, and couldn't hit .. so proceeded to summon people and kill 1 at a time.<br />
<br />
I wasn't there, but what they told me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We took Emp last night and it was fine for most of the fight.  We walked him back and forth along the wall to the right looking into the room toward the throne.  At one point he got pinned against the torch pillar on that wall (MA on other side of pillar, Emp on other with raid force behind him).  Myself and one of the other tanks got knocked back (never seen emp knockback before) and stuck on a ledge, but ducked / jumped out of it.  <br />
<br />
At around 4 percent he got pushed into the wall.  We all backed off to see if he'd come out, he summoned a BL pet, which got /pet offed eventually.  Then he summoned me into the wall.  /rewind gave some message about how I had to try again in a second, and then when I did it again I ended up at the safe spot.  <br />
<br />
So, it looks like its better, but not totally fixed.  If you're big on cornering, I'd have a plan b in place to deal with your mob getting walled.</div></div><hr />
