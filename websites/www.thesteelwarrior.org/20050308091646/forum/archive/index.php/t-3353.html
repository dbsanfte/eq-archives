<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goern</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really getting annoyed that we are such fodder for the comic. Both from the aspect of our class having such issues as to make it a target, and from the insult that our daily lives are now a running joke. Even in my own guild I have seen references publicly to myself as a &quot;coffeemaker&quot;. This offends my honor. I have openly stated that there are some issues on agro and on the lack of any real advantage left to our class after the Warrior-ication of the knights. I have never bitched, whined, complained, cried, or been a lily livered sissy on the subject. Still, the comments come in, and are more of an insult than a objective commentary of our issues within the game. I am not claiming that Woody intends them as such, or that Some people are not just teasing. I don't like being teased. Teasing is a socially acceptable insult. I have called out people on the subject of teasing before, both in game and in life. It's one thing to make a joke, it's another to have a hard edge to it, at someone's expense. Now, Woody is doing us a minor favor by raising the awareness of the issue with the EQ public, but at the same time we end up with catchy insults that are easily thrown with as much vigor as &quot;ranger down&quot;. A minor favor for enduring some dishonoring and removing some of our good name. <br />
<br />
Note, I don't use &quot;ranger down&quot;. Only insult I use in game is, WTB Pure heart of a Paladin, extremely rare. WTS tarnished heart of a paladin, 4cp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing that strikes me (maybe wrong) but if all the class boards are saying the same thing 'warriors are broke' then sooner or later it just cant be ignored anymore and some good may come from it.<br />
<br />
If GU helps to spread even more awareness that cant be a bad thing surely ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Goern. It has been stated more then once, Woody plays a warrior. He is also very popular and gets noticed by SOE. He isn't cracking jokes at our class, he is making a point that we are in dire need of some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woody</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's true Georn. I have never even played a secondary class. I have ONLY played a warrior. Even back during my Vallon Zek days, when that meant getting ganked every other zone because I had absolutely no way of protecting myself against pure casters.<br />
<br />
I know the &quot;CoffeeMaker&quot; comments have gotten their fair share of mouth time since I made that comic, but right now, it truly is an effort to force everyone to speak up.<br />
<br />
How many boards have rants and tirades about the inneffectiveness of Warriors, with a list of ideas of how to make them better?<br />
<br />
Like they say, no publicity it bad publicity, even if that means we get called CoffeeMakers for a while.<br />
<br />
I do apologize if it wounds your honor. But, atleast people are talking about it right? We've been crippled for how long now? Since Velious? It's time SOE, got off their butts and fixed the CORNER STONE class of EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get insulted by this...the worst thing you can do in a game is loose your sense of levity.  Ya it hurts having friends kid you about your class but at the end of the day its just a game.  Personally I was around during the first couple of months 1999 and man we had it *bad* then.  I don't mind GU at all....he tends to pick on all of us equally over time heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goern</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woody, I have read your comic for the length of my EQ days. I appreciate your comments. I have laughed my butt off. When I read your line &quot;coffeemakers&quot; I said Ouch. Hit a bit close to home. I have been moved from MA right off the assist list unless it's a /defensive mob within the last month in a guild that swore to utilize warriors as MA's exclusively because that was their purpose. In front of me, I see a Paladin, a Shadowknight. Now, I will freely admit I can be stiff necked and proud. I am stubborn enough that I refuse to play my alts, and keep banging my head against the monitor in search of groups or such. When I finally get a group as a level 65 warrior of moderate accomplishments... Well, within the last week a guildmate stated that after I left the chanter said &quot;well he sucked, can we get something better than that Gimpass?&quot; This drew some anger from me because I had actually had a decent number of procs with my epic and on the complete LDoN adventure, I was the only casualty, and had very little difficulty with agro for a blessed moment and I had left feeling good about myself. This was crushed out the next time I logged in and got, as they say, the rest of the story. <br />
Honestly, the comments on chicken-fu were disturbingly accurate with my bad luck. Heh, at level 64 I was running from FV through DL's on my way to chardok, and wasn't really paying attention. My invis chose to sputter out as I was about half way through the zone, and I started to gather a few mobs. I didn't pay much attention though, because I was in the middle of guild raid setup chat, and I look down and I am at half life. I blinked and looked and I managed to get a rager and a a few spiders and a horde of chickens behind me. I say, ok, I am a big guy now, no problem... and started destroying them. Only problem was, more kept arriving faster than I was killing them. It was like there was some sort of dispatcher calling out, Level 64 warrior down to 40%, send in the chickens!! At 20 I made for the BW's line and ended up smashed and dead about 4 steps from the zoneline. A few days later the chicken-fu ran... My guild kindly linked it at our site and said that it was so Goern-ish. I sighed, and took it on the chin, knowing that at least someone else has that kinda issue. <br />
It's no fault of yours that Warriors are having these issues. Actually, I do appreciate your bringing it out as fully as you have. I just wish that you weren't quite so quotable... <br />
<br />
To the rest, I know, I know, I am a grumpy old warrior. Heck, Stuborn enough to make a human warrior and stick with it cause it's what I wanted. Yay, humans, no abilities and crappy scores. Yay warriors and them turning every other melee class into a warrior with skills and powers. Yay to SoE for being my best friend ever!<br />
My favorite line was still, We addressed all melee, bringing Knights inline with their mitigation and damage. We increased all melee... well, except for warriors, who were balanced before the changes and working as intended. Ya... I am working as intended...</div></div><hr />

His often thought provoking comics really make quite a statement to q very broad audience of EQ players from all angles.<br />

My guild has ran with the jokes, not changed the way they do things.  Yes, I still get asked &quot;should we get a Paladin to tank&quot; when I join pickup groups, but I also get...&quot;Scale, Lord is up in PoS, we need coffee bad.....we ran out of rangers to sacrafice&quot;  Then I go and tank my thing. (When the guilds main tanks are away, the other warriors shall play).  Publicity is Publicity.  I do not think any harm can possibly come from this.  Heck, what will they do?  Take away our spellbooks?  Anyhow.  Good stuff woody, dont play any of the other games, but its still comical.<br />

P.S. I have the upmost respect for good Rangers.....but the others are sacrafice for the loot gods</div></div><hr />

If I wanted to do that, I'd cater more to the WoW community who are lighting up my referrer list over just a few comics.<br />
<br />
My only goal right now with warrior comics is to poke at the SOE folks. They do read them. Hell, they print them out and hang them in their cubicles/offices. They also read through my forums where I address each comic and talk about the issue I'm illustrating.<br />
<br />
I thought I was helping.</div></div><hr />

When it's spreading a common message/feeling in an attempt to help others, it's a good thing man.  Keep going Woody.</div></div><hr />

People here are vastly more cynical than normal due to obvious reasons. <br />

I could give you more explanation as to why people say things but that would be too long for me to type out at this hour of the night.</div></div><hr />

Got to give him credit for not only seeing the issues, but the comedy behind them.  Life after all is a comic tragedy....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goern</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proud warriors are not in short supply, nor are frustrated ones. Between the two, we sometimes get annoyed at being a &quot;Joke&quot;. It's not the comic. It's not the artist. It's not even that the truth hurts. It's just how sick and tired we are becoming with the situation. Warriors have a place tanking named's and not in groups.<br />
I will admit, at first LDoN seemed like a large aid, as 2 tank groups became more normal. But now that the newness has worn off, I have seen my LFG times zooming up the charts again as more dps group realize it's just more of a dpsfest to win. 2 hours sitting cooling my heels is a waste of my life. 4 hours is retarded. I am paying to be bored. For my money, I spend over half my gameday doing things I don't want to do. Things like LFG from zone to zone, attempting to farm somewhere to make some cash (yay, anyone want some orc belts? how about some spiderling silks? Why'd they drop the pp's off giants anyways? Cause warriors can start soloing them?), or playing an... alt /shiver. Seriously, why am I forced to play other classes just so I have something to do?<br />
Woody, I am sorry I lashed out at you. My frustration over the plight of warriors has gotten too great. So like a chained dog I bite at every hand, even helping ones. It's not any excuse.<br />
Mah Fellow Wahriahs, ask not what Sony has done for you, ask what you can do to Sony... What does it take for class balance to be addressed? And honestly, I don't mean fix taunt, cause it's &quot;working as intended&quot; which means it will place you 1 point of hate above someone else, woops they sat down/cast/hit it/are under 20 percent/ect ect ect. Agro generation is more the issue. Why are we the only class in the game forced to use specific proc'ing weapons to do our jobs? It's a shoddy attempt to bandage the problem imho. Naked, we should have some form of means of increasing our bloody agro, something that makes sence. Something to symbolize blocking the path to the casters, holding the mob's gaze, and forcing them to deal with you first.<br />
Be well, and Be safe.<br />

We have become frustrated at the seeming indifference of SOE to our plight. Some folks might transfer that to you, please dont look at it as actual displeasure at EU.<br />
I just pray they do fix things before the next &quot;big&quot; game comes out, or the population of EQ could drop heavily.</div></div><hr />
