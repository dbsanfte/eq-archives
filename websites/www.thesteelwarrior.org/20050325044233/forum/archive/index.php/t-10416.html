Casters get items that, as an example improves healing spells by 14. How is it factored in? is it just added straight to the heal i.e. your spell normaly heals for 100 but with that item in it heals for 114? Is that the way that it works for all items with + stats on them ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
really these kinds of racial benefits add a little accuracy and DPS, nothing more. there are few reasons why as a human you should never use an axe, or a sword as an orc.<br />

not sure about + to spell effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course this doesn't stop the mob from doing elevated damage on you due to being higher...</div></div><hr />
