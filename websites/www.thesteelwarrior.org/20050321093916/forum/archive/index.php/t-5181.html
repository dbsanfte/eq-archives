<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vorsis</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
<br />
<br />
Nevermind this is my first post, nevermind that its sort of a rant. Let us skip to the important issue. <br />
<br />
The Bazaar/Player sold items.<br />
<br />
Now see I am from Vallon Zek, and I am seeing some really insane prices on items of all caliber. Junk items that would go for no more then 100pp on its inception, being sold for 4k. Also semi decent items that used to go for 5 to 8k being sold for 13 to 15k now. Some prime examples <br />
<br />
Phase Spider Carapace - Admittedly a very decent item, specially for leather wearers like monks and beastlords. Decent AC and great stats all around. Former price 12 to 15k depending on the mood of the seller. Now I go to the bazaar for the last few months and its being priced at 23k sometimes even 26k. <br />
<br />
Shrunkien Goblin Earring (sp?) used to go for 5k to 8k now being sold for 13 to 15k. Good item for a pure melee that cant buff him or herself. But 13k for 15 atk? Save that cash to buy something with decent str to get that 15atk.<br />
<br />
Finally the ikky BP, a regen item that at best prior to this stupid inflation would go for 8 or 9k but typical price being 5 to  7k. Now this peice of work is going for 13 to 15k on my server. <br />
<br />
My conclusion, Mysupersales.com is ruining the EQ economy. With such an influx of pp into the economy people feel they can jack up the prices of items because there is pp to be had. <br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I aint faulting someone who is into making some RL cash for hard work and dedication selling pp to people who would buy it. But in reality this service is really screwing up the economy. Something should be done, but what can you do?<br />
<br />
Anyway I was curious, I am thinking about moving to another server that doesnt have such asinine prices and was curious if anyone could inform me what servers have reasonable bazaar prices or is this happening across all servers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
sold my AoN the other day for 125K use to go for 60 -70k <br />
I actually had it for sale for 60 before my friend stopped me an told me I can get 125 easily ( I'm not that current on the Bazaar scene) 20 minutes later it was bought by a reseller.<br />
<br />
wonder how much he marked it up =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Connir</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only items I have been noticing are old world droppable items in bazaar selling for insane prices. Why? Because no one farms this stuff anymore.<br />
<br />
Example: There used to be half a dozen Runebranded Girdle  or more in bazaar waiting to be sold. Now you are lucky to find 1. Why? No one goes to seb anymore.<br />
<br />
This is true for a lot of items and zones. Then there are decent droppable items from ldon in bazaar. But they drop so much the price just goes down fast.<br />
<br />
It does suck seeing an item that is 2 years old and has the same exasct stats as an item from ldon and it goes for 10-20k more.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is what you are seeing, but it's what i am seeing. lates</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the general indication is that prices seem to have gone up on many servers of late, i konw for a fact they did on my previous server. the reasons are supposedly many.... plat bugs, eq sellers buying out high end items. also the price of plat has gone though the floor, so those buying plat wont think much of paying over the odds for good droppable gear. hence the casino.<br />
<br />
anyway batem i wish id bought that AoN from you. been looking for one on saryrn. saw one the other day for a whopping 200k :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw a Fine steel weapon going for 100K today <br />
<br />
This is how they sell items for cash.  Give the guy in RL through paypal the $100 bucks then he goes and buys your Fine Steel weapon for 100k.  Therefore transfering the money without having to hand / trade you the cash.<br />
<br />
Normally when you items marked high like Flasks of Water or Fine Steel weapons it is for transfering cash with out doing an actuall trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Casino should have lowered prices, not raised them.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several reasons why the prices got so messed up.<br />
<br />
At first it started with LDoN, less people were doing &quot;classic&quot; dungones and PoP stuff, so nobody was really farming anything. Supply decreased, demand stayed relatively what it was before, so prices increased a bit.<br />
<br />
Then there were several tradeskill exploits that allowed you to make an incredible amount of money from nothing, and people were macroing it pretty much 24/7, then buying anything they ever wanted. That decreased supply significantly for people who actually earned their money, so people who still farmed learned about this and adjusted their prices accordingly.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that some of the sales people out there (yantis, IGE, people who sell at playerauctions, etc...) took advantage of the situation, and macro'd MILLIONS of plat, bought up all the high end items they could, no matter what the price, continued making more plat...the end result being that anyone who sold items/and or platinum for real life cash suddenly had millions of plat AND high end items to sell. Eventually SoE caught on and banned accounts of players who were using the macros, which took platinum AND incredibly rare items out of the market.<br />
<br />
A significant amount of people who exploited didn't get banned, and thats what the casino was put in for, so they could dump all their cash into it in hopes of getting an insanely rare, or even no longer obtainable item.<br />
<br />
At least, thats my understanding of the situation, I may or may not be correct...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to DN, Warslik's wood, and Trakanon's teeth and do a /who all.  You'll have your answer as to why they're so expensive.  Take heed...all you broke warriors out there.  Go farm Grachnist the destroyer.  Plenty of people still need instaclicks, but there are no gobbo earrings for sale.  This isn't a bad thing dude..this is a great thing.  Easily farmed items for sale for high prices?  Jump on the bandwagon, don't complain about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass - that's an excellent idea.  My warrior is getting bored with exp grinding in PoP right now; I'd been thinking about taking some time off just to go exploring or do anything different - if I could grab some decent drops while I was doing that, so much the better. <br />
<br />
So I know I can do Warsilks and Trak's teeth.  I'm not sure about the PSC - I've never even been to Siren's Grotto, let alone WW or Dragon Necropolis.  Are there any other out of the way places where I might find some interesting drops, that a 62 war could handle solo?</div></div><hr />

<br />
PSC drops in DN. Beastlords can solo at around 50(?), so I'd be careful because the Phase Spiders are fucking horrible for attracting adds because they phase (obviously). Try Velk's for soloing. Not EXCELLENT exp, but Crystal Chitin armor/Crystalline Silk sells for somewhat well.</div></div><hr />

Servers are getting old and platinum flows... and also the platinum dupe thing...  I think this is the problem and I agree with the LDON sideeffect<br />

What Im really worried about  *.com is account bussiness... too many high level newbies out there<br />

&quot;where is blah blah blah?&quot; &lt;- lvl 65 newbie<br />

<br />
:P<br />
<br />
All I want to say, however, is ... when all those posts were running rampant about how the plat duping was hurting the casual player ... I didn't trust em because they CAME FROM plat sellers.<br />
<br />
I still don't trust it.<br />
<br />
The economy is screwed up. And the plat sellers have a hand in it.<br />
<br />
It's not surprising that the economy is STILL screwed up.<br />
<br />
At least not to me, the champion of negativity.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, one of the worst changes ever to DN.  You aren't truly a warrior until you pull DN with no run 3.  Before Luclin, DN truly was the place where the cream of the crop shone.<br />
<br />
And I don't know why everyone bitches that the economy is fucked up.  It's never fucked up to the point where you can't make money.  If prices on loot are low and the bazaar has bottomed out, you farm cash or vendor sellables (IE : fine steel, droga for pure plat, Sebiliis for gems, etc).  If the economy is high, and everything costs a fuckload of money, you find the easiest thing to farm for your ability level and you farm it.  I've made probably 300kpp selling Copper Hammers and swords of the bloodsworn.  That's a conservative estimate.  It's seriously not that hard to make money if you just observe the economy every day.</div></div><hr />

That place was a riot when I was trying to get my Phase Spider Carapace on my beastlord. It took like 2 weeks to drop, but it was some fun-ass 2 weeks. Spiders phasing everywhere, trains to zone constantly, and my pet constantly depopping! GOOD TIMES!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dragon Necropolis owned so much in Velious.  Great atmosphere, great loot, great experience, and really exciting and challenging.  Man I coffined out of the Chetari tunnels at least half a dozen times, but I never turned down a chance to go down there.  <br />
<br />
Traps that spawn half a dozen mobs.  Hallway with tons of roamers in it, every one of them hard-hitting mobs that CH, gate, and summon.    Over level 55 which meant impossible to stun in those days.  Phase spiders were annoying but easy (with a group anyway), but to go down in those rat tunnels with 6 people and come out in one piece with positive experience movement.  Well not everybody could do that.  Hell, I couldn't even do it every time, but that's what made it so much fun.</div></div><hr />

However there are a few things that are still out of whack and will be for another month or so.  My biggest gripe are the prices of tradekill items.  Ex.  I make Bloodmetal earrings on my ench (jcm3/GM/trophy).  Earring is selling for 23-25 k on the server right now.  That fine except the HPG is selling for 20-24 k on the server.  Not really worth my while to continue selling them given the price of materials.   It just amazes me that folks try to sell trade components for more than the price of the item.  I still want to b*tch slap them.</div></div><hr />

Farm 'em.  Tactics is a great place to be while BoT is getting trained every 5 minutes.  Fun zone, good exp, and a good chance at some valuable drops, and HPG is not that  rare.</div></div><hr />

If you were smart, you would've done the Tactics exploit before it became common knowledge ^^</div></div><hr />
