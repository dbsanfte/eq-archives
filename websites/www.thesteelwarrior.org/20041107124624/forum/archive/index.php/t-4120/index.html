<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">THought this was in interesting thread....especially since Absor Actually acknowledged a probem exists at the end.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem is the developers can;t outline . . . . <br />
<br />
only takens 6+ months and they still can;t grasp the problem . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very ture.  It is also unfortunate that Absor can't respond without giving teh 'ol Absor Smash and locking the thread.  <br />
<br />
Warriors were actaully winning the debate there for once(easily)....and the Knight bandwagaon team COULDN&quot;T let that happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Glad to see there was atleast a hint of frustration. Maybe will see a bone in one of the next 10 expansions but I doubt it. They would probably just make it warrior free zones kind of like locking threads where warriors might actually be right on the issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How long has this problem been pointed out and they still don't have an outline solution (let alone something of substance)? THey've fucked it up bigtime (no surprises there) - i'm not even sure there is a solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The simple fact of the matter is that SOE doesnt care. Why should they. Most people will keep playing eq and just devolping a different character. Ive quit eq 4 times now and always came back because they have the only game worth playing. <br />
<br />
The one thing that will get SOE off their but is some true rivals making a good game people will switch to. And since SOE is a profit orientated company they are doing the corp model of America. Think short term gains of profit not long term.  <br />
<br />
I dont blame them for being profit orientated. They have a good monoply and are exploting it.<br />
