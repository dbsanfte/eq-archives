I have the mold but dunno if its stackable with chanter haste .Pluss i already have Spicked Seahorse Belt. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruenorg</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warlord's Steel Gauntlets (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24886) drop in high risk Ruj LDoN but are also buyable in the bazaar.  The ornate gauntlets would still be nice to have just for the clicky haste for those occaisions when you don't have someone around who can haste you.  Not stackable with other haste spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the glove will stack with the Spiked Seahorse hide Belt but not with chanter/shaman/any spell haste. thus if you never fight without a chanter or a shaman you don't need it, but if they are only occasionnally in your surrunding then go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A real benefit of having them is the fact it lasts 1 hour.  If you have the click up, and the shaman/enchanter/etc haste drops (the icons themselves stack), you'll still have 30% haste over items until they can get the spell back up (very useful if they don't have their group version, or if the buff drops while in a fight and the haster is busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is also a 1 hour ish crap buff for dispelling mobs.  It has too long of recast to be used in battle, but can be used before  a fight to space buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
I also have found it invaluable for soloing, faction work, farming pp, tradeskill drops, etc.<br />
<br />
If your stamina isn't maxed they are very comparable to the warlords steel guants as well to actually wear.<br />
<br />
I did get mine as a drop so not sure I would spend plat on them, but I have used mine more than I ever thought I would.  At the time I got them they were a big upgrade and I wore them until I got the warlords steel guants.  I still religiously use the haste as a filler until I can be rebuffed and to front load some buffs I don't care if they are dispelled.<br />
<br />
As someone said earlier, the haste does not stack with other forms of spell haste from an enchanter or shaman, but stacks with haste items like your belt for when you don't have better than 30% spell based haste available.<br />
