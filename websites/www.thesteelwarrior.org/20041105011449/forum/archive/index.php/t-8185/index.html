<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spanky5844</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just created a new ogre warrior on the morden rasp server.  I am in Jadded disent, an old school guild that for the time being is only up to kunark content.  The sticky for different sets of armor as you level up is great for what I was looking for.  I was just wondering if there was a similar thing for good warrior weapons, or If I could get some advice here.  I am curently only lvl 10 with my newbie weapon.  Any thing I could get now or in the future, with estimated levels if available, would be great.  The guild is up around 40(?) members so I could get a big group if I realy needed it.  I am also allowed to bazaar things from the original game and kunark, but would rather quest for em or get drops on the way up.  Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play on Morden as well, feel free to shoot me a tell ingame with questions. For old school quests I remember the langseax quest around Halas being good &quot;back in the day&quot; you'd need some help from someone with good barbarian faction to do the turnin for you. Since you are limited to old world/Kunark I'd look at it and I'd look at the old crafted armor quests. <br />
<br />
Sol A and B have some decent drops for that content. I'm not sure the exact rules of that guild, do they allow LDoNs since they are in the &quot;old world&quot;? If so I'd just do LDoNs and save up for LDoN armor and augs. If not I'd work on crafted early and then work on cobalt armor when you get to where you can go to KC/OS. You also might want to start some of the leg work for your epic, since that will be the best weapon avaliable to you until you guys move up into velious. The rules of that guild put alot of restrictions on what you can anc can't do and knowing the rules is key.<br />
<br />
As I said, feel free to shoot me a tell with any questions about old world quests or hunting places, just understand if I'm in the middle of a raid, etc I'll be a little slow to respond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>spanky5844</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info, Ill shoot you a tell.  <br />

I feal like babbling a little and clarifying my situation.<br />
<br />
I was already planing on going crafted for my next armor upgrades.  We have a temporary level cap at 30 right now to let the guild catch up.  I figure once I get there it will be a great time to farm plat for gems and get the other drops for the quests.  <br />
<br />
I am hopeing that a chanter in the guild will start making some jewlery soon enough to fill up some of my non visible slots.  What is the lower version of the velium fire wedding ring (6ac 65hp) that would have been available through the first expansion?  I think theres one thats 35hp, but not sure.  I am allowed to buy content appropriate stuff in the bazaar, so i figure 2 of those will be good.<br />
<br />
I know there is a + sta and str neck item in blackburrow that is pretty easily obtainable in the lower levels (12 - 17).   I dont know any other similar drops though, they were all trivial a year ago when I started playing so I never found out about them.  Im sure someone in the guild will be smithing as well.  I guess I could go for banded stuff in some slots, as it should be around the guild soon enough.  Any sugestions for any of this stuff would be apreciated.<br />
<br />
Also weapons.  I have no idea where to get upgrades, I have the tutorial weapon, which has better ratio then my newbie weapon.  And am getting the newbie one (+3 sta) soon for second hand when dual weild becomes available.  I guess next step up is to save up for a combine wepon.  Although I think that Im going to be pressed for cash due to the crafted quest gems.  Ill have to check out that barbarian quest, I thought that I couldnt do it at all cause of faction.  <br />
<br />
The basic rules are old world and kunark only, any zone that has been updated is ok, but no ldons or loy stuff.  Max level is 51 so we can stockpile AAs (but not spend em yet   :mad: ).  Once we have done alot of that stuff the level cap is getting bumped to 60 for velious (we can also spend our saved AAs  :D ).  After that who knows, we are taking our time and I could see that taking up to a year.   <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading all my babbling, and for any info provided.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>spanky5844</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, as far as weapons go I just got the fine antique poniard (5/20, magic) from neriak quest.  I am planing on geting a pgt for my mainhand once I hit 13 and get dw.  Should this be a decent set up for a few levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, just have fun, 1-30 is a blast. It's really hard to go wrong, but if you want to really work on it the old way, hit some dungeons and get the drops from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>spanky5844</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok what values should i use to calculate ac vs hp.<br />
<br />
My newbie helm is 6 ac 5 hp 1 sat, I also have a bronze helm which is 11 ac.  I know that the difference will be negligable (sp?) but for future reference whats a good general way to weigh the different stats.  I figure at my lvl sta is pretty much worthless, And id rather have ac than hps because if I need to tank something hard I could always get temp and have more than enough hps for the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aciphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still go by the old 15hp = 3sta =1ac</div></div><hr />
