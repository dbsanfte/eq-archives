I was using Great Blade of Storm in primary and Cord Hilted Spike Driver in offhand.  I am usually the tank in our Hard LDON group, and sometimes have to MT in pick up raids.  But in my guild, I am only the 3rd tank, or even further removed.  I have 40% worn haste, and whether in group or in raid, my haste is always at 100%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know of many warriors who use the shard and similar weapons as aggro, and love them. I also know many who have the shard and hate it, and use a GBoS/BoC over it. I will say that the JSoff is a great weapon, as are BoC and GBoS, and the CHSD isnt too shabby either. Highest dps combo out of them all would of course be the JSoFF/GBoS, and as for aggro, I'm really not sure. GBoS/JSoFF would be nice. BoC/GBoS is nice. BoC/JSoFF is nice. or try putting the JSoFF into primary, and it will still do a decent job of aggro. If you do come across a BoC, that would be the one weapon you should definitely use for aggro. Either the JSoFF or GBoS would be fine offhand, try them both, and pick one. A3 aug it, after you a3 aug the BoC, and then use the other weapon for dps. Or better yet, get a good two hander for dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok whouldn't the BoC be the best for aggro by far?<br />
<br />
also isnt the CHSD second best aggro because of 500 hate proc?isn't 500 hate better then nuke or stun which only generates about 150-300 hate?<br />
<br />
also since the damage on a weapon doesnt add aggro why would you even consider taking dps ratio with a non-aggro proc over something like CHSD?<br />
<br />
the more aggro you can generate the more damage the real dps classes can do without taking your aggro!  IMO warriors do crap dmg even with awesome ratio weapons compared to the extra dps the other 5 ppl in your group or other 50 ppl in your raid could do if you had better aggro!  don't you guys agree?<br />
<br />
if i have WA5, a boc with anger 3, and a CHSD with anger 3, ill be proccing for 300-700 hate about once every 5 seconds, nukers will be able to do a hell of a lot more damage without taking aggro, especially on a raid, slowers can cast sooner and with less time between casts on resists, the necros druids n shammys can put more dots on them sooner, how can a lil better ratio on the MA's weapons possibly come anywhere near the extra dps gotten from having better aggro?</div></div><hr />

The BoC is great aggro for Raids and long fights.  However it isn't much better than a droga weapon in normal BoT pick up groups or LDoN adventures.  The 15/20 delay is nice ( as is the 100hp) but the aggro from some other weapons like a gbos will give you quicker aggro.  As has been stated before for normal xp groups warriors want quick aggro, maintaining it isn't too hard once the fights moving along.<br />
<br />
The CHSD is 450 to hate, and I thought the stun from the droga weapons was around 400 to 450 to hate.  But that's just what I've read.  The main advantage I see to the CHSD is that it's pure hate with no knockback.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents...<br />

<br />
<br />
I should clarify my post.  This comment was made concerning both weapons in their stock form.  Not taking into account anger augs or WA.  <br />
<br />
I don't currently have a GBoS so you would obviosly have more first hand knowledge on this matter.<br />
<br />
I got my BoC from a warrior friend that said it sucked, and would rather use his GBoS and a SoD, in his experience he got better aggro in xp fights with the stun procs.<br />
<br />
I agree without any anger augs on it, my experiences with a BoC both when I had one in my early 50's and again now at 65 is that it's streaky.  Regardless of how people will swear it's 2ppm.  I've seen it fire 3 times in one fight in PoV and then not fire once on the next mob.  I currently use a sotbs mainhand with Anger 2 ( I regret not getting a yak aug since I believe it to be more aggro than A2) and I'm 200 pts from getting A3 for my BoC.  Perhaps then I will be able to mainhand it.<br />
<br />
As I said before BoC is great for raids and long fights, and the 100 hp is awesome.  But some people who've never used one seem to think that buying a BoC will mean they'll have Instant Aggro forever after.  This is not the case.  I'm not knocking it, I swing one.  And I'm hoping with A3 and eventually WA5 it will be even more UBER.  But if I had a chance at a GBoS, I would take it and sell my BoC for 500k plat and get my cleric some new gear.<br />
<br />
Once again just my 2 cents.<br />

&quot;Quicker aggro&quot; no, bad choice of wording there on Apok's part.<br />
&quot;More early aggro&quot; yes, the GBoS produces more aggro than BoC before the first proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*Scraches head*<br />
<br />
Before the first proc?<br />
Im not sure if that is justification enough to put BoC secondary.<br />
It goes against all aggro logic.<br />
<br />
All augs, AA's aside, the only reason I can see going GBoS primary would be for DPS.<br />
<br />
If the fight is going to be so short to where BoC aggro is irrelavant, I may as well pull out the GSot4W for even better initial aggro.<br />
<br />
EDIT: In review, its better to start off GBoS/BoC till procs start going off than switch to BoC/GBoS for maximum aggro efficiency?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I never said it was a good reason to put BOC secondary :) I was just trying to explain the quote.  I'd keep BOC in mainhand for all non-trivial fights.</div></div><hr />

I'm confused you used chos twice....did you mean you upgraded to GBoS?  Which I believe has the same proc as the chos.  Force shock?</div></div><hr />

While I agree with you for the most part in regards to the utility of Droga weapons in XP/LDoN grinds, I'd also like to mention that it really does depend on your group composition.  I'm not guilded, and play almost exclusively  with my hardcore group of friends (a rotating crew of 10 people); 3 of them are necros and one is a Shaman.  Maintaining aggro can be a real pain in the ass when their crit DoTs start going off.  I can blow through four or five EB/AngerIII procs only to find the mob fly off of me when their Horrors and Bloods of Saryrn decide to blow up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have BoC/GBoS combo both with anger 3 augments and WA5<br />
<br />
In most xp situations i use the GBoS primary and the BoC secondary because it's better dps and aggro for me is trivial after the first proc ... no matter what the first proc is.<br />
<br />
The only time i use the BoC primary is tanking for my guild's raids or running trials where i will be swapping in for the shield now and then ... or if i'm running with some insane casters where every pinch of aggro i can squelch actually matters.  When using a shield or playing with high aggro output casters, strenght of proc matters to me more than pitiful +'s to dps.  <br />
<br />
That said, with either setup, i've got overkill in the aggro dept 99% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well asking what is best aggro I'd say easily BOC main GBOS or CHSD offhand.What you can best use as a dps set up is dependant on what your ma is wielding and the care you take engaging and early fight.You may be better served by getting a non proc'r for swapping into main or a 2hander when going assist.<br />
<br />
However,the GBOS can be used with care as a good dps 1hander at that stage and if you dualweild it's easier to switch out your main hand then going to 2handers.The GBOS would also allow you to offtank well when you were slow to switch to your main ggro weap.If you go this route I would aug the BOC with a3 and CHSD with a2 or a3(you could aug the CHSD now and mainhand it till you get the BOC) and leave the GBOS unauged save for possibly a lifetap or similiar.You could also just aug the BOC offhand the GBOS leaving it unauged and switch for assist duty,though less procs is less aggro.<br />
<br />
The GBOS can be a pretty good aggro weapon especially when mainhanded..it's no BOC though.All the aggro proccin weapons from a GSOT to a BF are likely to draw some aggro if you're not careful and in fast fights It's all about the rng with these weapons.<br />
<br />
I never have enough aggro ....depends on the people you're playing with hehe.Bloody necros #$%^...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We tanked with CHOS's,GBOS's and CHSD's in main in my guild.Although, I would give an edge to the GBOS they are very close in aggro unauged.I liked the CHSD.The first weapon to show me significant advantage in aggro from weapons of this class was a BOC.However, you aug any of the others with a2 or better and you'll take the advantage imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">before the first proc? umm dude 2 less delay will hardly get you an extra hit or 2 b4 the first proc.... dmg has nothing to do with aggro, it's the number of swings (as stated in the library), i thought that was common knowledge...<br />
&quot;Dude&quot;, I'm not sure what you think you're saying here.  TSW library estimates aggro per swing as = dmg+bonus.  Using that theory, GBOS produces 9.3% more aggro than BOC before procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah,I agree the fast delay with good ratio (relatively)on the GBOS gives it a slight advantage mainhanded next to other weapons off similiar proc type.We used to depend on that kinda aggro when we couldn't hold it for %^&amp;* hehe.I would never mainhand a GBOS over a BOC equally auged personally when tanking.Though the differance is small in a short fight with the rng being the biggest factor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, so I am confused then... Since BOC is 15 damage vs GBoS which is 14, then how can GBoS produce more aggro?  And don't forget, I am always at 100% haste, so wheather delay of the weapon is 20 or 18 is irrelevant.  They will end up with the delay of 10 after haste.  So in this case, the shard should be considered at good at aggro too (before the proc), since it has damage of 17. Right? Or am I totally off base there?<br />

i was going on the fact that the mob turned in the same # of hits no matter what the dmg was, forgot to think of it that the person had the SAME weapon the whole time so it was adding the same amount of hate every hit, which would be a different amount of hate for every weapon.  ok so looks like ratio has some to do with aggro, damage bonus has a lot to do with it, and procs have the most...<br />

<br />
<br />
There is no minimum delay, and never has been, since EQ began.<br />
<br />
<br />
The logfile cannot report events that are faster than delay 10.  This has no effect on your weapons.</div></div><hr />
