<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On unslowed fast attack mobs DS rules. Basicly a monk/beastlord type hitting mobs are best as the trade high damage for more attacks. Slow completely negates the usefulness of DS. Fighting against unmezzables is a good time too. My druid usually sigle targets the MA, unless we are plowing somewhere then I just DS the whole group to save time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">450 Mana , for 48 DS....<br />
Get 100 hits in 15 minutes = 4800 DMG<br />
<br />
Even with your best nuke at max focus max critic max everything 450mana 4800dmg cant be beaten.<br />
<br />
Even for slowed mob DS is still the most mana efficient DPS form in the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DS can be very useful, can be very hurtful. Pull an unslowable mob with CoR, mage DS, bard DS, druid DS and druid AA HoT/DS and that mob is gonna walk away bleeding. If your tank can't spare a slot, don't cast it. It depends on the group. Generally I'd want a DS on me, but if all my buff slots where full or I was raiding I would turn it down.</div></div><hr />

So, how do you feel about damage shields currently? Is my 48 hp DS worth a buff slot in most groups?<br />
<br />
I will take all the DS I can get when I tank provided I have a slot open which I usually do unless I have to have a ton of resist buffs for that mob.<br />
<br />
I stack my DS so with the 48 from yours I am usually getting at lesat 80 or so and with a bard in  the group well over 100 ds which does a ton of dps on an unslowed or mitagted slowed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use ds's every time a mob hits fast enough to warrant it and I have the buff slot, the faster the mob hits the more it helps to have, I've even put a DS on over things like arch shielding, focus, wog, etc before but thats the exception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm afraid it depends what you are doing and how many buff slots you have available. Fortunately in OoW I hear we're getting 3 more buff slots for AA.<br />
<br />
In a raid it's all about surviving as a tank. Haste, Kazzad, Bo9, Brells SS, WoG, CHA, DI, a resist/Vie, HoT slot, mob debuff slot, etc. they're gone real fast.<br />
<br />
In a casual group (LDoN) it's haste, Virtue, Focus, for me Pestilence, Form of Defense, and whatever else you can lay your hands on. A DS is more than welcome.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gonna agree with BB here. DS is very nice DPS, but on a raid it'll sometimes get clicked off. If I'm rampage tank, I'm going to want it very much. In an experience group, I'll take it every time. Look at some of the old AoW parses... Unslowable mob with the DS doing absolutely insane damage. Also remember: DS is unresistable. It doesn't matter if the mob is magic and fire immune; the DS will still put out the damage.<br />
<br />
Now, I often find tanks have too many buff slots filled, or the DS takes up the last one, which is bad. This is a worry. <br />
<br />
  If it's the MT or ST on a raid, ask them in a tell if they want a DS. They'll have their own opinion if they're going to just click it off or not, so it'll save you mana and save them the hassle if you just go ahead and ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always take all the DS's I can get unless I'm MT and need the buff slots. Pumping out 100+dmg per hit on ldons makes them go super fast.</div></div><hr />

Or worse give it to them and have them not realize it at first and then see a DoT override their virtue. Ouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ds is a important mt buff, ds on anyone else is a waste(except ramp tank) since they are not supposed to get hit. it is certian damage to the mob. even on slowed mobs you can get 200-700+ a round. that = a fton of damage. and defintly better then the extra agi, or attack.<br />
<br />
exception is ds with resist buffs built in. normaly a group spell that should be mgb to the raid if it's a resist needed for the encounder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would make room for a DS, using Virt instead of  9-Kaz-Ward if I had too.  Even on slowed mobs, it a lot of damage for very little mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Graa usually takes two to three hits from a mob she has slowed, before Gront gets it back under control (normal LDoN's are easy enough that there's no reason not to slow that early; those two to three hits are lucky to do one bubble of Graa's health, if that).  It usually takes us less than 45 minutes to do the 50ish mobs needed to finish the LDoN.  That's 3 casts of the DS for 100-150 hits.<br />
<br />
If the DS does 40 damage per hit, you're looking at 4000 to 6000 damage for about 1300 mana.  Pretty good efficiency.  And that's on someone who isn't even the MT.<br />
<br />
When you figure that each mob in the LDoN run probably hits Gront about 10 times before it dies, you're looking at nearly 20,000 damage for 1300 mana.  That's just got to be good.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
<br />
Gront/Graa, Black Syndicate, Ayonae Ro.<br />
<br />
P.S. LDoN's are easy enough, in fact, that I'm wondering if it's worth running the next one unslowed and with a DS on Gront, just to see if we can clear it significantly faster with that extra damage.  Next time I run one with a bard and magician, I may just do that.  :-)<br />
<br />
P.P.S. Consider cleric mana efficiency.  If the cleric uses CHeal to patch me up, he's healing 6000 damage for 400 mana, or 15 damage per mana.  If the mob's average hit is 300 (which is probably a bit high for normal LDoN, honestly), and mage + bard + potion DS == 100 per hit, then leaving the mob unslowed lets the cleric &quot;do damage&quot; via the DS at approximately 5 damage per point of mana; which, IIRC, is more mana-efficient than most cleric nukes.  (Order, 1210 for 401, even focused at 15% that's 1392 for 352, or 4 damage per point of mana)<br />
<br />
Looks like DS's are useful.  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did a little research on DS a while back on the EQHunter forums...<br />
<br />
DS Infos (http://forums.eqhunter.com/viewtopic.php?p=16023#16023)<br />
<br />
All that stuff was for rangers, however, I'm thinking that a warrior can bump up that DS even more...  <br />
<br />
Firstly, Bladecoat is a ranger/druid only self buff that isn't present in any clickable form, so you will need something else for Slot 3 DS.  Through a quick perusal of Alla's Spell database, I found 2 items that both have a clickable Bramblecoat (Slot 2: 18 AC, Slot 3: 3 DS)<br />
<br />
Golem Spines (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24090)<br />
Spiked Chain Mail (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8362)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the Golem Spines are Lore and No Drop, so only a 1 time use item then you get to go find more; also, according to posters on Allakhazam's it looks like the Spiked Chain Mail no longer drops :(.  In running some final numbers, I'll go ahead and assume the use of the Golem Spines on an unslowable boss mob, and if you feel that 3 DS for 1 buff slot isn't worth it please feel free to just remove 3 DS from the total number ;)<br />
<br />
Secondly, as a Warrior you have a much better Slot 4 buff than a ranger would have access to in PoTime Saryrn's Girdle of Intense Durability (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21888) which gives a quite phenomenal 15 DS in your Slot 4, a 9 DS increase of a Ranger's 6 DS in that same slot.  Considering the use of Bramblecoat this would net a Warrior an increase of 12 DS over the ranger total, bringing your DS up to 321.<br />
<br />
One thing that wasn't  counted for a Ranger's DS, but I will include for Warrior raid purposes here, is the Druid AA Spirit of the Wood.  This is a 5 tick 55 DS Slot 8 AA effect that is often MGB'd during raids due to its wonderful 250 a tick HP regen.  If this were chain Massed by 4 druids the effect would stay up roughly 2 minutes, not sure how AA duration effects this so I will proceed with base numbers as the amount of DS applied isn't affected.  This 55 DS stacks with everything discussed previously for a total of 376 DS.<br />
<br />
A final note, and since I don't know anything at all about Warrior /discs these days, this might just be taken with a grain of salt :)  Allakhazam's lists a Slot 6 level 45 Warrior discipline called Barrier (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=4589).  I know not wether this is actually in game, and kind of doubt any warrior would take this over a defensive disc of some kind, but... the range given for applied DS is 25@45 to 33@70.  Doing some quick math (70-45)/(33-45)=25/8=3.125, meaning that every 3 levels gives another point of DS.  At 65 this would give a loss of only 2 DS for a total of 31.  This also stacks with everything including the Druid MGB Spirit of the Wood, bringing the total up to 407 DS.  <br />
<br />
The bard modifiers and such were gleaned from perusal of the EQDiva forums and asking many questions in the serverwide.bards channel.  I couldn't find any hard data on song mod caps, so I went with the highest possible I could find.  The final number might have to be adjusted down slightly.<br />
<br />
Hopefully at least some of the research I've done will help you guys in deciding if DS is worth it or not hehe.    In total, between Mage DS, Shammy Potion, Bramble Coat, Shield of Torment, Vengeful Guard, and Barrier, you are looking at 6 buffslots taken up by DS alone, but possibly when fighting Monk bosses the DPS acheived from ~400 DS might be more than worth the loss of a few buffs, but that would definitly be at the discretion of the user.  Good luck all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">bard DS + whatever DS you can dig up lets you do some really amazing DPS against multiple unslowed mobs.  It's not like the cleric's doing too much for a normal LDoN anyway so might as well take some more damage to make them useful.<br />
<br />
But even if you're fighting mobs the normal way, DS is still one of the most efficient form of DPS in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">as a general rule if theres a mage im my group and its for exping ill pretty much always ask for a DS.  in raids with buff slots at a premium its more of a toss up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have 15 buff slots.<br />
As a warrior, I need maybe 7.<br />
The rest is kinda icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
A DS will generate more DPS than any attack buff, so it takes priority after AC/HP buffs, DI etc.<br />
<br />
Unlike others, 15 buff slots is kinda overkill for me.<br />
Dont see what the problem is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I will get a DS in any LDoN I am in.<br />
<br />
I remember that Ragh 1, our GL prased the whole fight and the 97 (ish) point DS we had on the MT was the number one source of damage on him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
of course one could say: that's not taking one over another ,)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">DS is usually the most mana efficient dps for druids / mages. Especially versus quadding, non slowed mobs or group DS in chaos pull normal Ldons without mezzing. <br />
Extreme example: Ikkinz singlegroup trial zone nameds: ~220dps from DS only (bard, druid, selfbuffs) where around 1/3 or 1/4 were of the standard group / singletarget DS. Thats around 80dps x 120secs + 13min duration left = awesome mana / dam ratio :)<br />
<br />
Just make your tank parse his DPS. The &quot;non melee damage&quot; ( - his procs, nukes, other DS) can be added to yours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Looks like this topic is already covered, but just in case...I take a DS every time I can get it.  On raids I'll usually drop a less important buff for a DS.  That extra few k of dmg really helps and is extremely mana efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well never really checked in everquest but in Anarchy online i have done parses on my enforcer(AO Warrior, and Adventurer sort of druid/ranger combo), now i can't see that a damage shield in ao works different from a ds in eq.<br />
<br />
My enforcer can self buff up to a 117 point ds for a short moment(he is only lvl 95) and my adventurer can get around 80'ish, after doing a mission with adventurer the damage shield was the second largest dmg source, result was 15% dmg from shield, 15% out of 150k total dmg is not at all bad and the shield helps a lot if you solo, so judging by the parses i have done i would say yes they do help, and when/if i play my mage i try to keep the ds up on tank all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Like a few others I love DS and will take them over thinks like Spirit of the Predator, if I am forced to choose. However you do have to be careful in some situations, like if you are doing an event where adds are unmezzable and you are using root  for CC. Summoned root casters can be bad :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">However you do have to be careful in some situations, like if you are doing an event where adds are unmezzable and you are using root  for CC. Summoned root casters can be bad :p<br />
<br />
Hmm...is that because a DS will break root if it goes off or because it will damage the mob and therefore make it start to summon?  (or something else?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think he means that summoning mobs suck when using root CC. Having your clerics summoned and promptly eatten sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm kinda suprised people focus on DS's on raids but not mentioning exp groups as much.  I'll take a DS on a raid if I have room for it, I especially like bard DSs because they are big and do other beneficial things without taking a &quot;real&quot; buff slot, but it's not a priority for me becuase it's a fairly small percentage of the raid dps, CotR and a mage or druid DS is all I would get.  It's much more significant on exp mobs, although slow decreases it's damage by 75%, but it's still more mana-efficient damage by far than your best nuke, even moreso if it's a free click and at least for me, unless I get in a group with a super buff-happy shaman and druid that think you need every stat/resist buff up at all times then buff slots are never an issue in exp groups.<br />
<br />
For farming low-blues in places like droga, veksar etc, where you are pulling/tanking multiples without slow, it's the best buff you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">On raids ds is very important regardless of the delay of the mob you are tanking.  Damage shield can generate a shitload of dps, i think the last rallos kill in time my damage shield ds was upwards of 225.  It doesnt seem like much but over a 10 minute fight thats 135k damage.  The net effect is the duration of the fight is lower, significantly in many cases, (assuming your raid does 10k dps, rallos will die 13.5 seconds faster).  Shorter fights = lower risk of you dying.  Not to mention the numerous times im sure everyone has wiped to a mob at 0-2% which a ds would have turned the fight.<br />
<br />
In experience groups ds is huge.  Often times i will take a druid over a shaman or enchanter for the simple reason that A i can box a buffer and B ds + unslowed mobs give you the equivalent of a 7th person in the group.  That is assuming the healers can keep mana up the whole time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the recent improvement to damage shields' duration and small increase in effect, I've started using them again. Problem before was the very poor duration was lousy. Lucikly I have the ornate leggings so can just freely refresh, though I like the group versions for melee heavy groups.<br />
Now, I often find tanks have too many buff slots filled, or the DS takes up the last one, which is bad. This is a worry.<br />
<br />
But, over all, how effective do *YOU* feel damage shields are nowadays, since mobs basically *have* to be slowed in most groups? I'm not on the recieving end of all the damage, so don't get a feel for how effective my damage shield is for YOU. <br />
So, how do you feel about damage shields currently? Is my 48 hp DS worth a buff slot in most groups?<br />
<br />
Couple of points to check out on this...<br />
<br />
A Damage Shield does add aggro.  <br />
Yes, it is damage so there is some small aggro with it thus the AA for some casters to INCREASE damage shield aggro.<br />
<br />
Change your thinking on the DS from Damage Shield to Damage over Time.<br />
How long does your damage shield last?  How many times is it going to damage mobs?  How much total damage do they take?   In most situations, getting hit 20 times total in 1 fight at even a measely 25 hp DS is 500 damage that is unresistable to the MOB.  That's a free babby nuke.  DS lasts for 5 fights, you did 2500 damage to the mobs for the cast of that 1 DS.  Not to bad for even a gimp damage shield and you'll note the numbers of fights and damage per is fairly low.<br />
<br />
Look at it in reverse too...  When you run into a mob with a healthy damage shield up and nobody dispells it..  every melee in your group loses about how much HP from it?  The DS you use is 99% of the time a higher DS than the one used by the mob caster.  Yeah, slowed, the mob takes less damage but still, if you're looking at mana efficiency vs effect, you probably don't have a higher damage potential spell in your book than a damage shield.  Gimp as it may seem in the short run, it lasts a long time and is unresistable damage to that target for max effect every time it hits your tank.<br />
<br />
All in all a damage shield isn't a bad idea.  They are cheap for what they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Damage shield damage doesn't cause aggro to either the person wearing the DS or the caster.  It's just a buff.  There was a bug for a while where it gave aggro to the person wearing it, but that was changed back pretty quickly.  If you cast it during a fight you might get a tiny amount of aggro, but no more than casting any other buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Providing you tanks with optimal Damage Shields is something that every guild should concern themselves with.  Groups can largely ignore them though in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">A well timed Kilva potion can turn a hard LDoN fail into a win.  Also if you like to do &quot;challenging&quot; material with 1 group a good DS stack is hard to beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bloodeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">DS can really generate much dps, specialy in raid.<br />
<br />
An example here (http://membres.lycos.fr/Odeus/eqparses/time-rz-0622.html) on a time RZ : about 335 dps in a 8m07s fight  (more than 160K damage) only from DS.<br />

481 total dps is not that bad for a war. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damage Shields in groups can be quite useful for things like easy LDoNs and certainly are never something to ignore entirely.  Mostly though, these same environments are the ones where I ignore FA/Fero and other min-maxing measures, simply because it doesn't really matter much anyhow given the trivial nature of the content.  <br />
<br />
My thinking was more for hunting in KT/PoE/PoF and the like, where the percentage of damage produced by a DS versus the attention and mana needed to maintain them makes them less attractive.  Even there though, if you have someone that can cast a reasonable damage-shield they probably are worthwhile.  I suppose it depends on your style of play a lot also, we tend to pre-mezz and debuff the next mobs while killing the present targets, making the DS less attractive as the mobs are almost always going to be pre-slowed.  I don't really know if the mage/druid is still getting better bang-for-buck out of his or her mana with a DS or a nuke at this point.  I suppose at near 100% uptime the DS even on slowed mobs might well be quite efficient though.<br />
<br />
I'd agree with the concern over getting an add into summoning mode though and in some places that alone would invalidate them, especially if root is being used liberally as pre-CC.  Incremental efficiency increases are washed out quickly if they end up killing off your enchanter at some point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A DS that adds hate but no damage. The more you beat on me, the more you hate me! <br />
<br />
Imagine the mob:<br />
I'm beating on this damned half-elf, and MAN do I hate him. <br />
Can't beat on this damn half-elf enough! <br />
Yeah! BEAT ON THE HALF ELF!!!<br />
Some wiz just nuked me for 7k? So what! I'm BEATING THE HALF ELF!!<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL!<br />
I want it! Somebody make it so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I updated my Damage Shield Guide on EqDiva where a lot of Semp's information orginated.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Cut out the level 45 warrior disc ds of 31 points for 2 tics.  It was part of the melee enhancement that got scrapped so is not and will never be attainable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Good thread and some great information.<br />
<br />
I've recently made some effort to improve my DS capability and as a result have some IMO useful advice:<br />
<br />
Druid/Mag buffs, MoR, and the rather easy to obtain Coldain Ring #8 will allow you to do useful DS damage.<br />
<br />
BUT, In order to achieve the best results Warriors need to acquire a LOT of items. There is a narrow window of opprotunity to get items like Girdle of Living Thorns and Talisman of Vah Kerrath. Regal Band of Bathezid is best done before destroying your faction as is Coldain Ring #10. Still other items are obtained in PoTime - Girdle of Intense Durability and Shroud of Eternity.<br />
<br />
For most of us, DS damage is useful. However to reach anything like the theoretical maximums you need to plan ahead during your progression.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I never bothered with DS beyond CotR while ramp tanking.  Too many spell slots needed, combined with rampage as a high damage instead of high frequency hits make it generally a waste.  Add to that a small bug with DA that doesnt always hit ds damage back, and you have a pretty wasted spell slot.</div></div><hr />

Here's why I like a good DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I will take DS almost anytime I can get it. I remember parces from Rhag1 (way back when) and the DS on the MT did the most damage of anyone on the raid. <br />
<br />
While I haven't parsed LDoNs much, unless you are consistantly overkilling, the extra DPS is good on every single mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Thanks for the feedback.  I corrected the guide and removed the Barrier Discipline.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Xonic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I remember a parse from Ssra Emp fight few months ago,<br />
<br />
MT got hit about 1100 ish time during the 30 ish min fight. As a bard, I was singing DS songs for MT that did about 80 dmg per hit, so that's 88,000 dmg in this fight. (yes, 88k dmg) . As a comparison, the top visable DPS player in that raid was a wizard doing 60ish k damage. This is only the DS from bard; MT had mage DS and maybe some more.<br />
<br />
That was months ago. Now I've got new songs, new AAs, new instrument that I can do 133 DS if I want to.<br />
<br />
Ssra Emp maybe an extreme example but it helps clearify the importance of DS, at a magnified level.</div></div><hr />
