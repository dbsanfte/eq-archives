<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any word of the port to the spells system for pure melee, if these disciplines and the like will now be able to be screwed by the use of Silence?<br />
<br />
How will this effect dscipline like abilities, balance, and encounter design? Say there's a MT switch, but the mob just AE'd Silence, so the warrior cannot go defensive....<br />
<br />
Discuss!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oooh, good point. I'm not on test so I can't comment, but I'm glad you brought this up. Rytan, care to comment? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Silence has always been a spell inhibiter.  It therefore would be illogical for it to affect melee skills and disciplines since those are not spells (ie. they do not use mana).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, the new abilities are basically spells using endurance instead of mana - I would not be surprised to see them be silenced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That would suck if you pull a mob with the &quot;wave of white noise&quot; aoe.<br />
<br />
{Inc mob stay back it silences<br />
<br />
hitting defensive now *splat*<br />
<br />
wth!}<br />
<br />
<br />
i seriously doubt silence will affect us, but who knows, i cant proc at all when silenced and i never knew that your weapons needed to talk to be able to proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Someone from Test server actually said that silence prohibited them from using disciplines under the new system. Hopefully it will be deemed a bug worthy of fixing, but all things considered, I wouldn't count on it. We could be looking at the latest &quot;feature.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow, that's a grey area if ever there was one.<br />
<br />
I mean, these are skills, so they shouldn't be spells.<br />
<br />
But in the mechanics of coding them, I could see why the team would now have them as spells.<br />
<br />
But for something like silence, they shouldn't be spells.<br />
<br />
That'll be a puzzle for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Silence does NOT effect disciplines, openings, or provoke.<br />
<br />
I tested it yesterday, and was told that if it did, it would be a bug.</div></div><hr />
