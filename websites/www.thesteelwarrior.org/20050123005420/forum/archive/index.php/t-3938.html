<br />
Interesting.  The problem with the GBoS is not one person using it but multiple on a raid.  If you have 4-5 folks using it from the same direction it moves a mob pretty fast.  A single person knockback is fairly immaterial though.</div></div><hr />

Should I bank my edge and use the GBoS? That's what I am thinking, with the only exception being if I am on a Ssra run. I dunno.</div></div><hr />

It seems to proc pretty often. The knockback can be disregarded if you know how to possition a mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never even noticed the knockback on GBoS.<br />
<br />
What about the 3 fire damage, wouldnt that up the aggro on the weapon significantly, enough to compete?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it wont... and the proc on wrath's edge is suck for agro.  GBoS is a far superior agro weapon, and the knockback isn't noticeable, yet it is there, so it does produce agro, which makes it even better.</div></div><hr />

I know Gaudrelak has a 179dd and a 1 foot knockback but never noticed one on GBoS.</div></div><hr />

Like Auron said, you might consider WE main, GBoS off for DPS set up, but for agro BoC main GBoS off will be your best bet. Short of dual EB weapons, this is about as good as it gets pre-Time.</div></div><hr />

I do not have an answer for you but 1 thing you may want to consider is the knockback of GBoS.<br />
<br />
My guild explicitly says that no melees should use GBoS in raid unless he is tanking.  <br />
<br />
That's a little silly in my opinion.  The knockback is hardly noticeable at all. I'm always proc'ing stuns with a knockback and like I said it's not even noticeable at all. You're going to be pushing all over the place with normal melee damage anyway. In teh grand scheme of things, the 1 knockback on the GBoS proc won't make a bit of difference.<br />
<br />
As for the matter at hand, I'd definately use GBoS mainhand. It's a fine weapon. Save WE for offhand or preferrably find something better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are any of you dual wielding when you are not the main tank on a raid?<br />
<br />
GBoS is a nice agro weapon but a Windblade will easily outdamage it...as will a ton of PP weapons.  If you aren't tanking there is no reason why you shouldn't be using a 2H weapon.</div></div><hr />

You should not say things like that when you don't know the status of every warrior in EQ. There are at least two warriors in my guild that as far as I know lack a good agro weapon comparable to a GBoS. It would be three, but I recently passed down my old worn out Blade of Carnage when I upgraded.<br />
<br />
Although my guild is not in Time yet, we've killed Fennin 3 or 4 times now and we'll be there soon. I'm sure there are similar situations in many guilds out there.</div></div><hr />

While my 2hrs are not great, I get significantly better dps with my DW setups than with either of my 2hrs (GSoT and WMBS). I use the 2h weaps to OT to reduce the ripostes sometimes, but other than that they stay bagged.</div></div><hr />

GBoS is a nice agro weapon but a Windblade will easily outdamage it...as will a ton of PP weapons.  If you aren't tanking there is no reason why you shouldn't be using a 2H weapon.  Have you parsed this? A while back someone posted some parses to prove that WMBS did more DPS than a Windblade. They also ran numbers on their dual wield set up (IIRC it was CHoS+SotB) and the 1h combos actually parsed equal to the WMBS and both did more than Windblade. Depending on the AA path someone has chosen, it is very possible that they have more DPS with 1h weapons than with 2h.</div></div><hr />
