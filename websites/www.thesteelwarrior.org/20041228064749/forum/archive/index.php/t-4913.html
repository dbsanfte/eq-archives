<br />
I thought I understood but i'm getting more and more confused the more I read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, innate mitigation is the disc that makes us better than pallies. shielding is how we resist charm spells. DI and DB is fancy terms Thott came up with to make bards look more in need of help. Defensive is what thott will act like if he reads that.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears up any confusion you may have had. Good day!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shielding is simply a reduction in DB, pretty sure i correct on this.<br />
<br />
To try and understand mitigation.<br />
Lets assume a mob with DI=100 DB=100<br />
<br />
Before changes he'd hit for 200, 300, 400, ... 2100<br />
Or while defensive 150, 200, 250, ... 1100<br />
<br />
(5% mitigation)<br />
With changes i'd expect hits for 195, 290, 285, ... 2000<br />
<br />
However i keep hearing it shifts DI 1 interval to the left, so it actually is 200, 300, 400, ... 2000? (19 intervals)<br />
<br />
How then does defensive work with this?<br />
Defensive 155, 210, 265, ... 1145? (19 intervals)<br />
<br />
/confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DB : Damage Bonus<br />
DI : Damage interval<br />
a NPC melee hit is DB + X*DI, with X being random between 1 and 20. (A PC melee hit is quite the same, with a bit more complex formula with a few things added, but u can consider DB = weapon damage bonus, and DI = weapon damage/10 )<br />
<br />
usual 'mitigation' mean reducing the X value, allowing more min hits (DB + DI ) and less max hits (DB + 20*DI)<br />
<br />
defensive and new warrior innate mitigation work an other way : they directly reduce the value of DI, by 5% for the new warrior innate mitigation, and by 45% for teh new defensive ( instead of 50% before ). <br />
<br />
now, when using defensive, its effect 'stack' with new innate mitigation, allowing 5+45 = 50% reduction of the DI, like good ol' defensive. (this was stated by a dev on this board)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding only works with DB (you can think of it as the minimum hit).  Mitigation via defensive or innate only works with DI (the range a mob can hit for).  Therefore the two stacks with each other fine.  If you have shielding you'd see a lower DB as well as a lower DI (degree depends on whether you're using a disc or not).<br />
<br />
For an extremely simplified example, DB = 1000, DI = 100.  This mob would hit for 1000, 1100, 1200, and so on to 3000.  The range of the hit distribution is a function of your AC and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Suppose we throw in 10% shielding on a Paladin.  This drops DB by 10%, so DB is now 900.  Now we have the same hit distribution but it's over 900, 1000, 1100, ... to 2900.<br />
<br />
Now we give 10% shielding to a warrior who has an innate 5% mitigation bonus to DI.  DI now becomes 95 (100 - 5% = 95).  So our hits now look like 900, 995, 1090, ... to 2800.  To put it in more understandable terms, in this case the warrior's saving per hit, assuming all other factors are equal, is from 0 to 100 HPs (0 if min, 100 if max) per hit.<br />
<br />
Now if we use defensive, that brings mitigation to 50%, and DI is now 50.  Now our hits look like 900, 950, 1000, ... to 1900.  The warrior advantage per hit now varies from 0 to 1000 HPs.  It's kind of mind-boggling really when you think about it, that you can shave so much damage off with defensive and yet people can still use Knights to tank (and that evasive works better than defensive most of the time is likewise quite mind-boggling).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that shielding and mitigation bonus has no effect on the distribution of the hits.  Only AC decides that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron : nice explanation, but remove the case dmg = DB + 0*DI please, as the min hit is DB + 1*DI <br />
so mob hit is 1100, 1200, .... up to 3000 for normal hits, <br />
with shielding : 1000, 1100, ... 2900<br />
warrior + shield is 995, 1090, .... 2800 (warrior saving per hit being 5 for min )<br />
def warrior + shield is 950, ... 1900, (min saving being 50 )<br />
<br />
and for distribution of hits betweeen 1DI and 20DI is dependant on your AC ( more exactly the mitigation part of your AC, coming from defence skill, buffs and equipement ) and from the mob ATK</div></div><hr />

Ooo I'ma copy and paste these explanations to the guild boards, very concise and readable.<br />
<br />
I am not familiar with the term *shielding* - this is the spell based damage soaks, like Guard procs and the Bulwark line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, It's an effect on time items and a few time-level augments.</div></div><hr />

Well no wonder I haven't tripped over it  heh.  T'anks mister!</div></div><hr />
