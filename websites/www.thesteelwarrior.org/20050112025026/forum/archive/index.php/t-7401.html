<br />
Been a lurker here a while and found some interesting threads and advice, just got to the point though where i am a little stuck with my warrior.<br />
<br />
Basicly just after some advice, my main problem is helm upgrades, i have Champions head atm and not sure where to upgrade next, Rallos Zek helm runs 140-200k on my server.  Was tempted by Ornate helm as its 10 raw AC upgrade and would give more hp too but runs 25-50k. Not sure if its worth keep saving and hope for cheap Rallos Zek helm or bite it and get ornate.<br />
<br />
My guild is not a very high level guild and raiding mostly pre pop mobs atm, we have just got an alliance with a couple of other guilds to start doing tier 1 stuff and i am hoping to start hitting Zana in PoI to farm a CHSD soon.<br />
<br />
My plan atm is get 65 and start farming LDoN for Tak BP and Legs to replace those. Other than that and finish the loyaist shield quest i am working on atm i am not really sure where to go.<br />
<br />
So any comments would be helpful, i have arround 30k saved up atm.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice and time looking.<br />

All depending on your play style/time.  Me personally, I can get the plat to buy ornate in about a tenth the time it takes me to force myself to farm LDoN points so that's the direction I would go in your shoes, but your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />
