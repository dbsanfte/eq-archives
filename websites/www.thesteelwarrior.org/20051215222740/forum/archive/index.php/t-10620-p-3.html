<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for information on Maurdon.  We went through purple, killed Lord, went around to Noxxion and wiped 4 times.  He seems to disapear / untargetable for a brief period then atleast 20 little minions spawn.  Goodness gracious that was insane, the last time we thought we controlled the adds then the Spewed Larvae comes in and its all over.  We can easily kill the Princess lady in Arathi Mnts, she spawns adds very similar to Noxxion.  We are lvl 47.  <br />
<br />
My question, are we just to young to kill Noxxion, is Noxxion supposed to disapear during the fight, and are ALL those adds normal?<br />
<br />
Yup, it's normal.  Don't mess around and put the hurt on him fast. If you do it right, he won't pop adds more than 1-2 times.  Those badass poison cure/immune potions are super handy for the fight too.   We usually pulled him to the area just to the right of his pool after clearing trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep. Clear all around Noxx, drink a Nature Resistance Potion (the one that blocks like 2k nature damage, lasts an hour), wait 2 mins then charge so you can drink another resist potion if necessary. The pots are cheap - I bought several for a gold in the AH. 47 is a little low for Nox, I would wait until 48-49 at least.<br />
<br />
Also, you may want to consider AEing the adds. Everything needs to die fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've killed Noxxion a few times and I've never seen him disappear or spawn tons of adds.  Several times throughout the fight he WILL break up into smaller elementals - about 3-4 or them - and then reincorporate back into a  single large elemental.  That's about the most interesting thing about the fight, though.  Never had larvae adds, but I can tell you that my group cleared the mini-larvae in the room he was in (also, we usually cleared through orange so we also cleared out the larvae and momma-larvae room before Noxxion's room, which is an event and requires you shut off the spout that continues to spew out momma-larvae's).  My group was about 46-47 when we did Mauradon for the first time.</div></div><hr />

Go in the back way and its a three minute run.... just have to kill a golem at the back entrance and its cake to chew thru the dark irons and a couple scopions.</div></div><hr />

I don't know of any other trainer that annoying to reach or that requires you force friends along for the train-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'll have to look into getting a key then, I suppose it drops somewhere past the enchanter trainer just to make it even more annoying to get.<br />
<br />
I usually just two-box it so I don't have to nag people into coming, but my enchanter is only level 40 so it's a huge pain the ass. If my ench over agros and dies I have to start all the way over usually if I'm too far in. -_-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm not delusional you don't need a key. It's a quick run thru to the back of the cave I marked with a Blue Circle on the map I'm attaching. Don't even need to fight the Troggs just run past them to the back of the cave. When you get inside there is a gate with a Golem standing past it. Once you kill it your back to fighting standard Uldaman quality mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aight, I had a friend over the first time I did the enc run, he said I needed a key for the backdoor. I haven't been motivated enough to actually check it out, but I'm out that way a lot so I'll just take a look.</div></div><hr />
