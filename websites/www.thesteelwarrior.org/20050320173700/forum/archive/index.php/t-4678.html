<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well yesterday I tried to log into Everquest and it would not let me in. I thought I was maybe typoing my password but when I actually payed attention to the message being displayed it said I had been banned. I emailed SOE immediately but have still not gotten a response as to why I was banned. Not sure if you get different messages like&quot;suspended or what not but mine said I was banned and to contest it email SOE. I have never ever had a warning over anything, never been anything but polite to GM's when I petition. No one knows my info.<br />
<br />
This worries me a lot. I was just like everyone else that smirked when someone said they had been &quot;hacked&quot;, but I have read some very strange and unstelling posts about hacking problems in Everquest lately.  There is even a post on FOH where one hacker was insulting someone because of their  real life race. <br />
<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this? From friends or first hand experience? I read that SOE has banned hundreds of accounts, maybe I will get an email that mine was a mistake or something, but there has to have been something  bad in the records, and I seriously doubt it was me. I know I can use strong language in groups when I talk now and then, but no one has ever complained to me directly about it.<br />
<br />
What worries me is that SOE seem to be brushing off a lot of these accounts, and that the hackers seem to be getting more than just game info. I hope I am just being paranoid, and am reading too much into these posts surfacing about this situation, but only time will tell I guess.</div></div><hr />

They have to give you a reason why you were banned.  Then take it from there dont worry about it just yet it might have been a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like it. They shucked hundreds of accounts for the recent dupes/sploits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its possible that you might have done something that triggered their alarms without even knowing you did it.  Just because Sony knows something is an exploit doesn't mean all the players do too--its not like they post the exploits so people know to avoid doing those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be curious to know if you sold any high priced items recently.  I got the impression they were going to try to track down the plat and if one of the scammers bought a few hundred k worth of stuff off you, well... <br />
<br />
I had wondered if this might not bite some (relatively) innocent people because of sales.</div></div><hr />
