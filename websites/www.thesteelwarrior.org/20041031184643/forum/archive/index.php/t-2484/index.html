<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turgan7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After my last post here I threw some pp on my little Warrior and got him some more AC according to your suggestions. It looks decent so far but I would like to plan on further upgrades. As I see it face, neck and hands are the weakest spots. I think about cultural for all three maybe Champion Gloves. My current bank account will go for a GSoT as soon as I hit 55 so it will take some additional time saving.<br />
<br />
Question now is: Did I miss anything or should I just follow the plan?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Razzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cultural in the three slots you mentioned would fit wonderfully.<br />
<br />
Also, ditch Cobalt. Zero stats = totally useless. I'd recomend Helanic Tundra as a replacement for those, too, as the Thurgadin/SS boots have absolute shit for stats.</div></div><hr />
