Im not that computer knowledgeable but would like to know what Im dealing with before I finally turn to taking my comp to a repair man.<br />
<br />
When I boot up my computer and turn on my monitor, the monitor goes straight to power save/sleep mode.<br />

I bought a new monitor and same problem.<br />

I took out the video card, cleaned up the apg slot and card pins and reinstalled , nothing<br />
<br />
I bought a new video card, but directions say i need to go in and totaly uninstall old card drivers to install. cant do that with no grapics.<br />
<br />
I tryed hitting F8 when I start my Computer to start in safe mode but that was a no go.<br />
<br />
Also when I plug in my computer it sounds like it is starting up with out me touching the power button. Friend told me to make sure the power switch on the back of the computer was off, but I couldnt find it =(<br />

I think the best advice you could get from here is to have someone knowledgeable nose-to-nose with your computer putter with it.  It's so much easier to mis-diagnose the error than to diagnose it.  If you take it to a repair man, make sure there is some guarantee of their work.  I'd quite possibly be able to find your problem if I had my hands on your machine (I'm not an expert, but I've done some support) - but from here, I'm more likely to  make your problem worse.</div></div><hr />

Boot disks use a default display driver with a basic refresh rate.<br />
<br />
I would point to something getting wacked in the bios, like maybe it got set to 4x when the card supports 2 only (just an example) or something.  Or maybe power save was set on, or the &quot;wake on lan&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
Try getting into the bios, and double checking the settings. Can even flash the bios if your MB supports it.<br />
<br />
Think about what has changed, hardware or software wise, since the last time it booted up normally. If nothing has changed, it could just be a bad MB, especially if you can't even get into the bios.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
