<br />
We grouped near Kelethin and proceeded to clear the scum of the first platforms; but an ambush at the warrior guild forced us to a prompt retreat.<br />
<br />
We regrouped and were able to attract one of the guillmasters himself, Sindl Talonclaw, in a dark part of the woods. After an epic fight we were victorious, and left his corpse to rot, forgoten by all.<br />
<br />
As as proud representant of the Halas Warriors it was an honor to participate in this punitive raid.<br />

/ooc : The fight lasted 1h15, with 36 of us, average level 56.. this guy has more hp than anything I have ever seen before, of course they aren't meant to be killed. He didn't hit too hard (350 max) ... and of course he was up again 2 minutes after we killed him :)</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it's time for the Teir`dal to rally on Fennin as well. Death will be the only sanctuary for these cowardly, branch-swinging pales. Innoruuk Ultrine!<br />
