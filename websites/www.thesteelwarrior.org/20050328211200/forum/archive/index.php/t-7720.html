<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If all of you are on CoV faction its easy. If not then here are the options.<br />
<br />
1. CoV faction CoHable mage<br />
2. die at entrance SOS rogue drag and cleric with CoV faction res at HoT<br />
3. Spend about an hour clearing shit.<br />
<br />
As you can see there its very hard to get to him without CoV faction. Plus his drops wont do you any good without max ally faction to CoV anyways.<br />
<br />
If you talking about getting to Doz once you are in HoT he is very close to entrance. Just look up some maps of hot. There are some excellent ones out there. Think www.monkly-business.com had some good ones and pulling strats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, get on CoV faction and it's cake. There's only like 6 trash mobs to clear, and once slowed Doze is very, very gimp. The biggest key is getting the casters to dodge the AEs if you don't have many people. Pacify pulling works in HoT, fyi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my 1 encounter (3 attempts back to back) with Dozekar (2 mos &amp; lots of AA ago):<br />
<br />
A) As Holywrath said, plan on slower being in the belly to land slow, and keep casting it throughout fight (our last attempt, it was lack of re-slow that killed me)<br />
<br />
B) Whoever pulls and tanks will get hit by a mana dot of somesort (no biggee for a warrior except it takes a slot)<br />
<br />
C) An instant cast clicky is almost essential, I could not keep up with the debuff with my clicky gaunt haste.<br />
<br />
D) Pulling him with a tag team worked well getting him to the door for HoT for tanking after clearing the pit and roamers.<br />
<br />
E) His HP regen is huge, expect to have a lot of dps there and remember that all casters will be useless unless they are getting hit by the AE and nuking his belly or healing you.<br />
<br />
I think if we had 3 full groups rather than barely two groups and I had an instant cast clicky and the casters knew from pull one that it was a belly mob for casting, we'd been fine.  We wiped fast on first pull with me trying to pull him to a position in pit.  Second pull we did noticably better, but our wizard and mage and druid were not landing nukes and couldn't reslow and were barely keeping mob at 97% health (remember everyone haste was gone fast because of debuff and no instant clickies on anyone).  Third attempt, we got him down past 75% health but could not land slow again (enchanter didn't realize slow had to be done in the belly, although they should've guessed after the wizard said, yes, nukes were landing near full in belly of mob) and the cleric healing me went lom fast once it was unslowed again (and cleric wasted some mana trying to keep a dummy buff on me).<br />
<br />
We didn't try a fourth time because several of us were tired and it was a really nice day out and no instant clickies were for sale in the bazaar and we couldn't find backup for extra dps due to ppl being on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can single group him if your cleric is talented and your tank fat.<br />
<br />
just keep him slowed and bring a rog for dps and a druid for backup heals.</div></div><hr />

I have done Dozekar 20 times now, quite a few 6 boxing him myself.  Cuthbadth's story of problems can be quite real as I've seen 2 and 3 groups wipe to Dozekar.  There are several keys to this fight:<br />
<br />
1)  Instant clicky item OR group buff spells.  Instant clicky really should be had on the main tank, the goblin earring is probably cheap and works well, there are plenty other items.  If not, then you need someone to cast a group spell (ENC group MR, druid group seasons, etc).  I use this technique (group MR) to keep buffs on my other toons as they go in to nuke.<br />
<br />
2)  Perfecting pull technique.  I normally clear the two guardian dragons, jump on down and check the left door for roamer, if none, then I open Doz's door, shoot with arrow as far away as possible, then jump back up.  You can do this by jumping on the small lip near the 'pillars' near each door.  You can then jump up on the next step and get back up.  As an ogre I put myself in NDT form, as if you are a large race or small race you cannot get back up (least not as a max shrunk ogre).  I then engage Doz at the firepot.  The jumping deal takes a bit of practice, mucking that up will result in the MT going splat, so practice it a bit.<br />
<br />
3)  Healing power and sticking it out for the duration.  Your healer(s) should never be hit by the aoe as they'll be behind a wall somewhere, either near the entrance door or behind the wall opposite the firepot you fight Doz at (near the steps, right when you get the 'danger' message)<br />
<br />
4)  Buffing properly.  Make sure to put some crap group buffs at the top slots.  Instaclicky buffs should be first.  Keep in mind that you cannot resist his AoE with 1 slot debuff.  So, everyone in his AoE will take 400dmg and lose one buff each time.<br />
<br />
I do him with 65 clr/dru/enc/nec/war/mag.  The enchanter only slows and casts guard of druzzil.  I normally have the mage go in and chain nuke between slows, druid heals him and guard of druzzil keeps his buffs on.  Then the necro does DoT stacking and stays out of AoE most of the time.  Your cleric will be timing CH's.  A manarod is a great idea for this fight.  A backup healer can be handy as well, should slow not be done asap or you get a lot of resists on reslowing.  Even with tash and malosinia on Doz, my enchanter has a good amount of trouble slowing sometimes.<br />
<br />
The first time I beat dozekar I was totally geared in HoT armor with the droga weapons on the warrior and a couple of chardok B level items, really nothing overly impressive.  Having defensive AAs on the warrior will help quite a bit for this, though the change with disciplines being unlinked also helps a great deal !!  Furious then defensive/stonewall will get you over the hump for the first slow.<br />
<br />
With just my group taking my time, I do dozekar in the 23-30 minute range (more 23ish times these days).  With my old guild of 2-3 groups we did dozekar in about 15 minutes as we would race to see just how fast we could burn him down.  Last but not least is an average summary of all the times I've done Dozekar.  Even having killed him in the 15 minute range, his total HPs were still over 300k.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it is good 100hp gear, but not only do you need to farm dozekar, you need to farm all the little mini named for rare symbols which are also 7 day spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iirc, he's unslowable also.  We tried him a few weeks ago with me tanking (5500hps unbuffed).  We had 10 people total, all similarly geared to me, and all we had for heals was a 65 druid, 54 druid, and occasional patch heals from a 54 shaman.  We failed with Dozekar at 40% health, and I was about 1 minute and some change from defensive refresh.  Basically if you can put together 2 solid groups in Ornate quality gear you should be able to take him.</div></div><hr />

I always tanked him in the SW corner by the door (shrunk and behind the firepot) and had the casters hide by the door itself.  Single-grouped him with Fierce Heraldic or so gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is slowable, just very resistant to normal slow (non poison) and you need to be in his belly to land it.</div></div><hr />
