<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThanAlhazred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which is more useful in keeping/maintaining agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No one seems to really know, i personally use hammer in prim and sword in off, seen warriors use sword in prim and hammer in offhand.<br />
Try it out, both being good aggro weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sword is better aggro then CHSD in my experience... a proc from hammer will not necceserily turn a mob towards me.. a proc from the sword usually does. When my friend the shaman starts going full aggro hammer proc's don't keep the mob on me... sword proc's do however. I got the feeling EB weapons are nice for crazy ass long fights a-la luclin.. and that PoP mobs don't live long enough for them to start adding the numbers on the hate list and see whom they hate most :)<br />
<br />
A good 2hander still outaggro's this combo thou.. ( and is a lot easyer on the healer)... which is a crying shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think people see the &quot;adds hate&quot; on the chsd , but they dont realize the Gbos has a stun component to its proc , sure every mob in EQ is immune to the stun but , it still generates alot of aggro , not to mention that the Gbos proc does damage too , 179dd or some 358's if you have ingenuity trained. The Gbos also has a better ratio. The added dps from better ratio and damaging proc makes it the better weapon imo.<br />

While this is not very large knockback, it is in fact a little bit of knockback, which I find helps much more than it hurts, in addition to adding agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Where are u getting your info ? Nothing on anything i can find about it says it has a knockback , i also use one fulltime , and alot of times its me and one melee friend on the mob , he behind me in front balanceing the &quot;push&quot; . Even with a good string of proc with mob &quot;balanced&quot; between us  , it doesnt move.<br />

Observation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok , i realized why i have never seen it push back , every mob above lvl 40 or so seems to resist the stun portion of the proc . <br />
When it goes off i get a message like , &quot;mob is forcestruck for 179 damage &quot; and right below it &quot;this mob is immune to this portion of the effect&quot;. So i think u still get soem nice aggro for trying to stun the mob , but it never actually gets pushed around.<br />
<br />
Mofu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Um, actually that is not true Mofu... the push back portion of the spell is entirely independant from the stun portion; it just seems that stun and pushback seem to travel as partners on procs.<br />
<br />
You will still get push back even if mob is immune to GBoS's stun (which is damn near every mob anymore)... 1 ft push back just isn't incredibly noticeable.  Only way I can say that you'd be able to see it for sure is, in an exp group sometime, get 3 people on the back of the mob fighting it, and only you on the front... you'll see the mob steadily gets pushed toward you, but when you proc, he takes a step back away from you, almost as though there were more people pushing from the front for a second or two.  that is the push back working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A one foot knock back will never hurt a warrior ,Being that almost always melee are pushing the mob into the war and at much greater force than a measley one foot...<br />
<br />
I never notice the KB on my Gbos and I never notice it on my Gaudralek,Unless I am alone using it,and even then I only notice if I string a couple procs close together,,,<br />
<br />
Haveing said that,I do not own a CHSD however I do have a BoC,and I prefer the Gbos in mainhand over the Boc in almost every situation,only occasionally do I mainhand then boc and usually only if defensive and right at the start of a fight to get a couple procs in for an initial boost in aggro...<br />
<br />
Simply put,The Proc Rate on the Gbos cannot be beat,it is fast and procs a shit load,It procs enough that random folks in random pick up groups Excalim,&quot;Damn,That sword of your's procs Alot ! what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fantastic weapon....Don't pass it up if you ever get the chance to grab one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless your guild has 4-5 warrs with these and they are all on the same side of the MOB on a raid...it causes significant problems in this situation.  Especially if you are near a surface area that will cause the raid significant problems (ledges being the one of these).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have tested (not scientifically) boc + gbos, and prefer boc main hand, i was in a group with a monk(191aa) using Great Staff of Four Winds, and boc kept aggro more consistently than gbos<br />
