I cant confirm or not if this wil work but,, once I got my Epics done I combined to the 2HS and got a Mage summoned Sword of Rune (the lvl 18 mage spell) and combined it alone and got my 2 1HS's, so now I have both 1HS's and 2HS at the same time (and finally banked that dam scabbard) which makes me wonder if just getting the Scabbard and combining a Sword of Rune without having the other parts would make the 1HS's  , if you can get the scabbard have a lvl 18 mage summon you a sword and try it..  , maybe skip that part all together. <br />
<br />
Can someone explain this a bit more clearly.  It sounds like you can have both the 1H and 2H weaps at the same time.  I would love to get rid of that damn bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have your Epic already; combine it to make the Jagged Blade of War ( the 2Her )<br />
Next, put the Jagged Blade of War in a bag or whatever.<br />
Now, find a level 18 or higher Magician.<br />
Have said Magician summon a Sword of Rune ( it's a level 18 spell for a weapon to give the pet )<br />
Have Magician give you the sword and take it and put it in your Red Scabbard. Click the 'Combine' Button on the Red Scabbard and &quot;poof!&quot; Out comes your Blade of Tactics and Blade of Strategy ( the 1Hers )..<br />
<br />
Put Red Scabbard in Bank. Don't Destroy it :D <br />
<br />
and they fixed the quest too a while back; you used to be able to just complete the Red Scabbard and make the Epics without getting the rest of the parts but no longer will it work.</div></div><hr />
