<br />
Now that I'm 67 I'm grinding out some more AAs to finish off some of my tanking abilities. Got the two BoSs and I'm about to aug one with anger III. <br />
<br />
I can mass about 4 groups on any given night and I'm thinking about setting up an AoW raid. Can't afford a BoC in the bazaar on Bertoxxulous (goes for about 500k). <br />
<br />
Any suggestions you guys have got would be greatly appreciated, as always.<br />

So I advise you to keep them untill your group/raid allows you better content. The best now would be to get royalist faction for the tier 1 OoW armor (armsmaster's xxx) and to start your quest for thr royalist shield (not a big upgrade but it would let you free a buff slot).<br />
<br />
but for your weapons ...<br />
well, first I congratulate you for having completed you epic 1.0 ! you can bag it now !<br />
the BoS is lame aggro at lvl67, your GSoT+A3 would blow (both dps wise and aggro wise) your BoS+A3/BoS combo (BTW update your magelo on augment and on the charm slot). if you want to use a DW setup for aggro then buy either BB'sC or SoM'sV or RS-HS or CHoS or SotB or MoM, or LIK ... some of them may be much cheaper than a BoC, and it will fits well in offhand when you will roll a BoC.<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />

EDIT : check this thread for a larger list of upgrade.</div></div><hr />
