<br />
this might be kinda outdated and stuff.. but i have some general questions about luclin...<br />
<br />
The thing is, I'm playing in a server where the current update is up to Velious. Finally, next month Luclin is to be introduced...<br />
<br />
I being a newbie, remember when Velious first opened up in our Server... I didn't know anything so it took me a while to realize what should have been my priorities(after waisting time doing useless stuffs)...<br />
<br />
So this is my question... when Luclin openes up.. what should be my priorities... yes I know AA's Key farmings.. and stuff..  but other than that.. any important quests i should start right along(like Coldain ring of Velious).. <br />
<br />
And I'm also curious.. in what order would an average guild advance through Luclin (ex. in velious it would be something like vindi and other st key mobs -&gt; dain, tormax -&gt; tunare/ST/NTOV-&gt; AoW)<br />
<br />
Well to put it in short.. i with i could hear something like a walkthrough of Luclin(since its outdated infos aren't abundant).. so that I wouldn't feel so stupid like when Velious first opened up in my server )<br />
<br />
Oh.. and I'm a Warrior..</div></div><hr />
