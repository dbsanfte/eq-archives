<br />
Warrior, Monk, Shaman - Figured it would be the best combo, and thats the classes we wanted to play.. but. We aren't real sure where to go to get the absolute best exp for our levels.. we would like to get 50 quick.. we are all level 13 now, and are well equiped<br />
<br />
Shammy has 235 wis, Monk has Trancestick and KD, Warrior(I) Have Guard Captains Mallet and Lammy(Gonna switch lammy for LSoEE)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone got some suggestions for us as to where to hunt for the quickest exp?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've leveled up a few chars lately and after PC I went to the skeeters in Echo Caverns on the FG side.  They're easy, DS totally destroys them, and their wings and legs sell to NPC vendors for 2pp each.  Dunno if there are enough of them for a trio though.  With my mage-cleric duo I went and did the sarnak fort in LOIO, which is pretty much deserted these days.  After 30ish I grouped them with my warrior and did giants in GD, so I can't tell you much about the mid-upper 30s.  Did apes and then Zelniaks in DSP with my warrior in that range IIRC.</div></div><hr />

I had commented on the combo... but I see now that was not the question. (so I removed it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sarnak fort is fun. Solusek goblins should be fun and profitable and that dungeon should keep you going for a while. (I remember still getting xps for some stuff at around 35th-40th level).  Inside splitpaw and outside at the spires are both good from about 25-35.  While cash doesnt sound like a problem for you, in both sol and paw the mobs drop fine steel weapons too.  In the 30-40 range crypt of dalnir and kaesora are both really fun dungeons.  Guk is pretty good from about 25 up...upper guk for lower levels and lower guk for upper levels.  There's lots of places in velious and on the moon for the mid levels too.   That taps out my little grey cells.  <br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

Skeeters in Echo (FG side)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and from about 30ish on up you can also hit ToFS.  One of the more fun dungeons in the game.  CR can be a pain if you dont have spare keys in the bank, but the zone is big fun to hunt in.<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />
