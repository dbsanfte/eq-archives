The reason I ask is hardly anyone is EVER fighting there on my server as far as I can tell.  Every time I go into that zone there are prolly like 8 or so people there and thats about it.<br />
<br />
Also are there any other aggro procs out there that would be easy for a 48 war to get?  I know about CHoS but thats a little outta my price range right now.  Any info would be great.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at a WaveCrasher, they should be fairly cheap these days.  It has a 20% slow and 20hp a tick DoT on it and is decent for aggro.<br />
<br />
A CHoS is definately a good aggro weapon and dont' forget its brother Sword of the Bloodsworn or the 2hander GreatSword of the Bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
Also, the Greatstaff of Thunder is an excellent aggro weapon with its DD + Stun proc on it and that item's price has dropped quite a bit recently, at least on my server.  Though a 2hander really doesn't shine until you get your Punishing Blade AAs or at least break 60 for the increase in attacks.<br />
<br />
Its odd you are asking about Anger3 augs when you're 48 and cannot afford a CHoS, hehe, as I doubt you'd want to spend the time getting the aug to put it on a subpar weapon.  I'd think getting an anger1 or 2 aug and putting it on a CHoS would be outstanding bang for the buck, or perhaps hitting the Guk themes to get the Ykesha aug, which would be outstanding for a 48 warrior on a CHoS or GSoT or any weapon really.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the only true aggro augs are the Anger (duh) and Ykesha.  Some say the Guard augs (I have no experience on them) are as well.  The anger only drops in Everfrost theme, to my knowledge.  Ykesha from Guk (s.ro) theme and Guards from Tak (n.ro) theme.</div></div><hr />

I spent pretty much around 100k or so upgrading everything else on my warr to get some good hp/ac and a CHoS is like 20k right now on my server and all i have left after my upgrades is about 3k.  Just check out my magelo....I sold everything on my 55 mage I have and funded my warrior(my warrior is my new main now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 48 (and broke) I was able to save up for a Frostbringer which got me through to 55 and a GSoT.  Before Frosty I dual wielded Black Blades of Torment.<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn is usually significantly cheaper than CHoS, and would work just as well for you, if it's within your potential price range.  <br />
<br />
And no, there's no other way to get an Anger III aug.  However, at 48, there's really no need to have an Anger III aug anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Edit- heh, didn't realize you have a SoBS already.  You could essentially have that main handed and a Greater Lightstone in your offhand and have enough agro (with your Provoke Line) at 48.  Keep in mind your offhand is probably under 1 proc/min anyway, so it's not the main contributer to your agro.  If you're having problems with agro with Provoke+SoBS, then your group needs to tone it down a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, a guildy of mine came acrose a GM (or guide) in arena of Bazaar one day. The GM killed him. After that, my guildy was given an Anger III aug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah right now at 48 I have 0 problem keeping aggro, what I was doing though was looking down the road on what steps need to be taken for me to be able to hold aggro well into the 50's and 60's.  Right now I pretty much get complimented all the time on how great of a little dwarfy tank I am.  I mean I've had quite a few dungeons where not a single other person save the puller got hit the entire dungeon(which the clerics love btw :D )<br />
Really though im fixin to start hitting tier 1 planes pretty hard over the next week or two and I hope to hit 65 within the month, that was my main reason for the question about aggro. :)</div></div><hr />

wrong. there is NO DD on GSoTh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also don't forget that at your level, you couldn't get an Anger3 anyway, because of how few pts you get.  By the time you get 1150 pts saved starting at 10 pts per adventure, you'll be 60 before you have em saved :D <br />
<br />
Of course, you could die a lot...<br />
<br />
Might not be exactly 10 pts/adv.  I know I got 6 pts at like 39, and my 54 got 17?  But you get the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malikae</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I wouldnt worry about anger augs until you get to at least 60. You cant use them until then anyway. 510 points just for anger II will take you forever before you hit your 60's.<br />
<br />
And sure, agro is not a problem yet. Just wait until you start fight level 50+ mobs and PoP mobs. Then the fun starts.</div></div><hr />
