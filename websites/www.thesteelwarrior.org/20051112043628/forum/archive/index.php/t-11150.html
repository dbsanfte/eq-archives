And how often do you use the mouse to click abilities vs using the keyboard?  Looking for some ideas/setups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">04-01-2005, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For movement I use the alpha keys on the left side of the keyboard (a,s,d,w, and q,e for strafe).  This keeps my left hand near my most often used hot buttons (2 thru 4 for me).<br />
<br />
To swtich stances, I changed the default Ctrl-F1 for defensive to the numpad's '+' key, Ctrl-F2 for Battle to the numpad '-' key, and Ctrl-F3 for zerk to the numpad '*' key.  This keeps my stance changes right by my mouse hand.<br />
<br />
To switch weapons, I reconfigured the F9 thru F12 keys to activate sidebar hotbuttons where I have my weapons hot buttoned for switching.  Its layed out like so:<br />
<br />
F12 - 2h weap<br />
F11 - main hand 1h<br />
F10 - off hand 1h<br />
F9 - shield<br />
<br />
This puts me into any weapon config in 1 to 3 key presses.  The only real pain is going from 1h+s to dual wield.  I have to equip my 2h to unequip my shield, then equip my main hand, then my off.  Its not perfect, but once you get used to it, it works pretty good and doesnt break when they upgrade the client (*cough* cosmos *cough*)<br />
<br />
My left hand stays focused on movement and my main hot buttons while my right hand focuses on looking around, switching stances, and switching weapons.<br />
<br />
So far this has worked very well for my style/tastes. ymmv.<br />
<br />
For clickies or long cool down abilities/items, I use the mouse mainly to click on them.<br />
<br />
My hotbuttons always seem to be shifting around, but it usually looks some thing like this.<br />
<br />
1 - melee attack (mainly for visual indication that im in auto attack).<br />
2 - rend<br />
3 - sunder<br />
4 - overpower/revenge (twitch key)<br />
5 - hamstring/shield block<br />
<br />
the rest vary so much its not even funny.<br />
<br />
I also put the Shield Bash in a sidebar hotbutton and assign it to the numpad '0' key (numlock MUST be turned on for it to work).  I've found that to help a lot when I see someone casting, its really easy for me to reach over with my mouse thumb and hit that big old key. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
27 warrior here, and it seems every day when I login i'm changing my hotkeys around to try to find that &quot;perfect&quot; setup.....and this obviously leads to lots of screw-ups as i am relearning my hotkeys everyday lol.<br />
<br />
In other words....../bump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leekos</div><div class="date">04-05-2005, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my personal set-up:<br />
<br />
Battle stance:<br />
<br />
1 - Melee attack<br />
2 - Heroic Strike<br />
3 - Rend<br />
4 - Thunder Clap<br />
5 - Hamstring<br />
6 - Overpower<br />
7 - Shield Bash<br />
8 - Mortal Strike<br />
9 - Charge<br />
0 - Battle Shout<br />
-    Intimidating Shout<br />
=   Sunder Armor<br />
<br />
Defensive Stance<br />
<br />
1 - Melee attack<br />
2 - Heroic Strike<br />
3 - Rend<br />
4 - Taunt<br />
5 - Sunder Armor<br />
6 - Revenge<br />
7 - Shield Bash<br />
8 - Mortal Strike<br />
9 - Shield Block<br />
0 - ****(Can't remember.. must not use it much  lol)<br />
-    Intimidating Shout<br />
=   Shield Wall<br />
<br />
Don't really use berserker stance much, plus it's not completely full.  Mainly just for Intercept during PvP, and that's the same button as Charge in Battle Stance.<br />
<br />
Mainly, I put the buttons on there as I got them and just got so used to hitting that hotkey that I was afraid to move them or I'd mess up.  Now I just know: &quot;Yay, the mob dodged... hit '6'!!&quot;  (Btw, is it just me, or is the warrior the only class where you HOPE the mob will dodge?  lol)<br />
<br />
As for non hot-keys, I usually have trinkets, potions, bandages, tradeskills, weapons, Sweeping Strikes, Cleave, Blood Rage, Execute, Retaliation, Intimidating Shout, Challenging Shout, and Mocking Blow.  (plus my &quot;Moo&quot; macro.  Being a tauren, I always moo at any alliance I pass by  lol)<br />
<br />
Hey, uncle.. what do you have on the bar to have your off hand weapon actually go to your off hand.  When I try it, it just swaps out my main hand.</div></div><hr />

this is one of the major p.i.t.a.'s about weapon switching in WoW.  The only thing I've found that works (besides semi-complicated macros) is to equip my 2h weap, then equip which ever weap I want in my main hand next, then my off hand.  You gotta do it in that order too =(  Once you have an off and equiped, the only way to change it is to do it drag-n-drop style or by equiping your 2h'er to clear the off hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leekos</div><div class="date">04-05-2005, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Geez, I feel like a newb all over again  lol.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response, uncle.. I had figured as much.  Cosmos used to have an &quot;/equipoffhand&quot; but that's been broken, and after the recent patch and the implementation of &quot;Sky&quot; (read &quot;utterly useless&quot;), I got rid of Cosmos in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
Now.. Xvenator:<br />
<br />
Num . - Defensive Stance<br />
Num 3 - Battle Stance<br />
Num 6 - Beserker Stance<br />
<br />
How did you do this?  I didn't know you could bind stance changes to a key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xvenator</div><div class="date">04-05-2005, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">leekos, just open up your &quot;spell book&quot;, hit the &quot;p&quot; key, and drag the icons to a hotkey slot.  Since this makes the the class bar(where the stances usally are) obsolete, I have a add-on that removes the class bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For weapon switches I use the macros from this thread.  They have worked well for me so far. <br />

<br />
The ones in the main bar, i tried to make it so that the ones who have similar functions are it the same places. For example, charge is at the same button as intercept.<br />
<br />
On button 1 i have charge, intercept and shoot bow (for battle, berserk and defe stance)</div></div><hr />
