<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As we all know, /shield drops damage vs someone else 50%, you take 75%..... not modified by discs/AAs, only by an actual shield.... I have yet to see any hard data on this though....<br />
<br />
Has anyone done solid testing, to find out:<br />
<br />
1) Is the damage reduced by the SHIELDED char's AA/disc? ie, MT is defensive on a 3k hitting mob, max hits reduced to 2k, say average nonmax hit is 1k (reduced by 12.5% for max ID).... While shielded during disc, MT would take 1k max, 500 average nonmax...would the warrior /shielding that warrior take a) 1333 max, 667 average nonmax (based on the ACTUAL damage the MT would be taking, or b) 2000 max, 1500 average nonmax (based on damage MT would be taking WITHOUT /defensive or CS+ID)<br />
<br />
2) Just how is the damage reduced by the AC of a shield? Any comparisons done on same mob, with no shield &amp; varying AC shields? Could be either rune-like, every hit reduced by the AC of the shield directly, or multiples, or, more likely, reduced by some percentage...either direct percent (would make high end PoP shields way too effective) or by some sort of formula....<br />
<br />
Been thinking about doing some solid parse testing to figure this out, but if someones already done so......... point me to the results =) Haven't noticed them anywhere, here or other boards, but  I spose its possible I missed em..... If nobody has any solid testing results,  I spose I'll start doing some testing this week, and will post results here afterwards</div></div><hr />

Funny thing about this.  I was in chardok last weekend ghetto AE'ing the bank.  There were many times the mobs shielded each other at low life, and the chat box looked like this.<br />
<br />
A Treasury Guard begins to use a Slaveblock Guard as a living shield!<br />
You slash a Treasury Guard for 56 points of damage<br />
You slash a Slaveblock Guard for 56 points of damage<br />
You slash a Treasury guard for 113 points of damage<br />
You slash a Slaveblock guard for 113 points of damage<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, i'm no rocket scientist here, but 56 can not be both 50% and 75% of the same number, nor can 113.  So either NPC's get a bonus while shielded up to  50/50, or shield is set up that way for all.  It's a little more difficult to tell when you're shielding a PC if those are the actual percentages.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just type in /shield without targeting anything and the game will tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You don't need to use a shield, but damage is reduced if you are.<br />
<br />
/shield can not be used when either you, or the person you are attempting to /shield is using a disc.  So you can't /shield a defensive warrior.</div></div><hr />
