<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">since Badaan is crying like a little bitch i'll remove the link.<br />
<br />
btw it was mentioning that Robert Palmer died today. I figured it was worth mentioning since a lot of us in our 30's remember his music well ( heck, anyone who saw MTV has seen him ore times than you could remember) and since Baadan has decided to grace us with his lack of properly using the underlining tool to get his point across; i'll be nice and remove the link to the Washington Post where I read it this morning :D<br />
<br />
Sorry for any inconvience to anyone.</div></div><hr />
