<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oogmol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Considering the problems with aggro, and the contributing problem of our relatively low DPS. Maybe Sony should consider improving our damage tables? Certainly not equal to monk/rogue in terms of pure DPS, but we, as warriors are masters of the ways of melee, we should at least be able to contribute a respectable level of DPS. Maybe most would consider it a &quot;bandaid&quot; approach, but if aggro is such a problem to balance, why not make the warrior slightly more acceptable as a damage dealer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Additional DPS works in all situations, even if the warrior isn't the main tank. This would probably be all that is needed.<br />
<br />
I'll go ahead and say that not everyone does 100+DPS on an average, so the BoW weilders can take this into account. (edit: I just parsed my latest logs and with my setup and no bards I get 50-60dps. This is at 65 with no offensive AA's. If I'm that far behind the curve then I'm at a loss for how to improve it.)<br />
<br />
The &quot;upper crust&quot; aren't the ones who are in need so much as the middle class in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've parsed myself in nearly the same range, Steenky, so maybe I'm joining you under the bus that is DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Could anyone give me a rough idea on how to parse my damage? We try like this.<br />
X= times you landed hit on target<br />
N= total amount of damage from all landed hits on target<br />
<br />
<br />
N/x*.60=DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">go to www.yalp.org, download the parser.  Go into EQ.  Turn your log file on, go whoop some ass for awhile.<br />
<br />
log out, open log file with parser, and it will tell you what your DPS is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ah ok thx. will do that tonight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can also download and use EQWatcher: Evolution. It's a real-time parser, meaning that it parses the fight as it's happening and speaks your DPS to you at the end of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally I don't think warriors need more DPS.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I am having at the moment is dying out of order of the tank lists.  Frequently when the first tank goes down I'm the next to have agro and as Im usually not the next tank on the list it means I'm often dead before my turn to tank comes up.<br />
<br />
I no longer use 2hs on raid bosses and sometimes go as far as not wielding an offhand weapon until my turn to tank comes up when I will swap in a BoC.<br />
<br />
Unless we get given some way to mitigate agro I for one don't want more DPS (I certainly don't want additional +hate per swing unless its switchable) and to me an evade skill doesn't really fit the vision for the warrior class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's a good point. Alot of folks look at aggro in the opposite light including myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not even getting into disciplines...<br />
<br />
Monks and Shadow knights - Feign Death<br />
Rogues - Evade<br />
Rangers - Jolt<br />
Paladins - Root, back off, run away while screaming like a little girl. Maybe DA, run away while screaming like a  little girl. Lots o' little girl variations. ;)<br />
Warriors - /shrug, take the hits, maybe die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As forementioned, I don't want to be the DPS clown of my group. I was a warrior to take damage, and keep other people from taking damage. If I'm gimped in doing that, I'm not going to stick around the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">According to Kreugen (and no one disputed the numbers in that thread) the difference between a top warrior and a top Paladn is 165 vs 125 DPS.  The problem is that the gap suddenly isn't that good if you're on the lower end, so if you take say half of each you end up with 80 vs 60 DPS which is not nearly as big a gap.  Also Knights use 2H pretty much always, while lots of lower end warriors are stuck with DW which is typically low DPS so that makes the gap even closer than it should.<br />
<br />
A couple warrior only weapons that has comparable ratio to the weapons you'd expect a Knight to use will probably help.  Though I do not think DPS is the answer because we actually already do enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Phantron,<br />
<br />
I disputed the numbers in the thread...although I'm not a big fan of upping warrior DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Warriors - /shrug, take the hits, maybe die&quot;<br />
<br />
Have you ever considered turning off attack?<br />
<br />
That helps reduce aggro a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also leaves you low on the aggro list when you may want to take over before half the raid (higher aggro) wipes though :) taunt as we know doesn't always work, AEtaunt isn't infallible - being somewhere near the top of the list is helpful. Maintaining rampage is another consideration. in exp Any time you do get aggro you turn off attack sure but you still tend to be focus of attention til someone else effects an action.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes!   Awesome idea, do nothing!  The ultimate in skillful playing.   <br />
<br />
I am sick to my stomach.   Sick to my stomach that people have such a skewed notion of this game that it is now fashinable for people like Phantron define skill as not contibuting, and now, the answer of the shedding of unwanted aggro, where every class in EQ has this ability except warriors, mages and enchanters, the answer is &quot;gee are you a moron?  Just don't contiribute&quot;<br />
<br />
This notion that 'overnuking casters are retarded' is in itself retarded.   The notion that not maximizing yourself as a caster is somehow a good thing is pretty lame.   <br />
<br />
I'd argue that the concept of the 'overnuking wizard or mage' is nonsense, a relic of the days when there was a net benefit to having a warrior tanking.   A guy like Phantron would (and has incidentally) argue that groups that 'need' the aggro safety net that paladins and SK's provide are just a bunch of dorks.  I would argue the opposite, that people who INTENTIONALLY limit their potential to enable someone else to gain experience with *zero* measurable benefit are the real idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, why dig a ditch with a shovel when you can get a backhoe?  Who's more of an idiot, the guy down in the ditch using the shovel or the guy who's already done the job with the backhoe and is back in the house sipping a lemonade?<br />
<br />
Warrior = shovel.  Knight = backhoe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanters do have a way to shed aggro in MOST cases, ie Mez/Memblur. Granted, I am not on the elemental planes, so it may be a whole other world there. ;O) So that leaves the mage and warrior with no way to shed aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't think Paladins and Clerics can lose aggro...unless you're talking about root as a method of that.  I'd add beastlord to the list then, but they have their pet...then again, mages can do the same thing (have to run longer until pet takes aggro tho)<br />
<br />
Think Warriors are only class that have no way to lose aggro or stop the mob from attacking them.</div></div><hr />
