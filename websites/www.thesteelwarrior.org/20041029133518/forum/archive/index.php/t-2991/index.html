<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We all just got to the dials and were ready to click in...<br />
<br />
Then about 6 total people got in... but the other 66 people couldn't get in... to any of the trials...<br />
<br />
<br />
The portal has been tuned to someone else's essence. It won't work for you now.<br />
<br />
<br />
No other guild on the server has Time access and there were no other raids/groups formed in the zone but ours.<br />
<br />
Something that may be related to this... last night we were in Tier 4, prepping for VZ... when suddenly our raid was disbanded... not by anyone in our raid... all groups lost raid, we got them back when some people died, after zoning raid suddenly appeared, for most people...<br />
<br />
The people who weren't online yesterday CAN zone into Tier 1... Those who were online last night and cleared Tier 1, 2, 3, 4... CANNOT zone into Tier 1...<br />
<br />
Pretty buggy since the LDoN patch...<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen this?<br />
<br />
Some more info, I guess that since someone that wasn't on last night, clicked in first... it screwed up Tier 1 for all of us?  Lame!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SSharlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Worked good for us this evening, thankfully we are the only ones in time on E'ci</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Worked fine for us last night.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you've got 2 different 'instances' on your raid force. That's rather strange considering there was a PoTime reboot last that came with the LDoN patch. <br />
<br />
Best hypothesis I can make is that the instancing information wasn't wiped it the patch respawn of PoTime, just as PoTime instances suually persist through regular patches. If that was the case and the first person to zone up from your raid, didn't complete every stage the night before, your raid would be registered to the new instance of PoTime, yet all the raiders who got to P4 the night before would still be registered for the old instance. If one of them had clicked up to PoTb first, all would've been fine as the new raiders would've joined the existing instance rather than creating a new one of their own.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, some members are flagged to P4 with the old raid, and some are flagged to only P1 with the new instance. You're fucked for a week, basically. Since a respawn should intuitively also clear instancing flag, you might get your server GM on the case, and they might be able to reset the instance flags. The other option is to wait until the new instance despawns, then your old raid can click up, along with everyone else who didn't click up, but everyone who did enter the new instance is screwed for 5 days or so.<br />
<br />
All this is hypothetical, but it fits with the evidence. It may be the same on other servers but they didn't notice it if the first person to zone up was fully flagged from the pre-patch raid. Best practice is always to send your most consistant raider up first, just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild experienced the same thing that happened to you with your raid Tuesday night as we were clearing Tier 3. We're just grooving along then suddenly all groups are disbanded from the raid. Each group was still together, but not in the raid. So we disband all groups, group leaders were to reinvite members then be reinvited to the raid, except every time i tossed an invite to a person, they were immediately disbanded as soon as they hit Follow.<br />
<br />
Our entire raid force was forced to camp and come back to try to clear whatever bug was happening. Fortunately, it worked. As people came back from camping, groups and the raid were reformed as normal and the raid continued.<br />
<br />
I havent a clue as to what happened to you in Tier 1, but since raids seem to be gettin buggy (ok, more buggy) on occasion, i wouldnt doubt there could be some other problem related to it that caused the Tier 1 situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We had the same thing happen and we are the only time flagged guild.  Some people couldnt zone in luckily for us it was the other way around where we got most of our raid force in and a small portion left out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well we figured it out, but it cost us an hour of raid time, in Time.  Basically we had to just sit there for an hour and wait for the first instance to time out.  Then we had to go back in and make SURE that someone from the night before who was there all night clicked FIRST.<br />
<br />
So the next time you are in Time and you weren't there last 'time' (or night), make sure you don't click in first :P</div></div><hr />
