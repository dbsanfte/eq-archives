<br />
Incite ... ok this one helps a bit but seriously ... wherees the love 2 taunt keys? What are they trying to say we taunt silently and verbally curse ? Look at the underlying point here ... yea it does balance the taunt scales enough to make us actually useful, but wtf it makes no sense as a rpg, completely fuggin cumbersome and the original taunt has what 20% chance of success if that? Sorry but by adding the latter and crippling the original you made the orginal obsolete except as an &quot;oh whoops forgot to take this out sorta thing&quot; ... soooo ... my question is this wtf is up with the &quot;profanes statement&quot; on incite use ... yea its great for everyone to know its used thats really nice but wait wth .. curse at a blob_of _goo_001 and it hates you all of a sudden ... ?<br />
<br />
Comeon ... I've seen warrior hit the taunt key 30+ times with no success in a ROW now .. you completely made the key obsolete .. so whyd you leave it on the skills chart .. think we don't know?<br />
<br />
What's funnier is i seem to remember a post stating we were gonna have a &quot;more active&quot; part descibing the use of skill in playing melee ... yup .. ... step 1 remove taunt key step 2 insert incite hotkey<br />
<br />
so what did this all do ...<br />
<br />
okay great i can get groups and not feel like a gimp YAY i can pull aggro without begging the powers that be for a lucky string of improbable successes ...<br />
<br />
so where  do we stand ...  yes its true you all can solo 1 or 2 levels higher mob if you use the stonewall ability .. so now instead of low end blues we can all solo medium low end blues if you like killing one mob ever 20 minutes ... gee thx SOE ... that totally balances the scales .. i  was so hoping that i could as a player STILL BE THE BITCH CLASS. What does it take anyways for you guys to realise that playing a character 1 box as a warrior is completely asnine STILL?<br />
<br />
We still have 0 count them all 0 utilities ....<br />
<br />
So even if you guys decide over a period of time to phase out soloing ... your ecomony structure is FUBAR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya know what get rid of mana bars .. get rid of ch heal .. get rid of 9k nukes ..... and you might actually start on the road to a successfully balanced game until then you can still go fook yourself SOE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Taunt parses out at about 60% success...  It's not that bad.<br />
<br />
As far as the other stuff, openings aren't live yet, so no we don't have that much more of an active role atm.  That being said, I love the changes, and would be reasonably happy if that's all we got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yalp,<br />
<br />
If you don't like playing a warrior, stop playing a warrior. Roll up a hybrid or something else and go have fun, if you find it impossible to have fun with your warrior. <br />
<br />
Bitching and whining about  warriors being able to solo or expecting to suddenly get shitloads of utility is utterly pointless. <br />
<br />
And makes you sound like a little kid too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dislike how taunt almost never works on red con mobs, but that's been the norm since kunark (when for a while it didn't work on red cons at all)</div></div><hr />

All other utilities are beneith me and I dont want them.<br />
<br />
All I want is main tank utility</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yalp Bungabunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Great, fine .. if that how you guys wanna be .. joy. Sorry but I personally don't like being portion to the one fifth of the classes that have zero ablity to anything but one thing . and as far as this game is concerned basically only playing MT for a guild .. so lets see yall that are pacified WTF do you do when all the actual mobs are dead ... cybor? WTF do you do when you aren't main tank ..?????? I jeez guys when was the last time you took a reality check about the class you play ... ok fine YOU are willing to sell out for a little better taunt . thats great. sorrybut i put a shetload of time ino developing my character yes my RL .. sorry already 4 years in the making. I want to have same options as everyone else they don't have to be identical but yes as a paying customer i would like to not have to fooking go back and make 3 fooking twinks 1 for cash 1 for fun and 1 for options. Sorry if it just FOOKING BLOWS MY MIND that after 4 years SOE doesn't have the brainpower to fix that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dunno about you but Warrior can put out fairly decent DPS and can help kill. Or for fun like we do sometimes SPlit the raid into multiple teams and race on killing mobs(We started this in VT...go figure). It Makes time fly by when you are competing even if fun. And if one team is bored or killing too fast can make fun of the other and help them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yalp Bungabunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Korlis you're clueless nice guy but clueless .. so well stfu. I did VT over 20 times and sorry bnut my class never had any dps teaparties... goin ghmm sure glad this raid take 10 hours .. how's your tea and dps?<br />
<br />
 So the question still remains the same .. when vt is over .. YOU HAVE ZERO TO LOOK FORWARD TO . Why you might would i say such a mean and unsuitablebly unteapartielike thing? BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO KILL SHET WHEN THE RAID IS OVER WITHOUT S{PENDING 6 GODDAMN HOURS TRYING TO MAKE A GROUP WORK.<br />
<br />
See and heres the fooking crux of it as far as i can see we basically are getting the &quot;limelight&quot; in raids for avbsolute complete suckage at doing anything else but raiding 24 7. I'm am sorry to break this o yall but there just aren't enough fooking mobs on the server to do that and make gear gains. At best there are 5 to 10 mobs in the game your particular guild is suited for and can kill and make gains to keep up the level of the particular guild your in soory but there isn'y t and infinite # . Why the fook do you think guild wars even exist is our post modern passive fooking society?<br />
<br />
It is not my job to be a group counselor nor a progressive therapist . I just wanna enjoy the fooking game without hassle every fooking night. What if .. and i know this is mind blowing as well .. i had th option to make experience without having to have super guild gear ? Even slowly compared to ever other class standard? Is that really too much to fooking ask Korlis? Ask yor self this Korlis if yu were 1 boxing a bard how much exp  / money do you think you would have now? Now go down the list because I'm not just tryng to make example of the sacred fooking bards of eq .. say ever lass to yourself and hypothesize .  .. no wtf do you think would be at the very bottom of that list? and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Clueless my ass. All I play is a warrior and that is all I have played for the last 4 years. And if I was clueless I wouldnt be sitting here MT'ing in Eplanes about to enter PoTime soon. With the Rright aa's warriors can actually put out some ok dps. And with the unlinking of Defensive and offensive disciplines this only helps more. Yes we may not sit high up with Rogues, Monks, Rangers but we can sit up there. And if you think that we have nothing to do while not MT'ing think again. <br />
<br />
When we are raiding I am sorry I am always watching the current MT watching positioning thinking about what mobs are coming next and who is going to take it. My guild does not have a single MT we all share the load. We have had problems before with focusing on one MT. So now we function as a group and can handle more than some guilds with less numbers. Hell Reparm on my server was never done with less than 50 before we came along and most thought it couldnt be done. <br />
<br />
Yes, being a tank can be boring sometimes but every little bit of dps helps on mobs and if you dont realize that delete your damn account and move on.<br />
<br />
And as for getting groups I have no problem with getting groups hell I even solo sometimes for 1% aa per kill. It isnt much but it can be done if ya know where to go. If you know how to play your class and people know that then you can get groups if you dont then you are sol cause they will get the pally or sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As for xp and money I could care less. I have more than enough pp atm to last prolly for the rest of eq with how fast it comes in. And I know how well bards can grind. But you chose this class and everyone knows that we cant solo or do much for crap. I knew starting a warrior I coulddnt do much and yet here I still stand and I love it. Hell I love when my friends who most of what they do every day is track targets and do the craziest kills. <br />
<br />
The experience of the game for me is the comraderie of my friends and guild is what makes eq for me not wishing for something we wont get. If you dont like being a warrior change classes, you seem envious of bards quit and go play one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, is it just me or isn't the answer to your problem clear as an azure sky on a bright summer day?<br />
<br />
If you don't like being a single-focus class, well, change to a different class.<br />
<br />
The problem here is not EQ, or Sony, it is that you have chosen the wrong class for your desires.  Perhaps Bard would have been a better choice for you.<br />
<br />
As long as you continue externalizing your own poor choices, and pretending your frustration is someone else's fault, you are doomed to remain angry and frustrated.<br />
<br />
Take responsibility for your choices, and thereby take control of your future, and your happiness.</div></div><hr />

Korlis, we were doing Reparm with 45 to 50 while you guys were still getting your feet wet on Bertox.  Oh, and grats Bohbo on Xegony :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ouch, at least you know why the mob never turned on you tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yalp Bungabunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Get real. When was last time yu ever played a &quot;role-playing game that took 40+ hours a week where you had near o none ability to diversify? D&amp;D? nope sorry at a certain point your character does diversify .  Role master? Nope again thee most diversified game in the world. Magic the Gathering? Then you never played it. In fact zero games can really be compared to EQ. And come to think of it every single game that has crapped on players ability to diversify/ or had a complete lack of game balance  has failed MISERABLY. So why does EQ still survive? Because, its still its only competition in its own theatre and the pioneer of its genre /applaud Yippie! Someone finally made D&amp;D without the paper chase ! Now fix the f***er .. you can beat that around the bush much as you feel privy to but If there was I would have heard about  it/ be playing it. And sir if you don't already know how to play a warrior after 4 years it goes like this plink arrow hit def hit taunt hit incite call assist now wait 3 minutes .. say this &quot;def down&quot; now kiss your ass gbye . Thats it no study involved no tea parties just follow those steps. thats what 4 years of my freetime playing my character has been summed up into.<br />
<br />
     Simply because Sony has no motive to condescend to diversify all playing classes equally does not make it in any way fair to the player (which is redundant). Thus EXACTLY my point, because the current owner feels zero motivation to reward its players equally in any way shape or form basing the VAST majority of the play VALUE on GAMBLING which highly favors classes that can farm solo .. because why farm in a group of 6 when you can get it all to yourself without anyone, and also largely based on what are the more obvious cheats such as KITING, CHARMING, FEARING which of course we are told was not in the original intention of the game design however we all know these are nerfed at leisure for credibility/complaint relief and NOT for actually balancing the game for all players enjoyment.<br />
<br />
     Thusly the only point you have is YOU would rather fix EQ while PAYING monthly dues and SPEND YOUR time playing more than one class to get fair play value out of YOUR hard work! And if you enjoy watching how other tanks do the same exact thing every single night why don't you go play a f***ing cleric. There are ZERO other classes that have to share a condo (metaphorically) in this game. All of the classes get glory at some point, simply because we are the biggest and first linebackers does not in any way compensate for having zero other play value.<br />
What about action? does every class have equally desirable ability to get there weapons dirty? YES THEY DO! Every damn group im in the cleric melees now . hell half the casters do with that  weapon of the named crab in PoW . PROC 900dd .. when was last time you had that sorta power? NEVA! And yet you are still complacent telling me to just stfu I got it good somehow I should just be happy with my ability to actually get aggro. weeeeeeeeeeeeee. /overjoy<br />
<br />
      Lets put this in a business perspective .     You start a business put 40+ hours a week into it and find out 4 years down the road all your free time was just spent on a lemon, something that was even close to what it should have been. What do you do??? Restart your business ? Start a second business and run them both at same time ? Bull shit it pays, you just keep riding the same old broken pony so you can support your wife and kids, and try to fix what you have.<br />
<br />
You can take your responsibility and seize the day character value judgements and shove em up your dair aire.<br />
