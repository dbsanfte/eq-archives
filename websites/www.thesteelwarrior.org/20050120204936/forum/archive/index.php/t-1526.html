<br />
Vermont is the only state where fish shooting is a legal sport.<br />
(If you are driving by a body of water and see a entire family, father, mother, son, daughter, uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa, etc, with 30 30's to sawed off double barrel 12 gauge shotguns unloading into the water, it is perfectly alright.)<br />
<br />
Cow tipping is not a hollywood wood myth, it is real and it happens. Many a farmer must be wary of bored Vermonters with nothing better to do then go into a cow field at night and push over cows..........<br />
<br />
Winter = Nice way to get a tan while shoveling snow naked. <br />
<br />
Summer = Huddle inside with the air conditioner waiting for the freezer to make more ice so we can pretent it is winter.<br />
<br />
Home of tree tipping...... Not to be confused with cow tipping, tree tipping is a special skill which I myself excell at. It involves staking out likely looking target, ideal situation is a tall dead tree, running at full speed and throwing self into the tree in hopes of knocking it over. In the case the that tree doesnt get knocked over injury may occur. (Side note do not shake tall think dead trees because top will break off and fall straight down onto you.)<br />
<br />
Last fact, there are more fat canadian men wearing only a speedo lying spread eagle on their boats in Vermont then anywhere else. *shudders*<br />
<br />
Anyone got some special guirks about their home state? Or other country<br />

<br />
Haven't lived there in three years, so this may be out of date<br />
<br />
- As a child you feared having to spell your own state's name, and envied students in Ohio.   <br />
- You know where Tanglewood is.  Not only that, but at some point in your life you have spent the 5 bucks to watch John Williams conduct the Boston Pops there in between passing out on the lush lawn and playing frisbee.  <br />
- Who do you hate more the fucking Yankees or their homo-wner Steinbrenner.   <br />
- Bill Russel is God.  A parallel is insulting Bob Cousey or any other former Celtic great will earn you a well deserved beating.  When the cops get there pray no one tells them you insulted &quot;The Couse&quot;.  They are Celtics fans with sticks.  <br />
- Ted Williams was God.  Get caught insulting him (when he was alive) and, well, lets just say you learn what &quot;swinging for the fences&quot; really meant.  <br />
- Bobby Orr is God.  If the motherfucker who took his knees out from him ever pulls his head out of hiding, we'll tell everyone they insulted BOTH Larry Bird AND Carl Yastremsky.  Either that or bring Cam Neely out of retirement to pound his face.  <br />
- Ray Bourque got his Cup, thank fucking god.  <br />
- Everyone who lives West of Sturbridge tells everyone East of Sturbridge how shitty it is in the western par to fthe state because they don't want those Goobers moving west.  <br />
- Picking apples in September.  5 Bucks for a bag as big as Barry Bonds' head.  And you eat that many while picking.  <br />
- You get caught going 51 in a 50 zone on Route 202 by those rat bastard staties.  Put down that triple espresso and go arrest a cow-tipper in Vermont instead of costing people 1000 bucks in increased car insurance rates for going one over the limit why don't ya.  <br />
- Cape Cod: The only place where catching crabs is a good thing.  If you find one but lack something to catch him with, we conveniently provide nice sharp medical needles washed up on the beach. <br />
- Everyone has gone to Cape Cod for the week at some point in their young life with friends, where they spent the week drinking nothing but &quot;harmless fruit juice&quot; and never saw the beach once.  Not that they have memories of any of it.  <br />
- Waterskiing in the Connecticut River in November.  Bring no women for obvious reasons, unless they are familiar with that episode of Seinfeld so you can make funny references to &quot;shrinkage&quot;.  <br />
- Getting stuck in the middle of Northampton trying to get home after taking your SATs.  Oh, did I mention that you got stuck because of a freaking Gay Rights' Parade?  I never was into the whole Lasbian thing that most guys are.  Why?  Because I have seen REAL lesbians.  All you need is to see two fat, crew-cutted, smelly dykes french kiss once and believe me, you will be ruined for life.  Ok, but seeing one really hot couple of chicks kissing repairs the damage fast.  <br />
- Amos &amp; Andrew rules, Evil Barney sound clips pwns. <br />
- Unlike Arizona, we do get snow days.</div></div><hr />

I grew up in Newport (on the river across from Cincinasty), but I went to college in Lexington.  I moved back to the northern part of the state after I graduated.  I just can't get enough of the bad allergies and smog alerts during the summer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byork</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tips for Traveling in Texas...<br />
<br />
 1. If you run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in a four-wheel<br />
 drive pickup with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly.<br />
 Don't try to help them, just stay out of their way. This is what they live<br />
 for.<br />
<br />
 2. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same store.<br />
<br />
 3. Remember: &quot;Ya'll&quot; is singular, &quot;All ya'll&quot; is plural, and &quot;All y'all's&quot;<br />
 is plural possessive.<br />
<br />
 4. Get used to hearing, &quot;You ain't from around here, are ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
 5. Don't be worried at not understanding what people are saying: they<br />
can't understand you either.<br />
<br />
 6. &quot;Mom'n'em&quot; is not one person. When someone asks, &quot;How's your Mom'n'em?&quot;<br />
 They are referring to the whole family.<br />
<br />
 7. Be advised that &quot;He needed killin,'&quot; is a valid defense here.<br />
<br />
 8. If you hear a Texan exclaim, &quot;Hey, y'all, watch this,&quot; stay out of the<br />
 way. These are likely the last words he'll ever say.<br />
<br />
 9. When you come up on a person driving 15 mph down the middle of the<br />
road, remember that most folks learn to drive on a John Deere and the rest<br />
learned to drive while road hunting in the back roads. In both cases, this is<br />
the proper speed and position for that vehicle.<br />
<br />
 10. Do not be surprised to find that 10-year-olds own their own shotguns and<br />
 are proficient marksmen. Or that their mammas taught them how to aim.<br />
<br />
 11. Shakespeare is a rod or a reel, not a writer.<br />
<br />
 12. Duct tape is not only part of every survival kit, it is the whole kit.<br />
<br />
 13. Rasslin' is not fake.<br />
<br />
 14. Grapefruit is not a substitute for biscuits and gravy.<br />
<br />
 15. Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt and Elvis are good ol' boys. Jeff Gordon<br />
 isn't.<br />
<br />
 16. Turkey hunters actually curse Noah for letting coyotes and armadillos<br />
on the Ark.<br />
<br />
 17. If you hear a turkey gobble, get out of the way. Some Texans view that<br />
 sound like pay-off bells at a slot machine.<br />
<br />
 18. Don't be surprised if an obituary mentions that the deceased requested<br />
 to be buried in his four-wheel drive truck because, &quot;It ain't never been<br />
in a hole it couldn't get out of.&quot;<br />
<br />
19. &quot;Ya'll come back now, ya hear,&quot; is a temporary statement. It's okay<br />
for Yankees to visit, but damn Yankees are those who decide to stay.<br />
<br />
 20. If you decide to stay in Texas and bear children, don't think we will<br />
 accept them as Texans. After all, if the cat had kittens in the oven, we<br />
 wouldn't call 'em biscuits.</div></div><hr />
