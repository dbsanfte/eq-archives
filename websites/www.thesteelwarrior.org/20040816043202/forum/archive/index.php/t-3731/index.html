<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alchork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">An opinion:<br />
<br />
SOE isn’t stupid – they realize there is a problem with melee balancing just like many from each class does.  However with the current game engine, there isn’t much they can do about it.  Spells are significantly easier to add than melee skills so all the classes with a spell book continue to advance.  All the major melee improvements over the last few expansions have come from better itemization and procs – things easily added to the game.<br />
<br />
The true core of the melee problem cannot be fixed with the current engine.  They’ve announced that they are working on a new one, and I’ve heard rumors that it will be released around Christmas.  I am positive they are fixing/designing the system to handle the melee balancing as well as planning for the future.  However SOE is a business and they will do things on their schedule to optimize earnings.<br />
<br />
While many other games have been dubbed “EQ-killers” in the past, they have not lived up to their hype and have had problems such as lack of real content or severe buggy code.  SOE (logically) has timed their updates/expansions to coincide with the release of the newer games – always giving people a reason to come back/stay.<br />
<br />
There is nothing coming out in the next month or two that will draw and significant portion of the player base away – there is no major financial reason to fix anything right now. Many people I know are still playing EQ due to nothing else being out there and the major time investment they’ve made in their character.  Horizons is a few months out and WoW is coming mid next year.  The next big game that is receiving all the hype is WoW, and unless Blizzard screws up it is in position to be the next EQ-killer.<br />
<br />
SOE sees all the excitement on the message boards about WoW – and while the game possibly might not live up to its expectation as the greatest ever - as a company SOE would be ignorant not to plan for its coming and do whatever they can to retain their customers.  EQ has an advantage over any new game as it is difficult to leave your character behind for a new one in an unknown game – because of this time investment, SOE can even release buggy/incomplete code and people will still continue to play.<br />
<br />
The new engine will come out with some melee balancing and perhaps some perk for casters like being able to see mana as a number.  This will be timed to combat Horizons’ release mainly to keep the player base happily paying/playin.  The next expansion will be timed with WoW (unless it takes longer than expected) and will contain some significant advancements in skills – perhaps new melee techniques or more caster spell gems – all to make the game fresh and exciting.  The customer will then stay with EQ and SOE continues to rake in the cash.<br />
<br />
I’ve seen melee balancing threads on almost every class forum.  I really don’t think there is much more that people can say about it anymore.  It all continues to be the same arguments presented another way.  Nothing is going to change in the short term – and while I’ll sympathize with the ones currently on the short end of the stick, getting upset about melee balancing isn’t going to do much of anything - the EQ community as a whole sees the problem.  SOE sees the problem and they are fixing it - however it takes time to create the new engine and it won’t be released until marketing needs it to be.  At the moment there is nothing else out there to steal their business.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The &quot;engine&quot; they are talking about replacing is just the graphics engine. That is totally separate from game mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Considering that they are almost 9 months away from the announcement on 1/27/2003 that they would be looking at melee balance, I don't think anyone is hold ing their breath that things will change soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maineeak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">end of oct. / early nov.  , Final fantasy online is comming out for pc . i know that will drive alot of downtime in eq, if not lose some ppl to it .   http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/236401.asp<br />
<br />
so it wouldn't surprize me to see something new implemented to the game around this time, but , in doubt, i don't think it will be class balance that we want to see, but , rather some sort of promotion to keep cash comming in ( save 5 usd on eq evolutions ,save  5 usd on LDoN , etc). <br />

as much as i have read on this forum as well has heard in game and discussed with friends about my warrior , i have never commented on class balance in this forum , mainly because everything that every1 has addressed or ranted about on here i have the same opinion on . I LOVE MY WARRIOR TO MUCH TO RE-ROLL . my warrior , when first created , was nothing more than an alt back in the day, and my druid was my main char. but as time grew on i tended to play my warrior more than my druid , despite the HUGE lack of utility that i was giving up , becuase imo he was much more fun to play and he leaned more toward my type of gameplay style ( up in the mobs face , as opposed to being in the background). <br />
<br />
class balance does seem like a pipe dream , but , fortunatly , i still have alot of friends that still play, and have a DANK guild that im apart of , so that is really the main reason i keep on with my warrior and EQ in general. <br />
<br />
bottom line is that warriors give up everything else in the game to tank , and  they shouldn't have to sit on the sidelines lfg for 5+ hours , or bow out to another tank class becuase of their lack of aggro control . warriors should bring the most to the table in terms of tanking , both on raids and exp groups , and the only thing anymore that even makes us useful is /defensive. i thought for awhile that it was just that ppl wanted to be lazy and wanted snap aggro so they could do stuff in encounters at will , rather than have to cater to a warrior. ( wait on slow , wait til lower on mob's heath to nuke , etc ) but even when i am in a group of ppl that do cater to me, it's still have a flip of the coin on me keepin aggro . there has been time where a slower will wait til 70- 90 % health and then slow, and the mob will still come on them , as well as there have been times where the ppl that nuke round 20-50 % health still get aggro after the nuke . what good is any of my damage migration or defensive disc in exp groups , if the mob just doesnt want to stay on me dispite pressing taunt 4.7 billion times or prayin for a proc at the beinging of the fight so ppl can say that i do my job well. i consider my self a damn fine warr and it seems that the only place myself ,or alot of other warrios that i know shine, is on raids because we get time alone with the mob to generate aggro and we use our defensive disc to lower the amount of damage on us , as compaired to any other tank class. but what is raids if you don't have the lvls ? raid exp sucks , and if its hard for a average warrior to find a exp group becuase they can't keep aggro, they sit with lfg on. i shouldn't have to feel or seem like a charity case when i join a group , it should be the group is excited to have a warrior to tank for them , but with the way that things have panned out , i tend to find more warriors lfg than any other class (except maybe  rangers just becuase there are so damn many of them).<br />
<br />
<br />
/rant off <br />
<br />
<br />
i'll keep my wishful thinking and bite on the class balancing fodder they have been preachin forever just becuase i love playin my warrior. the main reason im still playin is because my friends are and i love my guild , so that alone will keep me in the game , but the more time that drags on where im lfg for hours , the more i want to play a different game and invite my friends over or play a different game online with them.<br />
<br />
keep you heads up fellow warriors . despite the way things are now , i feel that somewhere down the line we will get our improvements. only problem is WHEN?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe the nails head has been hit.<br />
<br />
Knights claim they should be able to tank like Warriors. My response is simple ...B...S...<br />
You get all your nice buffs and heals and (heck even the fastest horse in the game for 5 AAs),AND you want equal tanking power?<br />
<br />
I rolled a War when I started as my first character because Warriors were supposed to be THE KING of damage taking.Not the case anymore....Holding Aggro isnt even the main issue in my opinion.The main issue is that Knights actually have the capability to do something with the aggro .We dont complain that casters can get instant aggro because they cant do anything with it,they try to avoid it.<br />
If Knights can get aggro/keep it so easy that needs to compensate for the more healer mana they cost keeping alive.<br />
<br />
So you have a a defining roll.If you have a situation where you want a better tank,War...if you have a situation where your not as worried about the required healing mana, a Knight or War doesnt matter.<br />
Also a Warriors weapon skill caps should be higher,thus allowing more dps to compensate for lack of dmg spells/help add aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just hope they have some sort of fix before Christmas otherwise we'll be waiting for months after that expansion while they fix all the bugs associated with it.</div></div><hr />

With all due respect this is just noise unless you can link a who/what/when.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, to add more noise to this there've been rumors about a new class in an upcoming expansion...Berzerker. A melee class.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else see what's fundamentally wrong about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">as long as they don't nerf left hand axe :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Berzerkers ?!? ROFLMAO. Exactly what niche are they supposed to fill then?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And they're going to be Half Warrior, Half Knight!!!<br />
<br />
LOL,<br />
if they really DO add in a new class.. then it's going to be hilarious...<br />
I can see it coming though.... a new feature allowing Warriors to choose to become Berzerkers instead... at the mere price of 50$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Berserker, old Norse Barsarker, one who has the qualities of a bear. Maybe they will implement a class that can shapechange (not like the Shaman bear or anything).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh my 'zerker in DAoC was a wrecking machine.. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well I'd hope that the beserker is going to be kinda like a ranger with no spells. It'd be kinda too to have a melee that can use most weapon skills without being put down by being forced to tank or be behind a mob's back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd freak if SoE had an update message that said something like:<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro is working as intended. Since Warriors are the base class from which all other melees are balanced they are exactly where we believe they should be offensively and defensively.<br />
<br />
In this release Paladins will be receiving the AA Ablility Defensive. This will complete their transformation into their intended role - the most defensive class in the game - unmatched in their ability to fight the most dangerous monsters and able to make themselves the focus of all attacks.<br />
<br />
We are aware some Warriors are dissatisfied with their class. We will allow them to become a new class Beserker if they wish. All AA points will be refunded if you chose this option. This class will get a bonus when attacking from the front and with the proper AA abilities be capable of impressive melee burst DPS. It will however have low mitigation and the HP's of a nekked Enchanter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If they did add a Berserker class, everytime I saw one I'd hear that song from Clerks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Would you like some making fuck? BEZERKER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">EQ already has Berserkers ... just visit the Outhouse ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nagellom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hehehe! My DaoC Zerker kicked arse massively</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The fact that EQ has too many classes is part of the problem.  They should have never made tanking capable warrior+caster hybrids (SK/Pally) and then they would have avoided this whole mess.  If they add another class, they are just going to make this problem worse.  Might as well add a cleric+enchanter hybrid too and totally trash the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The true core of the melee problem cannot be fixed with the current engine. <br />
<br />
That's BS. What about when knights were moved onto an improved defensive table which, until then, was only given to warriors? What about when 2HS was made to be hugely more damaging when they added the separate 2HS dmg bonus? What about when hybrid exp penalty was removed? What about the monk mitigation nerf? What about when they added /shield? There's a LOT of things they can do with the current engine, and have, none of which involves spells.</div></div><hr />
