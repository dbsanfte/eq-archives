Sounds like it'd be a nice pulling tool(200 range, 30 sec recast, instant cast)  I'd just like not having to bow swap, not like it's hard to do just press the attack sounds more convenient, I tend to waste incite pulling just cause it's instant even though the range is shitty and it defeats the purpose(intial aggro capped)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pop it off when a mob switches targets and he immediately turns to me quite often, could be coincidence or anything really though<br />
<br />
It's also 1dmg so should work as a 'tag' before incite for full hate from incite</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pulling, Positioning, Breaking mezzes of mobs mezzed too far out of camp, the uses are still being found for me.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I have also found it to be aggro, I can use it for tagging a mob on incoming and get aggro lock without having to use bellow.  I don't know if its the knockback that pisses off a critter, I wouldn't think that would cause aggro, but who knows.</div></div><hr />

Warrior AA Refund<br />
Hey folks,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the Warrior AA Press the Attack has its range set much higher than we intended it to be.  Our thought was that AA was meant to be a positioning tool, and not a new pulling tool.<br />
<br />
As such, we are reducing the range in our next update. Any AAs spent on this ability will be refunded at that time.  We apologize to anyone who purchased the ability in hopes of using it as a new pulling tool.   A new version of the AA, with the correct range, will be available to anyone who wishes to purchase it.  <br />
<br />
Thanks folks,<br />
<br />
Big Massive Suckage.</div></div><hr />

How about giving us a 'throw stone' ability like level 1's (/boggle btw) that does 1dmg with range = to our strength or something, or does that make to much sense?</div></div><hr />

I can, silly me I thought the 1dmg was to be of use, not just so we couldnt use on mezzed mobs making it even more useless.<br />
<br />
And I agree the 'positioning' of it is weak anyway, the only thing that made this aa good was the 1dmg and the range. The knockback didnt mean anything.</div></div><hr />

i still don't see how in its current form is over powering. lack of high end bows in this game make many warriors having to switch to a bow fast for a tag. and not every warrior is/was lucky enough to get RZ pouch in time.<br />
<br />
this AA just added some fun to the warrior class.  yay to sony for making the most fun AA warriors have ever gotten to another AA to buy when all you got left are stats/tradeskill shit.</div></div><hr />

Anything that gives Warriors even the hint of fun or utility must immediately be nerfed ... the status quo must be preserved ... Warriors must contine to be King Gimp.<br />

It is indeed very handy, especially for those of us who use non bow range items.<br />
<br />
not that it will do any good, but I think everyone who loves the ability as it is should post.. possibly start a different thread.  A warrior in my guild even proposed a warrior stand off *snicker*.</div></div><hr />

By the description I figured it was a positioning utility but like, I was way too happy to use it for pulling and tagging. It made life so much easier without being overpowering, I've been pulling for days now and I havent pulled since AoW bow days. In short, fuck SoE for nerfing this. It's not overpower and it's the type of ability warriors need and are long overdue from having. Seriously, suck a cock. /donkey punch</div></div><hr />

Nothing sucks more than being in Muramite Proving Grounds fighting a cleric Aneuk that cannot be messed/stunned/interrupted.  A knockback would so own for those situations...and it gives us a surefire way to interrupt when you see &quot;MOB GATING&quot;.  I dont like relying on a 50% chance to hit or the chanter to get a mes off...<br />

That said, Press the Attack is still on *MY* need-to-get list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your question, i think the range is 200.. and it being changed to about the same range as bellow if not shorter.  This ability will do jack shit in the way of interrupting mobs, if you wanna go to seb and interrupt a frog casting CH, then this aa may be for you.  Otherwise its just another spot ability spot being taken up.. I for one would rather have warcy in an ability slot, because its more likely that gore is gonna spawn on my head and fear me, than this ability interrupting a gate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I dunno, spose in the end game there is just some super uber range slot item you cannot live without, but if you are pulling... do you really need it?<br />
<br />
I guess it would be nice if they kept it as is, but I dont see myself stressing about it anytime soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, I swapped out a bow from lvl 40 up to 65 and 180AAs where I got a bow with more HPs than my old range, but it's plain easy and it can be done just like ghetto bashing, dunno why it's such a big deal because you cant pull with it, you could stop being lazy and just add 2 hotkeys, one with a main Inv slot and one with your range, and swap , use a Ranged Attack hotkey, and swap back, doesnt take more than 1 sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it was a way more convenient way of pulling than with a bow for many reasons(line of sight/mobs on hills, disappearing arrows, summoning mass arrows etc) and that basically justified spending 5 aa's on it considering there's better/easier ways to balance push then how the aa is working atm(slight knockback)  I liked the feel of having an instant tag tool, which it still may be viable as unless the range is gimped to the point where it's just within melee range.  Maybe it's just an annoyance to me, swapping in my bow every pull/tag, I realize swapping itself isn't hard, just spending 5 aa's for the convenience of being able to hit a hotkey rather than draining my end with incite tagging was worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mondion</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't belive I'm replying to the comment about padding magelo with range, but here you go.  The difference for me is about 120ish hps from a bow and a range.  I'm not sure if you are up to date on end game gear, but most of the decent bows would probaby be better off in the hands of rangers which is the way it should be.  Of course thats a whole other arguement in itself.  I've seen one bow drop post Qvic, and it not and encounter I think any guild would appreciate farming.  Now compare that to the variety of ranges available.. I won't list them out but many have upwards of 40 AC, shielding, better saves/hps and effects.  Lay to rest your comment about magelo padding.<br />
<br />
I for one was excited about this aa because it opened up 2 slots in my first page of hotbuttons for easy access.  Having an instand no fail tag would have been beautiful for encounters where a split second tag for rampage or aggro is important.  Many encounters have a mob who becomes targetable at certain times and also has rampage.. do you really thing swapping out a bow for range, tagging, swapping back, finally making sure you aren't too close for the bow to actually work is efficient?  Nope, but I'll tell you having a no fail ability to tag the mob without having to swap around gear etc is heaven.<br />
<br />
Look, obviously the decision has been made to nerf it.  We made due before and we will make due in the future, it was super handy while it was available.. just call me bitter for having a nice ability taken that really wasn't changing the dynamics of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point was, if you are pulling, do you NEED that range items stats? I easily understand there are nice stats on nice (non bow) range items, but if you are not pulling, you use the range item. If you are pulling, use the bow.<br />
<br />
In the event that you cannot tank the mob you are pulling, in those cases where you are tagging the named or whatever, it seems trivial to swap a bow in for a second.<br />
<br />
It just seems that the major complaint revolves around normal, everyday grind pulling, which... I find hard to believe people are grinding on mobs they cannot reliably tank without their best range item equiped.<br />

But thats just me.<br />

Anything to reduce the damage spikes. Not to mention, you can look at it a bit differently. <br />

Would you WANT to tank without say...your BP equipped? Or would you be sure you had it equipped as long as it were possible to do so?</div></div><hr />

Anytime you try to make analogies like this, they invariably end up sounding dumb.  If you are choosing to be the puller, then either accept the fact that you need to use a ranged weapon or stop crying.  If you actually look at the description of the AA anyway, there is nothing in it that could possibly lead anyone to believe that it was meant to be a 200 range pulling ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't pull for groups very often (like myself), then having no way to tag a mob to have incite/bellow/whatever not perform to it's full potential really sucks. It's going to suck when  I finally upgrade my bow. <br />

Nod. And if you read the developer's notes, they point out that it wasn't envisioned as a pulling tool.<br />
<br />
Of course Paladin stuns weren't envisioned as a pulling tool nor SK snares. Nor were much too low level not to be resisted stuns originally envisioned as a replacement for using the aggro tools Verant supplied.<br />

SoE will do whatever they want, but it is a little silly to use the phrase &quot;did not envision&quot; when the use of sideffects by other classes for pulling and aggro is so widespread. Probably more accurately SoE could have said - and we don't want to give Warriors a pulling tool or at least we don't want this to be it.<br />

Was thinking it would be nice to use when tanking Xegony, to get her in the right spot.  Just got it and have only tested it on low lvl mobs. <br />

Im sure other guilds have different methods for pulling on raids, but we have our monks/bards drop the Inc right in front of us, or close , at which point we take over. Its great for jumping onto the rampage list  early  , and i definately agree there is some kind of hate/aggro radius generated that puts the warrior at a higher priority. The small KB stops them dead in there tracks, giving me just enough time to hit taunt and bellow, lalalalalala .... with attack already on.<br />

  Two thumbs up from me too...and i think from my own experiance, id have to say the range on this is past melee range.</div></div><hr />

Knockback 2 can't counter Boss creep when tanking.  The 30 sec refresh would be fine if they pushed that knockback up substantially.<br />
<br />
The one thing I use it for is interupting Mob spells.  Which happens...once in a blue moon.  Better than nothing, and hey, its another button to push during combat!!1!.</div></div><hr />

I guess it works if they're not sitting either but in that case they might not even notice you hit them with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well,, ive been wondering about this AA for some time, and up until recently the only thing i found this AA useful for was pushing people off the posky islands which i did one night faring wingblades.  However, a few days ago while tooling around in Kael killing the AoW cycle, i found that while corner tanking him, sometimes the mob and i would stack, in the corner, from the push behind.  this caused me to &quot;not be able to see [your] target&quot;.  Fired off press the attack, bam pushed the AoW right outta the corner back in range of melee/EB procs.  This got me thinking: how many of you guys have tanked poearth rings for example, namely the mud ring, with the AE shackle mob.  On fennin at least, we corner tank him at the earth zone line, so that the MT doesnt get shackled OOR of the mob.  however, even cornertanking, with the extreme push of a raid behind the mob, it tends to get pushed onto of the MT, making him unable to hit the mob, and in the case of this mob, being that  you are rooted the whole fight, you cannot reposition.  BAM, press the attack, and the mob is back in front of you.  Not a bad AA if you use it in this manner, but i sure miss that bowless range pulling</div></div><hr />

Then you are probably fighting content that is a bit too hard for you.<br />
<br />
If you are too lazy to swap a bow 3 or 4 times per night (i'll be generous 5) during a raid.<br />
Then you dont deserve a spot in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
It wasnt working as intended, it got fixed.<br />
Sure the agro cap on Incite vs Range vs Agro list sucks, but lets not turn this into the &quot;SteelWhiners&quot;.<br />

When Xping 20-40ac 150hp wont really make/break your grind.<br />
When Clearing Trash 20-40ac 150hp wont really make/break your raid clearing.<br />
When in &quot;Boss Mode&quot; 2 3 4 5 6 Bow/Range switches wont kill you.<br />
<br />
Yes a throw stone would be nice.<br />
Yes this was nice before it got changed.<br />
And no we are not lazy twats or druids to whine 24/7.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : I loose 35ac 20atk 65hp 2% Shielding when i grind (Kelek Range vs TZ Bow)<br />
And i dont care, i would use an EP bow if i had not TZ one.</div></div><hr />
