To quote a pally on the above thread who didn't have his head all messed up with denial:<br />
&quot;Cease and Desist were mainly ment to be spell stoppers IMO. <br />
<br />
This change would be in-line with the spells intentions. &quot;<br />
<br />
Then there was this fella:<br />
<br />
&quot;Throw us a bone?<br />
<br />
Have we become so Jaded being the masters of aggro that we can no longer see the game has become unbalanced? No way in hell should a level 9 spell be the staple of our aggro abilities until we get FOA.<br />
<br />
I do remember the days not so long ago when I zone-hopped LFG because no-one wanted a gimp paladin. Now, the same thing is happening to upper level warriors and I get the feeling there are plenty of people who think this is our just rewards for the hell we went through. Screw that, this game is about having fun for everyone. I do feel for our warrior friends and hope that Sony can make a change that does not nerf us too bad while making the non-elite warrior able to get xp groups again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow, it's amazing how much mental clarity intellegent people can exhibit about a class balance issue when they are not the one's experiencing negative backlash because they are not the one's at the disadvantage!</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry Apothes, but they are sitting over there talking in self righteous terms how they shouldn't nerf Paladins, just fix warriors.<br />
<br />
When all along the one with the problem is the &quot;cast til my mana runs out, KEI it back up, repeat til dinged (or AA'd)&quot; type players who grew up playing in Paludal Caverns (Formerly known as the Kunark Cycle - LOIO&gt;FM&gt;DL&gt;KC, right?)<br />
<br />
Bah<br />
<br />
That's all I have to say.<br />
<br />
Bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you read on in the thread, you will see that there was NO change to any paladin stun whatsoever.  All they did was update the spell description to show that it couldn't stun a mob over 55.  It can still be cast on them, it still generates aggro, it just doesn't stun them.  As recently as Sunday afternoon paladins were using Cease to get aggro in Vex Thal on Test.<br />
<br />
The bottom line.  The spell wasn't changed.  At all.  No further discussion necessary.</div></div><hr />
