<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my own experiences with Aegis of the Earth were promising last night.  I would put the aggro level of my combo, Bloodfrenzy+Aegis of the Earth at the same level as the ol' faithful Bloodfrenzy+BoC.  However, I do not feel it had the same aggro power as the Blade of War.<br />
<br />
Prior to this change I did not feel the BF+Aegis held enough aggro to make it viable for tanking.<br />
<br />
The good news is that Bloodfrenzy+Aegis is good enough aggro these days to use it as an MT on a raid and not make everyone walk on eggshells with their aggro.<br />
<br />
I hope the devs continue down the &quot;Block&quot; path, however, as the addtional benefit of the shield stats really do not matter given the tradeoffs of Increased Riposte rate (BF 20 delay vs BoW at 32 delay), Decreased Aggro (vs. the Blade of War), and Decreased dps (80 or so dps vs 150 or so dps).  <br />
<br />
Additionally, I wouldn't want to use any other one hander I have used to date besides the Bloodfrenzy, which is a SoL drop, and highly contested by a large amount of lower end players at that.  For high end warriors that missed Bloodfrenzy, I can't see this shield as working at all.  I would suggest adding a 18/20 EB 1hs weapon with the same proc rate as the Bloodfrenzy to some elemental god's loot table to avoid bottom feeding.  Put it on Fennin or Xegony so as to make it reasonable to farm.<br />
<br />
I would say the shield is going to need to be able to block 7-10% of the time to make the tradeoff truly worth it.<br />
<br />
To sum up, left to do to make the use of a shield a viable option for warriors:<br />
1.  Add a 7-10% block chance.<br />
2.  Create a Bloodfrenzy replacement in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
With these two changes, a warrior can choose to go for a shield that will give him more survivability, but less dps and less aggro, or a warrior can choose to go for a Blade of War for more dps, more aggro, but less survivability.  Now all they will need to do is come up with a good reason for us to use dual wield.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I really wish warriors could truly use all weapons.  I would really love to go into battle swinging a Hammer of Crushing Waves and an Ifir, Dagger of Fire and be able to perform my function on a raid.  It would be really nice if the developers would remove Enraging Blow from the game in it's current form.  From reading and thinking about what warriors should be, masters of armed combat, some ability to choose and customize our characters via weapons would be very fun, rather than forcing us all into the current standard patterns:  BoW, BF+Shield, BF+BoC, BoC+SoD, etc., etc.</div></div><hr />

(I've heard that when you /shield someone, a shield equipped will actually lower the amount of damage you take tho, so that's one benefit...)<br />
<br />
Furious Bash was a good idea...added agro on the bash is nice.  But still...<br />
<br />
I really wish they'd figure out how to put a type of Block on shields for those classes who use them (and some who are almost forced to...cleric, shaman, druid for instance), so they'll gain a benefit to choosing a 1hander and shield versus 2hander...right now using 2handers is so much of a no-brainer it's scary.<br />
<br />
Also really wish they'd also consider giving warriors an AA that allowed them to equip a shield with a 2hs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't think they have to figure it out.  It was on test over a year ago and seemed to work fine.  For whatever reason though, they decided not to patch it live.  My level 9 druid on test could block with a SBS for a while though hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably because a knight could equip a shield like that and gain the full benefit without losing much DPS due to the insane ratio on their 1 handers while warriors would lose almost 50% of their DPS and wouldn't be able to hold aggro with it unless their primary was an enraging blow weapon.  I wish they'd fix our aggro so it works at an acceptable level innately and then change EB and TB to something else.  Make it a big fat DD or a DD plus stun or something.  Give us back the freedom to choose whatever weapon we want instead of clawing for 1 or more of the 4 EB weapons in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The opposite is true for clerics shaman and druids, they have almost no reason NOT to use a shield. Wizards, Necros, Mages, and enchanters use two items over a two handed weapon most of the time as well ( they do have less shields to chose from however )<br />
<br />
( hint why block didn't go live~ )<br />
<br />
Back in Luclin era, indiscriminately bumping up the defensive capabilities of every class in the game wasn't a very good idea.</div></div><hr />

That would gimp the monk class even further, imo.</div></div><hr />

7 - 10% chance to block is better than a monks chance iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who cares if it's better than a monk's chance to block?  In what way is that relevant?  Monks aren't tanking anything in PoP, so if a warrior had the innate chance to block 10% of the time, would it affect monks in any way?  <br />
<br />
Would someone say &quot;Hmm... we need someone who can block... should we take a monk or a warrior?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well there's the fact that currently it's the ONLY good thing left about monk defensive abilities.<br />
<br />
Soooooo<br />
<br />
Giving a superior version of block to the other much more defensive classes ...<br />
<br />
Well it sort of makes that bullshit monk nerf (which is still in place in a gimped out version) ... look like even bigger BS than it was before.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see everyone who can equip a shield get block. It makes sense from an RP standpoint.<br />
<br />
But you know ... my monk ... he gets his ass handed to him by monsters STILL to this day. And block is the only saving grace he has defensively.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And yes you are correct. I do not tank in the planes.<br />
<br />
But I certainly pull. And still get hit.</div></div><hr />

Not trying to make a deal....just pointing out the similarity so yer not suprised if the monk community has a fit.<br />
would it affect monks in any way?<br />
And giving monks flurry wouldn't have hurt warriors in any way shape or form but you saw the shitstorm that caused......<br />
<br />
Its a double edged sword.  If there is a problem with monks wanting flurry....same version not improved, why is it ok to want a skill that only two other classes have?  and a better version at that?  Point that I'm trying to make is that it will piss someone off in the same way that that thread on MB pissed most of you off. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that the knights will get the same block bonus and still be superior for exp groups fixing none of the problems that warriors have.<br />
<br />
Edit: Cuz I don't know when to shut up.</div></div><hr />

Hello, retard, you do indeed not know when to shut up.  I don't give a shit as to whether or not monks get flurry.  That's not what this post is about.  This post is about what it would take to make a shield a viable option for warriors to use over existing ones.  I posted what it would take.  If they don't implement it or something similar shields will continue as they are: an odd option for an eccentric warrior who doesn't have a Blade of War.  If they are going to have Warrior only shields in the game, they need to give us a reason to use them.</div></div><hr />

excuse the fuck outta me.  it case you didn't read, i could care less so get off my ass.  someone asked why monks should care and i provided an answer.  i tried to equate it to something that i thought might help get the idea across.  i guess i shot too high in yer case.<br />
<br />
quite frankly, i'd like to see warriors get a hell of an improvement.  why?  because my guildleader and MT is a hell of a guy, knows his shit, has pretty damn good gear, and ends up deferring to a SK for a lot of fights because of the aggro control.  <br />
<br />
block from shields will accomplish nothing but further push the knights into a superior role as a tank because now they are taking less damage and sacraficing less DPS because of their superior one handed weapons.  <br />
<br />
furious bash and block is just another patchwork fix from SOE to cover the fact that they either aren't or don't know how to fix warrior taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sick and tired of the whining bs about warriors not tanking well enough and having agro issues. I'm not somebody speaking from the top guild on my server, but I do play with a great group of people. I DO know it can be a challenge being a warrior in groups and raids sometimes, but things are NOT as bad as SOME of you want to make it out to be. I've tanked JUST FINE in PoV experience groups with rogues that were much better equipped using a Primal 2HS (which has an inferior ratio to the very common windblade, and certainly isn't as good for agro as a greastaff of thunder). And all of the mobs my groups and guild go after we kill just fine when they're beating on me (except when I jump the gun and go for the mob before the healers are ready :p). I haven't even maxed my defensive archtypes yet.<br />
<br />
I agree that there should be another good EB 1HS weapon available in PoP or at least another &quot;definative&quot; warrior weapon like the BoW, Bloodfrenzy, HG, and BoC are. But you gotta also remember that the Blade of War blows everything else out of the water for the most part, so unless you missed out when your guild was doing RZtWL, it's kinda a moot point for many warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, we're only splitting hairs here.<br />
<br />
I'm all for shields giving a block skill to whoever's wielding them. It just makes sense.<br />
<br />
My only contention is that it shouldn't be superior to monk block percentages, since the tanks using the shield (warriors) already have all the other defensive skills AND parry.<br />
<br />
I would be happy with it being slightly less effective than monk block.<br />
<br />
Which would, overall be a defensive improvement.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
It's just a tinsy little thing. Not much to get up in arms about.<br />
<br />
It's just to me, having block modifier shields gimp the last useful monk defensive skill, seems like SOE kicking the dead horse one last time in the jimmy.<br />
<br />
Which ain't all that cool.<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />

Holding agro from other melee is not the problem really.<br />
<br />
two biggest problems I see (with taunt) at the moment is :<br />
<br />
1) The first few rounds of combat when you want debuffs to hit. We have to hope for good timing and then luck that our taunt lands<br />
<br />
2) Nukers in your group. With an SK or Pally tanking, your nukers can do prolly about double the DPS that they do with a warrior tanking. It is something quite obvious to me, because I play in the same room as our guilds druid nuker and we have both a 65 warrior and a 65 pally with very similiar gear.<br />
<br />
Now... that being said, I am not one of the warriors that wants better taunt.<br />
<br />
I want better tanking abilty. Agro is already trivial enough as is, and I would be willing to give up some nuker DPS if the warrior tanking has a noticeable survivability advantage.<br />

Wouldn't it be neato keen if they implemented warrior only 1handers with Paladin-like ratios that have certain restrictions such as &quot;Must have a shield equipped&quot;? I think that would be peachy.</div></div><hr />

Honestly isn't there supposed to be some challenge or fun to being a warrior? Taunt does work a majority of the time (IE more than half). When it doesn't work that's when you do things like /shield or area taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50% taunt rate ! Damn i'd like to see that on blue trash.<br />
<br />
Sword/Shield should be a viable option to 2HS. (See BF/Aegis vs BoW)<br />
Ac50 hp175  vs Ac100 Hp280 (with half the DPS)<br />
<br />
The gain on a buffed warrior is like what ? 4% Ac and 1.5% Hp ?<br />
<br />
Without DPS the agro should be coded as to be the same.<br />
With DPS BoW should be coded as to be 15% superior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the record, despite their avoidance completely negating damage, monks are not supposed to be the best tanks in the game.  (That's a whole different argument, tho)  Would it really be bad that classes which choose to use a shield instead of a 2hander, or 2 weapons, get a defensive bonus of the block ability?  (you'd think a person holding a shield and a weapon would be trying to defend themselves more over a person using two weapons or a 2hander)  And what's to say monks wouldn't get the same bonus to block if they have a shield equipped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fatz, that'd be a nice idea.  Ever seen the Helm of the Vampyric Traitor?  You need at least 30 defense to wear it, from what I see.  Would be nice to get weapons for warriors with knight-level ratios that require a certain skill in Block, which you'd only be able to get if you were using a shield.<br />
<br />
Besides...those nice ratio 1handers that knights use?  I guess a lower weapon skill doesn't mean anything to you.  They'd be nice...if I didn't miss about half my attacks on even green mobs.  The damage bonus and ratios on 2handers makes up for the misses, for knights, which is why they're preferred over 1handers.  I use that weapon in my magelo (18/22) because the proc helps me hold agro really well, and it goes off a lot, not for damage but for agro...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh. First two to three raids I ever pulled, I used a mage summoned shield. :-) Those were the days.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I guess it would, maybe have an effect. HOWEVER, what if the shields that do this aren't mnk equippable? OR, what if the effect isn't given to monks ... just plate tanks? OR, what if the effects don't stack or are just plain broken like Furious Bash was for the longest time?<br />
<br />
I don't trust SOE to implement this change properly at all.<br />
<br />
And that's me being optimistic.<br />
<br />
Heck, I even see a lot of peoples' points about this change being more beneficial to knights than warriors, which wouldn't help warriors much.<br />
<br />
I dunno.<br />
<br />
Inherently I keep thinking, it's a SHIELD, it's SUPPOSED to give you added defensive benefits.<br />
<br />
But in EQ they never really did much.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see shields be made useful somehow.<br />
<br />
I just fear it'll be all messed up in how they implement it ... and as usual SOE won't even think about the bigger picture. Heck I'd be willing to bet some of the people working on this don't even KNOW monks have BLOCK as a skill.<br />

<br />
plain and simple, SoE/Varent beefed up the following classes to make the more group friendly<br />
<br />
monks, druids, wizards, mages, necros<br />

and out of all those classes the monk is the only damn one that groups, most of the others join a group, complain about xp and go solo, that sucks for them because now groups are better no one trusts them.<br />

the only one that groups is monks and they almost never leave, i admit i love monks in my group, xp flows like rain but it really makes me mad how easy they can become the better tank with some crappy gear, meaning their base class skeleton is stronger than the warrior base skeleton, as masters of wepoans we really get shafted, were is our special attack? i mean an sword handle bash at least (very basic attack)<br />
<br />
( i used do a little renosonce fairs and my friends and i sword fight from time to time with kendo wepoans and the like)<br />
<br />
ah anyway sry, monk was whining about himself being less uber and it got me derailed <br />
<br />
i want you to consider this, if warriors start to use shields it doesnt hurt anyone elses power to do dmg, it only makes it possible to take less dmg ( new skill being added soon make a chance of completly nagating dmg) so less CH's and the bash and the procs mean we hold agro (our class job for gods sake) also keep in mind we dont have anything near the pally one handers, theres a reason its pally sk only on some of those swords you see that make you /drool. anyway im rambling so ill some it up<br />
<br />
shield proc and block skill will do the following<br />
1.) may result in a succesful raid when there arnt enough clerics to keep up<br />
2.) proc plus shield stun might stop your nukers from being fried<br />
3.) melees(besides monks) can effectivly rely on shields to give then that extra little bit of longevity<br />
4.) if half the warriors on a raid are using sheilds the mob has a high chance of being stun locked<br />
<br />
as far as group---<br />
1.) nothing, these items are raid roll only, almost like warriors themselves lmao</div></div><hr />

Ya... thought that is what I was saying.<br />
<br />
I dont agree warriors should get better taunt, I was just saying which parts of the current taunt system piss off some warriors. The fact we lack instant agro abilities of knights, while knights are not really inferior tanking wise (in XP situations anyhow)<br />
<br />
Read through my post again, and notice I do NOT want better taunt. I wanna tank better.<br />

<br />
i do like /shield and your right about it but please dont talk about using AoE taunt, you havent used it in a GROUP ( im sick of everyone saying we should suck in a group because we are raid favorites, that BS ) if you use it in the group you stand to pull the mobs from the other players camp (KSing is nnot looked kindly upon in the end game) and also since you already are on a hate list the mobs you may have used a lull line ALSO get pulled because this thing is basicly a spell with out a gem, a damageless AoE hate proc of sorts</div></div><hr />

<br />
So to deal with a monk (me) whining about himself (well actually I was whining about you all wanting to basically steal a monk only skill ... but hey, you know what, if Mage's deserve Ice Comet, you all deserve block!) ...<br />
<br />
Anyways, to deal with that, you go on an ENOURMOUS rant filled with lies and misinformation?<br />
<br />
Awesome.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what my favorite part of the BS was ... but I think it's one of these three things:<br />
<br />
1) You ALMOST lose in a duel to a monk, but ACTUALLY WIN THE DUEL, at a level where your melee skills are actually lagging BEHIND the monk's (skill cap check time) ... and you think monks are overpowered? I'd comment on something about how MEND only gives a monk 25% MORE hit points in a duel thus bringing them more EQUAL with a warrior toe to toe due to the huge hit point disparity, but that'd be pointless. Because DUELS count for jack and nothing in the grand scheme of things. I lose duels all the time. Is it because my class sucks? Nope, it's because I personally SUCK at duelling.<br />
<br />
2) You actually think monks tank better than you in XP groups. For anyone to believe this, you'd need to provide proof. This MAY have been true sometime between when Luclin went live and 3 months before Planes of Power (when monk defensive skills were ruined) ... but it's no longer the case. So either you're holding an OLD grudge which has LONG since been dealt with ... or you're lying. I opt for both.<br />
<br />
3) You think monks shouldn't have been given block. Which makes no sense whatsoever. It's just a defensive skill. Monks, who HONE their body to become hard as steel and become effective weapons, in COMBAT, have figured out ways to deflect and &quot;block&quot; blows. BIG FREAKIN DEAL. It's just another bit of random number generator SPAM in overall combat. Like DODGE. Why would a warrior wearing 29 pounds of plate and chain be able to dodge anything other than a head cold? Because it's a video game and the game says he or she can.<br />
<br />
Anyways, glad you hate monks and all. You're still way off base and full of it. The monk &quot;tanking&quot; superiority is SOOOO last year. And was dealt with THOROUGHLY.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anyone wanted to play this little game with you, Wubao, we'd just say &quot;Critical Hits&quot; and tell you to shut the fuck up.  To make it &quot;fair&quot; we'd say you should only get critical hits when wielding a weapon in primary hand and a shield in off hand.  But that would be a useless, retarded conversation.<br />
<br />
Get it through your head:  BLOCKING with a shield is not the same as a monk BLOCKING nor does it infringe upon ANY role or ability a monk currently has.<br />
<br />
Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imoh monks have enough with block, mend, FD, SF, all the special attacks and decent AAs so they dont need to whine when a warrior or pally or SK is made better, its not a narf on you unless you loose something, just because we finally are being looked at isnt call for linching the dev team.<br />
<br />
proof you get better agro hmmmm, maybe the dragon strikes or the flying pile of shit attack i dont know, or maybe the 1 percent bonus haste you get that increases with level that stacks with items and/or spells, SoE almost narfed your class but you flooded the feedback channel, commited suicide in the nexus to lag it out and threatend to quit, seems like the half of you that did that arnt used to having mud kicked in your face, i wish warriors did that when we got narfed, oh wait, we never have been because we are at the bottom of the berrol!!<br />
<br />
give me time, im working up a good list of information with cited sources as to the power of the monks in the game, right now its useless ranting on both sides. <br />
<br />
i should beat something that cons light blue to me (the monk) i almost didnt because my class is fixed with gear band aids each expantion, this shield skill along with the promissed AAs and plate armor/wepoan investgation is the first step at making us decent across the board instead of just when we have the latest expantion and a uber guild to carry us<br />
<br />
let me say this warriors in general dont call for a narf on this or that class, but rather ask for their class to be the class modified, but you also have to understand that it is EXTREMELY hard for SoE to change our class because all the melees and melee halfbreeds are measured with the warrior as the standard &quot;inch&quot; so if we get any major changes all the other classes that swing a wepoan have to get a change to</div></div><hr />

please shut up.  your posts have been filled with nothing but inaccurate facts and speculation.  its becoming obvious that you know exactly nothing about the monk class.  if you are working on a list, for gods sake at least find out the truth.<br />
<br />
to refute a few of your statements:<br />
monks are full of shit, plain and simple you bitch the most and get the most, i dueled a 47 monk at 52, i had the widebladed greatsword (one of the better swords in the game) and he almost kicked my ass because of mend, tell me were is mend a fair skill?<br />
- Great.....nice sword....what was the monk using?  Equipment and moreover SKILL have a lot to do with duels.  Maybe you just suck at duelling.<br />
plain and simple, SoE/Varent beefed up the following classes to make the more group friendly<br />
<br />
monks, druids, wizards, mages, necros<br />
- and you even mention the monk nerf later on.  I assume you just overlooked that in your rant.  I fail to see how they were beefed up.<br />
oh one more thing, monks should NEVER EVER get block skill<br />
- Already got it.... beastlords got it too....<br />
or maybe the 1 percent bonus haste you get that increases with level that stacks with items and/or spells<br />
- monks do not get innate haste.</div></div><hr />

And one more thing.. remember the movie Billy Madison?  When Billy had to describe the industrial revolution, and basically spat out a bunch of bull shit?  That's what your post reminds me of..

<br />
Because it's an internet message board. Because it's your standard class vs. class nonsense post. Because it's 6 months or so after the monk class was gimped thoroughly and I get to hear more vitriol and rhetoric about how monks are overpowered and how warriors absolutely NEED block to compete in the world of EQ.<br />
<br />
And because I get to read gems like this:<br />

Aggro's kind of hard to parse data for isn't it?<br />
<br />
If not, forget I said anything. But if so ... there's always what Ainmer said in the first post:<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my own experiences with Aegis of the Earth were promising last night. I would put the aggro level of my combo, Bloodfrenzy+Aegis of the Earth at the same level as the ol' faithful Bloodfrenzy+BoC. However, I do not feel it had the same aggro power as the Blade of War.&quot;<br />
<br />
He's not the only reporting POSITIVELY about the change to Furious Bash.<br />
<br />
I've heard good things about it.<br />
<br />
And personally, in regards to FB, I'm ecstatic to see it working so well. <br />
<br />
All that block jibba jabba aside, I think Furious Bash is a pretty good idea and hope it works out well enough to give a little more variety to the class.<br />

<br />
monks should have more offensive aas than us, why they dont get flurry, i have no clue, just poor design. sure some warrior is gonna whine about it if they give it to monks, but u need to ignore the stupid ppl.<br />
<br />
shielded tanks should block better than a monk(primarily an offensive class). lol its a plate shield verse a monk using whatever he does to block a blow. plate classes should be 100% better dmg absorbtion than a monk/rogue type class. any person using a shield should block better than someone not using one. there are even a few monk equipable shields, good for when pulling, which i would hope would make the monk block better too.<br />
<br />
as far as agro, BF is rare and cursed is killed asap on all servers. unless the shield gets a serious agro upgrade or another BF upgrade is put in the game thats little more common, there is no way anyone but knights and the few BF warriors are going to use them.<br />
<br />
frankly this isnt my biggest beef atm though, totally off subject, they need to fix the freaking drops in the game. go back to 3 item drops, 2 molds + item on pof minis etc would be great ! all Gods should have 3 drops at least, 4 would be reasonable.<br />
<br />
agro, dmg, tanking, whatever takes a backseat to the screwed up itemization in pop.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm...  I like being a warrior.  What fun is it to have an almost guarantee that a mob will stick to you no matter what?  There's no challenge in that.<br />
<br />
EQ raiding/xping is all about controlled mayhem, too little and it takes too long to kill a mob, too much and you have the mob ping pong all over the place.  It's a TEAM game, everyone has to do their part.<br />
<br />
I myself use a Cord Hilted/Stormrider Carapace combo for hp/defense, sometimes Frostreaver for 2H to keep ripostes down, sometimes other combinations.  Yeah, nothing amazing, but depending on the situation, they all work good for me.  Mobs stick, only get off me if someone goes overboard, but that's what aet/shield/taunt/etc. are for.  Keeps everyone awake.  Otherwise we become that &quot;pull mob, press autoattack, wait til mob's dead, pull mob, press...&quot; tank everyone is always talking about.<br />
