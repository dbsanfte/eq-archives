Since we've been stuck on this for days, figured i'd make a seperate topic to segregate the dnc's in the normal epic thread.<br />
<br />
My share so far is<br />
Water Flask + High Quality Metal Bits 2x + Ladislev's Toolbox = DNC<br />
Water Flask + High Quality Metal Bits 2x + Kyv Wheatstone = DNC<br />
Water Flask + High Quality Metal Bits 2x + Gem Setter Parts = DNC<br />
<br />
It's a pretty vague, so i figure we're gonna need to pull a dnc mass to get this done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i would try in a forge and oven both tannan and old world to cover all bases.</div></div><hr />

So, what is the make up of a mold?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zoriouz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the gemming mold has got to be bought. there are NO molds what so ever I have found that are player or npc made. Keep searching vendors guys, its out there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">may want to post on other class forums to see if other classes come accross it to let us know, might help with lookin around or maybe someone has seen it already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did anyone ask Gridbar &quot;gemming mold?&quot; I cant ask him since I haven't been able to get the items and flags up to that point, I had a hunch it might be a tinkering recipie, I even went over to the Gem cutters warrior guild and looked around akanon and the windmills for anything new, couldn't find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lumkib Stoutheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After reading all this....I think that if you take out most of the questions, you get a recipe.  One flask of water, 2 high quality bits, and a gemming mold. Now I've read several posts about this that and the other. I do believe that there MAY be a connection with centaurs in the Karanas.....however Karana's is a huge area and may need a tracker of sorts to check on named mobs. Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thinking about &quot;gemming mold&quot; and &quot;gemming tool&quot;, and remembered that there is a line of Velium Gemmed weapons in GoD that are player crafted.  Since we are talking about a tool to inset gems/eyes into a hilt, perhaps these are analgous.  For those recipes, it looks like the Short Hilt Inset Mold (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=11774)  is used for 'gemming' the hilt.  Perhaps someone could try these, or other hilt inset molds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">gemming mold may not mean its called &quot;gemming mold&quot;  It may have something to do with setting stones ala jewelcraft for example.  Was checking out eqtraders and found this.<br />
<br />
Receptacle Mold<br />
MAGIC ITEM NO DROP <br />
WT: 0.4   Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
stackable<br />
<br />
This item is the result of a quest: <br />
Abysmal Sea <br />
Hiloan O'Yviania @ -242, 232, 99   Its part of the newbie pottery quest but shrug, also tried the combine with a scaler mold and nothing.  Also there is an animal cookie mold in abysmal at the smithing vendors i havent tried yet.<br />
<br />
The only 2 recipies that are known to use hq metal bits are sewing needle and vale sewing needle also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calhoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When he asks &quot;Wheres the beef?&quot;  Do ya'll think he is looking for some sort of meat or perhaps an ogre in Highhold Pass I think it is named Beef?  Just curious what ya'll think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nafun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Perhaps &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; is a reference  to minotaurs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
when I did my hand in to him this afternoon he didn't say where's the beef.<br />
<br />
Yes, yes. Gemming tool. Very strong... huh? Korbuk wants a cookie?  Where's Gridbar?  Gridbar who?  I know I'm a horse, so what?  Huh?  Right, tool.  Need a flask of water... huh? Two high quality metal bits.  Who goes there?!  One gemming mold.  Cook them in a force, you got yourself a... what? Tool, gemming tool.<br />
<br />
He says who goes there instead of where's the beef for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">going from that it seems like possibly hand a flask of water to a horse or mino and the combine is  just 2 hq bits and the mold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Higelac_SZZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i doubt a horse would give you a mold :o</div></div><hr />

<br />

Does he also call it a &quot;force&quot; instead of &quot;forge&quot; now, or is that just a typo on your part?  Maybe we are not supposed to use a forge to combine them...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its a typo by the poster. He says forge.</div></div><hr />
