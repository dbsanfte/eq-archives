Personally I think Spike Lee is a dumbass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What a putz.  He may be a dumbass, but more likely he just wanted the attention this would get him.  Either way, his stance is totally asinine.  I hope they rule that from now on TNN can use the name Spike whenever they want to, but Spike Lee is barred from using the name and must come up with another name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Spike Lee's case will get over ruled.  He shouldn't have supreme access to how the word spike is used.<br />
<br />
Will they change the vollyball term from spike to &quot;bill&quot; perhaps?  Or perhaps youngsters will not longer spike the punch at their prom, instead they will &quot;bill&quot; it?  No more railroad spikes, instead they would become railroad &quot;bills.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, a big stretch there =)  It wouldn't make sense for the SC to give one man the rights to a word.  If so, I hereby take the word David and all its other forms.  Its my name and if anyone used it, it would put a negative spin on it.<br />
<br />
Yep, I bet that will hold up in court...</div></div><hr />

I'm usually a big fan of Ed Norton too.</div></div><hr />

The only good quote from him was from &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; i think it was: <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you, fuck your pizza, fuck Frank Sinatra...&quot;</div></div><hr />
