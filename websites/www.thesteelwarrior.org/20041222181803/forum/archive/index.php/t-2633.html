<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im currently in Bastion of Thunder with a group consisting of a 65 shaman, 65 shadow knight, 65 Warrior (me), and 62 beat lord, and a 62 Rogue. They are all in my guild and we are all equally pretty much equipped for their levels. We have no cleric, and we are doing the courtyard.<br />
<br />
The tank is the Shadowknight, the chanter is slowing, and the shaman is doing heals. I and the rogue are DPS.....ok..<br />
<br />
Shadowknight is using Greater Stormwatcher Horn.<br />
<br />
Do we need a cleric for this set up ? nope, not at all this is trivial in fact.<br />
<br />
Do casters have to worry about aggro...nope...shadow knight pulls with dark and DPS aggro and spells and not once the entire time in the camp has he lost aggro at any stage of the fights.<br />
<br />
Shadow knight is healing himself via weapon proc, spells, and shaman heal.<br />
<br />
As a warrior I would cost too much mana for this group, as I have zero ability to heal myself, and there might be some initial loss of aggro to the slower etc, causing heals to be spread out.<br />
<br />
Am I a little hurt? You bet I am. Some how this kinda makes me think that somewhere down the road SOE has lost site with class balance and proficiency, and I have played many characters but warrior hurts big time in this balance scheme.<br />
<br />
What advantage is there when we die at the hand of a green mob...solo is a joke.<br />
<br />
What advantage is there when a SK can heal himself and make up for the lost hps and some over whatever hp advantage I had as a warrior?<br />
<br />
What advantage is there for choosing a single dimension class(no spells) when gear itemization is the same for SK who are multi tiered? We get weapons that have mana and int and wis and it only helps them in their multi tier structure that much more.<br />
<br />
What's sad is that as a class we have lost serious ground as to what we can add to the table.<br />
<br />
SOE has glorified the Hybrid classes, and left in the corner a class of the melee only warrior whose benefits are obscurred in questions.<br />
<br />
Tis very sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our Shadow Knights in our guild all agree that the warrior class is very underbalanced and need some serious fixing.<br />
<br />
Futhermore, I have a RL brother who left EQ to play a warrior in DAOC. He laughs at our warriors here in EQ and says if you really want to see how a warrior tank should be, play DAOC who have their class concepts more on target.<br />
<br />
I played DAOC and in fact I agree with him. I brought a toon to 23 and just seeing how they depict the warrior makes me envious.<br />
<br />
Sory Sony, but you better rethink and go BACK TO BASICS in your vision of things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cry about something legitmate.  Paladins are far, far worse than SKs.  Any SK that actually knows how to play their class wouldn't be tanking because they're a lot more useful doing other things like doing damage (Aura of Hate &gt; your DPS on a melee heavy group even if he doesn't do anything else).  A SK using mana for aggro is wasting DPS because unlike the Paladin, his mana could be used for damage.  Why on earth would he not just cast Voice of Thule on you (2.5 mana/tick I think) and then use spells that actually do damage.</div></div><hr />

First .... relax...big time.<br />
<br />
Second read the damn post. I am not comparing damage - your confusing another post...same with a paladin. Dont draw crap in my post that isn't there. Are you a paladin? If so, which, it sounds from your reply - then your the one crying. F how did Paladins get in my post??<br />
<br />
He wasn't using his lifetaps to draw aggro. That wasn't his purpose. But I won't explain the concept to you as you missed half the post anyhow.<br />
<br />
In fact, your response would have been better if you just plain said I was lying. That would make more sense.  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a warrior.  If a SK can mitigate meaningful damage with Lifetaps that go at the rate of 1 mana for about 1.5 life, I'm not sure what you'll say about Paladins that have a 10 second stun for 200 mana.  If a mob does 100 DPS unslowed, then 200 mana mitigates 1000 damage.  Force of Akilae is even better ratio.  Lifetaps can't even compare to the stuns in terms of mitigating damage and only fairly well equipped Paladins use their real stuns.<br />
<br />
How well equipped is the SK?  A BoT mob especially casters type will rarely even do over 50% of my life before it dies if it's slowed.  There's a lot of things wrong with the Warrior/Knight balance right now, but SK taking less damage than you is not one of them.  Paladin can potentially take less damage with their 2 stuns but that actually requires a good amount of FT/AAs/focus to keep up the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a shadow knight can hold aggro so well that a mob does not ping pong from one party member to another then the difference I make up for less damage(which i aggree with you there - I had more hps AC) isn't going to make up for a group without a cleric.<br />
<br />
A shaman, and I have one, cannot function like a cleric, and I have one of those(62, 65 respectively) for fast heals and mana efficient heals. The fact that the shaman had to heal one, and only ONE person in this group the entire time make up vs. me being healed, the chanter, and the puller, or possibly Rogue DPS if I tanked.<br />
<br />
In this group make up, its not about my damage mitigation over the SK, it was mana efficiency for the healing via shaman/SK....which made the SK the better tank.</div></div><hr />

Hercules for instance, half human, half god. He was the strongest human around, but still, a god could kick his butt in a moment. Question would be in this example, which part is the weaker, his cleric abilities or his warrior abilities?

Some just can't believe that Warriors are underpowered.  Its always some other class that is over powered.  The &quot;core&quot; of what it means to play a Warrior has been so narrowly defined (or neglected...I can't tell which happened) that when the game moved on what choice is there but to abandon them.<br />
<br />
I find it funny that Phantron thinks that Paladins are bigger abusers than SKs.  In fact Paladin vs SKs issues right now are fairly balanced.<br />
<br />
Why do I think this?  Because both classes achieve the same effect in a different manner.  SKs and Paladins have different casting profiles that rely on different skills and different AA sets.  There is a bit of difference between the tactics used by an SK and a Paladin.<br />
<br />
If Phantron believes Paladins are cooler than SKs then he can believe that.  I just don't see it.  SKs can't generate hate like Paladins.  Paladins can't generate hate like SKs.  Both are equally useful with their pros and cons.   If this wasn't true then SKs wouldn't bother trying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CY mobs in BoT aren't the hardest hitting mobs out there.  Since the Shaman did not have to worry about slows, he should have been able to keep either you or the SK standing.  As mentioned previously, a SK has a lot of ways to make you a better tank.  I don't know enough about SKs to say whether it made more sense for you or he to tank though.<br />
<br />
I am a 65 Paladin, and if I had been in the group instead of the SK, I would have stunned the mob on incoming and then have the Warrior taunt off me.  I try to do this whenever I'm grouped with a 65 Warrior with decent (or better) gear.  It lets the casters start their work on incoming but still takes advantage of the Warrior's superior HP/AC/Mitigation.  Also, if I take a few hits before the Warrior gets aggro I am not likely to die and I can usually heal myself, so the main healer can focus on the Warrior.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that in a group with a Warrior and a SK that the SK was tanking.  The real problem is that a group with an SK is not likely to consider adding a Warrior at all.  And a group with no tank will look for a SK or PAL over a Warrior in most cases if one is available. <br />
<br />
In a similar case, I was putting a BoT group together yesterday.  We had Paladin (me), Chanter, Ranger, Rogue, Druid.  I saw a good friend, also a Paladin, LFG.  I told the group I was going to invite her.  The group came back with &quot;do we want a second tank?&quot;  To which I replied &quot;she is a good friend and player, we need good players&quot;.  All three tank classes are unlikely to be added to a group that already has a tank.<br />

<br />
No one is debating that a warrior, given the same access to gear, has better hps or AC. The problem exists when the efficiency of using that AC and HPs is not utilized appropriately due to aggro control. Yea some warriors got the BOW or the BOC..and have tuanting and enraging weapons. I'm talking the class ...not those having those weapons. I for one do not have those weapons, nor am I going to pay for a BoC.(I guess I probably lose out on groups because I dont have that weapon). A similar way of thinking is a car with 500 hp vs. a Car with 300 hp. If the 500 hp car cannot get that power to the ground, and the 300 hp car has the ability to get that hp on the ground via traction equipment then its going to be more efficient and thus win the street race.<br />
<br />
On a side note speaking as a Cleric. I for one would rather heal one person than 2 to 3 other people in a group. I'm not talking some uber raid here where defensive is in use...im talking an experience group. The concept I am going to use here is tanking efficiency. Don't give me this crap that SK and Pal can't tank...they can and they do a very good job doing it. And in most situations the difference between those two classes and a warrior are marginal. Don't tell me that a SK and Pal can't generate and maintain aggro better than a warrior...they do...and there is nothing marginal about this aspect. When you couple the two above that is what gives rise to the majority of many threads and balance issues in this board.<br />
<br />
My warrior is 65 with pretty decent gear at 134 AA. I am a frog. My first toon was a pure caster. Most of my toons I play with are 60's +. I have other toons and have played this game for over 3 years. I have arguments and praises on other classes. However, in the spectrum of things and as a class that is one dimensional pure melee - this limiting only dimension for a class has been neglected over time. I am o.k. with the knowlege that as an Overlord of Norrath I stand up as one of the weakest solo in this player vs. environment game. I am ok that in the high end game to have any chance whatsoever to gain experience ... I must be grouped. That is great. But, with all that there SHOULD be some offsetting compensation for this class and it has not been developed correctly. I for one would like the Warrior class the ability to make use of the Hp and AC given them more efficiently than they currently have to struggle for. It would be nice to come to these message boards and not see an array of voodoo science attempts to figure out why, what, how, when of why we struggle to do what we are intended to do in a game where designers chose to put &quot;Exit&quot; next to our Camp button for confusion purposes.<br />
<br />
If i can't find a group, and I want exp for my warrior I will log on my Necro and invis down to HoH and park my warrior against the wall in some basement camp while I use my necro to aggro kite sentry's or something. Guess what ? Shadow Knights can do the same thing my necro does solo. In fact it was a SK that introduced me to the camp. To hell if I have to struggle for the one thing my warrior has going for him !<br />
<br />
By Absor's own admission &quot;Undoubtedly warriors are the most difficult class to be innovative with.&quot; That's an utter BS excuse for not doing anything....and it's got to stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem having to have other clases help me with what I should be able to do for myself.<br />
<br />
Stunning on inc, then having the warrior taunt off is a lot like, say... with a warrior/pally in the group, the warrior has to tank the mob till it's slowed and has the paladin taunt off after it's slowed.... because on his own, the paladin can't handle the unslowed mob reliably, and can and does consistenty cause problems for his group because of it.<br />
<br />
Just as the paladin as a tank does, and should, be able to handle the unslowed mob's damage reliably without relying on help from the warrior, the warrior should be able to handle the initial aggro on any mob without having to rely on the hybrid, if present, to help them to do so.<br />
<br />
If they cannot, there's an issue there, and it needs to be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boleslav<br />

Your statement:<br />
<br />
&quot;The real problem is that a group with an SK is not likely to consider adding a Warrior at all. And a group with no tank will look for a SK or PAL over a Warrior in most cases if one is available.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can aggree with that...but keep in mind this is a guild group and we support our own and we needed a group. Also, we weren't out to prove who was better...just what worked the best...we were all friends so nothing to prove.<br />
<br />
 Also, keep in mind that I still think a warrior is a better tank than SK or Pal when people allow them to be. <br />
<br />
This is the big problem...casters and many others want to have the freedom to nuke like crazy and have the security knowing that aggro will not be an issue. They can gain this sense of security with a SK or Pal better than they can with a warrior, and often rely on that as the basis for their opinion. <br />
<br />
As for me I usually do pretty good as a tank, but its entirely up to the groups willingness to allow me to do my job. I am not above stopping a group and telling them what will work better, and many times I have done so when problems become too much. <br />
<br />
I get a lot of pick up groups so I experience various situations where one group I have what seems perfect aggro control and zero aggro recourse to caster. An hour later, I can have 2 people replace and all of a sudden the aggro management is totally chaos...and the other 3 people before wondering what is so different to cause such a change in aggro management.<br />
<br />
As a tank I am nearly always fully buffed, as I can log on a 62 shammy, or a 65 cleric for the best buffs available for experience groups. My gear AC/HP wise is pretty good, but I do not own a BoC or an EB weapon. I am probably right at 8k hps or within a hundred of reaching it fully raid buffed...exp groups I am around 7800...my AC is 1550 to 1600 ... sometimes I switch out stuff if I pull. I am usually fully hasted in my groups, and my Dex is always maxxed for procs etc. <br />
<br />
I am an avid believer in positioning, using taunt at the right times, and switching out weapons during the fight for different reasons. I also work to allow proper placement for rogue and ranger if in group(backstabbing and Walling of mobs).<br />
<br />
As for being on both sides of healer and warrior let me tell you my perspective on aggro management. A warrior can do a good job if people will let him. <br />
<br />
I don't mean this to offend you or your scenario. However my biggest frustration occurs when I group with someone who also is trying to manage aggro while I am main tank. It usually happens at the onset when a SK or BST want to generate aggro early on to protect the slower and take the aggro. <br />
<br />
A warrior has a refresh timer on taunt, and in my humble opinion that taunt button works. When I am in a group I expect to be the first person(other than the puller) to engage that mob straight out. As the Main Tank I want that mob hitting me and only me. After I hit that mob and a couple seconds later my assist key goes off I fully intend to keep aggro. When slow lands, and if mob turns to slower, I fully expect that my taunt button is available and ready at that time to turn that mob right back on me. 9 times out of 10 that taunt works. If I lose aggro to the slower/caster it's because my taunt button was not available to me when I needed it(yes there are times when taunt will fail or the caster gets resisted and retries and the warrior is at square one again). If I fail the taunt or I don't have the button available I have to rely on positioning, DPS, procs till that refresh timer returns or I make a judgement call on AE taunt.<br />
<br />
When someone else wants to play aggro managment they are blindly working against the warrior....making the warrior look like shit for aggro management. <br />
<br />
There have been times I blew taunt on an overzealous SK or BST, and got aggro back only to lose it again on the slower, only to wait a few seconds to refresh or blow my AE tuant to again have the SK or BST take the aggro again thinking that the warrior sucks and that they are doing some wonderful thing. <br />
<br />
I am not knocking SK/Pal/BST by any means. I have grouped with all of them and sometimes a couple of those classes at the same time very successfully in groups. And they can act as snap aggro for crucial moments that can save a life. <br />
<br />
However, it emphasizes a point that a warrior has more issues do deal with for aggro control than a SK or a Pal, and more opportunities for erros and people have to understand those issues to allow the class to function right or to respect that class as it is currently.<br />
<br />
In my opinion some of this was the original approach to how aggro management was intended...making people think to play.<br />
<br />
But, conversly I feel SK/Pal literally have it way too easy in the aggro department and it undermines this game as it stand currently. You can't give a class marginal difference in tanking ability coupled with a trivial ability for aggro control.</div></div><hr />
