Raid buffed I have roughly 8.7khp and 1525ac (with help from leadership hps AA) <br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of one groupable mobs to kill for upgrades as I am short on raid points atm (saving for BoW) ;)<br />
<br />
I am flagged up to PoFire, and have GoD, but do not have any GoD Trials yet<br />

<br />
PD3 and some points into Sturdiness will help you out too.</div></div><hr />

Get your CoV faction up and kill Doze and the drakes for quest armor pieces. The shoulders, cloak, bracer and charm would all be very significant upgrades for you. It might take some time and energy to do, but a single group can definitely take them down.<br />
<br />
  I don't know how much you like LDoN, but the Tak armor really is good. Especially now that you can get partial refunds for it and the augments, I'd very much suggest working towards 10ac augmenting the slots you can, and 40hp augmenting a few other things.<br />
<br />
  Btw, you should replace that Ring of Thunderous Spirits with even a player made 6ac 65hp ring. 75hp and no ac makes me weep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Grind out Sturd 5<br />
- Fill up all available slots w/ 40hp augs<br />
- Fill up all available slots w/ 10ac augs<br />
- Do lots of Hard LDoNs for:  Earing of Sand tides, Mana-Threaded Bone Bracer, Bloody Boots of Dark Rites, Necklace of the Troglodyte, Lost Ancient Elven Ring, Warlord Steel Gauntlets, Cape of Broken enchantments.<br />
- Do GoD trials and try to get:  Polished Garnet Loop (vxed), Burnished Antique Greeves (vxed), Bracer of the Heartstriker (tipt) ... a few other nice things here.<br />
<br />
You can grind serious aa's while doing both the trials and the LDoN's, and you can also grind out the points for the augments and work on earning gear at the same time while doing ldon.  If you were to do all of these things you would have 0 problems tanking in EP's (aside from mobs like reparm where everyone has problems).<br />
<br />
I'd imagine you'd put on ~1000 hp or more and a few hundred ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost all of the items listed in the hard LDON loot thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8113) is an upgrade for you.  Definitely do LDONs to buy augments, and try to stick to hard missions for the loot.<br />
<br />
Also, I see you have a bracer from GoD trials.  If you mix those trials in amongst your hard LDON missions, then you'll see more equipment upgrades from there too.  Vxed is particularly farmable, and has an earring and greaves that you will want.</div></div><hr />
