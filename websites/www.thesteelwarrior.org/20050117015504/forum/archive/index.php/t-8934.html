Agree, but with the following disclaimer; dual wield is better that 2h AFTER you have the AAs done... i.e. 5 levels of offhand riposte and DS resist.  With those, yah, the stats from 2 endgame 1h weapons + the superior aggro from em (the old observation that mobs hate getting hit more often more than they hate getting hit hard) = the resurgence of DW.  Add in the shield AAs and it's a lock.<br />

Basically the gist of it was it depends on what stage of the game you're at, and here's my interpretation:<br />
<br />
2h or 1h, your choice: Casual 65 using GSoT or CHoS/SotB<br />
1h: Less casual 65 using GBoS/CHSD or BoC/CHoS (ideally BoC/GBoS)<br />
2h: Raiding 65 using BoW<br />
1h: DBoTW+</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 26/21 32/26 i dont see how 65/35 2H can even try to keep up.</div></div><hr />

I think this is about right, although I think teh BoW is a little overrated, but Time+ dual wield is the clear winner, especially after the OoW AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW IMO was really good because it had a very high DB/DMG for the time, so the first swings would add a solid amount of hate, w/o having to rely on proc, which was the biggest weakness of the time.<br />
<br />
BF+Decent offhander both with A3 would be a better choice nowadays imo, except for maybe ripostes, which is an overstated risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I agree. in Gates, my unaug'd h8giver and soul render produced more static hate then my blade of war ... may sound weird, but on clearings, the 1h'ers held the agro over everything else.</div></div><hr />

I never liked 2handers, dual wield was just &quot;better&quot;... mostly because I felt warrs got the shaft by being denied the main offensive ability that seperates us from pallies and Sk's... now that Omens has AAs to correct offhand ripostes, I am greatly looking forward to full-bore tankage with 1h against all mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far for me the only time I have ever used a  2hander is when tanking longer fights where the mob is a heavy melee. Like AoW I would get a good solid agro with 1handers and then swich out to my 2hander. staff of 4 winds from BoT is best I have right now. Also have used this on mobs in SSRA like HP.  With the wierd way ramp works in SSRA I have not used a 2hander on any other mobs than HP once for fear that I would lose agro sending ramp to a cleric instead of my backup.<br />
I am excited for the new aa's and the shield aa's looks like a &quot;easy fix&quot; for shields in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
For raids, an anger 3 aug'ed bow + WA AAs + bellow (and for the paranoid perhaps a hate amp from ench/sk and a buff proc) was quite sufficient to hold aggro in all but unusual cases (aggro wipe/reduction/FD effects, etc).  Basically, the dps put out by the tank is rotten anyway, and if a 2h is good enough to hold aggro and minimizes the dmg taken (riposte + damage shield) then it's doing it's job.  That was PoP and for a large part GoD.<br />
<br />
Things change now tho, since the stats on 2 newer 1h weapons are significantly better than on the &quot;best&quot; 2hs, and there are AAs that eliminate the extra ripo/ds damage.  Or if max turtle mode is needed, there are some very viable shields that work well with top end 1h weapons and still allow aggro locks... and that &quot;block&quot; AA could be huge.<br />
<br />
For grouping, the additional DPS from dual wielding even while tanking makes things even clearer, again given the offhand AAs.  And for non-tanking situations, 2 low aggro high dps 1h weapons have always been better (except vs. DSes, obviously).<br />
<br />
That all make sense?  The BoW is still a good weapon, but it's 2 expansions old now, and from a pre-elemental encounter.  Works until something better is available, it's not like there are so many choices unfortunately (i.e. dark blade of luckydrops).<br />
<br />

Bah - I still hate that staff...I paid 38k for mine the day before Sony changed the drop rate and they became common... :mad: <br />
<br />
On the other hand...I finally got the GBoS last night so I'm all for increasing DW effectiveness now...  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK, 2 handers have been dead since the advent of WA.  These new AA's do not really do much more than put the final nail in the coffin.  <br />
That said, I think its kinda sad that 2handers are so far behind.  But that seems to be how the game is played.  I remember a post long ago on some board (could have been this one) asking if dual wield was dead.  This was before Anyone had gotten to Time, but after RZ.  Apparently, the game just runs in circles.  I for one would still love to have a BoW or even that new 2hander in OoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually still use both DW and 2H.  At the beginning of fights I use DBotW + GBoS (yeah I know... bite me), once I have solid aggro established, I swap in CB + 4 dmg aug for DPS for the rest of the fight.  If I'm feeling lazy I just DW and don't bother swapping.</div></div><hr />
