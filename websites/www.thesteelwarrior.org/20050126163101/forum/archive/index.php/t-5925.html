<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to finally buy the Sword of the Bloodsworn and Copper Hammer of Striking. Now from what I understand I have to get some proc augments. Can someone tell me what they are, and how many points I need?<br />
<br />
And one more question. My 1h blunt is low. Since I'm duel weilding a 1h slash as primary and a 1h blunt as a secondary. Will I get skill ups in 1hb? Or do I need to switch 1hb to primary?<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope I don't have to upgrade weapon anytime soon. ;)</div></div><hr />

I would suggest putting the SoBS in off hand as its faster delay will help your DW chances.  Also putting CHoS in main hand means more swings = more chances for skill ups.  And grats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about adding procs to the weapons?<br />
<br />
Sadly in Paludal I was loosing agro to a BeastLord... But I think this weapons had procs too. I'm not positive but I'd like lighting every once in a while. Most of the time I was able to get it back though. ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
go here to look for augments and cost and what camp to get em at.</div></div><hr />

Aggro should be a non-issue. You are wielding weapons that some lvl 65 people don't have. If the BL is stealing aggro he must be better twinked. Mobs more than likely die in 20 seconds anyhow.<br />
<br />
By the time you can secure a 1450point LDoN augment you will have made it to lvl 50 or so doing the adventures alone. That, however is a good idea. Max out adventures at a young age, not for the points but for the XP and because a win is a win, and when you can equip your LDoN Charm Augment, it will be maxed stats and very sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm probably going to do LDoN here and there. Not going to grind it to hell though. I'm not a huge fan of the dungeons.<br />
<br />
But I will try for that Anger III augment, it looks nice!<br />
<br />
Around level 51 is when I'll really start grinding LDoN for that nice elemental type armor.<br />
<br />
Still, I'm weird... I like to try to compete for agro. I did play a Paladin afterall. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want some augs do some Takish and some Everfrost adventures.  Anger augs are 510 for anger 2 and 1150(?) for anger 3.  Plus at lvl 58 im only scoring around 20-30 points an adventure so unless u plan on adventuring every single minute of ur life 51+ i doubt u will be able to score some ornate quality stuff from LDoN.  The points are slow until lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to last me for a while I'll be buying Fierce Heraldic armor. Which is pretty good if I do say so myself. :)<br />
<br />
But going to wait untill level 40... Crusty should work untill then.</div></div><hr />
