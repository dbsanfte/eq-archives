<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here's my problem...<br />
<br />
Wielding Norge`Tal. Base damage 53. Damage Bonus 47.<br />
<br />
Max Critical Hit: 587.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike should add 4 times base damage to any hit, according to the perceived interpretation of the Discipline description.<br />
<br />
So max Crit with Norge`Tal should be 799.<br />
<br />
Now I normally save my Fellstrike discipline for times when I am not even remotely likely to need Defensive or Evasive and I go berserk, in the hope of a huge Crippling Blow. Today I was annoyed at someone and just decided to pop it for fun. I was at max health and not tanking.<br />
<br />
What happened? <br />
<br />
I hit for 1119 damage!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How on earth does this work out? The only thing I can think of is the wording of the Fellstrike discipline, which says that it ensure's every blow will land for &quot;At least 4 times the base damage of the weapon&quot;. Perhaps in exceptional circumstances, i.e. the RNG is very kind to you, it does a lot more?<br />
<br />
Nothing else can explain it surely? I hit for my max crit normally plus TEN times base damage and 2 points over that.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Just to add something else... notice that the crit is awfully close to my max_crit + (max_crit - damage bonus), which would be 1127 damage.</div></div><hr />

I think it depends on the ac of the mob, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobbo</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you talking a 1119 crip, or a 1119 crit?<br />
<br />
I dont use fellstrike much, and when I do I never get good crips, but I do use a Norge'tal and the highest crip I have ever gotten was 968 or so - this was no disc.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to the original question - I think the 4x base damage is added before the crit/crip multiplier is used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fellstrike is double damage on all hits (before damage bonus) with a 4X weapon damage min hit.<br />
<br />
Just to spout out numbers:<br />
<br />
10 damage weapon hits for say 60 damage max normally, with 10 of that being damage bonus<br />
<br />
Min hit is 11 (1 + 10 bonus) and max hit is (50 + 10 bonus) 60<br />
<br />
with fellstrike<br />
<br />
Min hit is 40 (4x10 damage wep)<br />
Max hit is 2X50 + 10 bonus = 110<br />
<br />
Without fellstrike you might hit for<br />
11<br />
23<br />
40<br />
20<br />
17<br />
60<br />
<br />
With fellstrike, those same hits would be<br />
11-10=1, 1X2 + 10 = 12, less than 40 so you hit for 40<br />
23-10=13, 2X13 + 10 = 36, less than 40 so you hit for 40<br />
40-10=30, 30X2 + 10 = 70. greater than 40 so you hit for 70<br />
20-10=10, 2X10 + 10 = 30, less than 40 so you hit for 40<br />
17-10=7, 2x7 + 10 = 24, less than 40 so you hit for 40<br />
60-10=50, 2x50 + 10 = 110,. greater than 40 so you hit for 110<br />
<br />
11<br />
23<br />
40<br />
20<br />
17<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I awlays understood it,Fellstrike was an extra Damage bonus,IE you have a 50 damage wep so you swing it get your normal hit then 200(50X4) is added to the hit ,so if you swing and hit for 200 with disc active your hit would be 400....<br />
<br />
I hit for a max of 480 Crit with a 43 Damage 2 hander,and a max of 294 with a normal swing.With fellstrike active ( I rarely ever use this disc) I hit in the mid 400's and crit up in the 700's to 800's.. <br />
<br />
The use of the disc is pretty clear under normal circumstances,it is when you apply Crits and Crips to it that it starts to become a little more cloudy,The above explantation is very confusing to me to say the least...<br />
<br />
Crits are basically 75% more of whatever the hit was <br />
<br />
Crips are basically 130% more of whatever the hit was</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats how its described in some places, but thats not what it does.  It simply doubles your damage pre-damage bonus and limits the min to 4X base wep damage.<br />
<br />
There is no way you could get a 1802 crip with a 53 damage weapon without it doubling the damage, and I and others have screenshots of that one.<br />
<br />
Normal max hit at 60 (when I got my 1802) was 341.  About 40 of that was damage bonus, so 300 damage.  Max Crip without disc is around 940, so a crippling blow is about a multiplier of 3X.<br />
<br />
If max crip without fellstrike is about 940, and max crip with fellstrike is 1859, then obviously fellstrike isnt just adding 4X53 to the total, its doubling the damage before the damage bonus is applied.<br />
<br />
Even if you say, normal max hit is 341, add in 4X53 and thats 553, multiply that X3 for cripple and your at 1659, still 200 damage short.<br />
<br />
It doubles your damage before damage bonus and limits your minimum hit to 4x base weapon damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a 1119 Crit, and it must be some doubling affect going on. Its the only logic to it. Its just the first time I have ever seen anything more than roughly normal_Max+4*Base_Damage.<br />
<br />
Would love to get lucky one day and see a Cripple with this doubling going on. 2k+???</div></div><hr />
