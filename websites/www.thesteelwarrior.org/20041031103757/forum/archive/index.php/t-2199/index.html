<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nyyhte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 45 de war and am currently wielding a defiance and a centi ss. I like the look of my swords graphics matching. (I know I'm an appearance freak). My problem is I'm not sure if I'm getting the most out of my weapons. Is there a sword to go with my defiance that would look good and better than my css? I am a speed freak and thats why I like my defiance (19 delay I believe). Or should I look at some other swords entirely? I've used a cent ls but it looks kinda big on me. I know I'm going to get flamed about worrying about my appearance but I would like y'alls thougts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would get a frosty for your main hand it holds aggro way better than just two straight DPS weapons.  I would keep the defiance for your offhand or get a lammy.  That is my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wavecrasher, 9/19 with a 25% slow proc, VERY nice for aggro.  AND I believe it looks like a defiance when weilded.  <br />
<br />
I used one up until I got 60 and a Willsapper on the same night, that was Pre-PoP btw, but still should be very good for you're level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wavecrasher graphic is different than Defiance, it looks like a longsword with a hook at the very end. While I love the WC and all, for the most part you are better with a Frostbringer for performance vs. cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get two Tae Ew Longswords. They look like a Bloodfrenzies... 12/20 ratio and 50 hp. Non-lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tae Ew Longswords are damn nice blades, look alot like a gladius when equipped; although sometimes holding aggro with them can be a pain....usually when the casters forget you're not wielding dual EB weapons and just lose their minds chain casting.....which sadly happens alot these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">doh, totally forgot what WC looked like.  Haven't seen someone with one in a long time.  I knew it didn't look anything like it does on Inventory screen, and that disappoints me, I love the look of the CSS (Crystalline Short Sword).  Oh well, my bad.</div></div><hr />
