<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there...i play on Pinnacle server in CoH and was looking for a big group of people to play with.  I have been in other supergroups before but they are not that good and most of the time it is just me logged in.  Do you all play on one server?  How many play and at what times and how many are on at those times?  What level are you all? Give me the low down :)<br />

either him or i will update it again this weekend or so; have had some new additions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Epoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How come your guild is in different servers? And how much do you all play?  I am looking for a supergroup to join that plays the game ever night and not log in once per week or so :P</div></div><hr />

  We're actually a warrior community, not a guild. There are far, far, FAR too many of us to fit in a guild. We're spread out across every EQ server. That, and, uh, we're all warriors. We'd make one super shitty guild.</div></div><hr />

i saw a zerg rush (kinda) in perez last night; it was hilarious..on the AP zone in side  there was a line of blasters; and than this small group of tankers would grab as many CoT mobs out of the woods; round them up conestoga style like the old west...than the blasters would come in and tear them to pieces.<br />
the few mages that exploded was funny..always a few tankers would be left dead on the ground when it was all said and done.</div></div><hr />
