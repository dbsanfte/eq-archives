<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've landed a few PP, and I'm planning to buy some items to upgrade. I hate for this to be another &quot;look at my magelo pls and tell me what to do&quot; type thread, but I'm not too clear whether this plan will be a good one, and I don't want to waste money buying items I don't need. Any help would be greatly appreciated! <br />
<br />
What I plan on getting, in order: <br />
<br />
1. Greatstaff of Thunder - for aggro <br />
2. Truncheon of Doom - for slow <br />
3. Mosquito Leg Earring - HP +65<br />
4. Thurg BP MQ - HP +50 and Clicky Heal <br />
5. Cloak of Flames - HP +50<br />
6. Blood Runed Gaunts or Thurg MQ - HP +40<br />
7. Incaradine BP - Invis <br />
8. Racial legs- HP <br />
9. Forged Shoulderpads - HP <br />
10. Yaks - 1h aggro <br />
<br />
Is this a good plan??</div></div><hr />

This makes me sad, irl :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
 As for the HP, I think the +50 is the amount gained from his current cultural BP(40).<br />
<br />
 As for the entire list, I'd personally move Incarn BP up the list. I took way way too long to get mine, and after i did I couldn't believe I'd gone so long without it. And I'd look into a Spiked Sonic Wolf Collar (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=2599). Should be campable by you solo easily in Hollowshade. Assuming the sonic wolves are up. Just hug the right coming out of Paludal to the tents, Scarflank is in the one closest to the wall. Kill him a bunch and it will drop eventually. 10min respawn.</div></div><hr />

i hated keeping slots for invis potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty good list...but it depends really on lvl and what your role normally is (xp grind or raid MT)<br />
<br />
As far as incard BP, sure its nice for clickie, but only if you kill king and get to loot IMO. This is especially true if you are getting thurg anyway cause its not like you'll wear it. Instead I just buy larrikan masks (10 charge) for about 150p each...I rarely have to use invis.<br />

Add in the fact that gather shadows seems to last a lot longer than &quot;invisibility&quot;.  Of course, I also keep 2 invis potions on me, in case I need instant invis.<br />
<br />
If you're buying MQ's, try to get SS plate gaunts, those are some of the best gloves you will ever see.<br />
<br />
One other thing, I like to keep a tash stick on me, though I don't use it much, it's cheap and can help if you need your ToD to proc on a high mr mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You obviously have a lot of cash to play with.  Therefor I would look at Skyshrine MQ's of guants and BP.  The guants from SS blow away the Thurg ones and you should be able to afford it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The list is pretty complete although some things can changed depending on what is available to you.<br />
<br />
1. GSOT for 2h agro - droppable yes, no drop gear tons better<br />
2. TOD - the win everytime!<br />
3. Mosquito leg earring - Iron Scream earring, Bloodmetal earring of Engagement and Tear of the Rainmaker all much better.<br />
4. Thurg BP - any Velious BP or Shroud of Vigor from VT for the heal<br />
5. COF - solid haste for tradable gear<br />
6.  Blood runed or Thurg Gaunts - disagree on this to begin with but if we are talking Velious gear then yes SS gaunts are the best choice.<br />
7.  Incarnadine BP - replace with Cobalt Legs or Cloudy Steel Mask from VT (Both targetable invis so not only you but that cleric/pally in group is safe now to)<br />
8. Racial legs - Agree untill Farwater armor becomes more available then I would say those if we talkin droppable gear.<br />
9.  Shouldars anything with 50+ hp is a good goal, the Dragonwing mantles arent bad<br />
10. Yaks - would definately replace that with BoC/any weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have the money, I'd get a cowl of mortality+cloak of pernicity after the staff.  It's a bunch of hitpoints, and you also gain 25 strength, so you can switch out the bracers for cultural later.<br />
<br />
I would put a heal bp in front of a hp earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam3</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">don t take incarnadine BP, take cobalt leg and use them instead of buying racial :b so you will use less money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my messed up server, Cobalt Leggings go for 60k ... that's right, 60k. 20k more than the Cobalt breastplate. I thought about using Cobalt Leggings until I checked the price. <br />
<br />
I landed a GREAT deal on a Rubi BP (the new one) so I will hold out until I can get SS for the clicky. I need to work on faction, anyway - Sol B and the Planes have been my home until now, and I'm waiting until 55 to get in a friend's guild that goes to Velious often (since no regular groups go into Kael anymore on my server). <br />
<br />
Cloak of Flames and Mosquito Leg Earring (another great deal here ... couldn't afford engagement or scream) are also now mine. I have just enough PP left to pick up Greatstaff, Truncheon, and Incaradine. I'm going to wait a few levels on SS for the gauntlets also. 90 HP is a big plus! <br />
<br />
As for the dragonwing mantles - the best I found were 14 AC +55 HP. Does a gain of 25 HP justify a loss of 6 AC (which translates to 10+ as far as the actual statistic goes)? Forged Shoulderpads are 40k, way out of my range for justification. <br />
<br />
I'm also thinking about buying some resist gear, which I know nothing about. I'll probably start a new thread asking for assistance on this.</div></div><hr />

You can but enough mana batteries to recharge that thing for years for what it will cost you to get a BP.</div></div><hr />
