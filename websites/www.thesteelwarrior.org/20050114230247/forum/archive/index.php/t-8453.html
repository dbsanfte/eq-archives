I've browsed Allakhazam's some and I'm not seeing much to help, but there are a heck of a lot of different mob types in sol ro tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am fairly certain that just about everything in the zone can drop ornate.  I know that the sentry, protector, mephits, magmem, etc can all drop ornate.</div></div><hr />

I linked the wrong answer.<br />
I will try to find it, but no sware...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much everything drops Ornate, though you'll have to kill tower minis to get BPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even the first roamer at zone in can drop ornate.  However, it seems that ornate drops a little more frequently in the wings.  The trash mobs can drop all pieces except for BP.  You will even get plate pants if you farm the trash for long enough.  My pants came from the staircase camp.  BP's drop from the wing bosses.  They drop 2 items per kill, either of which can be a BP of any type.<br />
<br />
Fun zone, probably the best one in the POP expansion.  Enjoy exploring it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popss</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it has a very long respawn time, we use to clear one of the stairs up, and then hug the wall and camp against the back wall up top, there are plenty of mobs up there to keep yu busy till respawns and is relatively safe, unless your the chanter,,, i sugest bringing 2 tanks along with your slower. any trash drops the ornate,, but if yu stay at the ZI you well run outa mobs close and that makes for very long pulls. exp is between 2  and 3 tics aa per kill,, not as good as poe, but better than BoT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info. :)  We have everything but Saryrn now for sol ro tower flags.  I know we've killed a number of mobs harder than Saryrn but she's such a pain to raid.  We have yet to attempt it as we just recently finally got a tower key for someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you've done everything else for Sol Ro access Saryrn is a pushover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And with Plane of Torment being one of the new &quot;hot spots&quot;  maybe there will be a reason to go to this zone other than to kill Saryrn.  That would be nice, because this zone has the coolest sky that I have seen and the whole vampire castle theme is pretty creepy too.<br />
<br />
With the fairly linear layout though, I don't know how many camping spots there's going to end up being.  Plus, those damn birds cast silence which can be a real pita.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see how people deal with this, if at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trash in Xulz's cave just outside of his chamber is the best spot I've found in srt for molds and is relatively easy to clear and hold.Although,pa farmers and bot armys love this spot as well. :(</div></div><hr />
