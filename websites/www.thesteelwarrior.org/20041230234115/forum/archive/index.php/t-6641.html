I saw this at one of the druid forums and thought it might be useful to some new players or even those that just want to have a reference handy, so I made one for warriros. If you see any errors or have some more specific information you feel I should add then just PM me and I will edit the list. Hope you all enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Go ahead and run with it Lens... I was going to put those in but couldn't find much data on them and I didn't want to just put empty boxes there. As for HTML, I would love to but I am not competent with it. If anyone wants to grab the spreadsheet and convert it over, feel free to run with it. I am not looking for any type of credit, I was just trying to put a useful tool out there for warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it sucks...  Only reason I got through it was my cleric was doing the same progression for innate DA and they were about 6 AA back so I would look at cleric and go WOOT I GET SOMETHING IN 5 AA, ding and get it, NOT look at the fact that it's 16 AA till the next one but look at warrior and think, WOOT!  I GET SOMETHING IN 7 AA! repeat :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to spend 45 AA on packrat!  lol... what the hell were the devs smoking when they came up with some of these AA costs?<br />
<br />
Actually I don't think it was so much smoking something as it was not giving a damn.  With a good chunk of the GoD AAs, they never looked at the ability and the cost and seriously asked, &quot;will anyone buy this AA?&quot;  They just didn't care.  <br />
<br />
The devs sit around the meeting room:<br />
<br />
An_experienced_dev_01 says,<br />
&quot;Okay guys, for each AA skill, where L is the base cost of the first level, additional levels cost L *2, L * 3, L * 4, and L * 5.  There!&quot;<br />
<br />
A_new_dev_01 says, <br />
&quot;But guys, who's going to pay for ANOTHER lung capacity AA?  Who's going to spend 45 AA on Packrat?  Does this make any sense?&quot;<br />
<br />
All other devs say,<br />
&quot;Shut up, newbie!&quot;<br />
<br />
An_experienced_dev_01 says,<br />
&quot;Meeting's over, guys.&quot;  <br />
<br />
All:  &quot;Woohoo!  Time for beer!&quot; :D <br />
<br />
okay, okay, i was bored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks :)<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to know what all of the GoD AAs do though. Some of them say what they do, but we don't seem to have any parses on effects (ie: how much does 1 rank in WA actually increase your proc rate, how exactly does strikethrough increase offhand damage, will swift journey let you run at sow speed, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A minor correction should be made:  <br />
Punishing Blade costs 2/4/6 rather than 3/6/9.<br />
<br />
My other comment is that I don't know where the percentages for flurry are coming from, but it's misleading.  You don't flurry anyways near as often as the notes by the AA suggest.  As I remember, parses show that totally maxed to flurry6 with the PoP ability, you get 3-4% more dps/total swings.  Also Combat Fury 3 does not give you 7% crits.  Even as a warrior where it's added to our innate warrior crit ability, it's not that high.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the spreadsheet though.  I'm using it and added dorky color coordinated cells to indicate which AA I have and which ones I have planned. :)</div></div><hr />
