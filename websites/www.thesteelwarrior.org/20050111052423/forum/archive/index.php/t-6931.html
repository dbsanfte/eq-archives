<br />
My first post here and was wondering where I might be able to take my warrior with a 56 Shaman bot for decent xp. I have been doing the boats in Dulak for the last 3 levels, but that has slowed down quite a bit despite the fact that Dulak is supposed to be a &quot;hot spot&quot; now. I am getting about 1% xp per 3 kills at 54, and though it is steady, easy killing it is too slow for my liking and REALLY boring.<br />
<br />
I would prefer easier to access zones as well. Getting to LoY is a hassle, especially since I live in Europe atm and don't often find porters online during my peak play time.<br />
<br />
Also, though my warrior is fairly twinked out, his gear isn't the greatest atm. I can break 1100AC and around 5500HP with virtue and level 56 shaman buffs. Additionally, my shaman is only level 56 so he doesn't have the big heals yet to make mobs that hit really hard a viable option.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
i can't remember if the xp was really good or if it's just the fun times we had bringing out nostalgia, one way to find out!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My shaman has both of his LoY spells, and Stocism does indeed come in handy.<br />
<br />
I did Velks for a while in my late 40's killing spiders on back wall to get silk threads for shaman's coldain shawl, but I haven't been back since then because the xp for Romtom wasn't so great. That of course could have been due to the level disparity at the time.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried Jaggedpine or CoM yet but will pay the gnolls a visit next time I log on.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also Plane of Innovation is great xp.<br />
<br />
Crypt of Nadox is good xp too if you like LoY.</div></div><hr />
