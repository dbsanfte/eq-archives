There is a fix for warriors being able to get groups and it already exists. Simply keep your health at more than one bub of life and less than 2. While bezerk you will take substantially less damage and your dps will go up with crazy crippling blows. Far as aggro goes, when your life bar is that low you could hold aggro with a cracked staff. Once people see this being done warriors will be proclaimed as Gods and there will be a cry across the land for the need of a nerf. <br />
Grant it there is no room for any suck factor in doing this, however, stop asking for more when you dont even use what ya have. A warrior with high end luclin and velious gear (7500+hps)could do this easily on easy ldon missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I 2 box I stay berserk at ~30%, fun for big crips when fellstrike pops. Plus my cleric can't ever get agro :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Either the knight that wrote that was on some sort of drug, making a joke, or he should be dragged out into the street, beaten to an inch of life, then shot after his injuries we painfully healed up.  <br />

I do remember doing that when I was like lvl 25, and we had a warrior in our group with Aego, the good days.  It's also crazy to see a warrior hit Furious when he's in beserk with a 2hander, and the mob's slow has worn off, holy shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried that on RZ in PoTime when I hit low health once and wasn't going to get a heal. He wasn't amused :D.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have done that w/ my little war a few times in the past, and even a few times recently while soloing in VL.  Toss on the old Fabled Exe Axe, grab 2-3 spiders.  Pull em to zone hit Furious, followed by Mighty Strike while I hit Bezerk, and finish off w/ def.  Best cirt so far at 56 was 981 w/ HoS :D</div></div><hr />
