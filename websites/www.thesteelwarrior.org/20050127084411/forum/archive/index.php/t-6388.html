<br />
Does the clicky haste on Kizrak's Gauntlets of Battle (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18000) stack with the worn haste of Cloak of Flames (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2190) or do you only get the haste from the higher of the two?<br />
<br />
I am getting conflicting information and wondered if anyone has some definitive info b4 i blow 35k.<br />
<br />
Cheers all</div></div><hr />

<br />
The effect on the gauntlets, however, is useless if you are grouping with an enchanter, a shaman, or a beastlord.  The spell haste from the gauntlets will not stack with spell haste from a player (although it will stack with bard song haste from a bard).<br />
<br />
Three kinds of haste: item or tribute, buff spell, and bard song.  They stack with each other, but never within the same kind of haste.  <br />

Take care,<br />

I was confused as some were saying that even though you get an effect icon when you use them that it was still only a worn haste effect (ie it is not a chanty or bard effect). As such they were saying you can have both but you won't get the combined (in this case 66%) haste effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Original effect on ornate gloves had marvelous visions, which had a sta effect in addition to the haste effect.  They placed the haste portion of the MV effect on a different slot so that the buff would not get overwritten with a higher lvl of haste (ie SoV).  They nerfed the effect to only 30% spell haste but never altered the haste slot, so the icon stays up even though a higher lvl of haste spell is cast on you.</div></div><hr />

Half of them count as spells, half as v3 (stackable with spell) haste.  You can go to Lucy (lucy.allakhazam.com) if you are curious about a certain spell.  A few examples - Warsong of Zek (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3374&amp;source=Live) is Spell haste.  Rizlona's Call of Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3362&amp;source=Live) is v3 haste (sometimes called Overhaste, since v3 can go over the haste cap) and will stack with spell haste.</div></div><hr />
