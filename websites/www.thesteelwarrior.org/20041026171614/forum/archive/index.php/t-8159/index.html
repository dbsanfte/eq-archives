Do the math, reclick the disc and see how much time to refresh. Normal disc refresh time - time left to refresh = time to disc end<br />
<br />
Not too hard even without a timer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You realize what the odds are that you're going to check furious at the EXACT same time that it pops up?  If we give a 1second reaction time, assuming you check it randomly the chances of it firing as you hit is is 1:2700 (45min reuse, right?  If its 48min, its 1:2880)<br />
<br />
Okay, yes, people are more likely to check it when it has 5mins left than when it has 35minutes left...but come on.  How many times has that actually happened to you?  It's only happened to me ONCE since they implemented the new disc system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you want some cheese to go with your whine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a different problem because of a bug, that means my likelyhood is actually quite good that it is up.  The problem is that my timers don't really keep track right, ie my defensive button pops up but if I click it again it actually tells me that it has time left (this happens when I zone generally, defensive will think it's ready to go but it's not really), same thing happens with furious except instead of popping up it thinks it has like 10 minutes before I can use it, when I just used it (and zoned).<br />
<br />
Anyhow anyone know if ducking will really keep you from using a disc if you click while ducked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dunno... login, duck and click defensive?  I know this means you'll possilby not be able to use defensive for a whole 10 minutes, but I guess you'll have to cope somehow. <br />
<br />
Got a clock on your screen?  Maybe tap on the disc button twice when you activate it and roughly add the time the game tells you in white letters to the time on the clock?  You may have to carry a digit there, so keep a calculator handy.  <br />
<br />
Never seen the bug with the button showing ready while disc not being ready tho.  Something to do with your UI maybe?  <br />
<br />
Is it just me or have many things have just become TOOO easy in the game?  The buff timer is convenient, I'm not sure its really a good thing.  Having buffs drop at bad times is part of the game.  Having to actually think a little to keep track of when your disc is back up is too.  Just... (this thread in outhouse? yes.) fucking deal with it.  Go start a paladin you sook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ya, am at work atm so if nobody says anything I guess I'll try that (the reason I didn't want to do that is that most likely raids will start before my furious has refreshed /= )<br />
<br />
No clock or anything but I suppose I could try to find one of those ui things with one, and I'm just using the default ui + custom buff box and player box, so not much with my ui to mess it up, other ppl in my guild have had the same problem though off and on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My friend was complaining about the disc thing when I realized it was his UI.  His after you use discs doesn't even stay indented or show a time to reuse on it you just have to guess the intervals of time you used them at.  Download a new UI that when you click it shows the time till reuse.  Then if you complain that you may accidental trigger it right as it refreshes you're just being way too critical cause the possibility of that happen is very small.  I've never had that happen to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is it really that hard to do? I just click the button again and it clearly says what the time until it refreshes is.  Though I'm using the default combat window, so my buttons stay down when they're not ready for use.

I think the Time remaining on buffs is a cool idea, it's useful to know when to rebuff instead of waiting till the buffs fade, what's your problem with it? That your GL ability does the same? Someone already said here your GL ability works for the entire group, while this thing works just for you, so your point is dull. Stop trying to find something to whine about everytime they put a patch up, you can know how long you have till the disc pops up again already, I NEVER had that 1-in-a-thousand click as it refreshed, stop saying &quot;it triggers the discipline if I try to check it&quot; cause the chance is FREAKING LOW, it can happen once! and like someone else said &quot;is part of the game&quot;, if you cant keep up with..uh... 3 timers that are more or less the same, how do you deal with the pression of MTing and trying to coordinate people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You forgot to mention the fact that seeing the timer on buffs completely destroys the use of &quot;Inspect Buffs&quot; level 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright, hopefully everyone saw and read that this time.  I have this same bug and it's frigging irritating to go into a fight being the SA because you think your furious is up, then the MA goes down and you get aggro and BOOM no furious and dead warrior.<br />
<br />
It's also irritating when you have a cleric that is half asleep and lets you get to low for comfort so instead of backing up you go to pop furious and .... uh oh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah and I'm saying it could very likely  be your UI.  The default disc window works correctly along with some other nice mods but some don't work where they don't stay indented when down.</div></div><hr />

All my discs go off just fine when I duck and click the button. Just tested it to make sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks Wolveren and Buuhmann (=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you wanna put big fancy letters, go ahead, but his original rant was not about his UI having problems.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I have no problems with the default UI, never seen the button jammed or popping up when the disc was not ready, if you are using the default UI (not just 1 window, but the entire UI, with no add ons at all) and you are expecting this problem, I would advice you to /bug it and post on the EQ Forums reporting the bug or send an email to the Bug report address (cant recall it for the life of me, but they fixed bugs that I reported there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">No his orginal rant was because the /disc functionality, which was in the game for YEARS, was not carried forward when they did the discs revamp instead forcing players  to rely on a UI click to give you what a keyboard command used to.  This is not a minor issue for peeps who use the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Just because you dont use the UI a particular way doesnt mean someone else is wrong in asking for what was existing functionality back.  It has value to some folks who use the keyboard over the UI...actually its hella faster than the UI once you get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The /disc functionality worked because there was 1 timer, you cant expect to type /disc now when you have 4 different timers, its not logical, which timer would you get the report on? Do you want a spamming text to pop up saying the remaining times on all the timers? If you do, then I dont understand why people complain about the TM spam, it would be the same, but you would trigger your own spam.<br />
<br />
If you want a keyboard command, you should have 4 in this case, so now, you have 4 comands to check your timers, I still think its easier to watch the grey box and see if it pops. I dont see how your fingers are faster than your eyes, and I use the UI with a video resolution of 1024x768, and the Combat Abilities pop up doesnt even bother, dont tell me you dont have it up because it takes up space.<br />
<br />
So there, you can have the lil window up and use your eyes to check the timer, not really hard. Instead, you whine because you want a command you can type and a) Spam your chatbox with at least 4 lines of text everytime you type it or b) 4 different commands to check each of the timers.<br />
<br />
Btw, you dont have to click the button to know whats the remaining time, I hardly use the mouse either, but I can still check the remaining times on the timer, how? use your keyboard, my combat abilities are keyed to use with CTRL + #, not so hard and actually its faster than typing /disc! And OMG you can hotkey your discipline and use it on the Hot banks! And use a Numeral key to check if its up! You have to press 1 key! and you know whats the remaining time!<br />
So, what were you whining about again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If you could do what you just said but without the chance of activating it then people wouldn't care, but you can't, there in lies the problem.  <br />
<br />
The chance is actually much higher than you think, the reason is that it's on a per warrior basis and if you have 4-5 warriors you now have multiplied the chance that one of them may activate it when the Class leader asks if you will have defensive up in case the current tank falls.<br />
<br />
Combined with the fact that it is buggy and doesn't always pop at the correct time makes the whole thing rather crappy.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why it's such a big deal for you all that people would like their old functionality back?  If you don't use it then how is it going to make things any worse for you that someone else can use it (if it was fixed/corrected)???  It's like yelling at someone because they ask for the maintenance people to fix their apt, why the heck do you even care if it doesn't affect you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't understand why it's such a big deal for you all that people would like their old functionality back?

It's like yelling at someone because they ask for the maintenance people to fix their apt, why the heck do you even care if it doesn't affect you?<br />
<br />
Tell me HOW can you implement the old functionality back, like I said on the previous post, you have 4 timers, and 2 choices to use a command line, now, tell me which is your idea of implementation.<br />
<br />
Now, compare your idea of implementation with the current state, which is easier? Looking at a grey button (which by the way, I've never seen it bugged, and like I said in another post if the button is bugged, /bug it, its an UI problem, not a problem on the logic of the solution implemented) or typing 4 different commands for each timer?<br />
<br />
You know why I care? Because I rather see programmers focus on more important things than how to implement something that there is no need of . And I post here because Im tired of people whining about new game enhacements that are very useful, but because they didnt &quot;fix&quot; the thing they wanted, they feel they need to rant and whine.<br />
<br />
Do you use /attack to turn on autoattack? No, prolly you press 1 key. Why do you want to type /disc#oftimer or whatever other command, if you can check the timer with one key? See? Thats a waste of developing time. Yes, Im a programmer, and I get really irritated when a user tells me he wants to &quot;go around the lake when he can cross it with one step&quot;.<br />
<br />
On a last note, the possibility that you press the button the EXACT same second it pops up, it has been stated already, (think it was around 2% for a 45 reuse time disc), the chances that 4-5 warriors (your example), do the same thing, one after the other is...0.00000032%<br />
<br />
How many times did it happen to you? And how many times, during that long period of time, did you click on that Discipline to check the timer? Now, do your math, #ocurrences/#clicks, and I bet it doesnt get to 1%. It never happened to me. And I bet more than one is just speaking what someone else said and it never happened to them either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe if you didn't suck you could use commands too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">And your math is the suck too, first of all you have a 10 minute disc that your checking (def duh)  2nd of all as has been mentioned your not going to check until it's friggin close to time either so in other words probably 60 to 30 seconds left.  So 1 war has a 1 in 60 chance of hitting it per check, let say he check oh I dunno 5 times, now 1 war has a 1 in 12 chance of activating his time...  Now say you have 5 wars hmm so that means you've got a 5 / 12 chance that someone hits the button at the wrong time... or slightly under a 50pct chance.  <br />
<br />
Think before you speak and then don't speak at all because you suck k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Gryz, that was a horrible set of posts. You managed to come off seeming rather pissed off and stupid all at the same time. You are a developer, you say. Have you ever tried working on code that's been around for 6 years and has gone through untold amounts of revision and expansion? Why do you think things randomly get broken in a patch? There is no surefire 10 minute coding solution to this. There is a very large chance that a change would break something, somewhere. To spout off that &quot;I'm a programmer, and it would take friggin 10 minutes or less to put that in there. This is not something that's hard at all sheesh.&quot; is to announce to the world that you're an egotistical asshole who really doesn't know shit.<br />
<br />
  Then you claim &quot;And your math is the suck too&quot;... and to back it up, you make up all sorts of numbers. Wow. That's... uh... &quot;special&quot;. Refuting made up numbers with made up numbers. Nice going. I'm going to continue this trend by announcing that there an average warrior clicks their discipline 2.3 times per 3 second time frame, and starts exactly 96 seconds before their discipline refreshes. That's 73.6 times! They could EASILY trigger their discipline like that! See how it works? I could even change the numbers to 4.6 times per 2.8 seconds over 84 seconds and &quot;show&quot; that the average warrior clicks their button 128 times in that last minute and a half!<br />
<br />
  Seriously. Don't make stupid points to &quot;prove&quot; people wrong. You'll fail, and then people like me will mock you for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yes I have worked on 6 year+ old code that people who wrote have been long gone, but seriously there's a timer there already you know there is because you can click the button and get a message.  All it would take is to make 4 functions that does the same thing as that button but leaves off the activating of the disc, and then make 4 additions to the command line switch statement, that literally should take like 10 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Yes I am pissed that people try to make such a big deal out of fixing something, my numbers weren't to say this is how it is either it was to say this is how it could be, and their just as valid as those other numbers (which is basically none true, but for those people that want to throw unfounded numbers around and claim crap there's another set of unfounded numbers to refute theirs)<br />
<br />
Anyhow either way they should fix the ui so it doesn't pop up when it's not really ready (my suspicion is that the server has a timer and the client has a timer and upon zoning the ui goes with the clients timer instead of the servers timer which is why you get funky stuff (because if your computer's timer isn't in sync with the servers then doing that screws stuff up))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My math sucks? Ok, mister, two words for you: Bernoulli Experiment. Look it up on a Probability book.<br />
<br />
Since you probably wont, Im gonna make it short, its a formula that lets you calculate the probability of an experiment (warrior pressing the button *just* when the discipline popped) to succeed.<br />
<br />
From that, Probability Math comes with what it's called Binomial Distribution (or something like that, Im translating from Spanish, so bare with it), that lets you calculate the probability of N out of X Bernoulli Experiments to succeed one right after the other. This means, N out of X warriors pressing the button just when it popped, each one independantly from the other. In this case I calculated 5 out of 5 warriors doing it, meaning, that from a lot of 5 warriors, all succeded the experiment (pressed the button at the popping time), one after the other happened.<br />
<br />
They are not made up numbers, if you want me to post the formula to do it, please do so, but it would be de-railing from the main topic. I just posted this to prove you wrong, and now, your numbers are the only ones meaningless.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay, I was busy on my vacation week in Greece :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">greece is a fun place<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, through much thinking i have thought up this quick fix if you happened to hit a disc right as it popped up:<br />
<br />
1. stop crying about something that almost never happens<br />
<br />
2. tell your raid you're a moron<br />
<br />
3. make your SA tank it<br />
<br />
now, if you want to just avoid all that, use some of that math you learned in first grade to figure the approximate time yourself. taking 5 seconds to do simple mental math &gt; waiting for you disc to repop.<br />
<br />
oh and,<br />
 my friggin asssist button is /assist &lt;person&gt; /attack off that way if your assist changes targets you don't break mez before he does.<br />
there is a real command that makes it so you dont attack when you assist, /assist off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Svan is right, you can toggle the Autoattack-after-Assist function off, I have it off, so when I /assist anyone, I dont Autoattack the target.<br />

You are already using a disc! Means its up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Guess you don't do much PoEarth rings where the mob doesn't die before the next assist happens, or did you not realize that hitting assist again does not turn off attack if its on, even with the autoattack off.  Just proving how retarded you two are.<br />
<br />
And yes your math sux because your applying a formula that does not apply, oh big deal that you found some random formula for calculating probabilities that people will randomly push the buttons, if you could freaking read and think for yourself that is not the case we have, warriors are NOT RANDOMLY pushing their buttons, well at least our warriors, maybe your some moron who just randomly pushes his buttons.  <br />
<br />
I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's not equally likely for someone to push the button again right after they finished their disc as opposed to when it's close to time for the disc to be ready to use again, if you can't figure that out then maybe you should just keep your mouth shut.</div></div><hr />

From then on, never worry about attack again. It will ALWAYS be off when you assist. Unless, yes, as you pointed out your previous target is still alive.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">You must be doing some new rings I don't know about. The stonegrabbers are the only ones that have a mob that does not die outright (4 of them) and by time assist is called on the next, well, it's time to attack anyway. They only come one at a time, those ones. Mabey you should try going crack free for a day and check your superior attitude at the door. You're not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">heh, what I wanna btich about is how raid mark npc and delegate raid mark npc are fucked up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of getting 2 marks, you have the person who has raid mark npc always overwrites the person who has delegate, sony is lazy and instead of adding 2 marks your spending 6 raid leader points (hard as fuck to gain) on a useless skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">That'd be the door you checked yours at right?  I'm so sorry I shouldn't have made a hotkey to help in an event, you are so right of course.  I'm glad you find it worth your time to flame someone over making a hotkey on a thread about fixing the /disc to have the functionaltiy they once had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">If you have to click defensive 5 times in the last 30 to 60 seconds you are a true moron. Click it once. It tells you you have (for example) 40 seconds left. There's this thing, with 3 hands, called a clock. Watch the long skinny one. When it clicks 40 times, your disc is up, and you didn't blow it. Congratulations, you beat teh game!!1!one1!<br />
<br />
<br />
edit~ if you don't know what a clock is, type /time right after you hit your disc. add 40 seconds to the time (might involve some complicated math if you have to add a minute!), then instead of spam-clicking your disc, type /time every once in a while until 40 seconds is up.</div></div><hr />
