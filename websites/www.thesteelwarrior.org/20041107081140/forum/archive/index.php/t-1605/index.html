<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so Saturday night I really started out with great intentions to go find a decent group in the Planes. At level 51 was not as difficult as I thought it may be. Got a nice group in POJ and hung out there for an hour. The group broke up and the cleric and myself head over to POD. Wow I am thinking this is gonna be great.<br />
So we get a nice group goin 53 Cleric, 60 Chanter (friend), 54 Shaman,56 Rogue, 55 Ranger and Myself 51 warrior. All buffed all setup ready to pull.<br />
<br />
   I am nominated to pull. ok make sense let rock. One pull quick kill. Second pull got a spider the bastard is running all around , got him under control and start tankin away at him. Of course I lose aggro (shrug) figured the rogue had it on em. Wait no that the ranger ahhh shit he is at 40 Cleric hits him with a quick CH, Whew ok no harm no foul. As soon as the spider is down the stupid Fookin piece of work starts tearing into me about how I need to taunt How I need to keep aggro. Why can I not keep the mob off him. What kind of warrior am I. Ok so the blood starts to boil the foam starts to seeps up into the side of my lips as my fingers start to type in the most horedous of statement that one could make to a ranger and then...........................<br />
       I erased it all and simply told the group  that I will find another group and thank you. <br />
      Then it happened, the one thing I thought I would never see. <br />
Cleric says, &quot;Wait&quot; <br />
Ranger has been removed from your group. <br />
Cleric Says, &quot;I never liked him anyway.&quot; <br />
   Finally I was asked to stay in a group  in a Pop zone. I felt reallly grateful that night to that cleric and just wanted to take a second to share with ya. <br />
 On a side note there was nothing sweeter then to watch that TOOL of a ranger walk off by himself.<br />
<br />
  Thanks Meface</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rangers are a real &quot;Jeckyl and Hyde&quot; class.  <br />
<br />
A well-played ranger is a tremendous asset, either in a raid or an exp group.  A poorly played ranger is an evil with no equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's good to see things like that happen.  I've said this before, but it seems that too often things that used to be grounds for getting kicked out of a group (i.e., consistently pulling aggro off the warrior), have become so commonplace that now most of the time rather than get mad at the moron that pulled aggro, people get mad at the warrior.  It's good to know that some people still have the sense to see that aggro management is the job of the high aggro class, not the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emeralde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/cheer! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharvana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree with Sangriovese<br />
<br />
I have seen some truly kick-ass well played rangers and some really bad ones.<br />
<br />
I have also heard from some other boards that in PoP, that holding aggro is harding for warriors vs palis or sk's but nothing about rangers doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lol, the ranger was a jackass--honestly, I still have a a hard time keeping aggro off me when grouped with a lower level warrior but I didn't get PO'd about it.<br />
<br />
Grim<br />
62 Ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thats just it I was the last person to believe I would be able to hold aggro off anyone in the group. I was the low man at 51 and I knew I would not be able to hold aggro as if the group were on a level playing field. This was not in anyway directed towards rangers, It is more directed to the DPS classes that think Taunt will magically stop the mob from hittim them. I am just glad that it worked out the way it did. On a side note I play with a 58 ranger who is a RL friend and his favorite macro when it is me and him is, <br />
&quot;Meface the %T is gonna smack ya in 3..2...1..&quot;<br />
<br />
I think he loves that dam spell. Hehe anyway enough rambling from me Take care.<br />
