<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylexis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking to raise my resists without destroying my gear, the off hand is an obvious problem, but is switched out on fights with casters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zeeko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some questions for you:<br />
1. Do you *really* want to worry about this before 65th and the upgrades that you'll make along the way?<br />
2. Are you looking for swap-in type of equipment, or day-to-day stuff that you can upgrade to?<br />
3. LDON augs help once you get equipment that you'll keep.<br />
4. LDON/Ornate equip has decent starting resists and you would benefit from a few of those pieces.<br />
5. Rings, upgrade yours, valorium or steel resilience would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless you are looking for resist gear for AE fights when raiding, I would not worry so much about your resists.  I'd focus on getting levels and hitpoints, first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sylexis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, should have explained a bit.<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 65 main, this is my alt, (untwinked as the main is on another server), if you notice her gear is mostly chain, and rp'd as such, I am not taking this char above 55, and she has been 55 for a bit now, working on nd'3 and other such.<br />
<br />
Looking for day to day augments and wearable equipment to bring my resists up, I have 2 rings I am working on now, (valor ring, and signet of war) as well as epic and other quests: loyalist shield for a back slot, Gem of war quest, and strength of the elements.<br />
<br />
I am just wondering what I am passing over pre raid loot that can bring her resists up without taking even more dex and agi than I already have.<br />
<br />
Its a tough one, i know, thats why i asked here ;)</div></div><hr />
