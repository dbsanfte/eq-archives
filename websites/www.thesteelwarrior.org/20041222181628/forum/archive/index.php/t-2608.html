<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was playing around with Magelo last night, looking at how I can increase my hp, and found an interesting thing: if I stopped levelling at 57 and got nd3, my hp would jump to ~4400-4500 unbuffed, which is quite close to where my hp would be at 65 if I had NO aa at all.<br />
<br />
Now, everything inside me screams not to do aa before at least level 62, but yet... Would it be completely retarded to get nd3 before hitting tier 2 planes? It would certainly make the trip to 65 a lot more enjoyable, and since this char is an alt I know how amazingly fast 60-65 is even in tier2 anyway.<br />
<br />
It's only 15aa. Looks tempting. Levels&gt;aa, I know, but... any thoughts?<br />
<br />
*** EDIT NM, I was being an idiot. Gonna go level now and stay away from Magelo and aa exp. It puts stupid ideas in my head. ***</div></div><hr />

<br />
AA 60+ goes so much faster than pre 60 its not even funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends what you're killing.<br />
<br />
The level 60's in my guild pull in aa's in about an hour and change in droga.  Takes me around 2.5 hours or so at 65.<br />
<br />
There is no right answer.  Play your toon the way that makes you happy.  If getting ND3 would make you happy, then it's worth it.  Stalwart endurance 3 made me a very happy man, even if it's not what everyone else around here considers the most efficient way of spending my points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was healing a 59 tank in PoS when he dinged 60.  It was painful and I wouldn't have done it if he hadn't been a friend.  When he leveled, he was a whole new tank.  With no gear or buff changes so only the few HPs he got from the level it made a HUGE difference and something that he was barely surviving and I was using all my skill to keep him alive turned into a fun camp.  <br />
<br />
He's now 65 but no other level made a noticeable difference like 60 did.  Others on this board would know the whys - I'm guessing new defensive table but it is a pure gues - but I just know it happened and the difference was amazing.  <br />
<br />
I would highly suggest getting at least 60 before you AA.</div></div><hr />

I had thoughts of doing AAs &quot;pre 60&quot; as well,but talked a freind about it.. I held got to 60 made a big difference..After that i camped the POI Factory did 30AA,went from 60 to 62 and never looked back..The 60 does open up the defense better imo and it feels like a big boost for a warrior as well..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think i had 10% going into aa for awhile at around 52, and once i got about 90% aa to ding,  i went 100% aa for the level and dinged it. Thus i got r3. and kept doing it. At level 56, I completed PoJ trial, gettin an AA, then got my BoT key from PoS, for another aa, so I really only got 3 of my aa's, which i sunk all into R3, and the other 2 i got, i put into natural regen. Has worked wonders. But I do 100% xp now that i have r3. was the only one i really wanted, the rest of them were just a benefit for doing trials/PoP flags. Gonna wait until I am 61 or so before I start putting anything into aa, and then only about 10-20% at most. In the high end planes you still get a % aa every other kill at only about 10% aa. So it works out well in the end.</div></div><hr />

But it is your char, and your money.  Do as you please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzen Whacksem</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done things a bit differently......<br />
<br />
I am only level 54 now, but I took advantage of the blasted level restrictions on Nagafen and Vox to justify what I did.<br />
<br />
After I was within 4% or so of dinging to 53, I moved all xp to aa.  My intention was to stay in 52 long enough to get my red scale from Nagafen, then move xp to ding, then aa again to get Run3.  This is most likely far from being an efficient way to get xp, aa or straight up.<br />
<br />
I don't like mixing the xp ratio, preferring instead to go full out xp or full out aa.  Plus, I enjoy playing in the old world and actually solo as a warrior in my 50's (have just recently dinged to 54).  Ceremonial Iksar chestplate (regen) and an embalmer's skinning knife (free bandages) are wonderful toys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was a bit different for me as i had level 60 and about 17 AA when PoP was released.<br />
But even before PoP i went straight for 60, then went to 23 AA (run 3, regen 3, natural durability 3, AE taunt) then leveled to 65 and finished trial somewhere in level 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its 12 aaxp in arch for ND3 and worth every point. Do it now or do it at 60 is up to you but definately do it.<br />
<br />
Question is do you want/need more hp otw to 60 or can you wait? Only you can answer that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obeareaun</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(has his ENC cast INT/WIS buffs for this post)...<br />
<br />
I think it depends on the situation, actually.  I play an upper level Paladin and a Warrior.  60 is great, but I feel that some of those AA early on are imperative for not only you but others in your guild/groups.  Run3... I feel that it is a necessity, especially if you are the one doing the pulling.  I remember BEFORE I had this ability... I would usually get trashed pulling the MoB back to my group or raid and Clerics would Immediately have to heal me... This would almost immediately pull some of my taunt away from my MoB.  Depending on the amount of damage I had done before I had brought it back to my group/raid (usually between 10 and 25% of it's hitpoints) you can easily have a dead Cleric and noone wants that.  SO I feel that the Run3 is necessary.  The rest can wait for level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes about that level 60 thing I can agree to that. Pre 60 was kinda harsh it seemed tanking in PoV etc. But other day I sat in BoT and went from 0% xp level 59 to level 60. So last night I go get a PoV group at IC. Inside Cave for those who call it different. In 2 hours I was at 51% xp gained. And was only getting cheals every other fight or so. Some fights required a cheal, but majority went down with maybe an SE cast on me. Was completely different pre60 as when i got 2 cheals I was feeling awesome hehe. But now leveling is flying by.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are you XPing in Droga at L 65?<br />
<br />
An AA at L 65 should take less than an hour.  I do agree that if you can't manage this, deleveling is possibly an option.  (/em was feeling evil)<br />
<br />
5 AAs worth of XP make up about a post-60 level.  So, 12 AA is 2.4 levels.<br />
<br />
While gaining HPs is nice, real levels increase HP, hit rate, damage per hit, damage bonus, damage avoidance, damage mitigation, and make you a better person.  ;-)<br />
<br />
Stay at lower levels and AA if your friends, the people you want to group with, are at lower levels.  You can increase your power without greening out the areas where they have a hope in hell of surviving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Care to share the info where you can get an AA 'as a warrior' in a group in less than an hour pre elementals?<br />
If that place exists i havent found it even when grouping with elemental equipped people in tier 2 and 3.<br />
I know of chanter groups with CoD pets pre charm nerf that did get exp close to that or druids charm soloing in PoS if that camp is open but not a regular group with a warrior.<br />
In elementals you can do an AA in less than an hour, I agree, but how many are actually there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim AB</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While gaining HPs is nice, real levels increase HP, hit rate, damage per hit, damage bonus, damage avoidance, damage mitigation, and make you a better person. ;-)<br />
<br />
From a clerics point of view, no.<br />
Higher levels make it easier for the warrior to taunt the mob of others, but the damage mitigation and avoidance are far better with AA skills, than levels and the HPs are the same at level 60 as at level 65.<br />
A level 65 warrior with no or very few AAs will be blacklisted fast if he tries to make it in the highend zones. The 65 warrior will be &quot;forced&quot; to level in the same zones as the 60 warrior which chose AAs over levels, unless he got access to Ornate gear or likewise highend gear.<br />
The highend game is now a fierce competion between the tank classes and level is by far enough to get you a good rep there anymore.<br />
<br />
Get CA2, CS2 and ND3, which would make a healer notice the difference. AE Taunt is nice, but not really something that is a must in XP groups.</div></div><hr />
