<br />
<br />
Currently the Warrior class has a number of problems associated with it.  Unfortunatly there is no one clear cut way you can fix all these problems at once, but if there is a will there is a way.  Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) has several options, they can either take a full long look at the Warrior Class and fix the appropriate areas, or they can ignore the problems, which they have done thus far.  Warriors are the generals on the battlefield, we lead our troops into battle and overcome our foes to the best of our abilities.  <br />
<br />
As a Warrior you are plagued with the realization that any Knight can hold aggro better then you, and have near the same hit points (Equally geared Warrior vs. Shadow Knight / Paladin will have approximatly a 700 Hit Point differance).  There have been people out there that say to simply take away the ability of the Knights ability to hold aggro (usually Stuns for Paladins, and Darkness Line of Spells / Instant Aggro Spells for Shadow Knights) however this isnt the answer that is appropriate.  <br />
<br />
Paladins are noble and filled with honor, they are Gods soldiers, chosen to battle the evil creatures of the world.  Along with the gifts of healing and aiding there friends in buffs, they were given the ability to stun there opponents.  One of the main reasons a Paladin is so respected is because of his or her ability to stop a creatures casting through there stun line.   It would be unfair to take this away from the Paladin class, it's one of there strengths, dont make there inability to cast it a weakness.  Allow the stuns to continue but lower the amount of aggro that is a result of such spells.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights like Paladins do not deserve to have there advantages taken away from them.  Currently Shadow Knights (Using a Two-Hander and Offensive Alternate Advancement Points Maxed) are producing ~ 135 Damage Per Secod with there Spells.  They do the most Damage Per Second out of all the plate wearing classes (Paladins do ~ 110, Warriors ~ 130).  Along with there high damage capabilites is there Darkness, and Instant Aggro spells which aid them in controlling the attention of there opponents.  The answer for Shadow Knights would be to lower the amount of aggro produced from Darkness and there Instant Aggro Spells, perhaps by just 10%. <br />
<br />
Hit Points are perhaps the biggest problem with only the Warrior class.  The simple solution would to be raise % of Hit Points Gained Per Item.  For Example a Breastplate of Speed adds +125 Hit Points, but once its equiped you really gain 146 Hit Points, which is a 116.8% Increase in Hit Points from that Item.  If SOE raised that percentage to make it 125% you would add significant Hit Points to the Warrior class without hindering the other classes.  <br />
<br />
An Example:<br />
<br />
Currently looking at my Magelo Profile (http://www.magelo.com) you will see that I've got a total of 1890 Hit Points gained directly from items.  Assuming the percentage gained from those is actually 116% you will see that those actual 1890 Hit Points added result in 2192 Hit Points.  If it were to be changed to 125% for the Warrior class only, I would add 2362 Hit Points Added.  This for me would be an added 170 Hit Points.  Adding 170 Hit Points to my already buffed Hit Point total of 9,100 Hit Points would be a 1.8% raise in total Hit Points while raid buffed.  <br />
<br />
Damage is another important area in EverQuest, on May 10th 2003 the Developers stated that they would be looking at High End Melee Damage, based on the fact that we are drastically lower then our casting brethren.  This would be a good upgrade because it would allow every melee class an advantage to inch closer to the currently overpowered damage that wizards and magicians can deal out in short periods of time.  While our damage would be spread out over time, it would still be an increase.  With added damage, comes added aggro control, overall a wise move to increase damage for all melee classes.<br />
<br />
Along with our damage dealing capabilities, comes our ability to take damage.  If SOE were to increase the mitigation percentage the warrior class has it would be a great benefit to us.  Have it higher then the Shadow Knights and Paladins, they are 1/4 Caster, 3/4 Tank, make there melee damage, and damage taken become similar to that.<br />
<br />
Alternate Advancement abilities for Warriors only, one of the changes would be to increase the number of ranks Warriors may get for Planar Durability make it 5 Ranks for Warriors, giving warriors an edge for Hit Points over our Knight friends.  The second would be to add a completely new Alternate Advancement under &quot;Class&quot;.  This Alternate Advancement would be called &quot;Taunting Blow&quot;, it would be a passive ability allowing the warrior to land blows to critical areas angering there opponents more then usual.  The percentages even if small would be an added way for warriors to hold aggro. <br />
<br />
Although if all these changes were made the Warrior Class may become unbalanced and to powerful, perhaps several changes would make us closer to what we were designed to be:<br />
