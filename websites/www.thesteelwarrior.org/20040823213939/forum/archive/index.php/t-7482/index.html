<br />
Our epic 2.0 from the handle looks like the sword Aragon gets in lotr 3 with some conan in it. If you look at the drawings of all of them, ours seriously looks the most boring. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It is reminisent of King Theodin's sword with curled tongue Celtic dragon heads facing out rather than horse heads facing in.<br />
<br />
Six dragon heads on the crossguard and ricasso???!!!! And PAISLEY used to handle where the flipped symetrical halves meet in the middle??!!???!!! Let's put it this way - if SoE were to license reproductions of the epics, I certainly wouldn't buy this one.<br />
<br />
The SK sword has the gothic fantasy motif one would expect - nasty looking.<br />
<br />
The Paladin sword is much like the Wilkenson Excalliber sword - very clean and noble looking.<br />
<br />
But it looks to me like they ran out of ideas when they got to Warriors. An ornate ceremonial Zwiehander is the best they could come up with. Not a workman-like hand and a half sword or wraped ricasso 2H Claymore with a dragon headed crossguard and more subtle parrierhaken - essentially a cleanup and improvement of the original epic design. References to the original epic without slavishness would have been reasonable.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will at least cleanup the crossguard design. Six dragon heads and paisley be not very creative.<br />
<br />
It's almost as if new artists are determined to make their mark on EQ and to heck with previous style.<br />
<br />
How's the expression go? puff, puff, pass?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You know what? Screw epic weapons. What I want is an epic BP. I want a unique model for it, tailored to look bad ass on each and every race. I want it to just look dark, evil, and like I actually ripped off the armor off a panzer and wrapped it around my body. I want it to put all other pieces of armor to shame. I want it to proc hate when things hit me to make them want to hit me MORE. I want it to have a damage shield. I want it to have a clicky AE taunt. I want to have to take it off when I'm not MT, because the mere sight of it inspires mobs to rush after me and try to tear me apart. I want it to make me KOS in all cities, in all expansions. I want it to ward off DT; I want it to have a chance of negating any spell cast at me. I want to be able to drop my weapons, run at a mob and make it attack me until it dies. I want it to have enough extra room in the back that my entire group can climb in; screw aggro, they're unreachable in my armor. I want it to inspire green mobs that have no business attacking me anyways to just run away. <br />
<br />
  This is the epic I want.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You can tell the SK epic, its the one that says Bad Mother Fucker on it.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i think it is ok, but it doesnt look like a real or dangerous weapon, it doesnt speak of untame power just below its steel, all the others do.</div></div><hr />

I'm wholeheartedly in favor of the epic bp idea. I want to anger aug my armor goddamnit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Groeder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">epic BP wouldn't be a bad idea, but it would have to be better than a Time / highend GoD BP, which would equate it to be *INSANE* :)  I'd personally like to see a new slot, similar to a head slot for an Ioun Stone-type item (D&amp;D and NeverWinter Nights reference~) and maybe make the Epic 2.0 go there? That way, not only is the gained hp/mana/stats greater, but no-one will have to re-augment items.  And the particle effect could be an animal or some symbol indicitive of the class (Shamans = bear, Ranger = corpse, etc..)<br />

just my 2cp : )</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does look like it's just the one sword though. Doesn't make sense at all. If that's the case it better have a HELL of a low delay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because if it is (and if the developers do it right), then that would mean that those of us who are casual players in family guilds will have epic weapons that are a challenge to get, yet are actually accomplishable by 2 -3 group raid forces in non-elemental gear. The final version of the weapon ought to require full raid forces to complete, just like Epic 1.0 did in its day (and still does, if you're a casual player), and it ought to be appropriately more powerful.<br />
<br />
As for what Epic 2.0 should be --- personally I hope we have just what we get with Epic 1.0: a two hander and two one-handers (gimme a sword and axe!). <br />
<br />
Though Fitemore's BP sounds awfully nice too ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>CleohPatra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">My only concern is the rumors of the Epic 2.0 being for High end guild players. If this is the case then most casual players in family type guilds will be screwed. Personally I would hate for that to happen as my old friends are all still in my first guild on EQ. *shrugs* I don't know. That's just my feelings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A weapon made out of that liquid metal stuff like in the terminator so it could shift it's form into an axe or two swords or a spear or a hammer and each form would have it's own different proc Like a aggro proc or a dd proc or a debuff proc or a buff proc depending on what you were fighting and how you were fighting it.<br />
<br />
That would just own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I like the warrior 2.0 look, always been a fan of swords with long blades and ornate hilts.  I'm just glad it looks like a practical weapon that a warrior would actually be skilled with and not a 50 pound weight that would run stamina as it would be hard to lift for long durations in battle.</div></div><hr />

  Yeah, I was thinking about that too. Especially if they add more melee type immune/resistant mobs... Hell, we're supposed to be the masters of all melee types, aren't we? I'd love if they stayed with that theme.</div></div><hr />

Considering that they said its a Time+ level weapon--lots of warriors (and other classes too) are going to using their epic 1.5s for a LONG, LONG time. <br />
<br />
I hope they are progressive in more than two steps and built to be mudflated in the future. And that the thing is 1h so there is some variation in the way warriors look.</div></div><hr />

If you're not already at the very end game when the quest is put in, by the time you get it it's gonna be obsolete.  That's the fate of any melee based epic.

See - Why I dont quest for gear<br />
Toys yes, but not upgrades.<br />
Clickies are toys, epic is a toy (now) , etc. If they make the epic to continute to be upgradeable EACH EXPANSION, that would show actual foresight.</div></div><hr />
