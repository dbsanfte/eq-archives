<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Correct me of I'm wrong, but I was browsing Lucy, and it appears that Cloak of the Akheva has finally been fixed on test to be like AoTC, even though the devs stated at the last fan faire said they wouldn't fix it?<br />
<br />
If it's true, /cheer SoE, bout time.<br />

On another note, the new AoTC got a few changes too:<br />

<br />
Looks like the devs had a change of heart, looks like neither of those initially stacked with FoS, but got changed so they both now do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If this stays changed, good for SKs.  Guess the devs realized that they can't give all these benefits to one hybrid tank without giving benefits to the other.  (And also realized that their &quot;upgrade&quot; to AotC won't be used since it doesn't stack with Focus)  Here's hoping the changes stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Squeaky wheel, grease, and all that. Maybe if the clerics threaten to cancel their accounts, AoZ and its upgrade will stack as well.</div></div><hr />
