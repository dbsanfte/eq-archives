<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ggak</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering if people could tell me what to upgrade next. I am thinking of getting 2 valorium ring of gallantry or a crimson/fierce heraldic belt as those 2 spots are the ones I think needs the upgrade best. Any suggestions on belt would be nice, or on other things.<br />
<br />
Money is a problem, but not a huge problem. Could probably get 20k or so to spend.<br />
<br />
I am also wondering which weapons to wield for a) dps and b)agro.<br />
<br />
Before you all scream GSoT, look at my lvl and see that its 53 still, which means I cant use it yet. I am going to wield it when I hit 55, but I have to use something in the mean time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would save up for a soulscream belt, which i saw on my server yesterday for 20k.<br />
<br />
I would also look to buy a Solstice earring kit, to upgrade your griffon earring.<br />
<br />
To repalce the hands, either try to buy a MQ for SS hands, or blood runed gauntlets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ggak</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is a solstice earring really good for a warrior? I was planning on saving up for a bloodmetal earring and/or a earring of rage. Don't really know if I am getting 2 of one type or one each so any help on that would be nice.<br />
<br />
Also more suggestions on items for me woul be nice. Have almost decided on a soulscream belt but not sure it its worth 20k to get a 9 % increase in haste.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're worried about cash, I don't see why you'd go after bloodmetal earrings when you can get one solstice + something cheap.  Blood earring of rage isn't that good, solstice owns it in both stats and price.  On my server solstice earring ingredients go for like 4k total which is damn nice for a 5sta 55hp 5fr/cr/mr earring.  Soulscream would definantly be worth it just cause it's better haste and damn nice stats which leaves your glove slot open for like a SS gloves MQ if you could(90raw hp)  The upgrades I'd suggest is keep the jagged bone hoop, get earring of the solstice, soulscream belt, clattering bone necklace, and look for a SS gloves MQ to buy.  Some minor upgrades would be tossing the rock molded wrist for another crimson darkscale or fh bracer, dented kunzar helm(8sta 35hp, goes for cheap on my server like 2-3k) and grimling contraption(5sta 50hp aura of health mask)  If you want an earring to replace the jagged bone hoop I'd look at a mosquito leg earring cause, well at least on my server, mosquito leg earrings are down to 18k if you look around and bloodmetal are at 35k with not that much better of stats.  Another cool upgrade to look at if you ever have some extra money is chokidai hide pauldrons(15sta 55hp), bought those for 15k on my server, pretty nice hp gain, low AC but eh.</div></div><hr />
