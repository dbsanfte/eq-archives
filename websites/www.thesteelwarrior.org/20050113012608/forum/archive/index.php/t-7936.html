<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I try to help out my guilds tanks as much as I can. I spend alot of time reading the boards and try to get a better idea of the numbers so I can give sound advice when I am asked. Recently a paladin inquired about which aa's to do first. The paladin friend got a good shield and a good one hander, so I was trying to see what would be best for him. I noticed the double attack aa work only for 2handers. Started to seem to me that sony wants paladins to be tank/healing/offense in that order. Maybe this is old news to most but just my new impressions.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I started thinking of some general ideas do balance out the needs of the tanks without infringing on the unique design of each. I don't feel warriors need an extra amount of improvement, just the normal every class gets better with a new expansion sort of shit. Although Knights have some specific needs that need to be filled.<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
First I think paladins need 2 new lines of healing spells. Both faster casting but about their ussual mana/hp ratio. One that is heal self only. Just to simplify healing yourself while tanking. A second line of spells that is heal target's target. So a paladin can maintain dps and cast heals when other classes take agro or be a reasonable backup healer choice while still maintaining dps. Which with the laa, hott I can see this adding alot more usefullness to have paladin in a normal group.<br />
<br />
Holy Fortitude : Give paladins a version of fortitude, duration 2 ticks, re-use time 1 hour. I thought fortitude would be better for paladins so it can be used when they are rampage tank. But this should be an aa, that they have to buy.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights<br />
Shadowknights unique spell casting style seems somewhat passed by recently. So think one aspect that should return to shadow knights is that they inpsire fear. So I have 2 ideas for spells. 1: Submit, fast casting mez, with the side effect that the mob sits down and recovers mana faster and regens HP faster, unresestable, re-use time 5 minutes. The idea being that the mob kneels to the shadowknight. 2: Short duration fear/snare spells. 1 tick fear with 95% snare, -300 magic resist or so. BUt with re-use time of 3 minutes or so. A fear that is useful in grouping, but not game breaking. Just something to help with mitigating damage spikes<br />
<br />
Simple spell changes should include faster FD and faster lifetaps. <br />
<br />
Hate's Resilliance: Give shadow knights a furious style disc, duration 2 ticks, re-use time 1 hour. I thought shadow knights should be the more offensive of the 2 two knights thus have autoriposte for building agro and offense, but does not have the advantage of avoiding rampage etc. This wuld be an aa, they have to buy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think with this kinda stuff in mind warriors wouldn't lose there main tank role. Knights get some utility they can use in the high end grouping. Also giving there things to do for when multiple tanks are in the same group. I don't know how are these thoughts to everyone else? I know this is the warrior boards, my thoughts are just that knights have lost the usefullness of some of their high end spell casting, but that can be fixed without needing to nerf/steal defensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silkarn</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see the duration on the /discs raised maybe 4 ticks for pally and 3 for SKs with lower reuse say between 5-8 min for both, but other than that sounds good.<br />
<br />
or even, for SKs only of course<br />
<br />
/disc heresay<br />
<br />
duration 30 seconds, reuse 8 min<br />
15% damage mitigation<br />
15% less DPS<br />
5% of each  individual attack that actually hits the SK is returned to target, this acts as a DS, does not activate Intense hatred.<br />
SK is silenced for duration of /disc<br />
<br />
<br />
IE if mob hits you for 1000 while no disc is up and you hit for 300, with the disc you are hit for 850, you hit fro 255, and the disc (activated DS if you will) hits for 43.<br />
<br />
I see this as something rather SK like, a DS + small mitigation, but not long enough to really long enough to make SK the choice for raid bosses, but nice to drop in if sh*t hits the fan untill another War can get in (if using transitions or what not). The DS scales according to the DMG done, so if the SK gets hit for 3500, yes they get a &quot;free&quot; hit for 175, but how long will any knight last if DBL/Triple/Quad 3500 is incoming? <br />
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NO, they are not defensive. They are just longer reuse time versions of furious and fortitude. Do not bring mitigation discs into this. There are 100 pages of defensive arguements, these are specific ideas, that include spell changes and giving a hour reuse time version of furious to shadowknights, and giving a 1hour reuse to time version of fortitude for paladins.<br />
<br />
For a warrior fortitude stops all melee damage from every angle including ramapage and flurry for 12 seconds, with a resuse time if 40 minutes. MY suggestions was that this be giving to paladins ina form of an aa that has a re use time of 1 hour.<br />
<br />
For a warrior furious makes the char riposte every attack, for 12 seconds with a re-use time of 40 minutes. riposte cannot block rampage or flurry. MY suggestions was that this be giving to shadow knights in a form of an aa that has a re use time of 1 hour.<br />
<br />
I am opposed to any form of defensive being given to knights.</div></div><hr />

I understand the arguments quite well. I respect that this is your thread and thus I will drop my suggestion in this thread. I do wonder why though you would want a longer resue for knights on the discs you suggest though, surely they are not so overpwering as to require a 1 hour reuse for a 12 second disc? What about 3 ticks for SKs, 4 for pallys, 15 min resuse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main reason they should have those discs is because rangers and rogues have one. There is no reason knights shouldn't. But rangers and rogues all have the disc at 72 minues reuse time, which gets droped down to about an hour at 65. So knights should have it at about the same time.<br />
<br />
Warriors have alot of discs and will run out of endurance before useing them all. The only real set back for a knight useing the disc is limited by the reuse time, as there endurance is not used alot.<br />
<br />
If warriors get 2 ticks 40 minute reuse time, there is no reason to make knights better versions of the discs.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure how well monks would like it if SK's had a faster casting FD.  Death's Peace is a 1 sec cast w/ a 1.5 second recast as it is now.  If you were to make it faster casting you would also have to short the recast time.  Say the cast time was dropped to .5, then the recast should also be changed to 1.0.  <br />
<br />
Dropping it to that would save ME a ton of hassle on pulling Hard LDoN's when it gets bad :D<br />
<br />
P.S.  I also like the mez idea and its not that far off the mark as one of our parent classes gets a mez type spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I want at this point is a DI bump up one level and warriors get another one level increase and I riposte disk simililar to what rangers have as far as the duration but with a shorter reuse time maybe 20 minutes or so this is all I think I really need.<br />

The code is already in the game, its simple to implement and it does not take anyones role away.</div></div><hr />

Lifetaps are dead, been dead, rotting in a hole in some third world country, give it up.<br />
<br />
Faster FD is what we are asking for, hotkey AA thanks.<br />
I still stand by the point that if Im going to be tanking worse than you, I should taunt better, been this way since release, shouldnt change, your 3 minute refresh is laughable for any type of aggro spell that I would even think about memming.  Now if you want to go ahead and add that 0 second stun to our terrors with low mana cost and almost instant cast time, then Id approve of your damage mitigation spells, might want to add a debuff icon so we dont get shadowknights using it in rotation.<br />
<br />
30 second duration, 30 minute reuse riposite disc.  No drop,  I have enough AA to catch up on thank you.   Dropped in tier 4 PoP or higher.  Duration and refresh brought into consideration that hey, I have one disc to mitigatate damage, and not only will it not scale, but it pales in comparsion to the aggro generation and duration of warrior mitigation discs on seperate timers.</div></div><hr />

I would support a DI increase if warriors were also increased.  You mean -2DI for warrior and -1DI for sk/pal?  I support that.  I also support +1DI for non tanks (the other 13 classes) which would do the same thing, but better.<br />
<br />
I support a parry/riposte ability, but I think you need to weight the duration and recast.  If the recast is 20 minutes the duration needs to be 1 tick.  I think SoE would agree, because I have seen posts by devs saying these type of abilities must be limited because they are very powerful.  I don't see it very likely a 3 or 4 tick with less than 20 minutes will every go in game.  I think it is more likely that a 2 tick 40 to 60 minute or 3 tick 70 to 90 minute abilitiy will be added if any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well those mobs are also usually immune to stun too. We can't have it all. Maybe it could be coded unresistable to this special short duration fear/snare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything, having Furious/Fortitude at all on a tanking class is a mistake.  You don't deserve to get them.  If anything is to be done, it'd be to get rid of them on Warriors too.<br />
<br />
And 3 ticks of 100% immunity to melee damage borderlines on absurd.  18 seconds of melee immunity is the difference between life and death on any encounter where melee damage is a factor to winning.  You know what the premier tank class can buy with AAs that recycles once every hour that helps us tanking?  Warlord's Tenacity, which maxes out at 1500 HP healed.  How dare you even suggest that you can buy an ability that's better than fortitude?  Who cares about the refresh time?  It could be three hours and it'll still be overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey now, Nimble is not Weaponshield (unfortunately).  The Rogue disc lasts only 12 seconds or so and provides auto-dodge in the front arc.  My reuse on it is about 25 minutes or so.  While WS is a nice pre-tanking debuffing tool, Nimble is more a personal defense when we grab aggro on something that can 1-round us and we are quick enough to pop it off.  I'm sure it's the same as the other pure melee classes' dodge discs but Rogues typically use it for different reasons.  Although one can have a rogue pull and try to hold aggro for debuffing, it's still pretty unreliable compared to a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personnally, I like Omnus propositions. <br />
They aren't out of balance like all the other given after him (especially Silkarn dreams of god mode). The only hole is that Omnus stays unclear on what warriors could ask/expect from this new expension.<br />
Increasing the power of or currrent disc ? I think it can't help balance (3 ticks furious? no to much, 60% def ? even worse) <br />
maybe an AA that would permit us to fire a disc before the end of the timer but at a high endurance cost ? this should be tested to be sure it doesn't allow us to chain using disc (maybe cut the timer in three part : first 50% no re-disc, 50% to 75% re-disc at 10x the end cost, 75% to 100%  re-disc at 5x end cost, after the 100% of course the disc would be usable again at 1x cost. morover it might be important in this case to make timer stacks : ie if you fire a disc at 50% of the timer you need to wait 150% of the timer to be able to reuse it without end taxe).<br />
<br />
I don't think the disc system allows such things for now, thus it can be quiet heavy to implement.<br />
I don't think either this must be the balance of Omnus proposition, I wrote this here just to discuss about it.<br />
I don't think either this is a need from our class, it's just a &quot;and if ...&quot; idee that might end up with all the stupid knight-def proposition : right to the trash.<br />
I don't think either this should be 'war-only' if it reveals to be not so stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't anticipate Knights getting a 30 second auto-parry or auto-reposte disc. I believe the upper limit is likely to be 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Basically, I believe Verant/SoE has intended Warriors to be the only tank capable of exceeding normal mitigation long enough to survive even a 30 second fight vs. a brutal hard-hitting mob. Knights are intended to fight nearly (but not quite) as good as an identically equipped undisc'd Warrior and cast spells some of which enhance their survivability during combat and some of which serve other purposes.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what the case has been since Kunark, what it was intended to be, and what it should continue to be. The role of Knights is to be able to tank mobs not requiring &quot;burst mitigation&quot; (and to cast a multitude of spells) and the role of Warriors is to be the tank that can achieve the &quot;unmatched ability to survive&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fortunately with SK's having base level tanking and also being able to produce damage in a number of ways, &quot;snare&quot;, FD, cripple a mob and inspire Fear in it their role in any sized party is assured.<br />
<br />
Fotunately with Paladins having base level tanking and also able to heal, buff, group heal, Root, GRC, etc. their role in any sized party is assured.<br />
<br />
Should Knights need spell improvements so they can meet their class description, they should be forthcoming. Should a Knight perceive a need for &quot;burst mitigation&quot;:<br />
<br />
a. they are undergeared for this particular mob OR<br />
<br />
b. Have engaged a Warior prefered mob through error and will require additional support OR<br />
<br />
c. Have encountered improperly adjusted content and should inform SoE.<br />
<br />
Defensive (by any self supplied means) is a Warrior class defining ability that should not be shared. Not for three minutes and not for a long enough duration to provide &quot;burst mitigation&quot; for any entire fight no matter how brief. <br />
<br />
A &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability long enough to be useful in an emergency, at initial contact so the healers can get &quot;synched up&quot;, etc. - that seems reasonable. But not long enough to make them Warriors with spellbooks in any fight.<br />
<br />
I believe most Warriors understand these issues, SoE has shown general agreement, the PoN Class Balance board has finally generally come around, and only a few players continue to argue to the contrary hoping to wear down opposition through their persistance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see Knights offtank most mobs in raids fine, and believe me Warriors don't really use discs to offtank random trash if only out of laziness/save it in case of something worse come along.  They might require more upkeep but conversely a Knight brings more utility to a raid than a Warrior, though maybe SK could use some help.  But it's hard to argue improving SK's raid usefulness when ZBite is so overpowered for raid since a raid pretty much revolves around tanking (warrior) and mana.  Yes it sucks being a mana pump but SKs pump mana far better than anyone else and thus will always be useful to a raid by that alone.  <br />
<br />
As for grouping, it's not like I kill a mob with defensive and then my group waits the next 7 minutes until the disc is up.  If I can tank it a mob in xp group so can a Knight, although with less efficency, like the way it is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The Knights could get a weakened Stonestance deal, not because they need it but because it might shut some whiners up.  Really all it does is turn Knights into monk wannabes and no doubt most Knights won't even appreciate the usefulness of a Stonestance clone so I'm not sure why this is even suggested.  Most likely Knights will continue to complain how their new disc that they never had sucks and Warriors will complain how this is destroying class balance and everyone will be mad.  But who knows, maybe we can get along for once.  <br />
<br />
I think Brael's suggestion of 2 ticks, level X 4 mana/tick upkeep cost, 65% mitigation, some kind of improved casting ability (increased channeling maybe), and same or possibly slightly longer refresh time than Stonestance (no reason for this disc to be better than Stonestance in any way).  It should also at least drain enough endurance such that you never gain endurance if you use this disc whenever it is up, though not like it matters since Knights get endurance for free unless it's class specific or hybrid only items, and don't need it for anything else anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You dont want to share defensiv and so you got it nerfed. This is there way to balance warrior and knights and your comments here made clear that this is the only way. You have to live with it that it get nerfed for every encounter where a knight and a warrior has to be able to tank it and it has to be a challenge for the warrior. Every encounter is very easy for you when it is balanced for a knight and you can hit defensiv. <br />

<br />
If anything the change to those two trials was to respond to people complaining trials being too hard but they don't want to weaken it so that it becomes trivial for a warrior.  Having mob (PA) that hit slightly harder than some Time Gods for one group was simply not a good idea.  So they made them as if everyone can use defensive against them by lowering their DPS to that level, but then made sure Warrior can't stack another level of defensive to make the encounter a joke since these are supposed to be gatekeeper encounters (though Jhiru is a joke in presence of Pooka pets anyway).  <br />
<br />
The game is build around defensive.  The game is not build around Knights tanking.  I'm sorry but Warriors win here.  I sure haven't seen any other of the thousands of encounters that exist tuned specifically so that a Knight can tank them.  If anything the GoD level + attack change helped Warriors more so than Knights since most mobs are not not stunnable which means mob DPS versus Paladin is now way up while it's roughly unchanged for War (lower attack, but more mobs dual wield).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Arbosch,<br />
<br />
I thought you quit.<br />
You dont want to share defensiv and so you got it nerfed.  <br />
Rytan stated:<br />
Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />
Nor should it be. SoE has confirmed this a number of times. So I suggest you start out with that truth.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Warriors didn't get it nerfed. SoE developers came to the startling conclusion it you design an encounter so that the major test is fighting a boss mob at the end it very difficult to have it an equally challanging test for Warriors and other classes that tank. Knights insisted the challange be equal although in any other venue it wouldn't be and SoE was unwilling to remove the boss mobs and make it a slaughter or make the boss mobs trivial (that means Knights can tank them and Warriors rightfully own them outright - unless they Fear or have a bigtime DS).<br />
<br />
That's right Arbosch. Every encounter is easy if a Knight can tank it. Well, almost. Tanking CT is pure misery for me, but I can do it. Anything tough for Knights is likely to push a Ranger or Monk to the limit, but a Monk isn't a Tank and Knights are scared to death of being compared to the other Warrior/Caster tank hybrid.<br />
<br />
Yes Arbosch, I at least am concerned SoE will listen to you, or more precisely since you've grown tired at having your thoughts ridiculed, Iustus who now is asking Warriors what kind of utility do they want in exchange for three equal tanks (two with awesome Spellbooks). I don't want SoE to take away the Warrior traditional role, the reason I've played a Warrior for 479 days, and have us get ANY utility in exchange for our Class Defining Ability That Will Not be Shared. Frankly, I enjoy the game and don't want to quit. <br />
<br />
It was nice of you to drop by and reveal once again your class jealousy:<br />
You dont want to share defensiv and so you got it nerfed.<br />
Want to be the narrow focused best tank in the game? Roll a Warrior. Oh, my bad, I forgot - you wanted to be a Warrior AND have a Spellbook.<br />
<br />
What did Brenlo say??<br />
Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and SK's.<br />
Yep, that's the one. He could have said, Like it or not Warriors will never 90% Res, buff like a Cleric, GRC, Root, DA, stun, LoH, heal for 1500HP's in 1 second, group heal, etc. But he didn't need to - Warriors are neither greedy nor foolish.<br />
<br />
Wait, come back so I can taunt you yet again. Bring me a shrubbery.<br />

The game is that broken in that many ways that it is fun to see people still think there exist balance.<br />
<br />
You dont think that mobs which need to be a challenge for level 70 players will create more dps then mobs which we fight today? <br />
<br />
If they create more dps you dont think that the gap between warrior and knights dont get larger and larger as higher the dps is from the mobs get because defensiv?<br />
<br />
If the gap get larger it create a situation that everything will be a joke for warrior other then a few endnameds because the gap between warrior and knights or knights are back to the situation they was 3 months ago that we simple can not tank the stuff with the same gear as the warrior.<br />
<br />
This break the game in many ways. First for the highendgame it break it because guilds can choose the classes they want invite. If you have troubles on a raid. Invite warriors for offtanking and you just made it easier. The healing you will need less is easy more 'healing/utility' then any knight can do. But the real killer is the normal game. Because warrior can go arround the need to need 'good gear' and so have access to areas they should not have. This break the game for the not so good equiped peoples. That they can do stuff with warriors and with knights they can not do it. As less gear a warrior need to do the same stuff as a knight as more player will have troubles with it.<br />
<br />
This is the killer for you guys and i find that to funny because you nerfed yourself and aggreed with them. They have to find a way to not give knights defensiv because you dont want to share it :). But have to make that the gap is not that large between warrior and knights that it is for both a challenge. Why you think they will find a better way this time then to simple disable defensiv or make it that easy that everyone can tank everything which make warrior and knights generell less wanted in groupe because tanking is not needed.<br />

<br />
If anything, having Furious/Fortitude at all on a tanking class is a mistake.  You don't deserve to get them.  If anything is to be done, it'd be to get rid of them on Warriors too.<br />
<br />
And 3 ticks of 100% immunity to melee damage borderlines on absurd.  18 seconds of melee immunity is the difference between life and death on any encounter where melee damage is a factor to winning.  You know what the premier tank class can buy with AAs that recycles once every hour that helps us tanking?  Warlord's Tenacity, which maxes out at 1500 HP healed.  How dare you even suggest that you can buy an ability that's better than fortitude?  Who cares about the refresh time?  It could be three hours and it'll still be overpowered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangers don't tank?  I have seen rangers tank in GoD on most nameds.  Every hybrid has a melee immunity disk besides sk's and pallys.  This makes no sense.<br />

If the extent of your GoD experience to say that is Sewers, then sure... but weaponsheild still isn't a &quot;tanking&quot; tool.  It does have some raid applications that are tank like, but for 99% of the experience grinds, its a save my ass card, just like Nimble, or that pansy dance bards do.

<br />
Theres no point, to not having a knight have an extended duration autoriposite disc when warriors have several, mostly on different timers, and every other hybird has one.<br />
<br />
The simple way of putting it is that they dont want you to tank in any situation where you might actually make a difference outside of HT and LoH and whatever these other godlike spells BB says I have in this book that save raids every day.</div></div><hr />

A funny thing is, that if they give us an autoripost discipline you will see way less ranger corpses. Knights and Special paladins will simple get there 'go bring mob to position A and hit ripost discipline and die with honor' job. The good thing we will not die when we do it.<br />

The total effect is debateable, but I would argue the combination to be so marginal as to not being worth the sacrifice of buffslots and spell slots.<br />
<br />
Inspiring fear exists as an ability only against level 55 and beneath mobs. <br />
<br />
SK non tanking group contributions are effectively Snare, FD pulling of a manner with significantly different advantages and disadvantages over a monk, DPS approximately inline with a non-tanking warrior or slightly higher, a poorly designed group attack tap, totals about 60 attack, and the active mana / health regeneration of Z-bite. There exists also a short duration resist tap, which sees little use, but can be helpful situationally. <br />
<br />
On the advantages and disadvantages of Z-bite: This is an interesting spell, and certainly an effective one for a class which has never had the ability to 'feed' mana. Barring crits, it is on the same total mana effiency as our most effecient lifetap, Bond of Death, at 2 HP returned per mana, with only one recipient. Effectiveness only improves with group members, and unlike other mana-generation spells, it is self stacking. 2 SKs can feed 400 HP and 200 mana to each of 4 other people per cycle, with a cumulative cost of 0 mana, while gaining 400 HP each. However, it is also an active spell, requiring a mob be engaged in combat, and to have direct damage cast on it. It is fully useless in downtime, barring the presence of Holgresh Elder Beads or eye casters. It effectively forces the SK to sacrifice a spell slot to provide his group with mana regen that is, alone, inferior to most forms of passive mana regneration. Full efficency is very unlikely to be reached, meaning that most SKs will only provide between 50 and 80 mana per minute on average, 5-8 per tick. Alone, it significantly consumes the SKs mana - He is unlikely to spend much, if any, time benefiting from meditation, and thus is forced to rely on passive mana regeneration. Depending on gear and buffs, this can easily range from 14 per tick to as high as 48 per tick sans bard. Cost, then, can be significantly depressive to DPS, larger, more tanking relevant taps, and other utility. While Mental corruption decreases this cost, it is at a sacrifice of healing and DPS. Ancient: Bite of Chaos only amplifies all these issues, while being less mana effecient - 2 SKs chain A:BoCing each other will lose 20 mana per cycle.<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot AA mana regen.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to burst the bubble, but with Furious, the majority of the time on raids, rangers have already lost the &quot;position the mob&quot; job, so I have no clue why you think knights would get the job over warriors when they have Incite, EB weapons, Furious, and then Defensive/Evasive to do the entire job themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, Warriors are pretty much a tank-in-a-can now. They can position mobs and take no damage with Furious, tank with Defensive after that since the unlinking of discs, and with Incite are also the best add tanks in the game.<br />
<br />
So basically, that one patch gave Warriors one of the Ranger's raid roles, WS positioning, Knight's raid role of offtanking, and of course Warriors retain their raid role of MT'ing. What a deal that was! Oh, toss in 500 hp for good measure. Sounds good to me!</div></div><hr />

Your misapprehensions are apalling.<br />
<br />
I've been able to position mobs ever since I first MT'd. There's not a special ability required, just shoot an arrow on incoming, taunt, proc, and viola it will briefly follow you right into the corner. Admittedly, it's better to have the Monk drop it at your feet or sometimes to have a Paladin DA pull, but it's not mandatory - never was.<br />
<br />
Furious is not used on adds or on normal experiance group mobs. Neither is Defensive. You needn't salivate over tools Warriors use in their long established raid roles.<br />
<br />
Incite has a pretty long refresh. Bellow a mob and when that unexpected unmezzable red mob wanders into camp 10 seconds later, your Warrior MA is out of tools except instant death (AE Taunt) and the infamous RNG Taunt Button. On the other hand, a Knight can switch targets without missing a beat. Knight rapid-fire aggro &gt; Warrior slow refresh aggro when add tanking 10:1.<br />
<br />
As a Warrior, I am more effective off tanking hard hitting red mobs and splits - always have been.<br />
<br />
So no, despite your claims, nothing has changed. I do the exact same things I've done in raids that I've done since Kunark was released. Knights however do much more.<br />

Uh, I have no idea where some knights get the idea that incite in and of itself comes anywhere close to competing with knights spell agro. The only agro advantage warriors get is what is generated by knights themselves by making poor gear/augment decisions. Any CE item is usable by knights, symbol is usable by knights, Ykesha augments are usable by knights. Spell agro is easily enough by itself however so most knights dont bother to make these choices, thus defeating your whole argument. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is no reason for a paladin who made appropriate gear choices along the way to be outagroed by a warrior in the first 30 seconds, which is the period of time most critical to add tanking. Ask any warrior how useful incite is vs resistant/randomly mezzable mobs such as qvic and txevu trash (where you cant risk swinging if the raid is attempting to mez). Even the ancient incite isnt enough to cover a single tash if you arent swinging most the time.</div></div><hr />

Um... you compete with knight aggro when you off-tank? I guess you guys do it different than we do... We don't try to grab aggro from each other, we try to aggro the mob before it chews on the robed ones. For that, incite is plenty.<br />
<br />
You guys crack me up.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt use the word huge, I would use the phrase &quot;badly needed in order to fix an archaic system that was badly outdated&quot;. The implementation of endurance however still leaves alot to be desired, when you can use 3 discs and still have 80% endurance left its rather stupid. Conversely if you get hit with a endurance drain and it takes a week to regen back from 0 its also stupid.<br />

<br />
So which part of &quot;ancient incite by itself isnt even enough to cover a tash&quot; was confusing to you? My whole point was that knight agro is fine for offtanking, and its generally better then warrior agro in the first 30 seconds ESPESCIALLY if there is a chance for the mob to be mezzed.<br />
<br />
Just incase anyone was confused, I fully support some broadening of raid roles for knights as long as it doesnt involve making them better at absorbing damage from yellow/redcon mobs. I was simply disagreeing with part of what 1 poster said about incite.</div></div><hr />

These problems were due to playstyle changes (players not waiting for Warriors to establish aggro) and a falling off of pure melee DPS.<br />
<br />
Brenlo knows it and has said it afaik, SoE said it, and you know it. Knights HAD a major group preference and were capable of MTing end expansion boss mobs, both of these situations have been fixed.<br />
<br />
Let's be honest here. When for over a year Warriors had greater and greater difficulty getting goups, it made getting a group for a Knight a matter of turning on /lfg and hitting your &quot;Yes&quot; macro.<br />
<br />
The fix is not to make three equal tanks (two with spellbooks). It's to make Paladins and SK's have a reason to exist as distinct classes in raids. The three plate tanks are relatively well balanced in experiance groups and have the potential for different but valuable raid roles.<br />

Discs are certainly not an integral part of Knights.  You don't see encounter focused around Santification or Leechcurse.  Something you use once 72 minutes is not a disc, it's more like a LoH.  When you look at pure melees, even with the discs uncoupled there is still always a choice.  Use disc A now and risk not using disc B later, and not to mention the endurance cost to worry about.  If Knights are supposed to be focused around discs then you'd have issues like do I use a Santification now or save for Holyforge later, or do I use HT focus and risk not using Leechcurse.  But you simply don't have that kind of decision, because a Knight is never meant to have discs that require a choice.  <br />
<br />
Having DA/Harmshield instead of Fortitude/Furious is by design.  If Knights are meant to get the latter lines, they would not have DA/Harmshield to begin with.  If I remember correctly, DA/Harmshield is added in Kunark as level 50+ spells for Knights.  So Paladins who can do almost anything a cleric can do besides CH don't even get a spell clerics get at level 1 until level 50+.  That to me seems to be intentional.</div></div><hr />

They were when they were created.  When the class was designed.  Only in the last couple years was the agro removed from them because knights were using them for tanking.  I guess that would should at the time that SoE thought they were too powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the time, mid-Kunark, Paladins recieved Divine Aura at level 55. Harmshield, at the time, was not a Shadow Knight spell, being added much later than the nerf, requested as a pulling tool. Then, as now, Stun was a potent aggro tool, however, with the lesser aggro capabilities of other classes in general, it was much easier to 'coast' on aggro for the 18 second duration of Divine Aura. DA provided, at the time, perfect invulnerability. Neither spells nor melee could penetrate it. Mob DPS at the time is much lower: It was sensible to trade the ability to be healed for invulnerablity for 18 seconds, and the healer can pick up at the end of it easily. Meanwhile, the nearest parallel is Fortitude, which, at its old duration of 9 seconds, provides half the length of immunity, while not proofing the warrior against spell, as well as approximately 50? minutes of lock out from the entire discipline system. Weaponshield and Deftdance do not yet exist. Against this backdrop, twice(or more) as good with a third the recycle of its nearest parallel, DA is perhaps over strong. <br />
<br />
Today's situation is vastly changed. Fortitude no longer comes at its enormous price. Less tank oriented classes are capable of fortitude type /discs, with longer durations to boot. Interrupting a less than absolutely perfect cleric's spell timing with the uncertainty of DA dropping can well spell suicide for the knight in question. With the massively higher Damage output, and thus aggro output, of the other classes, combined with, in the SK's case, a many-fold reduction in aggro capability, it is more difficult to build aggro to a pinnacle that can hold aggro with others beating on it for three ticks. The game has changed greatly since that nerf - Perhaps it's time for re-evaluation.</div></div><hr />

But simple because one reason. Because the neutralized defensiv and lowered the dps of mobs general and so nerfed defensiv indirectly (lower dps = lower effect of defensiv). But in defensiv in Ikkniz and Tipt and the balance is broken again. <br />
<br />
Now it look like you dont unterstand it still and this is funny. The game will only keep balanced if defensiv is neutralized in every futur zone which is like ikkniz or tipt. And there will be most futur zone like ikkniz and tipt. Because it is not that they are a flag zone which make them unbalanced. It is because warrior groups are able to get rewards which they should not get with the gear they have. They can do this because defensiv neutralize the geardifference between the tankclasses. This dont come from flags. This come from the dps of mobs. Increase the mobs dps and you have more ikkniz and tipt zones.<br />

Seriously, are you playing EQ? Defensive is &quot;neutralized&quot; in 2 trials. Essentially intro content to GoD. Frankly if you couldn't do those pre-nerf you're not tanking much other than yellow or below yard trash anyway. Given the pita involved, I doubt SoE will be too comfortable about 1-group flag content ever again. It's probably much easier to do 8-person expeditions - the challange being pass/fail with no player silliness like Druids should be adequate Main Healers for a trial.<br />
<br />
Defensive has a central role in deciding who tanks what in the content beyond. Essentially it's what it should be. Most yard trash is yellow or below and since Kyvv Heartstriker was adjusted, I haven't seen a Warrior pop Defensive on such mobs. Bosses, splits. and exceptional adds are red and can hit hard - the is territory of very well-equipped Knights or one recieving additional support or a Warrior who well-might concider using Defensive depending on the mob. Afaik top Knights can handle this stuff (top Knight by my definition being ~1k HP below a Top 100 Warrior on EQRankings).<br />
<br />
So by my lights, Defensive is doing exactly what it should and Knights don't &quot;need&quot; a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability at all. In all fairness, one to pop in an emergency or for initial contact on an exceptional add or one group mini isn't out of order, but it should not last the whole fight nor be able to be used every 2, 3, or even 4 fights.<br />
<br />
My guess is that SoE is not going to be stampeded into a bad discision. They know what spells and disciplines they will be providing, what roles they intend classes to fill, and are doubtless leary of unintended synergy. Who ever thought Circlet of Shadows would need to be nerfed? Yet, it really is more powerful than intended.<br />

Me, first day it was found, got mine the day after.  I believe my exact words 15 seconds after getting it were &quot;they're going to nerf the fuck out of this in an emergency patch&quot;.  I might even have a screenshot of it still, would have to look.  Anyone who knew the game at that point would have been able to tell you that thing was more powerful than intended.  Of course it's pointless now since with the amount of see invis in the game the effect isn't quite as drastic anymore, if it weren't for the effect it would have on the lower end game where it's still helpful I would say they should drop again.</div></div><hr />

It is not flags which make this unbalanced. It is that defensiv create a to big gap between the tankclasses. This happen because mobs dps got increased that defensiv simple is more worth then all gear you can get. If you increase the dps you only make this worser and worser because the benefit fom defensiv get larger and larger. It is simple not possible to increase the mobs dps and to balance it. Every groupesituation is unbalanceable when you increase the dps of mobs even more (which they have to do to keep the game interesting for level 70 players) and keep defensiv that unbalanced that warrior get the benefit from it and the other classes not. How you think will knights balance out the effect from defensiv against mobs with higher dps? If you come up with stuns.<br />

How can a tool which get less and less usefull when you fight stronger and stronger mobs (higher level, resists, immun etc.) help us to balance something which get stronger and stronger as harder the mobs get? It only create a larger and larger gap. <br />

You still don't understand. Knights are not Warriors nor do they share the Warrior raid role (except for some Knights that you and I are unlikely to ever group or raid with). The size of &quot;the gap&quot; is immaterial so long and Warriors and Knights can get normal experiance groups and have a role in raids.<br />
<br />
Look at your spellbook. There's a spell gap. Imagine Paladins got Virtue tomorrow at level 65. Would it change things? Nope. So long as we are each suited for our raid roles and equally desirable in groups, it doesn't matter one iota.<br />
<br />
Let my try to penetrate your stubborn beliefs from another direction. Compare our Magelos. Yet we can both get experiance groups. More importantly, we would both be wanted on a raid. Because sir we are NOT the same class. We are apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
Yet, because it serves your purposes, you whisk your spellbook out of sight and focus attention ONLY on the ability to tank differences, in one sized party, and one tanking situation - a hard hitting boss mob that you can't stun.<br />
<br />
Guess what Arsbosh, I can MT for a single group killing mini-named in Kod-Taz today and outperform you. I  did tower named before you and could tank single more difficult mobs better than you in EVERY expansion.<br />
<br />
I'm for all practical purposes 10K HP's unbuffed. That could be 12K HP's or I could have 60% melee damage under Defensive and it STILL wouldn't matter. You get experiance groups and perform your raid role (which btw is NOT the role I perform) just fine.<br />
<br />
The tanking gap is a LOT smaller than the spellbook gap between our classes. It doesn't matter, we are not the same class, nor are you ONLY a tank.<br />
<br />
And that's why reversing my argument around and saying it doesn't matter how small the gap is doesn't work. You see, at my progression level you CAN through equipment alone out-tank me if I don't have Defensive. That is exactly what you are NOT entitled to do.<br />
<br />
You are NOT entitled to tank like me and cast any spells for any other purpose on any ocassion whatsoever. Defensive insures that this doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
The gap is in your head.<br />

<br />
BB<br />
<br />
We are not the same class, but we fight for the same spot in the groupe/raid. This is the mainproblem. You simple ignorre. Warrior only have tools which support them in there role 'tanking'. Knights have many tools but which dont support them in there 'mainrole'. All our tools only play a role when we are able to support our mainrole and this is and will allways be tanking. If we cant support our mainrole we simple dont have an use in groups and only a very, very limited role on raids. <br />
<br />
Someone who can heal 1000000000hps in 2 sec. is not better then a warrior if both have to tank. If he die in 1 sec. that he can heal in 2 sec that much hps dont help him to do the tanking job. He will be a damm overpowered healer and will total owne every existing healingclass. But if he has to tank and this is our role. He will be useless against the warrior. You have to balance stuff and look at the role they have to do. There are to many classes and not enough roles. You have to share your tanking role. So this job need to be balanced. Defensiv simple break this balance. Tell me how you balance a defensiv warrior with a knight when both tank. If you now come up with but we dont us defensiv all the time. Yes you dont us it. But if something get hard you will us it. If something isnt hard you dont need tanks to tank really.<br />

I agree with you that this single groupe flags are bullshit. But i dont aggree with you that stuff should be easy. Tanks should hope for hard stuff because hard stuff is why groups need tanks.

And here's the gaping flaw in your argument - we do not compete for the same spot in raids. You perhaps would LIKE to compete for the same spot, but you don't and since Kunark haven't.<br />
<br />
Pay close attention please.<br />
....warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.<br />
Warriors tank hard hitting mobs. That mob that hits for 1500HP's or 2K HP's, Warriors have an unmatched and unmatchable ability to tank it and survive. Knights do not.<br />
<br />
Knights MAY have the equipment to handle a hard hitting mob, or they may not. In the event that at a given progression and equipment level Knights can not handle a mob that they should it is a mob design issue, not a class balance issue. Kyvv Heartstriker was a mob design issue.<br />
<br />
Warriors MT raid boss mobs, hard-hitting splits and exceptional adds that can not be stunned and/or do not Fear.<br />
<br />
Knights are tanks, but they are not the preferred raid MT's. They do base level tanking and cast spells. Warriors do base level tanking and advanced tanking.<br />
<br />
This does not mean Knights do not have a role in raids. Most mobs can be tanked by anyone with base level tanking. Besides some (not all or even most) of your spells augement your tanking abilities. This allows Knights to add tank, plow tank, tank mini-bosses, and offtank splits that don't hit exceptionally hard.<br />
<br />
If Defensive was the key to tanking, then I would only tank a mob for 3 minutes maximum and be unable to tank another for 10 minutes. Defensive IS the method used to insure that<br />
....warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.<br />
and that Warriors retain their traditional and long established Primary Tank role in raids.<br />
<br />
Knights do not compete for Warriors spots in raids.<br />
<br />
I do not use Defensive in experiance groups, except of course named hunting groups - which btw are NOT experiance groups. Experiance groups focus on moving the experiance bar as quickly as possible with the least amount of risk.<br />
<br />
While we do compete for spots in experiance groups, since Defensive is rarely used, we are competing on the basis of my base level tanking + advanced tanking (unused) vs. your base level tanking + spellbook (used). While Warriors do in fact operate with some groupability disadvantages, they are not major and are offset by the sence of greater security a group percieves when the 100% Tank is tanking for them.<br />
<br />
Despite your feeble arguments to the contrary, Defensive is not broken. It is operating EXACTLY as intended and as it has functioned for four years. It insures Warriors have a decided advantage performing THEIR raid role without giving Warirors an experiance group preference that results in Knights being /lfg for groups focusing on experiance gain.<br />
<br />
Anticipating a desperate counter-argument by you....... Yes, groups will favor very well equipped Warriors when experiance grouping in some advanced zones where a mini-named might pop. Warriors group MT'd in PoEarth before Knights commonly did, and at PoFire Picnic tables, BoT, named Sand Giants, Fungi and Juggs in Seb, etc. On the other hand when Knights demonstrated they too were capable of tanking in these camps, players did not hesitate to group them.<br />
<br />
Knights have some experiance group preferences as well. In the past it's been places like Lever, PoD, etc. where the threat of adds was great and the ability to help the puller (or be the puller), snare, Root, etc. in addition to tanking were major assets.<br />

If knights get another disc then rangers and beastlords should get another disc too.  Fair is fair right?  So when suggesting things such as new discs please think of the other classes that will start bitching and moaning.  Do you know how many rangers would like a melee disc to go with that trueshot?  Hell even on the same timer so we'd have to pick one or the other...<br />
<br />
+1 DI too all but plate tanks (plate tanks for clarification, I still think rangers should still be adequately called tanks in most circumstances, albeit not so good as knights, and in fact having the same gap between rangers and knights as there is between knights and warriors[not counting defensive]) would be a bad idea.  As hard as some of the GoD mobs these days hit, losing what little defense many non plate tank classes have... I don't really have to spell it out I don't think hehe.  The -2/-1 thing sounds much more reasonable, but warriors will still outtank paladins and sks in straight up mitigation, so who cares?  While you're at it throw in -0.5 for rangers please :)<br />
<br />
Oh also of note, in the eqrpg rangers are on the same HP table as knights o.O I think an update to ranger hps would be in order.<br />
<br />
Ok so the thing was a bit extreme, but I'll bet some of you knights were thinking WTF is this guy smoking, which is exactly waht I'm think when you are suggesting things like 20sec/20min fortitudes.  I've WS pulled every mob from Vindi to AoW (skipped ToV) to all of ssra including blood and emp, lord seru (god knows why they wanted me to do that), mini aten, big aten (such a fine foxy lady she is), to every PoP boss up to Fennin (only EP god I did before I had to deguild due to work).  I enjoyed it very much, and it had its merits.  Chaining 0.5 cast Tangling Weeds and 1.5(?) cast flame lick built up a metric f*ton of agro that allowed the mobs we were fighting to get debuffed and slowed before the Defensive tank went in to regulate.  My warrior knew what he was doing, he'd wait for my call that WS was ending soon and AET off me, I knew what I was doing and I'd go sit in the corner and throw a few jolts in before doing anything else... in fact, on every standard rampage (as opposed to AE rampage) mob I did this with, I survived the whole fight!!!!  Holy mackerel batman, rangers need a nerf I guess.  <br />
<br />
The whole thing was though, it was strategy and teamwork, ya I was a little upset that I lost something I considered fun, but sometimes I get to do it still anyways... hell why not save that Furious disc for an Oh Shit later down the line, or save my WS for when Azzkicker_02 is running amock on the casters, taunt (always works when warriors are also trying to taunt, I know not why) flame lick/snare, pop my WS disc and hold on for dear life cuz sweet suzy I'm comin home.  <br />
<br />
I've really gotta agree with what has been said about warriors being the ones who tank Azzkicker_02 type mobs.  If you try and find a work around for this, knights, you only widen the gap between yourselves and the tanking classes following behind you, which can only end up in you hearing these same bitchfests with preposterous 'suggestions' (I'm almost afraid to call them suggestions, but for lack of a better word...) that you are laying on the Warrior community right now.  I can only thank what lords in heaven there may be that Slein Jinn isn't in here ranting on about 'you can't have your cake and eat mine too' or whatever it was I saw every other damn post in that 27 page optical marathon...<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, I'll let you know in advance that I love SKs and would like to see them get some improvements, I have a great roleplay oriented /disc for you paladins... since you are divinely blessed with your powers and all... /disc pray... you hit this disc and everything in the immediate vicinity agros you, and you better start praying that your clerics are quick with them heals.  12 second fortitude seems a bit much even to me, 12 second dodge/parry seems more inline for what you all are asking for... and take the 72@60 refresh jsut like us rangers, I don't blow that damn thing unless I absolutely positively have to, or at least think I have to as it always seems those damned clerics heal me right after I spin my weapons... I do think you guys should get the Bard disc message though.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I pissed anybody off, and I apologize if my post is more rant than actual feedback, but after reading 27 straight pages about class balance,  it raelly chaps my ass to see this same crap over again.  I've seen some VERY good ideas presented by both sides, and they either A) get forgotten in the midst of all the prick waving or B) get shot down because you guys want to tank cutting edge bosses.  The fix to the 2 trial bosses was really nothing more than allowing more people to get access to KT, without needing the holy trinity... and to be perfectly honest, I've played in Vxed/Tipt for a total of about 60-70 hours, and guess who tanked the whole time... those lovely little pookas :)   <br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you guys get another disc, I'm going to want another disc, and if I have to create and account on PoN (thats the pally website right?) to do it, so be it.  Hell while I'm at it I think I'll fight for getting the ranger self buff to stack with brells like the sk/pally self buffs do.  And I might as well ask for a  1 tick duration/2 tick refresh 50% mitigation AA, as well as archery DPS that surpasses rogues ala pre-ep style.  Oh lets not forget our preist parent AC/HP buff lines, you get 2nd best (Aego) and we get... man like 3rd?  If you think I'm coming off as a whiny bitch, please remember that half this shit is just to give you a little climpse into what I've had to put up with in most (not all thankfully) of your posts, and as always if the shoe fits, wear it.. if not you arent my Cinderella!<br />

Look back to Kunark for instance, the difference between necrosis scarab and a sepsis scarabs was negligible. You didnt have the situation you have in Kodtaz now where if you pull a Hexxt Deathaim thats hasted it can kill a tank in 3 seconds while the regular trash can be killed unslowed all day long with a druid healer.</div></div><hr />

An SoE representative replied that there were no plans to give Knights additional disciplines at this time. It did ignite a storm of protest that subsided.<br />
<br />
Basicly, I believe the reasoning is that Knights have pretty powerful spellbooks. You can't really begin to compare a Ranger's spells to a Paladin's. In virtually every catagory Paladins have better spells.<br />
<br />
And let's remember, much of the Ranger class's ability to MT harder mobs was nerfed long ago. While Paladins may tank CT and Inny in PoTime before they are trivial (btw, neither of these mobs are patsies), I'm unaware of a Ranger prefered boss mob in PoTime - there isn't one.<br />
<br />
It's very probable that DA was selected as the Paladin &quot;escape mechanism&quot; with no intention that they be able to use it to tank like a Warrior. At least when they could tank with DA in force, it was changed so you could not.<br />
<br />
SK's FD with a spell. It could have been a discipline but intentionally was not. They really shouldn't be able to repleace Manks in raids as pullers. When bards could do this it was finally fixed.<br />
<br />
Rangers on the other hand are not really capable of replacing Warriors as raid MT's or Monks as pullers.<br />
<br />
Knights get most of their auxilarly power through spells and aren't intended to have many disciplines. Spellcasting is very powerful, benefits from KEI, FT, etc. BUT spells have a couple of intended limitations - they fizzle sometimes and can be interrupted.<br />
<br />
No tank class has both powerful spells and powerful disciplines. I imagine there would be a lot of opprotunity for unintended synergy especially when fueling spells with a mana bar and a discipline with endurance.<br />

And here's the gaping flaw in your argument - we do not compete for the same spot in raids. You perhaps would LIKE to compete for the same spot, but you don't and since Kunark haven't.<br />
***<br />
<br />
You call offtanking not a role for warriors? You dont us warriors as offtanks if you have free warriors? Since GoD the role of warriors changed a lot in our guild. They gone from maintanks to overalltanks. They simple tank everything they can now. They are the first choice for everything. Not only the bad guy at the end. They are not the proffesionell maintank. They are the overalltank which tank everytime they can. The aggro upgrade from warriors was needed, but to tell this dont made that warriors did step on knights shoes as offtanks is the biggest bullshit i ever read. You are the best maintank. But i think balance then is that knights can do the offtank job as good as the warriors. At the moment we simple hope there is no warrior to tank that we get the offtankjob. Simple because you have tools which help you maintank and which full support you on the offtankrole. You dont need it most of the time. But you are overall better and you have better tools for bad situation for offtanking. Ripost discipline is only 12 sec. But this are 12 sec. which save you. If you see healing is incoming slow hit defensiv and this slow healing will keep you alive. Knights dont have tools which activ help them for the offtanking role. For raids our tools are damm limited and our allmigthy stuns are 90% useless on the raids. Stuns only make trival stuff even more trival. But dont help us in bad situation.<br />

And I'm not sure why Warriors still think Knights are better offtanks.  They are not, and hasn't been for a long time.  I don't think that's wrong but it is the reality that Warriors do not seem to accept.  Right now the only time you'd ever have a Knight tank is if:<br />
<br />
on bosses, anything that fears often and cannot be resisted reliably (CT)<br />
<br />
on trash, you need the following 3 conditions:<br />
1.  Mob is not meleeable, and<br />
2.  Mob needs to be mezzed, and<br />
3.  Knight already has various aggro spells loaded, which cuts into their ability to do anything else.  <br />

Oh yeah, and Knights tank NPC druids better because it takes them 3 minutes to move into camp so they have all the time they need to grab aggro on something that does about 25 DPS since it never stops casting.</div></div><hr />

Any Knight at my progression level can reach my HP's - 1000 (386HP Warrior advantage after AoTC + 500HP from sturdyness) and essentially my AC +/- 50AC.<br />
<br />
Since I don't use Defensive tanking normal adds nor off tanking anything except brutal adds (and most red mobs are far from brutal), Knight spellbooks more than offset my HP's advantages and &quot;-1 DI&quot;.<br />
<br />
Defensive changes nothing for me in GoD. I raid add tanked, off tanked, plow tanked, split tanked and MT'd (or not) in every single expansion. For me, nothing has changed.<br />

Perhaps you have failed to keep up Arbosch. Include a Magelo and lesse if you look like a post-Time Tank with AC or HP's in every slot or someone not ready to tank in content much beyond PoP.<br />

Unless this is 1500HP's minimum out of date, I want two hours of my life back - discussing this with you has been a total waste of time. All the trials have been adjusted, and the only hard hitting yard trash mob in Kod'Taz, Kyvv Heartsriker too. You aren't ready for content beyond that.<br />

And warriors wonder why many knights are frothing for something, anything. While circumstances of late have forced me to step up my pulling duties during raids, I'm apparently not allowed to do that, either. <br />
<br />
Ciae and I clashed in the past over a debuff line with actual teeth in it for the SK, a real melee debuff line for the SK could have the advantages of raid stackability with warriors, as well as solving the issues of competition with Paladin stuns and providing a reason to use the SK as an off-tank of convienence: A tank that can take the edge off a mob while he waits for the slower and crippler to get around to his mob has a real edge. Immunity/partial effects flags are easily possible. Combined with a more effective way of dealing with damage than Touch of Innoruuk, the SK starts to approach the paladin for the white con, and even slightly exceeds on yellow-red cons. The warrior, meanwhile, is not significantly threatened: The combination of a deeper HP pool, better mitigation, potentially a higher effective AC (Depending on the coded caps, not the mob-attack cap), and defensive for the appropriate situation, leaves him a solid choice, and, hell, the SK can debuff his mob too while he's at it.<br />
<br />
If, as so many warriors want to shout about, knights strength should come from the spellbook, then the spells must stand up and actually function to reduce incoming damage, and ideally, they should -stack- wth defensive, much the way slow does. Stun is an excellent step along this line for the paladin. Nothing stops the paladin from stunning a mob that a warrior is tanking, given appropriate aggro-care. This is the tanking tool the paladin should have, and properly balanced stuns at white con, or even yellow and the lowest reds should obviate the need for defensive. It must function as a tool to defuse bad situations. Properly designed self heals should probably exist here too. More, shutting off a mob for half of the 10 seconds a slow takes should be occuring, no matter -who- is taking the beating. This is how a paladin should be able to stack with a warrior, not just sitting back and flash healing the enchanter. The SK currently has ... a 40 point attack tap. Once the warrior starts tanking, the SK offers pulling and DPS, both of which are done better by monks. <br />
<br />
Of /disciplines, an 'oh shit' button is still quite desirable. Currently, the knights are the only melee type classes that cannot 'escape' without dropping the aggro onto the next person on the list - often a poor choice. It's fairly inconsistant that of the three tanks, only one has any sort of melee immunity discipline, while four of the five DPS melee do, and the fifth has a 90% mitigation discipline. This is fairly absurd.</div></div><hr />

Tell me which mob need to get stunned that you survive the fight? There dont exist such a mob. So if you survive anyway if you use stuns or not. Is the stuff not trival? If i can stun then i only make it more trival. If there exist a mob that i need to stun it to be able to survive. I will not be able to tank it. Stuns dont work like defensiv. They are more powerfull on paper but will lead to death knights if you need to stun the mob to survive. The moment you get a resists you are death. Defensiv simple dont fail stuns fail. You are death if you need defensiv to tank a mob and defensiv fail. Knight will be death if he need stuns to tank and stuns fail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the whole the part of this discussion that I don't understand is this.<br />
<br />
Knights want to be preferred addtanks? I beleive this is what I've gotten from various posts on this thread and others. So, is it that they believe that can not do this, or are they mad that spare warriors can and will be perferred for this role?<br />
<br />
Ok, first, if Knights are having a problem addtanking. I know that it has been suggested before, but maybe its just been lost in the confusion and debate. If they are indeed having a problem with this one shouldn't this be considered A) a content adjustment needs to be made, i.e. if warriors are having to blow defensive and these adds are nothing more that yard trash, or guards, etc.. or B) these adds are not trash and are considered an appropriate part of the challenge to these encounters and thus are intended to be &quot;brutal&quot;, in which case this is not the domain of knights and SoE has stated that it is not.<br />
<br />
Ok, if this is the case, let pull back a second and take a break a try and look at it from another angle. Here's a similar situation, not exactly the same but I think its close enough for comparision. Please bear with me.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple clerics around and you have the adequately setup on rotation and devided into the grouped they need to be in, but you still have a surplus, what would you have the others do? I think most people agree that they would be on spot heal duty or perform other utility functions, right? So, what happend to the druids and shaman that would have otherwise performed the spot heal duties, should they claim that clerics need to be nerfed or that SoE has taken their role away simply because people are (and should) prefer the specialist class to perform the duty that they were designed to do.<br />
<br />
I see little difference between having surplus warriors addtank or surplus clerics spot healing, instead of the alternate classes performing the role. I believe that we all would agree that if a druid or shaman started complaining about their &quot;spot heal&quot; raid role being taken by clerics who are deisgned to do that role just as well they do their main role at better effeciency that druids or shaman, we would all just fall on the floor laughing at the utter absurdity of such a suggestion.<br />
<br />
This about this guys, its not really all that hard to see why any form of class adjustments should be made for such a small and trival issue.<br />
<br />
If however there is something else vital worng that you think Knights have lost or are having problems with I'm quite sure warriors would support you on it. But trying to take away a role that a class is SPECIFiCLY DESIGNED TO DO (TANK), simply to justify a position in the big raid machine where min/max is the rule of thumb, isn't going to get you anywhere.<br />
<br />
On a related note, if you guys are having problems in one group EXPERIENCE situation, which I seemed to have missed all the obvious examples of where this occurs, then it's obvoius that the content needs to be adjusted. I'm quite sure the warrior community would be behind you on such an endevour. You need to provide actual specific examples or senarios for that to happen though.</div></div><hr />

Paladins and SKs will be situationally useful, they can tank raid trash add's pretty well(paladins more so than SKs currently as it should be), warriors just do it better- however, paladins can snag the aggro pretty fast to prevent a robed friend from being eatten which is in their power if they see fit to do so, if alot of warrios happen to be on ball that night though there may not be a need for it, in which case paladins will focus on other duties like CC or  healing their group when patches are needed or a warrior thats tanking.  In the exp situation paladins should have zero problem, warriors will still do it more mana efficiently except on low con mobs that can be chain stunned perhaps depending on the paladins gear, but warriors will always take less damage from a given mob.. thats basically the whole story and it wont change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's important to remember that there are two Knight classes and that there are differences of opinion within each community. There are two views which I believe are extreme:<br />
<br />
Some have pushed for &quot;Tank Parity&quot;. They believe that there should be three equal Plate Tanks each capable of performing any tanking role. In order for this to occur they propose Warriors be given unspecified &quot;utility&quot;. Iustus has been championing this on SoE's boards of late.<br />
<br />
Often a slightly more realistic version of &quot;Tank Parity&quot; is asked for where Knights assert they have always been preferred to tank everything other than raid boss mobs - add tank, split tank, off tank, tank mez multiple named, etc. while simultaniously revealing the untruthfulness of this claim by asking for substantial upgrades that would allow them to do this.<br />
<br />
Some have asked for Defensive by another means including shields having an innate chance to block, &quot;stun mitigation&quot; functioning on most mobs (excluding raid boss mobs), or by removing Defensive from the game, etc.<br />
<br />
There are variations on this theme ranging from Knights ought to be at least able to MT the raid boss mobs if Warriors don't show up, Warriors should have a slight prefernce, on down to the point where some Knights state that they do not want to be raid MT's at all.<br />
<br />
The other extreme view consists of Knights that do not expect to perform the traditional Warrior raid role. They demand however that Warriors are unable to perform the Knight raid role with any degree of acceptability. The two main methods they have propose for achieving this is lamenting that Warirors got the Incite ability and hinting it should be neutralized to asking for a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability with a fast refresh that allow Knights greater mitigation than Warriors can achieve vs. adds (Brael for example).<br />
<br />
I believe that regardless of where you might fit in this spectrum of beliefs that:<br />
<br />
1. Warriors should retain their traditional raid MT role (on most but not all boss mobs).<br />
<br />
2. Warriors should always tank better (mitigate better) than Paladins or SK's vs. generic non-trivial mobs.<br />
<br />
3. Knights should mitigate sufficiently to perform a tanking role in raids - at a minimum be able to add tank with Warriors assigned to exceptional adds and plow tank with Warriors assigned to exceptional incoming mobs (providing of course the Knight is geared to appropriate progression level). They should IMO have the tools needed to perform a superlative job at add tanking without excluding Warriors from this task nor gaining an experiance group preference. Further, some minority of raid boss mobs should be Knight prefered.<br />
<br />
4. Knights should always have spells that make them, once raid MTing/hard mob tanking needs have been satisfied, greatly preferred to additional Warrior/s. That a good potion of their value in raids should be based on their spell casting and the differences between the classes have at least as much impact on raids as the simularities.<br />
<br />
Whatever we all think, SoE is going over Class Definitions. I'm not expecting them to radically change the role of any class, hybridize pure classes, or marginalize them - but I am hoping they will refine class definitions and insure classes can perform those functions they are supposed to be able to perform.<br />

I watch paladins with less AC and less HP do tipt and vxed with higher success rate than me.  I know this because I often die in tipt and vxed from more dps than a cleric and druid can handle.  When I bring one of my two &quot;very good&quot; paladin friends, they hardly ever die.  I used to have a cleric main, I know how to heal.  When I see how much less average damage they take, it is clear why they survive more often.  If I used defensive on every trash mob I would be in better shape, but I can't do that like you can use stuns on every single mob.  I will restate, I have 9700 hp, 1800 ac, LR5/ID5, Sturdiness 0, and WA1.  I need more WA since I also can't hold agro for crap in vxed/tipt.  The paladins never lose agro.</div></div><hr />

More spell gems has been asked for roughly twice every week since pre-kunark. The 8 spell limit is chosen specifically to force us to choose between spell lineups. Most casting classes have between 8 and 12 spells they want to have memmed at all times, and choosing between them forces prioritizaton. Casters have been told no to this so many times we've stopped asking. Thus is the cost of spells, much like choosing defensive vs evasive vs stonewall. <br />
<br />
On the other side of things, twice now has Sony betad a FD hotkey AA for SKs and necros, and each time, it's been tossed away due to inadequate functionality. If they'd finally -give- us this AA, it'd free up a perma-memmed slot for a line of debuffs rather nicely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the big problem is that paladins and shadowknights should not havet he piece of the pie they made the wrong class in order to get a piece of that pie.<br />
<br />
<br />
i have seen quite a few paladins win tipit on my server really must be alot since 3 guilds are tackling kt +, so what if it takes paladins and shadowknights a few tries to get threw the trial i did 4 failed vexed runs myself and 2 failed tipit runs spend a few days doing them and i am sure you will make it out on top atleast once.<br />
<br />
<br />
i think that some of the biggest problems are that paladins and shadowknights think they should preform just as well as warrior when tanking is concerned , the problem is this will never happen due to the fact that we gave up spells to be 100% tank , just as druids and shamans gave up stronger heals to buff / solo better then a cleric , its just that if one class see's another class doing well they want thoose abiliites and preform just as well or so close it doesnt even matter,<br />
<br />
KNIGHTS , DRUIDS AND SHAMANS THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
<br />
now on to what i think would help the warrior  community and the rest of the mellee class's maybe it was mentioned before but i dont know :)<br />
<br />
<br />
i think there should be a weapon mastary aa system , where given a chosen choice of weapons to be better with then other weapons<br />
<br />
for example<br />
<br />
if i had sword mastary i would preform better with 1hs and 2hs weapons then other weapons and the differneces are as follows<br />
<br />
increased dps ( increase the damage bonus ) <br />
<br />
incease the speed ( lower dely )<br />
<br />
give the certian field a innate chance to proc ,such as if slashing could do a DD like proc<br />
<br />
this wouldnt be limited to warriors but to every class that melee's effectivly<br />
<br />
example for name as follows<br />
<br />
Slashing Mastary - 5 ranks ( first 4 accesable by anyone , 5th rank to warrior only )<br />
<br />
<br />
shields well i could care less about shields i hate them and never use them only if i want some ac and hardly needed , if i am going to avoid ripostes i use a 2 hander.<br />
<br />
i would also think that a upgrade to Tactical mastary and Stalwart endurace would be some nice things for them to add.<br />

I know this because I often die in tipt and vxed from more dps than a cleric and druid can handle.  When I bring one of my two &quot;very good&quot; paladin friends, they hardly ever die.  I used to have a cleric main, I know how to heal.  When I see how much less average damage they take, it is clear why they survive more often.  If I used defensive on every trash mob I would be in better shape, but I can't do that like you can use stuns on every single mob.  I will restate, I have 9700 hp, 1800 ac, LR5/ID5, Sturdiness 0, and WA1.  I need more WA since I also can't hold agro for crap in vxed/tipt.  The paladins never lose agro.<br />
<br />
Again, trival is trival. Your posting show this good. Knights got better at trival stuff and tipt and vexed are trival stuff. It is hard when you dont have the needed gear and that is your problem. You simple dont have it and so it is hard for you. Knights which dont have the gear have stuns which make it easier for them. So knights make trival stuff even more trival. <br />
<br />
***<br />
I see little difference between having surplus warriors addtank or surplus clerics spot healing, instead of the alternate classes performing the role. I believe that we all would agree that if a druid or shaman started complaining about their &quot;spot heal&quot; raid role being taken by clerics who are deisgned to do that role just as well they do their main role at better effeciency that druids or shaman, we would all just fall on the floor laughing at the utter absurdity of such a suggestion<br />
***<br />
<br />
This is a good point. Druids will go rampage there is that a large difference between there healing then between a defensiv warrior and a knight. Our druids even outheal our clerics from time to time at spothealing. Simple because focus effects (gear). The only real advandage clerics have against the other healers is complet heal. This is total usless for spothealing but keep them there mainjob. To bad this is not the case with your discplines which allways keep there us. <br />

If you look at me magelo i have to say. You live in the wrong world. I only gave it up to update it and dont see sense to get gear for me knight because his suscription end at 03.08.2004. I did pay 6 months together that is why it end then. At the moment i not see sense to pay again and so since 3 months i dont want any loot simple because this paladin will rest in peace and so it is wasted gear for the guild. If i will come back i can easy invest me points (dkp guild) to get 3 or 4 top end items. But why should i invest points and steal the guilds loot when i dont see sense behind the knightsclass like they are now. <br />
<br />
If you will look at our guild here is the homepage<br />
http://www.ancient-dawn.de<br />
<br />
If you care about magelos go look at vicothnics (warrior) magelo. If i am not allowed to talk here because our guilds isnt geared enough. You are not allowed to talk here to. Because our guilds look like we are near each other.<br />
<br />
Yes you will allways be maintank, but it has to stop that you are allso the mainofftank and knights have to hope that no warrior is there to offtank. Keep your maintankrole, but make your tools useless for offtanking or give knights as good tools for offtanking as you have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my guild, Warriors tank everything because we can, and it's always less effective if you let someone else tank.  There is one Paladin who must keep 3 or 4 stuns memmed that can actually get aggro on a trash mob before I do, but that's got to hurt the casting ability.  We use Knights to offtank because we run out of Warriors, or maybe because people like variety.  I don't see how a Warrior can be better at tanking big mob and somehow not better at tanking trash mob, because a trash mob is really just a weak big mob.<br />
<br />
Even if overnight we put in something crazy like say, Paladin stun level 80 unresistable for 10 seconds, refresh time 12 seconds, guess who will tank the mob in the 2 seconds the mob does move?  It's still going to be a Warrior (assuming current aggro rules apply normally to the stun), and why not?  Even if the mob is only doing 1/6th the normal DPS, the Warrior is still better at tanking that 1/6th DPS than a Knight.  Of course at that point you probably don't care but a Warrior will get more aggro than any Knight that doesn't have some ridculous aggro spell setup by just attacking with DBoW/Fleshbiter + Anger 3s wearing anything with Echo of Anger, and to top it off that's usually the best DPS option for Warrior and certainly the best tanking options (DBoW/Fleshbiter AC is insane for a weapon).  <br />
<br />
But I'm not sure if it's really a problem, any more than Warriors who claim not be able to get a group back in PoP.  If I can conjure up any number of any classes at will my raid's class composition will look awfully different than they do now, but it doesn't mean just because the 3rd magician could've been replaced by the 25th rogue for better DPS you get rid of your magicians.  Especially with Paladins, what they bring on a raid and group is so great that even if one never tanks you'd still want one.  If anything it's SK that may have a more dubious role since their only real special role is FD and feed mana.</div></div><hr />

This mean that our guilds rarly but loot on knights. The answer is simple. the last 3 months most of the time they got brell from an applicant or someone did log it in. We gone from 8 very activ knights to more or less 0 paladin in less then 1 year. For shadowknights it look better. but that have to do with pvp. They simple are a fun class to play on pvp servers becaues harmtouch.<br />

Maybe your Magelo is way our of date and you are not nearly 3k HP's below a Warrior in your own guild. However, if this IS where you are, there's your problem. Ikkinz4, Ugua, Q'Vic and I hear beyond are not kind to undergeared &quot;tanks&quot; - not that undergeared.<br />
<br />
When you are at Vicothnics HP's, AC, and advoidance -<br />
minus ~386HP innate Warrior advantage after AoTC and 500HP's for sturdyness then you are geared for the content. In your case that's 1500HP's away minimum.<br />
<br />
A full set of visable Elemental/Time armor gives a Warrior 492AC and 1335HP's and a Paladin 442AC 1215HP's. Add in your buffs and that gap (which has been about the same in every armor set) narrows.<br />
<br />
The differences you percieve are not because they are built into the system. You are simply undergeared. It's one thing to be raiding content beyond Kod'Taz with a guild and actually being able to tank mobs in that content.<br />

This is the problem. You dont us it. So it is nothing. That is what you try to tell us. If the situation is normal. You are right. It is nothing. You dont need it. If the shit happen to fly. Then you have the tools to counter this situation. Berhaps your guild is perfect and you dont have shitty situation. In our guild we are not perfect. We have shitty situation. This is why we put the free warriors on first offtank position. Because they have tools to counter this situation. Knights can get the gear and tank 'near' as good as warriors if the situation is normal. But if you have a knight as offtank and the shit start you fail with a knight as offtanks. He can do nothing. If he get 2 adds on him he is death. Next the healer which is with him and a chainreaction happen. Warrior hit ripost and let another tank get one. This situation dont happen everytime which only make it worser. This has the effect that most warriors have this tools ready to us. A wipe cost you more time then the timer of the disciplines. So if the shit start to fly you dont care about timers. You us the tools you have to save the raid. Lets look what tools you have and what knights have. When the mobs dps was lower knights was better because we was able to get the raid more time with lay hands, heals etc. But today with that massiv dps of mobs we simple dont buy the raid more time. Even when you can time the lay hands perfect you got the raid berhaps 2 sec. more. Our normal heals get us less then 1 sec. Stuns works but 95% of the mobs i have to offtank on raids are immun to stuns so useless.  A warrior can give you 12 more sec. etc. Our utility not grown as strong as the mobs dps. or is made useless from the mob design. If we are the utility class this utility should help us in bad situation and not only make trival stuff even more trival. <br />
<br />
If you now come with stuns. This simple dont work. Your disciplines are a 100% working never fail tool. Stuns are a work or work not tool. If we should be better offtanks in raids we need to be better. A 100% working tools against a work or work not tools will allways create a situation that you are better. Wipes suck and so the last thing you want is to have a tool which work or work not for raids. In groupe this is okay. You waste berhaps a half hour for 6 people. But in raids you waste 50+ peoples time and berhaps waste 3 or more hours from them. So to have a balanced situation your tools have to be as dangerouse (can fail, can get resistet or ignorred) like our tools or our tools need to be a 100% success tool like yours. <br />

<br />
I don't even get asked if I have Defensive up when I add tank or plow tank. Nor am I promptly replaced if I tank a named and have used it.<br />
<br />
Like many Paladins you've alternated between stating Defensive is broken and should be removed from the game and showing an obvious desire for Defensive or at least for something like it for addtanking/plow tanking.<br />
<br />
The hard truth is for a Paladin to Tank like a 10K HP unbuffed Warior, they have to be at 8500HP's unbuffed minimum - and that is pretty much what they reach with equivilant EP/PoTime/LDoN augmented equipment.<br />
<br />
But Knights like you with 7k HP's unbuffed say &quot;We don't have the tools!&quot; No sir, you don't have the AC, HP's or Avoidance to match Warriors at your progression level and it's ALL due to equipment.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want a 9k HP Knight Tanking in a raid if if I could have a 12k HP Warrior doing it. You're right about that. But it's not because of Defensive. <br />
<br />
I've very honestly used Defensive once (1 time) plow tanking or add tanking normal adds in raids since Kyvv Heartstriker has been adjusted ( I remember because I was called to MT a named next and had to /tell the Raid Leader Defensive down). Yet, with your heals, stuns, Root, etc. you can't match me as an add tank or a plow tank - not because of Defensive, I don't use it. It's because you sir are almost 3K HP's below me in HP's and probably 200AC.<br />
<br />
Gear-up with what is available in EP/PoTime/LDoN augmented armor and the story changes quite a bit.  A Knight with 2300AC, 10500HP, +10 Avoidance, and even possibly far more buffed etc. can add tank and plow tank. Rapid-fire aggro becomes a major asset.<br />
<br />
Would you use a 7K HP unbuffed Warrior to MA if a 10K HP unbuffed Warrior was available? How about if he could stun White mobs and below? I didn't think so.<br />

If a Knight can stun a mob, then the Knight becomes a form of damage prevention, but aggro determines who tanks, and even if you can stun a mob 100% of the time, it doesn't change the fact Warriors are still the one who produces the most aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron, it's actually quite easy to give Knights better tanking than Warriors on some mobs while still leaving Warriors as the top tank on boss mobs.  Like I suggested before fast use/reuse mitigation abilities allowing Knights to get on additional mobs quicker before debuffs are on.  Increases to aggro allowing Knights to lock it immeaditly once again (SK aggro is particularly low in comparison, espically non damage aggro).  Those are tools which would let Knights excel at tanking adds, you could use a Warrior but it would actually be more efficent with a Knight, and it doesn't hurt your role at all.  Seeing as how it's the role Knights have been doing for years now (espically due to the lack of any other possible roles for us) I really don't see the harm.  As far as Paladins bringing so much to a raid you always want one, I would much rather have 9 Warriors on a raid than 6 Warriors 2 Paladins and 2 SK's, the raid would be better off in tanking power and higher in dps.  Theres a major problem with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arbosch</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will allways us warriors if you have a free warrior. I can get this gear that is not the problem. But i even a warrrior which is less geared then i will get the offtankjob. Simple because he has tools to counter bad situation. Gear dont help you in this situation.<br />
<br />
One question. If you equal geared warrior and knight and both are free. Who you take to offtank? What you loose when you let the warrior offtank? What you loose when you let the knigh tank? A smart raidleader will not let the knight offtank because he loose (ripost discipline, defensiv discipline, better general migration) and you win a free knight wich can support heal. This dont sound bad. We can heal so we have a job. Oh wait, you have free druids. Which class you take if you need  support healer. A druid/shaman or a knight. Every smart raidleader will take a druid/shaman because they can support heals a lot longer and more effectiv. So knights only have an use when no warrior take his offtankjob. If no druid/shaman take his supporthealing role etc.<br />
<br />
In the past we got a job because warrior was not able to create aggro to be effectiv offtanks. Now that they can create aggro good enough there is no reason not to take one. But there are many reason not to take a knight if you have a warrior free.<br />

Knights never had a raid add taking role because Warriors couldn't generate aggro.<br />
<br />
Ya know, this is the problem with what borth Brael and Arbosh's many positions.<br />
Like it or not, Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and SK's.<br />
It's what we do - tanking. SK's can do damage in a variety of ways, debuff, etc. Paladins can buff, heal, etc. They are primarily melee. Warriors are 100% Tanks.<br />
<br />
No guild in it's right mind is going to have 16 Clerics, 8 Warriors, 3 Enchanters, 5 Bards, 11 Wizards, and 11 Rogues.<br />
<br />
Knights don't have to out-tank Warriors in experiance groups and vs. adds a la Brael's wacky out of balance &quot;burst mitigation&quot; on every mob scheme. Nor does Defensive need to be removed per Arbosch's fantasy.<br />
<br />
Knights need only to be ABLE to perform their main role in raids and bring extra value because they can cast some useful spells in a raid environment to be wanted in favor of Warrior #7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12.<br />
<br />
So what adds can't you tank Brael? What can't you hold aggro on? Frodlin asked you elsewhere and you had the decency to reply that you could in fact do your job. Are you going to change your tune?<br />
<br />
BTW, anyone who thinks a Paladin can not obtain and hold aggro on a mob with stuns is flat out silly. I have never seen nor heard about a Knight using a real genuine aggro weapon with a Force of YKesha aug and Symbol of the Planesmaster in this game ever.<br />
<br />
***<br />
If Knights want to complain they can not hold aggro, I'm certain Warriors will support Knight aggro improvements.<br />
***<br />
<br />
I do appreciate Brael coming right out and saying what he has said. He wants Knight TANKING superiority and &quot;burst mitigation&quot; which is hardly burst if it's every mob.<br />
<br />
From Kunark on forward, I have seen Warriors, and only Warriors, having a traditional role Plow Tanking, Off Tanking, and tanking Adds - except Saryn's Adds and RZ's adds in PoTime and Rathe Councilmen which I have seen MT'd by Paladins. I've NEVER seen an SK preferred to tank anything, anytime, anywhere.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Name the raid where SK's have always been the preferred Plow tanks and add tanks - that &quot;traditional role&quot; you claimed they always have Brael.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Tradition would dictate that the use of Warriors for all raid tanking tasks continues. However, Warriors support Knights having an add tanking role they never previously enjoyed until reaching PoTime.<br />
<br />
If SoE wants to enhance Knight rapid-fire aggro, then I'm sure Warriors would go along. But if Knights are going to insist on greater TANKING capablility than Warriors, they do not have a leg to stand on. Neither by removing Defensive (Arbosch) nor &quot;burst mitigation&quot; on every mob (Brael).<br />
<br />
The common complaint was that Rangers out tanked Knights - suggest Knights get Weapon Shield and the story changes yet again - disgusting, very disgusting.<br />
<br />
If there was even a single grain of truth to Braels or Arbosch's position that Knights have always been the preferred add tanks and Warriors could never do that task, then neither of their suggestions would be needed, would they? Disgusting, guys. Come back when you can get your stories straight.<br />

Did a search in EQ Rankings just now, currently there are only 60 SK's in the game with 8500 hp unbuffed or more.<br />

So in addition to the riposte disc and -1 DI I am asking for Knights  (Warriors get -2 DI all other classes remain the same) <br />
<br />
Its pretty clear that BB is right here and that we also need SoE to give us the extra 500 hp that warriors got.<br />
<br />
Currently there are 142 warriors listed with over 10k hp unbuffed. There is also 742 Warriors with 8500 hp unbuffed listed.<br />

Secondly, there are more than 2 Warriors for every SK. So with about 140ish Warriors at 10K HP's unbuffed, 60 SK's at 8500HP's unbuffed is about right.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, SK's just got a self-buff to not be overwritten - you in fact just got an overdue bump in this area.<br />
<br />
Finally, here (http://www.gpcentre.net/content.php?page=evercrack/compsheets) is a link to armor comparasons. Ignoring Knightemization of Plate Tank/All armor, it's pretty easy to see that Knights CAN achieve what I have stated to be true. This doesn't mean that Knights WILL achieve it.<br />
<br />
Arborsch is a prime example. I'm willing to bet that although we are at the same progression level - unlike me, he doesn't have 100% raid attendance for 450+ days played (just missed my first raid in 14 months). In those guilds with DKP (raid attendence) used to determine reward (loot) players are capable of determining their own fate at a given progression level. Should every player be automatically given their drops when they reach a progression level?<br />
<br />
AND not all level 65's are at the same progression level. Nomilus (a well-known and justifiably admired Paladin), for one example, has more HP's, AC, Avoidance, etc. than I because he is further along in the game than I.<br />

Having established what Knights CAN achieve, you choose to focus on what EQRankings shows they have BOTHERED to achieve.<br />
<br />
Look at those armor comparasons. Here's what Warriors have that Knights do not:<br />
<br />
~500HP innate advantage after Knight selfbuffs, 500HP from Sturdyness, &quot;-1 DI&quot;, an advantage in total HP's available from full sets of class specific visible armor and tanking disciplines.<br />
<br />
Since class specific armor turns out not to always be the best in every slot, the HP advantage conferred on Warriors by class specific armor is variable depending on progression.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much it. Warriors might get slightly higher DPS, but they don't care about that one whit.<br />
<br />
Feel free to make some fake Magelos. The truth is Knights at 6500-7000HP's unbuffed in PoTime guilds are under equipped. Warriors realize that if they are to raid MT they must be as much of a Tank as possible. We don't have a spellbook to fall back on. In every post-PoTime guild I know about, Warriors insure they have the gear and the LDoN or better AC and HP augments to let them do their job. If they don't, then as you observed by looking at EQRankings, there are plenty of other Warriors ready, willing, and able to be a guild's #1, 2, 3, or 4 MT.<br />

By your figures on the amount of SK's vs warriors there should be more then 120 SK's with 8500 hp and over.  Since there is less then half as many.<br />

Perhaps not slackers, but given the power of spellbooks accustomed to not focus on acquiring Tanking gear to the same extent as Warriors.<br />
<br />
Also given the much higher numbers of Warriors it shouldn't by surprising that the top 10% are skewed heavily toward Tanking.<br />
<br />
And of course, as a typical Warrior my FT=0. From the moment I created my character to the present, I've made no Tanking compromises in order to cast spells. From character creation until the present, Knights have chosen to make Tanking compromises in order to cast spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Knights trail Warriors in HP. Entering the EP's and before Sturdyness I had many more HP's than Arbosch who is now post-PoTime - not that he's near what he should be at his progression level.<br />
<br />
The top Warrior in AO according to EQRankings shows 11085HP's unbuffed. I am currently 1K HP's lower due to progression level (and equipment choices, personel effort, and accomplishments).<br />
<br />
Do you contend Warriors should get nothing? My HP's are too high for my progression level?<br />
<br />
In PoP, end expansion Knights were able to achieve very close to Warrior AC and HP. Those that did (and other classes as well) were able to MT end expansion mobs. I would expect that SoE has somewhat fixed this with &quot;-1 DI&quot; and Sturdyness.<br />
<br />
When tanking any mob that takes more than 3 minutes to die (almost all raid boss mobs I've seen in GoD) the real Warrior tanking advantages are as I've indicated.<br />
<br />
Defensive is only a major benefit on mobs that take less than 3 minutes to die (but because of refresh time Defensive is not useable on normal adds or pulls), or like AoW used to kill Warriors as soon as Defensive drops, or when Warriors offtank exceptionally brutal adds while the MA leads the raid in killing them one-by-one. This is exactly how it's always been since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Want to plow tank, do adds, offtank, etc.? Well just like Warriors if you don't want to spend a significant amount of time doing secondary roles, Knights must be as close to what is achievable at their progression level as possible.<br />
<br />
BTW, Warriors can concievably cast CH now thanks to Potion of Serious Healing. But don't worry too much - it's a GM quest reward and has a casting time of 90 seconds.<br />

<br />
<br />
To match Nomilus' unbuffed AC BB need at least 124 raw AC more (because BB has no shield and has already less AC).<br />
<br />
<br />
we can go on like this for a long time on the question of &quot;who's the best tank&quot;. Actually as BB said Nornilus might be better than him, but nevertheless a warrior is more desirable to tank than a Paladin, but it doesn't remove the Paladin's utility because his great spells can assist the warrior at best.<br />

This drive by Knights to be Warriors or better makes the game less fun. It obscures the fact that GoD is actually too hard but still big time fun to raid - a huge challange.

<br />
Ya know, this is the problem with what borth Brael and Arbosh's many positions.<br />
BB<br />
<br />
This is simple not true. Warriors was able to create aggro overtime. But they was not able to create aggro fast and save. They had the same problem as knights have with stuns. They get lucky and got a proc fast and got aggro fast or bad luck and was not able to create aggro for 10 seconds where the mob gone rampage. This simple was not save. A tool which is not controlable and warrior aggro was not controlable in the first seconds is not as usefull as a controlable tool. Knights was able to create aggro from the first second and so total owned warrior for the offtankjob. <br />

SoE nerfed vendor recharging shortly before Incite went live. I very very often add tanked and plow tanked prior to incite. I could not only get aggro, I could survive once I had it.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, Incite has a three minute refresh. Poink the wrong mob and it's just like it was in the past. Lose aggro (and we can) and we're back to square one.<br />
<br />
Stuns still own Warriors for rapid-fire almost always available aggro. Warriors are able to handle one mob at a time and that's the first mob they incite. Then they are unable to handle another for three minutes.<br />
<br />
Now at one time Knights could get aggro on raid adds but promptly died if they were so presumptuious. Can you say Flurry Drakes Juggs, etc.? Warriors add tanked and raids practiced aggro control. It wasn't until they stopped doing it in experiance groups, particularly in LDoN, that Warriors raised a rukus.<br />
<br />
You just can still move from mob to mob quicker and save that Enchanter with a stun regardless of when mezz breaks or grab that unexpected unmezzable add. Warriors can't. (Well, I can but I carry a limited supply of Crystalline Silk Nets). That doesn't mean we can't or don't regularly add tank or plow tank - it just means we lack certain advantages.<br />

<br />
I agree on everything except the 10 minute part.  It should be similar to ranger weaponshield or the rog/monk discs (i.e. longer reuse time)<br />
<br />
I also think they need to put a recourse to prevent stun lock on paladin stuns.  In oow they will become way too powerful.<br />
<br />
Well either most SK's are slackers or there is some imbalance here.<br />
<br />
I know they are lazy, because I know pre-elemental paladin with 9000 buffed hp and 1700 buffed AC.  If time doesn't add 2000 hp over pre-elemental, you are lazy.  That paladin is now elemental and has 9700 hp buffed with close to 1800 ac.  He isn't time flagged, so no time gear.  He doesn't have any god goodies like GPR.<br />
<br />
So in addition to the riposte disc and -1 DI I am asking for Knights  (Warriors get -2 DI all other classes remain the same) <br />
<br />
Its pretty clear that BB is right here and that we also need SoE to give us the extra 500 hp that warriors got.<br />
<br />
<br />
So your proof is some eqrankings stuff?  This make me no longer respect you.  That is an asinine basis for your opinion.  It is rude of you to ask for the HP bonus.  As it is right now, if any power increase (beyond fixing problems) like better mitigation, avoidance, HP, AC that a warrior doesn't get an equal or greater amount is at risk of putting warriors back in the same situation they were in LDON.  I am in a guild (elemental + KT GoD) and we have more paladins than warriors and sks combined.  Our MT has roughly the same AC and only 1300 hp over the top paladin.  They have 400 (paladin) and 600 aa (warrior) and the warrior works much harder on upgrading gear.<br />
<br />
If you don't have this kind of gear, it is wrong to try to get SoE to make paladins a better tank in every way plus keep healing and stuns.  SoE has denied many things because they can see it isn't balanced.  So many paladins scream about balance and then ask for abilities that equal warriors and exceed warriors when combined with the knight's spells.  This kind of stuff just pisses me off to no end.  It makes me wish you all would quit the game.  You need to understand that SoE isn't going to just destroy the game to make your e-penis bigger (even if you are a woman.)</div></div><hr />

While I might use a Crystalline Silk Net ocassionally, if the adds are very frequent and the pull rate intense (as they tend to be in more trival content), there is a limit to how many I carry and how many I'm willing to use.<br />

The tougher and more cutting edge the content, the more care exercised by the pullers and the greater premium placed on Warrior survivability advantages.

<br />
What makes you believe that?  Stun lock has been an issue addressed at need since way early in the game.  The oldest case I know of was the Enchanter long duration stun Whirl til you hurl, which was changed to be broken when you hit the mob (pretty sure that happened before I started playing in July '99).  The second oldest case I know of was Clerics stunning mobs in Hate (Clerics had more stuns than Paladins in those days), resists and (supposedly) a boost to stun aggro combined to weaken that tactic.  The only other cases I've heard of, outside of absurdly trivial content, were PoP-era players in Luclin, and at least one mob (Arch Lich?) has been flagged stun immune in response to that.<br />
<br />
The only two cases I've heard of where stuns were &quot;way too powerful&quot; in current content date from pre-Kunark, and didn't even involve Paladins (the stuns in the game when Luclin was current content were level capped too low to affect mobs like AL).<br />
<br />
For over 5 years of they've been restricting stuns in various ways, relying mostly on immune flags, high resists, and mob levels (i.e. they've been relying on content, imagine that!).  Why anybody would assume that the devs are now planning to allow stuns to overwhelm current content, and therefore some new and absurdly punitve restriction must be added lest the evil Paladin Plot To Rule The World should succeed, is beyond my ken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if they will, but they should.  The current problem in GoD is stuns are too powerful against white and blue mobs.  OOW will have more stuns and even stuns to level 75.  This will be way too powerful and I can't believe they are going to put this in game.  Maybe they will give warriors some kind of war only mitigation or avoidance to compensate, but as of today, there are no new abilities for warriors.</div></div><hr />

It's true that with a Monk using a SoT and a Paladin in a group, way too many yardtrash mobs were stunable in some GoD trials and zones. However, SoE became aware of this situation and fixed it.<br />
<br />
Yes, new higher level stuns are scary, but it is the Paladin traditional method of mitigating some damage and since getting both stun mitigation and anything other than token &quot;burst mitigation&quot; might be over the top.

Consider slow is mitigated significantly in higher GoD zones (I can't even tell if a mob is slowed in Yxtta) stun was the most effective form of damage mitigation even back when the only way you can stun something was a proc from Staff of Transcendence.</div></div><hr />

BB<br />
<br />
The exodus allready happen. Warrior only not saw it because they was in there 'golden age'. Warrior will be the class which will have the biggest increase in power in OOW. Simple because defensiv. Take a level 55 mob and see what defensiv do there. Take a level 65 mob and look how more effectiv defensiv on the level 65 mob. Now you can see how warrior will get there biggest boost in power in OOW. I unterstand that you want them to wait. Everyone can see that an increase in dps will create massiv problems because defensiv. Noone told me yet how they will compensate this. Your answer to this problem is to wait and look how worse it is. I dont find this a good idea to wait when i see a big problem incoming. I know it will be worse when you increase the dps of mobs and keep defensiv the way it is. <br />
<br />
Oh and wasnt it you which told us that it is not acceptable that warrior need to farm items with charges to get aggro. Now you bring up this that you allways had aggro with this tools. I am confused now.<br />
<br />
***<br />
And you would have warriors go back to the way it was? (I suggest you think about it before you reply to that.)<br />
***<br />
<br />
If they dont balance migration yes. So you have the choice between a save aggro and worser migration (knight) or better migration and worser aggro (warrior). Today with all the aggro tools from warriors you have the choice for save aggro and better migration (warrior) and  save aggro and worser migration (knight). If you will keep your aggro tools for offtanking then balance out the migration tools. But why you ask this. If battleblade is right, you guys never needed this to get aggro. So you dont loose anything for offtanking when they take away all your new aggro tools (disciplines, aguments etc.). Or you loose berhaps what make you to the mainofftanks?<br />
<br />
But the most funny thing here is. That warrior tell knight that we are okay. They give us stuns to compensate defensiv. But stun only are fair when they dont work on hard hitting mobs. How can someting which is limited in that many ways help us to compensate something which work allways. Can a warrior explain this please?<br />

I didn't know that knights got spells to compensate for defensive, I thought they got spells to create a new class with different roles and abilities. Considering outside 3 minutes of glory, knights tank almost identical to Warriors. I don't see the problem. Sure, maybe if knights spell books were 100% concentrated on tanking and ran off endurance (hmm, kinda sounds like the disc system as it now) I could see knights tanking just like warriors. That however isn't the case, you guys chose utility along with a decent amount of tanking ability. I'd say you guys came out ahead by being able to tank 99.99999% like a warrior of out defensive and have the added value of spellbooks to bring to experience groups. You should be THANKING the devs that they use defensive to define the difference between the part-time and full-time tanks instead of giving warriors a noticable mitigation table that would always be on.<br />
<br />
These discussions are moot though. They all revolve around how one class doesn't do something that another can do, and how its not fair. No shit!, you don't say. I have to chose a class with strengths AND weaknesses? OMG, this is SuXoRs...</div></div><hr />

You look at a feature of Defensive, it's scalability, and conjure up the worst possible scenarios.<br />
<br />
Every caster receives the benefits of FT, KEI, SD, Manasong, AA abilities, and Focus items - no noise from Arbosch that this increase in caster power is unprecidented. None. I've read PoN for a very long time - this unparalled increase in caster power in general and Paladin casting power specificly went unhearalded by Arbosch.<br />
<br />
Never mind that a single sucessful stun might delay or prevent thousands of damage from taking place when the first stun cast in the game might have prevented 15 damage.<br />
<br />
Forget that slow increases with power as mobs increase in power.<br />
<br />
The fact the SL/HL chains now heal inconcievable damage doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Arbosch doesn't care that Seasons, Trib, and MR prevents more damage now than against mobs iwhen they first appeared.<br />
<br />
From the moment Warriors used first used Defensive. Each more powerful mob they used it on (and that's a lot of mobs) saw both and increase in the damage mitigated AND and increase in the damage Warriors recieved.<br />
<br />
Get real Arbosch. Defensive is used overwhelmingly in raids and generally by the MT - a job Knights do not perform and benefits the entire raid - not enriching Warriors. Knights and Warirors are not competing for the MT job. <br />
<br />

Frankly I'm pretty bitter about your constant carping about the Warrior defining class ability. You can't even think about your class ever without thinking &quot;Warriors have Defensiv.&quot; - not before PoP, before LDoN, before GoD, after, GoD, and now you are predicting the future.<br />

<br />
Every caster receives the benefits of FT, KEI, SD, Manasong, AA abilities, and Focus items - no noise from Arbosch that this increase in caster power is unprecidented. None. I've read PoN for a very long time - this unparalled increase in caster power in general and Paladin casting power specificly went unhearalded by Arbosch.<br />
<br />
Never mind that a single sucessful stun might delay or prevent thousands of damage from taking place when the first stun cast in the game might have prevented 15 damage.<br />
<br />
Forget that slow increases with power as mobs increase in power.<br />
<br />
The fact the SL/HL chains now heal inconcievable damage doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Arbosch doesn't care that Seasons, Trib, and MR prevents more damage now than against mobs iwhen they first appeared.<br />
<br />
From the moment Warriors used first used Defensive. Each more powerful mob they used it on (and that's a lot of mobs) saw both and increase in the damage mitigated AND and increase in the damage Warriors recieved.<br />
<br />
Get real Arbosch. Defensive is used overwhelmingly in raids and generally by the MT - a job Knights do not perform and benefits the entire raid - not enriching Warriors. Knights and Warirors are not competing for the MT job. <br />
<br />
The fact Warirors have Defensive isn't even &quot;your business&quot; so to speak. It wasn't you up there getting hit for 2k HP's under Defensive. It's not you getting hit like I did for 4002HP's straight melee in one hit by a mob when not under Defensive.<br />

<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Get the things right.<br />
<br />
1.) Focus effects only work to level 65 spells. They dont grow in power. They are balanced for the level 65 game. If you look at the past when we go 5 new levels (60 to 65). Focus effects not got upgraded and keep getting there level 60 restrictions. Tell me please how i grow in power when i hit level 66. As it look now caster will get less effectiv because there focus effects dont work anylonger and need to get new gear to get the same effect. All other are fix upgrades. You get x more many etc. Not like defensiv which scale up. Caster dont increase in power on the mobs dps. They have fix upgrades which are balanced against the upgrades warrior get on there melee side when they get up (higher atk success rates etc.). Melee allso have fix upgrades when they get a new level. A level 66 warrior with the same skills is more powerfull then a level 65 warrior. Level play a very, very high role in this game. Levels are more important then skills because everything you do in this game have a level check. Defensiv was balanced for Kunark and was balanced for mobs which hit for 200. Not for mobs which hit for 4000 and the game today. That a 3 year old tools is your most powefull tool shown what is wrong with this tool. In the past caster got more because they get more powerfull spells then the increase in power melees got. But that was a balance problem. You are able to balance this because you have fix values which dont change. If you don see how different defensiv is i cant help you.<br />
<br />
2.) Go read me posts. I am against stuntanking. I dont want stun tanking because it is as unbalanceable as defensiv. You can not balance stuns and you can not balance defensiv. Both tools are to powerfull when they work. The difference is simple. The knights stun are made useless because many reasons (immun, resists etc.). Defensiv is an allwys working tool. Remove both tools from the game and the game is balanceable.<br />
<br />
3.) You can say it 1000 times. Aslong there is not a good reason to take a knight bevor a warrior as offtank people will take warriors. I will have this area balanced and this is not the case. It is unbalanced at the moment and defensiv will unbalance it even more. Give knights the same tools as warriors for offtanking or make that the warriors tools are neutralized when they offtank on raids. Then we are balanced. Aslong you have your tools which total dominate (even when you us it rarly. It create a situation where you total dominate knights) knights we are not balanced for this area. Your tools are total overpowered for this area. This is like you say you have a 100'000dmg button, but it is balanced. You dont need it to kill mobs. That isnt balance. It only let both do the job but the one with the 100'000dmg button total owne the oher which dont have this. Because he allways have the freecard which the other class simple dont have.<br />
<br />
4.) Yes i do the right thing to not support them when they can not balance the game. Balance = equal power for both classes. Not that ne class total dominate the other class. Even when they rarly us this tools. If they have this tools the other class need as good tools to counter the other class or the game is not balanced. The question is if you they will have balance or not. If they dont want it they can say knights are a roleplay class with no real us and warriors are the powerhouse. Then the play with open cards. But not the bullshit they throw out. At the moment defensiv create a situation which is not balanceable in OOW. I made postings in november last year that the upgrade pre GoD will bring knights in a very, very bad situation in GoD. This happen like we saw the last months because exactly the reasons i told then. Aslong you can not show me a prove that defensiv will be balanced i know that it will make the situation even worser then it is allready. <br />
<br />
5.) Even when you dont see it from me postings. I find the situation very funny. <br />

That's exactly what SoE is getting away from. It's a terrible trap. It led to Knights focusing only on Tanking and expecting to tank like Warriors. It leads to class blurring, since obviously it focuses only areas where pure archetype class should have superority. You bump up tanking for instance and you eventually have to take the spellbook away in fairness or give it to Warriors.<br />
<br />
Brenlo stated:<br />
What we want to do is make sure that each class has a role at all levels of play AND that each class is fun at all levels of play. So while it may be that certain classes still are defined as a DPS class, they would each also have other things to contribute and keep them distinct. Now please understand that this does not mean we are going to overhaul each class. We are not sure yet what changes this will mean, if any. It will mean that we have a new viable framework for moving forward that does not try to maintain a balance by comparing one class with another.<br />
Role sir, unique contribution, a reason for each class to exist distinctly.<br />
<br />
The Vision(tm) at least made the game a phenomena. The Blur(tm) created massive unhappyness because in the end despite years of Knightemization, Knights can't be made into Powerful Warriors with Powerful Spellbooks - that's not equal. The Reawaking(tm) elevates the principle that each class needs to be distinct and have roles - not &quot;by comparing one class with another.&quot; It may well put EQ back on course.<br />
<br />
Rapid-fire aggro with no requirement to camp equipment to achieve it isn't enough of an add tanking advantage? Add Tank/RT/Combat Medic/buffer/CC/ GRC/melee/rezzer aren't enough abilities for your class to have a role at all levels of play, be fun at all levels of play, and have a reason to exist as a distinct class?<br />
<br />
Well SoE will sort out class definitions and roles. Too bad you say you won't be around to see the result.<br />

Actually all VT focuses were lvl 60 restricted and got upgraded to lvl 65 when POP was almost released. Id be surprised if the same thing didnt happen to Tacvi focuses at least come OOW,  possibly all focuses from Qvic+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thus this means that balance between a warrior and a wizzard can be reach only if they have the same domage output and the same  sponge  domage ability ! ha no you mean between tanks, ok ok ok let me rephrase it. thus this means that balance between a warrior and a cleric (afterall if he is a plate waerrer this means he's a tank) can be reach only if they have the same domage output and the same  sponge  domage ability !<br />
<br />
I call it bullshit.<br />
<br />
two different skills can't be equal otherwise it be one skill. thus this statment is completly wrong. how do you compare dodge with incite ? you can equall to diferent things only if they are alike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chania</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it is right now, if any power increase (beyond fixing problems) like better mitigation, avoidance, HP, AC that a warrior doesn't get an equal or greater amount is at risk of putting warriors back in the same situation they were in LDON.  I am in a guild (elemental + KT GoD) and we have more paladins than warriors and sks combined.  Our MT has roughly the same AC and only 1300 hp over the top paladin.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Only 1300 hp eh? What do you think is an acceptable gap between Warriors and Knights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordi</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it's worth, we use knights as our primary off-tanks except in rare situations. Incite isn't guaranteed aggro by a long way, warriors are 100% dependant on the RNG for procs. Well, dps aggro too, but that's hardly enough to keep us on top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
Also, we use knights to hold pre-aggro on mezzed mobs, so that when the mob is awakened by the MT it hits the knight (presuming taunt fails like normal :P), instead of the enchanter/cleric/shaman that had aggro.<br />
<br />
Add to that the fact that paladins make great group healers for AE mobs and add 350hp or whatever BSS is these days to the entire raid. We also have pulls where SK's are our preferred pullers... to be honest, SK's have more of a right to bitch about their role on raids than paladins do.<br />
<br />
If the knights on raids don't have a role, it's because they haven't shown their guild that they have one. If they have and the guild hasn't listened, time to find a new guild.</div></div><hr />

A great question, but not becuase we need to debate what the answer is, but because it points out many of us persist in class comparasons like accountants and not on creating and preserving roles.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure there is any so-called acceptable gap. There's the gap that is:<br />
~500ish HP after Knight self only buffs innate Warrior advantage.<br />
Any difference attributable to the visible pieces in each expansion's class specific armor set.<br />
<br />
Warriors called atention to the fact that the resulant gap is not only variable, but that once Defensive ran out on a raid boss mob there was little difference between Warriors and Knights except for the fact Knights still had their spellbooks. Warriors also pointed out that the gap had remained about the same AC and HP values for many expansions and was becoming an ever decreasing percentage.<br />
<br />
SoE responded with &quot;-1 DI&quot; in the Phase 1 Melee Update and 500HP's in the GoD Sturdyness AA ability for a big chunk of AA.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that should be a class comparason anymore given SoE's new philosophy EXCEPT<br />
<br />
We have been assured some classes would retain their long established roles. Obviously to do this, in the case of Warriors and MTing raid boss mobs, Knights can not have sufficient AC, HP's, Avoidance, healing, stunning, buffing, or &quot;burst mitigation&quot; abilities in any combination to perform this task while these mobs remain non-trivial.<br />
<br />
A better way of looking at things is perhaps what SoE has urged - classes able to perform roles, be fun to play, and have unique capabilities in all environment that justify them being a distinct and valued class.<br />
<br />
Yes, questions like how much of a survivabililty &quot;gap&quot; should exist since this is a major factor in preserving the Warrior traditional raid role. But at the same time questions about the survivability Knights need (and spells, and abilities) to perform their roles without surplanting other classes in their traditional roles is perhaps a better direction to look at the issues from.<br />
<br />
When SoE embarks on this, there is going to be a huge re-examination IMO. I think changes can be done incrimentally, which should be a help.<br />

<br />
The point I was trying to make about your paladins all having crap for gear was that you really have nothing to base their tankability on.  You admit yourself that they haven't looted anything in months...<br />
<br />
This mean that our guilds rarly but loot on knights. The answer is simple. the last 3 months most of the time they got brell from an applicant or someone did log it in. We gone from 8 very activ knights to more or less 0 paladin in less then 1 year<br />
<br />
So, if I understand you right... &quot;This mean that our guilds rarly but loot on knights.&quot;  I can only assume that you mean, and forgive me if this wasn't what you are saying, that your guild doesn't let knights in on loot but rarely....  Now, if what you say is true, that your guild doesn't let knights loot, then you must be in a merit guild, or have some form of a NBG system in place in your guild, correct?<br />
<br />
How to spend raid points<br />
<br />
You can use your raid points to obtain items dropped on raids. A bidding contest is used to determine who wins the item. If several members bid the same, a random will determine the winner. If you win an item, your raid points will be reduced by the amount of points the item was auctioned for.<br />
Bids have to be made in these intervals: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40<br />
Officers reserve the right to set a minimum bid that is in line with previous bids on that item.<br />
There is already set a minimum bid for all AoW loot which is at 50 pts.<br />
<br />
<br />
- You can bid the amount of points currently listed on the raid point list and add those points from the raids you think you are listed on the logs. Be aware if you count wrong it is your fault ! If you overbid, youll be penalized with another negative 30 points by every 10 points you overbid (you have 104 pts and bit for 110 = -36 and if you bid for 130 = -96).<br />
- You can only spend raid points/random for items intended for your main character. It is not allowed to bid for an item with the intention of selling, trading, twinking or giving it away, unless officers explicitly call an open bid or a cash bid. Then everyone can bid/random without restrictions.<br />
- New members start with -25 raid points.<br />
- You are not allowed to give away raid points to anyone else. If you leave the guild, the raid points will be nullified. <br />
<br />
Hmmmm I don't see anything in there that says there is any restriction on who goes in on gear... unless of course I missed something o.O <br />
<br />
Also, you tell us that you have gone down to practically 0 active Paladins in your guild, because, I determined this through simple reading comprehension, Paladins have no place on a raid;however, according to your guilds forums...<br />
<br />

<br />
Wierd... your guild is in a medium demand for paladins... what gives?  Apparently they want paladins around for something, or else they'd be down on the Low Demand just like the sks.  So why is the real reason you aren't actively playing your paladin?  Apparently your guild is in need of paladins... are you just pissy because you can't step up to the plate and take down the bossmobs that hit harder than a Defensive Lineman on steroids? (hehe The Program is the win)<br />
<br />
Unless your guild has a new webpage they are hiding somewhere I really don't want to hear that its out of date.  Any guild thats worth its weight in Dot Matix printer paper will have its recruitment requirements updated on a somewhat reasonable basis.<br />
<br />
You seem to enjoy playing the pecking game with what other people say, so I figured I'd send it back your way bud.  Your only recourse is to attack the things people say, when you clearly must understand their intentions, simply for the sake that you have no other reasonable argument.  <br />
<br />
Oh ya... one more thing...<br />
<br />
Balance = equal power for both classes<br />
<br />
I'm a ranger... I want balance between all classes...<br />
<br />
Ranger vs. Beastlord... I want to have equal utility, equal damage, and a pet.<br />
<br />
Ranger vs. Druids... I want to gate and nuke as effectively as druids, and druids should mitigate/avoid &amp; melee as well as rangers.<br />
<br />
Ranger vs. Rogue... I want Rogue DPS, and rogues should be able to do ranger DPS at range<br />
<br />
Ranger vs. Warrior... rangers should tank like warriors, warriors should get snap agro like rangers, and ranged dps like rangers.<br />
<br />
Ranger vs. Paladin... since rangers already tank like warriors, i guess paladins need to be brought up to tank like rangers (meaning they'll tank like warriors) and rangers should be able to heal like paladins.<br />
<br />
Warrior vs. Paladin... since paladins already tank like warriors, warriors should have heals like paladins.<br />
<br />
Warrior vs. rogue... since rogues already tank like warriors, i guess rogues tank like warriors and they bot get ranger dps at range, and warriors also get rogue dps.<br />
<br />
Blah blah blah, I&quot;m sure you get the point... none of this crap is even comparable.  My DPS is half that of a rogue, my tanking ability is behind both knights and warriors, as well as equally geared beastlords.  The disparity between paladin and ranger classes in their ability to heal is way out of balance.... but you know what, I'm sensible enough to realize that if I get the ability to tank like a knight and heal like a paladin, I will be jsut a bit overpowered.  I can stand at range all day and plink away, healing the healers in my group, and if shit hits the fan I can surely run in and tank the boss mob.  It just doesn't happen.  We all have our niches, and while I'll admit that I'd love to see some things about my class boosted, I'd never want to tank equally to a knight, the difference between warriors and knights and between knights and rangers should be about equal, and in the high end its getting there, for if I did tank like a knight then why am I playing a ranger?  Truth be told its not hard at all to powerlevel another character up to 65+100 AAs in less than a month... hell PL them up hard and fast to 51, take them to CoM, save them up 30 AAs+ the six in Archetype and you're already a third of the way there... and you could do that in 1 week...<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm bored of you now Arb, gonna go log on and kill some stuff and make fun of paladins.  Hell if I ended up just rambling in my post, I'm sorry, theres just so many times you bother me just by being so pigheaded that you can't see wtf you are really asking for.</div></div><hr />

Equal power dont mean that a cleric tank like a warrior. Equal power is that the clerics healing is as usefull in this game as the warrior tanking. That if you have a ranger, warrior, cleric, knight, wizzard etc. you have an equal use for all this classes. Another exmaple. If you will have balance you have to make the knights 'utility' which you call the knights area as important on raids as the warriors maintanking. A raid should be in the same situation if they dont have a knight and if they dont have a warrior. A raid which dont have a ranger should be in the same situation as a raid which dont have a warrior. The best way to see if the game is balanced for raids is to look what you can do if you miss this classes on raids. Noone can tell me that a raid which dont have a single cleric and single warrior can be as effectiv as a raid which dont have a druid and paladin. Raidbalance = every class is 100% needed for raids and everyclass has his owne job. Or every class can get 100% replaced with other classes. That is balance for me. Create 16 jobs and make every class the specialist for this and only this class can do it. Or make 4 jobs and let 4 classes be able to do this job. Not the bullshit we have now with 5 jobs and 2 out of this 5 jobs are only doable from 1 classes and the other 14 classes have to fight for the other 3 roles. I unterstand that you like this because you are the king of the hill. But this is not balance.<br />

Paladin can heal, and SK can pump mana more efficiently than anyone else with ZBite + Ancient.  Both are vital roles to a raid even if it's not what you signed up to do.

The best way to see if the game is balanced for raids is to look what you can do if you miss this classes on raids. Noone can tell me that a raid which dont have a single cleric and single warrior can be as effectiv as a raid which dont have a druid and paladin. Raidbalance = every class is 100% needed for raids and everyclass has his owne job. Or every class can get 100% replaced with other classes. That is balance for me. Create 16 jobs and make every class the specialist for this and only this class can do it. Or make 4 jobs and let 4 classes be able to do this job. Not the bullshit we have now with 5 jobs and 2 out of this 5 jobs are only doable from 1 classes and the other 14 classes have to fight for the other 3 roles. I unterstand that you like this because you are the king of the hill. But this is not balance.<br />

Well..you would be right except that a ranger and paladin are Hybrids.  They are a lesser mix of 2 classes which means they don't have any &quot;must have&quot; abilities; they bring nice buffs and backup to other classes to a raid.  Rangers do decent dps, have nice attack buffs, and can spot heal fairly well.  Paladins can offtank, have BSS, res, and pretty nice spot heals and group heals.</div></div><hr />

For you hyprids are subclasses and need to be weaker because they are mixed classes and can do more then one thing. They need to get extra penaltys because this. To bad EQ has no use for this. <br />
<br />
This is like you have 100 US$ (Warrior) another guy has 100 Euro (Cleric) (1 euro = 1 US$ to make it easier). Now you are hungry and you can buy a big meal for 100US$ or another big meal for 100 Euro. Both get happy and solved there hunger. Now you think balance is that you give someone 75US% and 25Euro (Knight). He now have the same as the other two guys. This is rght, but aslong he can not transform his 25 Euro to 25 US$ or his 75US$ to 75Euro he can not buy the meal. Because the meal cost 100 Euro or US$. So he keep hungry because he can not get the needed 100. What the designer done is created a lower meal for 75 and keep the big meal for 100. If they will have balanced they should have created another big meal for 75US$ and 25Euro (offtanking). Then the guy with 100US$, the guy with 100Euro and the guy with 75US$ and 25Euro are in the same situation. Because everyone can buy one big meal but only one meal. Not that the one with 100 US$ can buy the big and the lower meal and can choose which he want. <br />

Gave them all the closest to equal gear that I could, while still maintaining FT/focus effects/etc. No loot from Noquiefel or above. I'm aware theres a few flaws to them.  I'm aware the warrior is an iksar and thats a 35ish? AC bonus or such, just didnt want to click create a character again.  Didn't include AC augs either.  As for the shield thing, thats a whole different topic for the knight/war classes so I just added in alternate magelos.  The War/SK are 20hp behind the range due to the ranger using a bow which would have a DD aug on it rather than an hp.  If anyone has any suggestions for them, I'll correct them. <br />
<br />
What do I suggest for the tanking issues? I suggest bumping the Knight's up to -1DI and bumping Warriors up to -2DI.  This would further separate the Knights from the light tanks while keeping the warrior ahead of the Knights. Knights should be given a Ripo/Parry Discipline so picking up aggro without dying won't be a miracle.  Together, these two would not make Knights better at tanking (or even the prefferred exp group tank like in PoP).  However, it would help us get the job done in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Arbosch, I think your opening statement is flawed.  Nobody (at least no posts I've read here) is stating that knights should be weaker than warriors.  What is being said is they should be weaker at tanking  than warriors.  The reason for that belief is knights bring more utility to the table than warriors.  <br />
<br />
The goal is to have the classes balanced overall - this doesn't mean that class A is equivalent to class B in any particular ability - it means that when all abilities are considered, the classes are equally desired overall  in the game.  <br />
<br />
This also doesn't mean that for specific encounters each class is equally desired - it means for the game as a whole they are equally desired (which, IMHO, is too complex to achieve, but SoE seems to do a good job of this overall.)</div></div><hr />

So you dont want balance. You will keep your status. Myanta at the moment is half burning in fire from the knight community because his comments. You allso know that myanta is not a raiding knight. So he not play in the area where knights utility get less and less usefull. So your argument is, that knights should be happy aslong they are happy (lowlevel area) and if they get unhappy because there tools get neutrlized from the mobdesign and they loose more and more power against the other classes they shall quit the game. Sound very ood if you ask me.<br />

No they make a real bad job. There dont exist balance when you have that a high need for 2 classes out of 16 and you need to have near 1/5 (4 warriors / 8 clerics out of 54) to be one of this two classes. That is not balance. Balance is when you can make a raid of 54 with 3 or 4 from each class and then you should have the most effectiv raid because yuo have the best possible classbalance. Not that you have the most effectiv raid when you have 4 warrior, 8 cleric, 1 shaman, 1 enchanter, 1 or 2 bard and the rest roques and wizzards. That is simple not balance.<br />
<br />
In the moment situation balance will be that a warrior is asgood in a groupe as a knight is as maintank in a raid. Then the balance is that warrior are the raidingtank and the knight is the groupetank (Something i dont like but then you have balance). You dont have to touch boths skill. Only give every exp mob a 30 sec. 1000dmg ae proc. You will have troubles to do your job as groupetank because you will need more healing on the other groupemember and knights are the unmatched groupetank with our groupeheals (give shadowknights groupelifetaps). You make our utility then usefull for groups like your disciplines are usefull on raids. The balance exist in that you are the best raidtank and we are the best groupetank then.<br />

paladins were given 1 k group heal(s) , a healing over time spell , a self buff that stacks with every thing and brells  if you choose not to use them to there full potiental that is your fault.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you can tank a boss mob just like a warrior + the mentioned spells above what would be the point of being a warrior?<br />
<br />
now you said you are having a tough time in gates , well to let you know something we are all having a tough time in gates not just paladins. i have failed a lot of tipit and vexed runs but you dont hear me complaining on any board because i love the challenge.<br />
<br />
<br />
There will never be equals amoung class's in everquest you will have to understand this because it will never happen because /omg there would be no need to be anything but class a or class b.<br />
<br />
you say that warriors have this snap aggro with incite , well lets have a shaman or enchanter or beastlord slow on inc and me hit incite without a proc off and see who has aggro. warriors needed the incite because dude it was pitaful to wait for 2 procs to slow or debuff.<br />
<br />
you want balance because you want to have everything that a warrior has but think of what a warriors again and you should come up with better tanking /oh my<br />
<br />
do you expect to go threw something and not loose or fail ? do you expect not to wipe atleast 5 times while learning a encounter? see thats the questins you have to ask yourself when going to gates or anything new for that matter.<br />
<br />
the content was ment to push everyone to there limits it isnt a walk in the park it is ment to be balls to the walls and luck. <br />
<br />
now you say you want to have a auto parry disc , i ask this questin why? because we get it? gues how many times in a exp or raid for that matter i use furious or fortitude ? well i can name one for fortitude<br />
<br />
btw i never use defensive in a group and if i have to and its not in gates then the healer sucks and i leave the group.<br />
<br />
i use it when i am on rampage to get the druids some time and really it isnt even needed then.<br />
<br />
<br />
but lets say your spaming your group heals , single target heals during a raid you just did a vital part in the raid by keeping thoose alive in your group and if you dont like that part in the raid o well i guess rangers and druids didnt think they would be kiting adds around 50% of the raids either now did they?<br />
<br />
paladins should be viable group tanks ( and they are ) you are just not playing to your best ability you are not giving it your all i should say.<br />
<br />
if you choose not to play your ass off you have no right to complain at all , i know tons of pally's who use there group heals for aggro in gates you dont have to rely on stuns and you have taunt /oh my it may not be the best method but its what we got right?<br />

<br />
I refer you to my earlier post  (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?p=119588#post119588) on this very thread as to Zbite and it's on-paper-only effiency. More, the idea of defining a class by an Ancient spell is ludicrious. This is the same as telling a warrior to go home and diddle himself until he has a Brutish Blade of Balance. <br />
<br />
SKs are secondary tanks, we are pullers, we are DPS, we are kiters, we can even be called buffers with the torrent/aura lines, but to define us as mana pumps via a resistable, and for the grand majority of SKs, single spell is roughly as ludicrous as defining a wizard by his ability to DS. I mean, they've got two spells in the line! They even stack with mage/druid DSes! The enchanter, bard, beastlord, and quite probably the necro all feed mana more effectively than the SK, and it's a good thing too, because we're not supposed to be some wizard's mana whore. There are plenty of other roles we've had that we'd like to be desirable at again, thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

Arbosh - if you want to be the best at a particular aspect, play a specialist class.  If you want versatility play a hybrid.  If you want to do cutting edge content, understand that specialists are often required for select roles.  (and mandatory single group content is a horrible game design IMHO - and SoE has said as much...so I don't think attempting to create class balance for GoD trials is warranted)<br />
<br />
Concerning content design - I'm not in upper GoD zones yet so I don't have the personal experience to state what each class can and can't do.  I do know that in PoP and prior expansions there are plenty of raid targets where knights play a substantial role (sometimes MA, usually secondary/add tanking.)  From posts I've seen here, it also sounds like there are plenty of raid roles for knights in GoD (of course, I'm only going off other people's statements since I'm not there myself.)<br />
<br />
By the way, paladins (not sure about SK's) are already the preferred group tank outside GoD.  The ability to quickly lock agro (without relying on the RNG) is a huge advantage in an xp group - especially when coupled with the utility of the spell book.  <br />
<br />
One more comment - please take this as the constructive comment that it's meant to be - the grammar in your posts makes it very difficult to understand what you are saying.

Also realize that there are so many Warriors, Clerics, and Wizards in the game precisely because some players were attracted to focused classes that are and should be superior in their area of focus and therefor have been in high demand by raiding guilds..<br />
<br />
There are easily 200-400 12K HP buffed Warriors and less than 100 (guessing) 10500 HP buffed Paladins. This is despite the fact that Warriors are totally group dependent.<br />
<br />
Given a long history of guilds needing 4-8 well equipped Warriors minimum, players strove to fill those vacancies.<br />
<br />
MAing Saryn and RZ adds, being the preferred MT vs CT and Inny, and being invaluable with groups heals and GRC when doing Quarm amply illustrates the usefullness of Paladins in PoTime.<br />
<br />
Group heals again doing QVic armor droppers and several other post Kod'Taz raids are important. There's not to my experiance a yardtrash mob in QVic that I use Defensive on - they're ALL Paladin tankable.<br />
<br />
Yoy've just been campaining for unrealistic and unneeded changes for so long, you won't gear up at this point and prove yourself wrong. I don't know if it's self-pity or anger that Warriors are no longer the #3 tank on everthing except the raid boss mob. Whatever it is, it's driving you from a game and a class that is without a doubt the best designed, most versatile, and most powerful overall Tank in EQ.<br />
<br />
Truthfully - If I hadn't invested 4 years into a Warrior, I very probably would be playing a Paladin - he wouldn't be sub-7000HP's unbuffed and I would not be posting Defensiv is broken. I know and appreciate a Paladin's strengths even if you do not.<br />

<br />
I ma for my guild and most of our knights tank all the same group stuff that I do.In many cases they are a better choice for groups that may lack particular skills in their make up.Thats why hybrids are desirable groupmates.They bring a variety of things to the table to make up for group weakness's,although they do nothing (or should not)as well as their parent classes  in their respective fields...ie Tanking is a warrior's field of expertise.<br />
<br />
When you are raiding experts in most fields are present so a hybrid's usefulness should diminsh in contrast to grouping.They still contribute a lot with their versatility though.<br />

I think SK'S need some love to better balance with their knightly cousins.However, I'd like to see this come from improvement to their spellbooks where the inequality is drawn from.I don't know about raiding time and god,but, the knights in my guild have more work to do than most of our warriors when we're killing stuff.</div></div><hr />

Our guild has a high need for knights because they most of the time raid with no real knight on. But we have people which can log me or other knights in for brells. The us i have on raids is to brell the raid. This can be another person which log me in and cast this spell. Knights rarly get loot because we rarly on raids and rarly get points.

Well folks, since Arbosch isn't a raiding knight, he even said so himself, though people log him on for raids while his acct is expired, he really has no point making comments, just like Mylantra.  The point I was trying to make Arb is that if your guild is actively recruiting paladins and you have one that is already guilded, why the hell aren't you playing him?  It sounds like your guild could use his services in a raid setting... if all they need a paladin for is to brells they can just as easily have someone box a pally, just like you said.  However, they show a need for paladins to be recruited so for some reason they must need them for more than simply casting a brell here and there.  I'm starting to get the feeling that you are just trolling the warrior boards for your own entertainment... wonder if anyone else gets the same feeling...</div></div><hr />

I simple dont call this balance because this system dont work in EQ. You have jobs to do and how good you do this job is the part where you see how usefull you are. If the job is allways better done from specialist there simple dont exist a need for the secondary classes. You berhaps think that is the way EQ should work and if the designer think this berhaps to. But that is not how EQ worked the last 5 years. <br />

And you can keep your comments about that i search the godstatus. If i search the godstatus i will try to get the stuns spells upgraded that i total dominate every warrior for every content where stuns work. Stuns are like defensiv a tool which scale up with the mobs dps. You only have 3 minutes of glory with defensiv. I can keep the glory up the full time if stuns work. Stuns will not be a balanceable tools. I allso dont think that it work to balance out defensiv with stuns. Both are unbalanceable and this dont create balance. So the best way to create balance is to remove both tools and balance it right.<br />

On pvp server it is not smart to 2box characters. It is a little hard to pvp with 2 characters. Allso we dont really like it to have log in warrior, clerics or other classes. Simple because there should never be a need for it to log them in. We do it when it is needed, but it dont have to like us. So it is better to have a real knight playing then someone which move 'arbosch' arround.<br />

Just because a given class isn't the best at one particular aspect of the game doesn't mean it's not a useful addition in most raid and group settings.  Think about druids for a second.  They are not the best at anything, yet they are very useful as secondary classes in a variety of roles.  If you only want healing, clerics are better.  If you only want dps, wizards are better.  If you want CC, enchies are better.  But, if you want a class that can perform a variety of roles, druids beat all 3 of those classes hands down.<br />
<br />
A strategy that is based on the principle that the only way to balance classes is to have everyone be a specialist in one area isn't realistic given the number of classes in EQ.  <br />
<br />
The strategy of having a few specialist classes and a bunch of hybrid classes is the only viable option with the number of classes in EQ.  This is also the strategy that (IMHO) has been successfully employed ever since EQ was released.  Yes, there have been hiccups along the way (sometimes due to class issues, sometimes content issues), but overall this strategy has worked quite well - otherwise the game wouldn't still be here today. ;)</div></div><hr />

Forgive me for saying this oh mighty and powerful zekker, but if you are only logging them on in a raid setting for nothing other than follow you around and buff, who cares if he dies if pvp happens?  The point is, your guild wants more paladins, because people like you sniffle and hide and gripe and bitch and moan and etc etc so you don't play your class, hurting your guild.  If all they wanted a paladin for was to be a brell bitch I doubt they'd have their desireabiltiy at medium, put it at low.  You are bitching about not being able to tank ground breaking content when your character hasn't even been used in months?  Maybe I'm not endgame but when I was in a guild breaking into elementals we had some pretty well geared paladins, equivalent gear to the warriors and able to tank anything we needed save  brutal mobs, so you obviously can't be complaining about that aspect of it.  I've seen paladins less geared than you successfully tank sewers trials, so you can't be complaining about that aspect of it.  You let your account run out on 03.08.2004, and your guild just beat Ikkinz 4 on June 2, 2004... so you can't be complaining much about any of the KT+ content.  The only 2 places that I can think of that you might have such a problem with is Time and Tipt/Vxed.  Now, I know that Paladins perform well in time, and have a number of encounters where they prove useful, though I'll admit I haven't raided there yet, if there is anything contradictory to what I said please feel free to inform me.  And the Tipt/Vxed trials were fixxed and from the tone of many SOE posts I&quot;ve seen they will probably be veering away from single group flagging content.  Though I do like the idea of having the choice between one group content and raid ala Rondo vs. Sewers.  I'm just having a hard time understanding what it is you are having such a problem with... as a ranger I can tank anything but nameds in PoE, which I've seen Knights do successfully, I've tanked sewer trials, Hard LDoN, and Tipt named before.  Granted none of this is end game/cutting edge stuff, but its things that many many people have access to, and stuff that Arbosch would have access to.  You are simply undergeared for the content that you are referring to, and, moreover, you have in fact admitted to and stated that you quit playing over 4 months ago, along with the majority of paladins (who are also hurting in the gear department when compared to content), so you really have no 1st hand frame of reference.  Your guild wants more knights, so they consider them needed moderatly, what is your problem?  I challenge you with this, if every class should have its own job that its best at, tell me what you would propose for each class, I want specifics too, though I doubt you'll take the time to do this.   Anyways, I'm late for dinner.</div></div><hr />

Well you should read me postings. First i am not an mighty and powerful zekker. I started on vallon because i want kill dark races as paladin. Not becuase i am kwel and owne this or that. I allso know that pvp in EQ is the worst way to handle pvp. I dont need skill. The class i play and the gear i have make me simple superior to 95% of the players which play on this server.<br />
<br />
The problem i have is simple. At the moment the balance isnt that bad. But why isnt it that bad? Simple because they lowered the mobs dps general and removed defensiv on groupecontent which are rewarding (flag, items etc.). The remove from defensiv made this game more or less balanced at the moment. But the way the removed defenisv is a workarround. If in OOW you have single groupe stuff which is rewarding and should be a challenge for a groupe with knight and warrior it is simple not balanceable. You can not balance it the way defensiv work. This unbalance will get even worser and will get knights more and more troubles to get there offtanking job. Simple because the gap between a defensiv warrior and a knight is growing and growing.<br />

So, you are saying here that the only real problem is 1 group content as far as defensive goes.  Its already been stated many times that SOE is thinking that single group required encounters are a bad idea for OOW; furthermore, if they do put them in, then they can just as easily make the boss mobs of said encounters defensive immune, just like Tipt.  There is no reason whatsoever by your reasoning that Defensive needs to be removed from the game.  You are talking in circles, and I think everyone knows and realizes it but you.  You avoid the fact that you aren't playing anymore and thus can't have any first hand knowledge about which you speak.  Forgive the abrasiveness in assuming all zekkers are morons, I've just seen it as being all too common in serverwide channels, I let myself slip and the ignorance of stereotyping take over on that one.  I apologize.  You still didn't explain why two boxxing in a raid environment is such a bad idea.  You still didn't explain, in any real concrete fashion, why your guild is looking for Paladins when they have you that refuses to play your character.  Like I said, you avoid the issues that you don't have a solid answer too and which won't help your cause, and continue talking in circles.  You must understand that you are fighting a losing battle here.  Hell, the only reason I even post anymore is cuz my dad's comp is too crappy to play EQ effectively, so all I'm really able to do is scan forums, you just seem to not get it.  There was already a 27(?) page post going over this exact same thing, I suggest you read it, if you haven't already, and realize that you aren't going to get anywhere with this issue as long as you continue to ask for the same thing.  Your arguments aren't changing anyone's opinions and/or stance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If single group contents are really such a big problem they could just make every boss you've to beat hit for exactly 500 damage and never miss unless a special defense skill check is successful (riposte/dodge/parry).  No way to ever use any defensive discs besides Furious line.  And by the way, there are mobs that behave like I described at least in part, like the Kyv named in the Qinimi 18 group event, Custodian of Righteousness in Ikkinz, or Anuek named in Txevu.<br />
<br />
The fact that this isn't done leads me to believe this isn't really a problem, but if it is, the tools exist to fix it without needing to change anything fundamental.</div></div><hr />
