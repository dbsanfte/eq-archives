<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the setting. I am a lv52 Warrior and duo 99% of the time with a lv45 Cleric. Do I kill the cleric and level a Shaman up to mid 40s to group with or do I consider getting a ToD? I currently am questing the Eyepatch of Plunder which will give me a total of 41% haste when combined with my FBSS. I have heard wide ranges of success with the ToD. Some people say its worthless that its always resisted and rarely proc's even with 155 dex. When I asked what rarely ment they told me about 1 in 3 mobs when duoing. On the other hand I have heard it proc's nearly every mob with only a 100ish dex and that its good well up into the 60's. I come to my trusted fellow warriors to find the true answer. The ToD normaly runs between 6k and 10k on my server. If I buy it, it will take most of the pp I have saved but will it be worth it? It would be very unlikely to happen but should I wait and level up some more and try to get in a group where I would have a chance to loot the Willsapper? Is there some other slowing weapon out there that I am not aware of? On a side note... I had some guy laughing at me last night because I am lv52 and upgrading my armor to dwarf cultural and any cobalt I can find that is cheap. Thats the low end cultural not the underfoot. Am I really that far behind other untwinked early lv50 players? I have around 2350hp, 925ac, 965 atk. Here are the 3 items I talked about incase people dont remember exactly what each one is.

<br />
I'm a 65 Warrior and I still keep ToD in my weapons bag. I use it for soloing big green mobs when I'm bored and when I need to be an emergancy slower. It is amazing just how high the mobs are that it will slow. Sure, you will get resists but so do Shamen.<br />
<br />
Look at the ratio, 33/44 - not good but not bad. When it hasn't procced you are still doing damage. If it was 44/44 people would be extolling it's virtues from the mountaintops.<br />
<br />
Soloing (no Cleric ;) ) regularly for exp until about level 60, I used ToD, Obsidean Great Axe, and Silken Whip of Ensnaring to fear kite.<br />
<br />
IMO ToD is a must own weapon for mid-level warriors.<br />

Willsapper is awesome as aggro and has decent ratio as well but is main hand only.<br />
And unless you have a tracker placed in Dragon Necropolis and a guild to support you, you wont get to drop Vaniki around your level.<br />
I was level 56 or so and we took him with like 4 groups and still a few died due to adds.<br />
No way a single low 50s group can get him.<br />
But that was shortly after Luclin release and almost noone in guild was 60.<br />
Only other slow proc weapon is wavecrasher that you could buy or camp.<br />
Drops in sirens grotto, has 20 percent slow proc and can be camped by a single group although it might be hard at your level to resist the chanter type mobs.<br />
<br />
On your stats, i think your AC is a bit low for 52.<br />
But hard to say without a profile.<br />
I think i had more than 1k AC at 52 and that was before i joined my current guild and we were raiding PoH and later Halls of Testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have spent most of my career duoing with a Druid.  I think both she and I would agree that my ToD is perhaps the most useful weapon I own.  Currently I group mostly with the Druid, a Paladin and a Ranger so we are w/o conventional slowers and I still use the ToD.  When I'm not grouping I just pretend to be a solo class in PoJ and once again the ToD is what allows me to do that.<br />
<br />
For me it seems to proc pretty reliably.  I have noticed that if I get a resist then I will almost always get a hit within 2-3 swings of the resist.  And what other class besides a Warrior would look at that and say...&quot;oooh a resist :)&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
All warriors should have one as it comes in very handy in a pinch. If yer duoing with a cleric, you'd really see its benefits.<br />

There are some cheap cheap upgrades that you could prob buy to increase your stats.<br />
<br />
As for the ToD, it didnt proc well for me.  I started using it around lvl 55 or so but my 2hb skill was low.  I guess Ill give it another shot now that Ive raised that skill.  Hopefully it'll work better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mightie Gnome</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buy a ToD, and don't sell it, ever, ever, ever.<br />
<br />
It's priceless when duoing with a cleric.  He'll have more mana and you'll have less downtime.  It help your lack or AC big time.  I've used mine for a while and I'd say it procs on 80% of the mobs I fight.  Have a good dps weapon to switch out once it procs.  I use a black acylia halberd and that works good for me.  As far as your armor goes, post a maglio and a budget and the people here can help you out big time!  Even if they don't I will (I know some are tired of the help me with my gear posts, but hey, if the advice is good people will always ask).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On CY mobs it procs about three-five times a fight. maybe 1/8 get resisted. I have about 130 dex unbuffed but always with a sham or ench so usually at about 160/170.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't buy mine till lvl 65 because slow wasn't needed so much in the old days.<br />
<br />
However, I would agree with what most here are saying. Buy it, and never sell it! I duo with a 62 cleric in plane of storms alot and the 2 of us can take the Giants there np using TOD for slow. Even if no slow proc I can tank one unslowed but the cleric is oom at the end of the fight. With my ToD, assuming it procs before the mob is 50 life the cleric will end up 80 mana at the end of the fight and xp per kill is exactly 5 % aaxp. I would never sell my ToD, you never know when it might save your life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragan</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have dualboxed with a cleric since around level 53 and I wouldn't want to be without my ToD. It procs pretty reliable for me at dex 139, usually at least 2-3 times per fight although on occasion it doesn't proc at all or when the mob is at 1% health and fleeing, weee ;)<br />
<br />
As for your stats, at your level my stats looked a lot like yours (HP 2234, AC 951) and I was never in a particularly uber guild and I seem to recall being in mainly the old human cultural, some cobalt and some thurg at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodi</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As otehrs have stated, buy the ToD and always have it with you.  I duo box much with my cleric and when I can't get a group I just pull out the ToD and start taking out mobs in PoD/PoN.  I have a dex of 169 and ToD procs for me at least once every mob.  I get resist every now and then but not overly noticable.  <br />
<br />
Its also a life saver in raids and exp groups when the chanter/shaman goes down early due to tash/malo aggro.  I just whip out the ole trusty ToD and can get lucky in landing a slow soon into the fight.  Would highly recommend as a very nice to have item for all warriors.</div></div><hr />

It got me through Exe trials when the enc died before the executioner got slowed, as well as helping me kill countless BoT 8 hour spawn mobs (when the enc or shammy gets eaten prior to slow).  You never know when this weapon will come in handy... any tank without one should be hanged.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't get one til 65 either and while I rarely use it, I do always keep it with me.  Having 50% slow at your disposal for the uncommon scenarios when you don't have a slower can be very handy at times.  Unlike the overpriced Fungi tunic I highly recommend that every warrior pick up one of these things.  If you get it in the mid levels you'll use it alot.  If you get it when you're 65 you probably won't use it much but you'll love having it available when you need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zethallon</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't pick mine up till around level 60.  Although I will agree with the previous posters that it's rarely used at higher levels, it's nice to have it in a pinch where a slow would really help you or your group out in a pinch.  It's one of the more fun weapons that I've had in my EQ career.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToD is simply an amazing weapon.  I always have one on me, as does almost every warrior.  Recently even used it to solo Warlord Skargus.  Proc's a good amount for me, and I've rarely seen it resisted.  As for your stats, I was worse off at that level heh.  The other items you listed: willsapper you have almost no chance at getting any time soon.  Vaniki is often watch for by guilds so they can equip their tanks with the willsapper (good aggro weapon), also it's % slow isn't as good as ToD anyway.  Eyepatch of plunder is fairly easy, but extremely boring to camp.  Expect spending a lot of time sitting around, and possibly even ks'd on Stormfeather (two sk's were hanging out at stormfeather spawn when I did him, one openly said he would be trying to take SF, luckily they got bored and left before he spawned).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you guys are over stating a point, I carried one around from lev 50 to 65 and only ever used it once in Chardok. <br />
<br />
I made the decision to sell mine about a month ago - fearing some thunderbolt would strike me for leaving it out of my weapons bag. I havent missed it one bit to be honest.<br />
<br />
My caveat is - I never group without a slower, and I dont think I have ever duoed for xp post 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been the Main Slower for EXP groups on more than one occaision in PoP, it's defintitely situational, but boy will your group/guild mates love you when you pop it out and start the exp flowing again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh. otoh i think most of shikarii's exp'ing/douing up to level 60 ( back than ) with my wife has made the Trunch of Doom irreplacable..i don't know how i'd gotten to level 50 without one :D<br />
<br />
even as a tank mezzer on raids i could bust out the Trunch and ghetto swap in the JBoW and could sit there all day tanking. a while ago when fire AE's were broke; DL was prepping for dozer and we had a red drake add on one of the wurms and i basically tanked it down solo by swapping JBoW and ToD.<br />
<br />
if you're pretty much solidified into getting a group with friends/etc daily; than the ToD is basically useless. but to someone who uses soloing as a means for exp up to level 60 or so than a ToD is worth every penny you spent buying it or every minute you spent camping the drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if you do usually work in exp groups, it is still precious to pull out after the slower is dead and there's still mobs standing around.<br />
<br />
Sure it's situational, but it only takes one situation (like finally succeeding executioner trial on the 26th attempt because of it) to remind you of how precious it is.  Anyone who sells theirs will find themselves in a world of hurt 2 weeks later when they realized it coulda saved their ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToD is situational but I will never sell mine. I remember a few times in HoT when we were just getting used to things and the only sham / ench would die.  After all convential hopes of a slow were gone it's always good to see the shout:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO ToD is something every Warrior over the level of 50 should have in their inventory just in case.  Yes, if you group regularly with a slower you may not get much use out of it.  But if you ever find yourself in a situation where the slower is killed or no slower is available, it makes things possible that would otherwise not be possible.  I've double boxed in Umbral planes with my Warrior and Cleric and without the ToD the down time would have been a lot longer and the chances of the Cleric running OOM mid battle would have been much higher.</div></div><hr />
