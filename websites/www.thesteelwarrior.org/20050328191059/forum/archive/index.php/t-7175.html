(And what an unmitigated suck of a time sink it was... Getting that damn key nearly drove me out of the game.  And now to wait for two months until our rotation time comes up. Instanced zone! Instanced zone!) <br />
<br />
Had a question that I suppose I should have asked when I was starting as opposed to when just done:  Does anyone know of any patterns to the shard drops?  It really seemed streaky... You either got a bunch of shards in one session or you were there beating away on low xp mobs for hours at a time with no luck.  <br />
<br />
Some time of day?  Some mob up that prevents shard drops? Lower drop rates on weekends?  Just plain random and it only seems like you hit streaks?   <br />
<br />
Just trying to make this less of a complete pain in the butt for the next guy to come along.  Tho really I suppose I shouldn't.</div></div><hr />

Certain mob names are more likely (sometimes the only) droppers. Some places, the deeper you go the more they drop. It's just a crappy set of camps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you play any dice orientated games will see this, like Risk or D&amp;D.</div></div><hr />

Lot of those places can be solid spots to exp in if you do em at the right level. At 65 its just a grind. Grats on key :)</div></div><hr />

The Emp key parts actualy pulled our guild closer together but shards... Uggg, glad it's over and done with.</div></div><hr />
