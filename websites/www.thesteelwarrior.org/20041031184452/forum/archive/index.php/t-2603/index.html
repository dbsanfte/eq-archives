They aren't as bad as ubers like to say, and the amount I get inspected is a riot.  First five minutes I received prolly 15 tells askin me what the weapons were, in PoK.  From newbs or not, it added to the excitement of killin the queen B*TCH in chardok=))<br />
Would take me 20k to beat them in bazaar, but mebbie I'll leave the cash in the bank, to earn some interest....oh, wait, THAT would be too complex /grin.</div></div><hr />

my only question is would the 175dd offset the 200 less agro from an EB proc weapon. I am doing my epics but the 1hs versions will probably not see the light of day as my 1 handers i feel are better but the 2 hand version is very tempting for a decent ratio mixture of DD and agro proc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive had my Epics for a while and must say the aggro from them doesn't appear to be 500, I have a CHSD I use as main weapon which is 450 hate and holds alot better than epic, not to mention 14/24 is just lowsy, and the dmg on 2H is sad indeed , GSoT out aggros and out damages the 2H not to mention 2H procs maybe once per fight. <br />
War epics are the only melee Epic that is bagged the day its earned by alot of people, and the hardest to aquire at that, with the least useful utility, BST- RNG 50% slow/ 40% haste procs, ROG Haste, Monk insta cast haste 40% haste, War epics really are from the land of yesteryear too bad really cuz they are nice looking. <br />
If they lopped delay on them to 14/18 , even 14/19 , and the Tactics effect Rage of Tallon was right click insta cast and 2H dropped to 31/36 and bumped Rage of Vallon and Rage of Zek to 700 hate then there would be a lot of Warriors out there with a real shot at an EB weapon, this could solve a few issues with aggro. I for one would like to see Warriors weilding thier Epics<br />
Its sad once you hit 65 alot of people giggle at you when using your epics :mad: mainly because they're less useful than what you can buy in the bazaar for 10K (bout the same price as the red scale)<br />
<br />
Dam while writing this reply I realized how pissed that makes me I spent a year working on my Epic and they're useless to me now, dam it SoE make some changes to these things, you want to play Warriors on the Itemization screw than dam it make this shit useful :mad:  make Epics Enraging Blow !!! and faster..<br />
And grats Werekin !</div></div><hr />
