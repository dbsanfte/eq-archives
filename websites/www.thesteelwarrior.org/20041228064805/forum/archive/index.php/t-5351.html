<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For ALL** FUCKING WARRIOR USABLE WEAPONS that are NOT a Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, Bloodfrenzy, or a Darkblade of the Warlord the following applies -  <br />
<br />
For Main hand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = 1.5 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 2 proc/min<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX =  .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
<br />
This applies for proc augments, spell procs, as well as innate procs. Augmented and spell procs are actually very slightly lower due to a weapon only being able to proc once per swing and innate procs getting the first opportunity to proc. Proc rates DO stack, a weapon with 2 procs will proc at 2x the rate associated with your DEX.<br />
<br />
The only weapons that have been show to have different proc rates are BBoE, BF, and DBotW, all of which have a substantially higher proc rate. There are also some caster weapons - cleric hammers, Greatstaff of Power, etc. that also have higher proc rates, but those are useless to a warrior.<br />
<br />
** All means every WARRIOR USABLE weapon you can think of. All of them. Even your snare whip, fleshgrinder, primal, frostbringer, wavecrasher, and uber proc weapon_03. All of them. If you find one that is NOT 2 proc/min then please post a parse because those weapons are rare.<br />

<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
 <br />
<br />
All 2handers have the same rate as a main hand weapon.<br />
<br />
And this is based on a lot of testing done on these boards.</div></div><hr />

I know you said it applies to augments as well as innate procs but do these rates apply per proc or per weapon? In other words with an Anger III augment on my Hategiver, with 305 dex will I get 2 procs/min from both EB and Anger or just 2 procs/min for the weapon?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Wrong conclusion for the removal of the aug slots.<br />
<br />
Follow the logic here -- Primals created an enormous boost in power for any guild.  Simply hitting ST and getting every melee a primal weapon increased your entire guild's DPS by 10%, easily.  They're so overpowered that people swap in primal for the proc all the way thru the elemental planes until they hit the worn ATK cap.  It stands to reason that SoE knows damned well how ridiculously out of balance Primals are, and the last thing that they want to do at this time is promote more usage of already overpowered weapons (IE : Anger 3 on your Primal dual wield setup).<br />
<br />
It had nothing to do with the proc rate, and everything to do with discouraging people from using Primals.  I'm sure that's why they proc the version of avatar that counts against the ATK cap too.</div></div><hr />

That's really not long enough to make any kind of objective statement. 4hours and I'll start to take it seriously, but 8hours and I'll consider it fact. With the quirkiness of the RNG, it takes quite a bit of time for the funny streaks and spikes and whatnot to smooth themselves out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuniargo</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Current assumptions:<br />
 Dual wield generally procs more often then a two hander.<br />
 Fast weapons generally get more riposite damage then slow weapons.<br />
 Slow weapons proc at the same rate over time as fast weapons.<br />
 Dual wield generally has 1.5x the proc'ing potential then using a two hander.<br />
So basically what I want in my weapons are the following:<br />
 Two one handers.<br />
 High delay to prevent significant riposite damage.<br />
 An aggro proc.<br />
 High damage value to compensate for high delay.<br />
One problem with my view of a good warrior weapon is probably the extra hate gained from lower delay weapons applying their damage bonus more often.  They sure didn't make weapon choice too clear hehe...<br />
<br />
For instance, if you had the following weapons which would you use in primary and which in secondary?<br />
<br />
High Delay:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/fpics/hooked_soshar.jpg<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics19/FlameforgeHammer.gif<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/rpics/delightful_orb_of_forgotten_magic.jpg<br />
<br />
- or -<br />
<br />
Low Delay:<br />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/rpics/Braided_Strands_of_Corrupted_Mana.jpg<br />
(no proc, but how much would the low delay's damage bonus factor into hate?)<br />
<br />
Would be fun to make some type of formula to determine average hate over time factoring in proc hate, damage bonus hate, etc.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure this is not the case. I just hate when people state as fact something they can not prove (even if it is true).<br />
<br />
We can say for absolute certainty that a BF is an exception to the rule because we have hard data to show it. But when you take this information, along with the few other parses, and cast a general statement such as &quot;all&quot; and &quot;never&quot;, you open yourself up for looking like a fool.<br />
<br />
Here is how your responses should read when someone questions whether weapon xyz 'fits' or 'doesn't fit' into the results of the testing:<br />
<br />
After testing several different proc rates, it has been concluded that a majority of procs fall into the 2ppm with 305 dex category. There are currently 3 notable exceptions (fill in list here), but at this time, those are the only ones found to be outside the standard. The possibility exists, however slim, that there exists other weapons with procs that also fall outside the standard. If you feel that weapon does not fall into the standard, parse it for an extended amount of time, and post the results here. You will most likely find that it does, in fact, fall within the standard. But I can not say this 100% certainty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now see...that wasn't so hard, was it?<br />
<br />
BTW, I have never accepted &quot;That's just how I am&quot; as a valid excuse for being a jackass :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could argue with you, but it's been said about 50 times on this board, by about 50 different people.  We are fucking right on this.  We being me, Wandor, Brutul, Emilia, and anyone else who fucking tells you that weapons proc 2 goddamned times per minute at max dex.  I'm sick of explaining it for the fucking short bus kids.  If you wanna sit here and think you're special because you thought of something that no one else did, go talk to Ahz, because we had that exact same conversation last week and he knows exactly what the deal is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...Mr.Jackass....I made absolutly no claims that any weapon did or didn't fit the mold.  And...for the record, I am inclined to agree that all weapons use the same algorythm to randomly generate a proc, thereby making them all exactly the same likelyhood of procing the same amount over time.<br />
<br />
Once again...since reading comprehension seems to be your weak point, if I was a uninformed warrior, and came here to find out that in fact, my xyz weapon does proc the same a every other weapon, I would have to search through 100 posts of your useless drivel of lame putdowns, and colorful expletives, to find the 1 or 2 freaking posts where you actually DID prove this to be the case.<br />
<br />
You are quite fond of stating for a fact things you can not possibly know as fact. You only assume it is fact, because only 3 out of the 20 someodd parses that were posted deviated from the norm, and therefore. it must be true.<br />
<br />
You can respond all you want saying you know it is a fact that 'all' weapons are the same, but unless a dev sent you source code, and the table where proc rates are stored, you are talking out of your ass (regardless of whether you are actually right or not)<br />
<br />
If you are so tired of explaining it to people...why do you? Here is a novel idea...don't! Sure would make it easier to actually find the information people are looking for, instead of wading through your 2225 posts of crap. (Oh wait, you did post a parse in one...2224)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jinaabi. I didn't fall for your bait as such, I looked at your post count and figured a response was needed.  My posting was really intended for everyone, not just you.<br />
<br />
And Haass is certainly right, I got an earful.  And everything I said (and everthing Haass said, for that matter) was drop-dead true.  Doesn't matter - the point is taken.  I'll summarize to ease your pain:<br />
<br />
There are 3 weapons with known to be proccish.  Search to find them.  All other weapons proc 2x per minute yadda yadda.  Of course, if a weapon hasn't been parsed it is possible for it to proc differently.  No one, not even Haass, disputes this.  Don't say you found an exception, however, without parses to back it up or EmiliaEQ will bite you.  The weight of information and experience on this topic is overwhelming.<br />

The reason for the assertiveness on the part of many people here is to keep the casual lurker from seeing something like, &quot;My gnoll-hide lariat procs like 6 times a minute! I know it does!&quot; and believing it.  We're trying to keep the disinformation down.<br />
<br />
If someone thinks that some_weapon_01 procs more or less than 2x per minute, then they should do the community a favor by parsing it and posting the results.  If the results are remarkable they should be prepared to defend the parse.<br />

I don't select a weapon on whether it does or seems to proc more than any other.<br />
<br />
My point (and here is where that reading comprehension part creeps back in) is that you are stating as fact something that you do not know as fact.<br />
<br />
I specifically baited you with the Tentacle Whip because I DID DO an extensive search on the boards to find out if anyone had done a parse on this particualr weapon, and found none.<br />

If you state unequivocally that the Tentacle Whip is a 2ppm weapon, then you are wrong for saying so (once again, whether it is true or not)<br />

Ahz, thankyou for your post. Although it wasn't necessary, it is a perfect model for how people should respond to anyone who questions the validity of information believed to be fact here.<br />

Let me summarize one more time...I have no desire whatsoever to contradict the 2ppm theory at all. I mearly used this situation to point out that stating something as fact, when you can not do so, is wrong.<br />

<br />
THERE IS A DEFAULT PROC RATE FOR WEAPONS.  They are not coded individually.  When they add weapons to the fucking database, they do not go &quot;hrm, how much should we make this weapon proc?&quot;  There are 3 weapons, all from the same zone, and the same fucking expansion which have been proven that they do not meet the default.  There ARE NO MORE.  All of the rest of them, from Original EQ up until now all proc at the same fucking rate.  Are there more exceptions?  Yes, there quite possibly could be, but until someone else comes here and proves it, the fact is that ALL WEAPONS PROC THE SAME.<br />

Stop being a fucking idiot and nitpicking the point.  We don't need to confuse someone who started playing the game 2 weeks ago and just bought an obsidian shard in the bazaar with exceptions that he'll never see.  If you want to know which weapons proc more than others, you can do a search and find them.  If you don't find anything, well then it's 2 procs per fucking minute.  Now how about you sit your ass down, shut the fuck up,  and respect the people who did some fucking work around here, or start doing it yourself.  I'm sick of being belittled by people who have contributed jack and shit to this discussion.  Ahz questioned me, and he put his money where his mouth is.

He's talking about contributing hard data to the ever growing pool of parses on this site.

Also could be attributed to your points in flurry and ferocity.  The check is made per swing, to average out at 2ppm, but you're swinging more than a base level 65 character would.</div></div><hr />

Katta Banker from behind. Primal Velium Battle Axe (2hs).<br />
<br />
Only buff was avatar - I procced it before starting, so it was on constantly during the parse. Worn 41% haste. 1461 Atk. 286 Dex.<br />
<br />
Parse length was 5 hours 41 minutes and 20 seconds (stupid server went down AGAIN while I was parsing).<br />

676 Avatar Procs (1.98 procs per minute)<br />
70 Flurries (.21 flurry per minute)<br />

Conclusion: We expect 2 procs per minute with 305 dex.  My dex was below this for the parse, so I expected to be a little further away from 2 procs per minute than I was.  <br />
<br />
So, this parse, just like my other one, came out with a proc rate just a little higher than I expected (but not really significant.  As Haas pointed out, it is probably due to the extra swings I get from the various AA abilities.<br />

It looks like the primal two hander conforms to the 2 proc per minute rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
I *think* someone else parsed this before, but I can't locate the post... question was: <br />
Does the innate proc rate of a weapon directly affect the proc rate of auguments on that weapon. i.e. BF with aug, does aug proc more often?  Answer IIRC was &quot;no&quot;, and that makes sense from a coding point of view.<br />
<br />
Note that there's also lots of data showing that the following  observations are consistent and probably accurate:<br />
-the EQ RNG is &quot;streaky&quot;<br />
-the &quot;duration&quot; of a particular &quot;good&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; seed is ~ 1 tick<br />
-&quot;success&quot; results from the RNG are all consistent in polarity (i.e. high (or could be low)  = good/successful for all game tests).<br />
<br />
This means that the probabilities for separate events in close time frames are not truly independent;  for proc rates, this means that you'd see measurably fewer &quot;2nd check&quot; procs than expected from straight probability alone.  I think.<br />
<br />
Also, it *appears* that at some point early last year they &quot;fixed&quot; the proc rate code so that the primary hand weapon did not impact the proc rate for the offhand weapon.  I don't have a sufficient database to &quot;prove&quot; this with high confidence, but after one of the... messier patches, the proc rate I'd enjoyed w/ an offhand primal while wielding a mainhand BF dropped dramatically.  I'd categorize that as a bug fix rather than a nerf, but it was fairly ouchy (i.e. went from 4-5 avatar procs from  offhand to 0-1 on typical grind 1-2 min blue mobs).  Like I said, I don't have a sufficient number of old parses to prove this unfortunately.<br />

It seems it makes more sense to say a weapon proc x times per   ?tick?<br />

It looks like when starting a battle you have an increased chance to proc.<br />
Imho that may be because the game checks if you have procced already after engaging combat (getting on hatelist) this round or not.</div></div><hr />

Why does that make more sense?  You just move the decimal point over.  It's also misleading to say that because you can proc multiple times per game tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the guess was that the procrate is coded per tick and when you start a battle exactly that it checks if the weapon has procced this tick yet. (or maybe combat round)</div></div><hr />

Your weapons have the same chance of proccing in the first minute as they do in the 5th minute as they do in the 100th minute.</div></div><hr />

If it had been reworded to be simply &quot;The vast majority of weapons use a default proc rate of 2 procs per minute at 305 Dex. A miniscule fraction of available weapons have different proc rates.&quot; it would have been accurate. Making a sweeping generalization is usually considered a bad thing when dealing with the scientific method, don't you think?<br />

BTW, compare proc rate per swing against the effective delay of the weapon. That normalises against things like flurry and extra attacks from AA.<br />

Default proc rate % per swing has been shown to be:<br />
<br />
delay * 0.002 @ 255 dex<br />
 <br />
I would *assume* that this measure scales with DEX, but I don't know.<br />

I'm sure there is a default proc rate on weapons.  Unless it's coded specially, like the 4 or so weapons we are aware of, it's got that default proc rate.  It's a rule that works, with a couple of exceptions, like almost all rules.  Don't like the rule?  Make a better one then.</div></div><hr />

Actually, yes it has. I can think of about 4 weapons with a non default proc rate that you didn't list. If you hadn't included the &quot;For ALL** weapons&quot; part, the entire opening statewould would be true, but since you did include it, the statement is now false. It is wrong. Provably so.

<br />
Where in the original statement is the level 56 cleric hammer mentioned? It isn't.<br />
<br />
I'll point out what I'm talking about in a real simple way.<br />
<br />
a statement can be EITHER true OR false. Is the following statement true? <br />
For ALL** weapons that are NOT a Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, Bloodfrenzy, or a Darkblade of the Warlord the following applies -<br />
<br />
For Main hand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = 1.5 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 2 proc/min<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
<br />
Simple question. Is it true? The answer is: No, it is not. <br />
<br />
To put it more simply: does the cleric hammer proc at 2 procs per minute in mainhand at 305 DEX. If it does not, that initial statement is wrong. I don't see the cleric hammer listed there...do you?<br />
<br />
If you remove that &quot;ALL weapons&quot; part and put in a caveat about it applying to a very large majority of weapons...it suddenly IS true. THAT is the point. That statement, as it was written, is provably wrong. <br />
<br />
Someone posted it very clearly, very simply:<br />
We can say for absolute certainty that a BF is an exception to the rule because we have hard data to show it. But when you take this information, along with the few other parses, and cast a general statement such as &quot;all&quot; and &quot;never&quot;, you open yourself up for looking like a fool.<br />
<br />
Here is how your responses should read when someone questions whether weapon xyz 'fits' or 'doesn't fit' into the results of the testing:<br />
<br />
After testing several different proc rates, it has been concluded that a majority of procs fall into the 2ppm with 305 dex category. There are currently 3 notable exceptions (fill in list here), but at this time, those are the only ones found to be outside the standard. The possibility exists, however slim, that there exists other weapons with procs that also fall outside the standard. If you feel that weapon does not fall into the standard, parse it for an extended amount of time, and post the results here. You will most likely find that it does, in fact, fall within the standard. But I can not say this 100% certainty.<br />
<br />
And yet you STILL argued. You responded with: I could argue with you, but it's been said about 50 times on this board, by about 50 different people. We are fucking right on this.<br />
<br />
YOU. WERE. WRONG.<br />
<br />
Provably wrong. <br />
<br />
Remove the &quot;All&quot; and you aren't wrong anymore. That is the point. Don't make sweeping assertions like that or they jump up and bite you on the ass and you end up &quot;looking like a fool&quot;.</div></div><hr />

OMFG.<br />
<br />
WTF cares how its worded.<br />
I was going to post a word of thanks for the info provided as its rare I learn something new nowadays.<br />
<br />
Then I kept reading....<br />
<br />
Its kinda disgusting.<br />
<br />
Dont criticize them, thank them.<br />
They did not have to provide the info to you.<br />

This was parsed for the first time in kunark when paladins got their first innate proc buff, Divine Might, and has been parsed multiple times since then. **It may be that other innate proc buff act differently, but why would just the paladin and ranger proc buff function that way and not others?<br />

**Caveat!!</div></div><hr />

They did not provide it to me. I'll thank an old guildmate, Ruca from Xeb server for a study (the word parse doesn't do it justice) that she posted to the shaman boards over 2 years ago. That's where I got the proc rate per swing = 0.002*delay@255DEX that I listed earlier. That extremely thorough parse was done in mid velious using about 15 different weapons @ 3 different haste levels with 20k swings each per haste level. To be honest, I thought it was commonly known since that parse was widely commented on and changed the entire paradigm of how we as a community of everquest players viewed haste in relation to proc rate. No one would have even considered slowing themselves to up the proc rate of their earthshaker before that parse was &quot;published&quot;.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU RUCABOO!</div></div><hr />

Thanks to Haas and crew for making it common knowledge to the rest of us.</div></div><hr />
