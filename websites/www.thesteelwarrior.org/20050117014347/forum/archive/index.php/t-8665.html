I have heard that there is a way to seperate Vindi from his guards, if anyone knows how some help on this would be much appricated.  <br />
We have beat him a couple of times, and we have lost a couple of times.  But it would be much easier if we could do the guards first.  The way we have been doing him is that we try to pull the guards with a SK's pet and this works great on other mobs but not on Vindi. I tell the raid to expect that Vindi is comming and we keep the MT on Vindi with the clerics healing him, and the rest of the raid fights the guards till their dead, then all attack Vindi. So thanks in advance for any help on how to pull the guards seperate.<br />

Be in the &quot;arena&quot; area, peel off 1 guard at a time, kill then have him bring Vindi solo.  It's the easiest thing on earth, and watching 3 giants chasing some little dude around the Ice wall is the funniest damn thing ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep that's the method to use, fairly easy and you can probably do it yourself after watching it done once, or just try it out. Also, you have good enough gear to tank Vindi very well, but if you finish ca/cs/lr/id asap it will be much much easier. Once you finish those AAs, tanking vindi should be almost trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use a necro to snare the guards and fd a few times and you can get Vindo far enough away from his guards to pull him single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">regjen</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bards should be able to gate him or guards whatever you would prefer. Bard would prolly need to deftdance to not get ownd by the 3 of them then fade after he gates each one.... should work but linked stuff is sometimes weird. <br />
<br />
If i can get my mouse to work or go buy a new one ill go play with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coem</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we were doing Vindi, we just had a paladin and druid tank mezing on each of  the guards while everyone else killed vindi.  Once Vindi is down the guards go down like kelly bundy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, if you have an extra tank just have them tank-mez the adds.  When we do him for people working on the phara dar quest (usually less than 2 groups there) we just have one warrior tank Vindi and the other on ramapage/tank mez.  We always kill the adds and then Vindi but I'm sure either way would work.  I might try Frodlin's method next time just to watch him chase somebody around the ice wall a few times though hehe.</div></div><hr />

We kill vindi with 1 group like this np.</div></div><hr />

If you agro Vindi, the guards are agroed.  However, if you agro the guards instead, if Vindi is far enough away from assist range, then you can bring the guards alone.</div></div><hr />

They are pretty much pussies slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerberus</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild killed him last evening. Interesting thing was he was pathing single on the bridge by himself. After killing the other giants on the  way to him. I waited for him to path to the end of the bridge then pulled him. He came single but his guards showed up about 40 seconds later. Guess his guards were in the little giant's room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daerkon</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard owns for pulling Vindi. I usually clear the mobs close by where Vindi paths to the arena, and then Pull Vindi with bard. Once Vindi and guards come into arena just highsun Vindi back and have group off to the side pull the two guards. If you do it right and bard continues to highsun Vindi while you finish guards you can then have bard fade and group med to full mana before pulling Vindi solo. This makes it easy for low numbers to take Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite is the warrior's best tool for the entire Kael script.  Here is how I single handedly (well, other than tag help) pull the Kael script from Vindi to AOW himself.<br />
<br />
First you clear to the left cubby (Why? because left is better because i said so).  You setup, buff, etc. blah.  Then when read you run up and agro everything in the arena and shout &quot;Train to Vantage&quot; (or whatever your guild is) and kill all 10-12 green cons.  After the arena is clear, you assign another warrior to be rampage tank and have him wait in the middle of the arena.<br />
<br />
You then arrow tag Vindicator and stay ahead of him just enough to land an Incite.  Only after you have used Incite do you tell that rampage warrior to plunk one arrow to Vindicator and then head back to raid.<br />
<br />
If you did it right, you now have Vindicator + his two guards following you, and Rampage list already pre-set.  It's at this point you merely kite your train in a circle in the arena.  Using Incite each time it pops.  You have someone else run up and tag both guards off you.  Once you have extracted and kill his guards (Incite will keep agro on you with regards to vindi) you're all set.  Have them tell you when ready, and come barreling into camp with 7+ incites of pre-agro already.  Congrats being able to call engage at 100% and rampage tank already set.<br />
<br />
From there, you use the same method with Statue of Rallos Zek.  Tagging him, and running him around in a circle and inciting to hold agro before someone can tag the Armor of Zeks off of you.  If you landed 7+ incites you can also pre-tash pre-malo and pre-slow the statue before you even bring it into campsite (which we do).<br />
<br />
From there, I usually decession with a druid or ranger to zone line and zone to EWastes and get Spirit of Eagle, then get COH'd back.  It's not necessary but makes things a shit load easier later on.  You then use levitate (or spirit of eagle) and come up the south end of the arena's pit itself (so you are looking north into the pit AOW himself pops into).  You tag some green con, or anything, and run NORTH as hard as you can to end into that little notched out ledge north of the pit (which is very close X Y wise and just south of Idol.. it's where you drop down from if you were in Idol's halls).  Wait for your green con to catch up and warp up top to you.  This will cause assist agro to agro the Idol.  HoTT comes in handy here to tell when he agro's so you can get a head start.  Just run up into the arena and once again, Incite kite.  You'll probably have a few trash mobs as well, so its all good.  Just pull them off and after your 7+ Incites are done, pre-tash pre-malo pre-slow and bring him into camp.<br />
<br />
AoW runs slightly faster than the others, so this is why Spirit of Eagle comes into handy.  To kite him you tag him and run up to arena, his huge size makes him kinda warp around before he gets up top to run out.  The key is to run him in a figure 8 in the arena vs. a circle.  Using the South ends of the arena to make each turn.  Using this method you can again 7+ incite (i usually do less just because this is so high risk to do) the AoW and get tons of pre-agro to again, instantly call engage soon as he hits camp.<br />
<br />
This is how we've done AoW the past 5-6 kills and its insanely easy and makes the hit insanely fast since you don't wait on monks for jack.  It's a warrior pulled event.  Don't even have to mess with the yellow con zek trash in idol's hall since you agro idol with help agro.<br />
<br />
It's hard to explain some of the things without drawing a diagram but if you understand what I said, grats a solid strat to making the pulls of this encounter trivial.<br />

I recently was in Kael and some friends wanted to kill Vindi so we did, the SK was having alot of problems splitting, so ..... I got impatient and ran up and tagged the guards and it worked fine!  If you pull the pets first, you need to fight them outside of the arena, because Vindi will come to help his friends out.  You're also still aggro on vindi if you were fighting his pets and move back into the arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I killed Vindi the other night with some guildees for his heart.  We leveled the arena and had a monk pull Vindi and his guards.  The monk kited Vindi while we peeled his guards off one at a time.  We stayed in the middle of the arena to fight as the monk kited off to one side in the arena.  If you kite Vindi and guards you can kill the guards and stay in the arena while you do it.  Then Vindi is alone and easy pickings.  Make sure you use an experienced kiter though as fighting all three is no fun for someone doing him for the first time.  Also, consider charming a pet for dps, as they make the fight much easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A monk is much riskier.  Usually having just throwing agro from one huck of a javelin, or maybe just the monk having proximity agro, is not enough to keep Vindi on the kiter.  This is why you use a warrior with Incite to be able to get sufficient agro.<br />
<br />
Here's an analogy.<br />
<br />
A monk kiting Vindicator is as petting a grizzly bear with freshly lotioned and well cared for hands.<br />
<br />
A warrior kitting Vindicator is as grabbing onto a grizzly bear's dick and yanking as hard as you can.<br />
<br />
Choose your agro wisely.<br />

<br />
If you high sun him and are not X distance from his guards, they will still come barreling in.  Same for vice versa.<br />
<br />
Just use my method and it's a whole lot safer.  But yes, given luck + sufficient distance, high sun will work.<br />

<br />
they're not hard tho... you could tank all 3 mobs @ once if you're cho'ing ... the guards are pretty damn weak.<br />
<br />
And, FYI, you have a GOOD ranger pull vindi. Just root the guards. Easy as pie.</div></div><hr />
