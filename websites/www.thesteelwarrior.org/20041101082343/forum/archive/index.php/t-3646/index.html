<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fieldweeble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
I'm pretty new to the warrioring section of the game, being a level 28 dwarf, and have a couple questions.<br />
<br />
First, what sort of weapons should I be using? Fast, slow, peircing, procing, one handed, two handed, ect. Maybe someone can suggest a decent quest / cheap weapon available to warriors around my level? Also, whats with all the SK/PAL only weapons? I was in the bazaar, and saw a guy auctioning a 25/25 hammer. I was like &quot;holy crap, that's good!&quot;...but glancing down, I saw that it was SK/PAL. I thought warriors were supposed to be the weaponmiesters? Why don't we have any 1 handed weapons with insane ratios like that? Or do we?<br />
<br />
Second, armor -- Should I be looking for high AC, haste, stats, hp, what? Anyone have suggestions on what I might want to be wearing around this level? Maybe some useful quests?<br />
<br />
If you guys could please tip me off to some useful quests, or maybe some cheap warrior gear that I'm overlooking, it would be great. Sorry for the long winded questions, it just seems like most of this board is posted by higher level warriors, and there really isn't much info for lowbies like myself.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I'm on the firiona vie server, so hardly anything is nodrop. Thanks in advance for your responses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you level, when one maxes, switch to another type etc. <br />
<br />
AS for gear, what race/diety are you.  and post your magelo if you have one.  If you have cash, try and see about a vindication BP if it's no drop on FV.                        <br />
<br />
Crustacian armour is pretty good for your lv.  if you're hitting lv 30+ and can wear heraldic armour or tribunal go for it by all means!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK - a little warrior 101. <br />
<br />
Previous poster is correct - keep all you weapon skills current.  At your level, you should most of the time be dual-wielding.  So those weapons (your 1 handers) should be the best you can reasonably afford.  The 2 handed weapons you should just try to get something fast, so that you can skill up as quickly as possible at each level and then go  back to your primary weapons.<br />
<br />
You of course want the best ratio you can get in each hand, but go for speed also- particularly in your main hand.  As you level up, the primary hand damage bonus will become more and more important.   You also want to hit as frequently as you can to maintain aggro (your main job), so you will sometimes sacrifice ratio for some speed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Proccing weapons will (usually) increase your dps and will add aggro.  Some types of procs (debuffs - slows and the specific hate producing procs) will add even more aggro and are more beneficial for that reason. <br />
<br />
As to what you should be looking for in armor, it would be easier to help if you posted your magelo, or at least your current armor/weapons and/or your current stats.    <br />
<br />
Barring that, however, the first thing you probably want to worry about is your AC - to a point.  At every level, you want to get to a certain level of AC to minimize the amount of damage you are taking from the level of mobs you are fighting.  Beyond that level, it will not help that much, but below that level it can hurt a lot.  I'm not sure what amount of AC that is at your level - you sometimes hear 20 points of AC per level, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. <br />
<br />
After that, hps are always important.  The more you can get helps you take damage that much longer. <br />
<br />
However, at your level, you may still have some worries on stats.   All the melee related stats (Dex, Sta, Agi, Str) are important in one way or another.  Number one - you absolutely don't want any stats below 75.   Number two - you want your stamina at 100 or above.  If your Sta, Agi or Dex are below 75 (I know your str is not), deal with that before anything else.  Then work on getting your Sta above 100.   Then try to get everything else close to 100 or above.  Beyond that, we would need more information. <br />
<br />
Somewhere in the midst of that is haste.  Get what you can - it helps all your weapons, but it may be difficult to get much on what appears to be your budget.  <br />
<br />
Post your magelo or just list your stuff and we can make specific suggestions - I know that FV economy is different than every other so it may be hard to give you the best info, but we can at least recommend items. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps a little.</div></div><hr />
