<br />
How is Blizzard going to balance PVP between Hodre and Alliance.  Per www.wowcensus.com there were about 800k Alliance toons and 500k Horde.<br />
<br />
On Kargath, where I play the numbers are more like 3:1. So on most servers, when the battlegrounds roll, the Horde will get stomped and stomped and stomped.<br />
<br />
Frankly I think part of my blahs for grinding is knowing that at 60th part of the end game is PVP and that I am one of the weaker classes, on the weaker side just is not strong motivation.<br />

WoW, at the moment, has the strong potential of becoming World of Alliance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In theory, a well geared toon will be able to kill two poorly geared toons at the same level, I'm referring to say a raiding guild toon vs two casuals (again, in theory). It may also come down to organization when you get into bigger battles. But honestly I think it's stupid to assume that all the Alliance are &quot;retarded casual&quot; players like everyone seems to think, there are a lot Alliance raiding guilds despite what all the Horde players like to believe.<br />
<br />
If you notice on EQrankings (atleast for doomhammer) even though the Alliance may have more toons, a lot of them are a lower level average. If you compare the level 60s, the horde isn't that far behind how many the alliance have, atleast last time I checked. I also don't know how reliable those numbers are since a lot of people probably don't take the time to sign up.<br />
<br />
Don't get this confused with the LoTR Legolas &quot;I'm a hero of the (insert race), so I can ten vs one&quot; mindset, but I have had RL friends/guildes actually take on multiple level 55s at level 60 each, so level/gear does make a big difference. It may also be that our guild is ahead of most of the guilds on our server so their gear may be affecting it a lot also (don't get me wrong, I'm not bragging, it's just a fact). We've done some minor raids on Stormwind for fun, granted the zerg masses and waves of guards won out in the end, we did last a good hour with minimal deaths (mostly toons under 40) when fifteen manning it.<br />
<br />
We'll just have to see how the whole quality vs. quantity argument plays out. As much as I like to think it's possible for the underdog to win, I think the Horde will have problems PvP once all the slow levelers start catching up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it's all speculation at this point, but I heard that battlegrounds would have a set number of people on each side...so the server-wide split wouldn't matter as long as there was enough Horde to fill up the max number of slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Move servers.  Apparently Hellscream is Horde-heavy.   :p <br />
<br />
It would be a poor, poor design decision to base class balance on massive-scale PvP.   <br />
<br />
I also think it is highly premature to be concerned about 800k alliance, as if 800k toons are going to go rushing into Horde territory at the same time.  The question is going to be about cohesion and motivation (and maybe the ability for one's computer to manage the mass-scale PvP), not numbers.   Sure, there will be fights where alliance network faster and more show up; and then there will be fights planned by Horde that win because alliance weren't quick enough on their feet in responding, or didn't care enough that day to bother. <br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is your fear isn't well thought through.  And I'm not saying this in a mean or fanboi way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thought on the topic...if Blizzard gives horde advantages to &quot;even things out&quot; due to the numbers difference, people will switch sides...then they'd have to &quot;even things out&quot; again...  I don't think looking at overall population numbers is the right way to go about it...I think a better approach is looking at class/race balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly think it's all circumstancial. There's too many factors, It could be a 3:1 ratio on a PvE server, but how many of those people will actually want to pvp? Then there's the level/gear/class factors, the NPCs in the actual battle location etc. <br />
<br />
Just because there's 1,000 alliance on your server doesn't mean they're all just going to drop what they're doing to rush into the Horde zones and take over.<br />
<br />
Edit: I highly doubt blizzard is going to give the horde anything to compensate, I think people are just going to have to deal with it. I don't play on a PvP server, so for all I know it could be horrible playing a horde toon there, but as far as PvE, I've had no problems what-so-ever. If they cap the battlegrounds that will fix that anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play on malganis, where horde outnumber alliance pretty much. There's one guild with over 500 members, they even had to make extra guilds to hold everyone. That's on the horde side.<br />
<br />
Even with a numbers advantage, the alliance manage to still keep things competitive. Looking at the raw numbers doesn't show how things really play out ingame. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry too much about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you consider the # of people that plays this game, it is basically statistically impossible that your side will have anything but mostly average players out of the pool of avaliable players.<br />
<br />
So obviously, playing against more people is going to be harder.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if half of the story of 'we owned no skills alliance guys' is posted by guys who are on the alliance side.<br />
<br />
There's no particular reason to believe the horde would be any higher level or more motivated to do PvP either, given the size of this game.  Now, obviously your server may differ, but as a whole, both the average horde and the average alliance player are just that: an average player.<br />
<br />
Most likely it'll turn into something like the early days of Starcraft.  You'll have say half of the people who play Horde (out of current horde population that is) just because they want to play horde, 1/4th will defect to Alliance for the easy win, and 1/4th of the guy will be fooled by the Alliance guys posting as Horde guys about how skilled horde player can overcome no skills alliance zerg (which, incidentally, was what Zerg players did back when 6 Mutalisks = auto win against Protoss).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah,  it seems people have this mentality that &quot;Omfgz, all of the hardcore 1337 gamers will be horde for the challenge!&quot; when in all reality, there's just as many hardcore gamers/retards on both sides of the fence. I couldn't give a shit either way as long as there's people running around for me to swing at.</div></div><hr />

I don't foresee this as having a snowball's chance in hell of happening.  I think what will happen is pretty much what is happening now.  A bunch of horde post saying they are outnumbered and it sucks.  A bunch of horde post saying they kick the crap out of the alliance cuz they have leet skeelz.  A bunch of alliance post saying they are outnumbered and it sucks.  A bunch of alliance post saying they kick the crap out of the horde cuz they have leet skeelz.  And maybe someone will even post that defecting to alliance gives you an easy win and other players are bragging incognito to trick people into underestimating them (even though the WoW forums won't allow you to post as a character you can't play).  <br />
<br />
And the game will go on, with alliance winning some and horde winning some.</div></div><hr />

That is the fucking lamest ass exploit ever, and the worst part? Blizzard says to &quot;deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can only hope they deal better with other exploits =/</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I was playing the other night and a mage was kicking my ass from the roof top, I tried to fire back and the guards kicked my ass *sighs*<br />
<br />
What they should do is put up invisible walls like they have in the AH's or give guards ranged weapons and make them work (I've seen em with crossbows/guns/bows out in the past but don't fire them because of line of sight)<br />
<br />
One time I managed to get up there to make a sniper pay it turned out he had a rogue buddy just waiting for it, ripped me up from behind in no time at all.<br />
<br />
I switched from doomhammer to Illidan so PvP is more of an issue for me, but it is fun to find an nightelf all alone in the stagnant oasis, thats for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-15-2005, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Any system implemented will have to be dynamic. As populations change the carrots and sticks have to change.<br />
<br />
2) The reason I posted the numbers is that we don't have any reason to beleive that Horde player or Alliance players are going to be more or less attracted to PV than the other.  So a general population advantage to be reflexcted (statictically)  in the number of PVPers, the number of high levels, number of leet fighters etc. <br />
<br />
3) Looking at www.wowcensus.com for Kargath the reletive ratios of Alliance to Horde seems to hold at 3:1 no matter what level range you are looking at.</div></div><hr />

Also, rather than sheer number comparison... A level total for each side would be a better comparison for now. Personally, I agree with Haass. Ya'll worry too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as Battlegrounds go they are having a queue system so that the teams remain equal.  You put your name in when you get on and then can go do your other crap and when a spot opens you are summoned into the battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />
