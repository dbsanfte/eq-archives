<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. I am in the process of making a warrior as I type this, and just wanted to ask a few questions here. I have played a beastlord since the day that Luclin came out, but now my guild needs tanks to do anything, and the beasty has gone about as far as he can go without being able to raid higher than the arena in Kael. So I'm taking a little while off to buy-and-sell stuff to make enough money to piece together a good warrior for my guilds purpose.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on to the questions...(yes I did look at the Library first, btw  :p )<br />
<br />
1) From what I have seen, everyone seems to value aggro over everything else. The general conensus is that you can't have enough aggro. That makes perfect sense to me, but I was wondering if it can ever go over the top a little bit. Most of the people posting that seem to be from high lvl raid guilds, and I would assume that being able to hold aggro there means everything and that aggro &gt; all addage rings true. But what about non-uber group XPing and low-tier raiding? Could it possibly be better there to have a but more DPS or stats instead of aggro? <br />
<br />
2) If I work hard enough on selling I can probably begin life with a Blade of Carnage. My question, is a BoC the end-all-be-all must-have weapon of the non-uber raid warrior? Because if I don't get it I can spend a little more of armor etc, but if it's going to make life significantly easier for me (which I can see it doing) then I'll pony up the 300-350k for it.<br />
<br />
3) A question I see a lot up here, race.  The general consensus seems to be that in the end it doesn't really matter at all gear wise. But do any races have an advantage in other departments? IE race-exclusive quests, easier time with quests than others, race/deity exclusive weapons? It's probably a silly question, but I figured it's easy to ask and it might help.<br />
<br />
I don't want to enter the warrior world as a complete newb and know nothing about it. I saw a quote in someones sig about winning the war before you start the battle, and that's what I intend to do here. Thanks in advancer for yer help, I hope to be around here for awhile to come. Ciao.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answering your third question. When corner tanking (if that is ever an option again) you need to be able to fit into the corner well. Certain races such as Ogres,Trolls, and Barb's can't shrink down enough to fit in the corner. Vah Shir have trouble fitting in the corner with their tails. Wood elf and Dark elfs seem to be a good choice for this because of their slenderness. Human's are also a good choice when double shrunk. I think gnomes are the best bet for corner tanking because you don't need shrinks, but then you will have to deal with a whole life of harassment. Hope that helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taggen_of_Xev</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) If you plan on tanking for your guild Agro is a must, just get 2 sets of weapons.  1 agro setup and 1 dps setup so that you can use whatever fits your needs.<br />
<br />
2) GBoS from BoT Towers primary and BoC offhand would be a very good combo for ya if you can arrange it.<br />
<br />
3) Ogres get stun immunity and can worship RZ  but are big<br />
     Iksar have nicer innate AC but cannot worship RZ<br />
<br />
&gt;IMO&lt; those are the two i could choose from for a warrior</div></div><hr />

Slamming will allow you to interrupt casters with the same chance that bash does or kick post 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Das_bert</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how well do Frogloks do when cornering?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sodami</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also in the process of making a new war, and I am considering going halfling. How well do they corner compared to gnomes? Also, I am considering switching from Xegony to another server, what is a good one to start a war on (I have a 51 druid to PL him some)? I am considering MithMarr since they have a good PU raid system, was just wondering if anyone else had suggestions, thank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">unlike your bl you can't just cast slow 1-2 times and lock agro. as a warrior you have to use procs eb/anger and stuns being the biggest, followed by the provoke skill line, then you fall into debate about this and that debuff rune most agre they do add some amount of agro, snare type procs fall somewhere in their. and lastly dots and dd though some dots add a meserable amount of agro. most agree dd does nothing for agro.<br />
<br />
next you have to reley on the random proc generator to determin when your &quot;agro&quot; proc will fire. averages out to 2 per min off course that could be none for 10 min and then 40 in the next 10 min.<br />
<br />
esentialy it boils down to generating enough agro to keep agro from everyone else in the group raid ect... before you hit a dry streak, or one of the random idiots does something to grab agro. like use draugt of jiva as their only nuke and chain cast it and wonder why they keep getting agro (the 0.0 stun draugt wizzys get at 55 dojiva id'ed by the torrenet of reckless magic emote when it lands). or the mob might need re slowed, snared, dotted, stuned, debuffed, ect.<br />
<br />
so as a war you can never have enough, even though you hold agro well.<br />
<br />
<br />
for the price of a boc you could get some serious armor for each rec lvl cap, serious agro weapons for each lvl cap, great dps weapons for when you rach a dps lvl. on the other hand once you have it you'll have it till you get something better. witch for 1h agro is like 2-3 things.<br />
<br />
<br />
race is what ever you want to be. if you chose it just for stats and not fun of playing you will prolly not play it much. witch is worse then haveing or not have some rascial ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I have played with tons of warriors needless to say, and I have seen first hand how annoying it can be at times to get aggro when the stupid weapons just won't proc for you. <br />
<br />
Also, a question about Incite, Provoke, etc. Is there a time to use them that's better than another? Or hit it whenever it comes up? To me, just thinking logically, hitting it right after a sucessful taunt check makes the most sense, but I am probably wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the responses  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoC is not the only answer for non raiding warrior<br />
I wouldnt even recomend spending all of you cash on it since there are some nice low budget agro weapons out there GSoT comes to mind and hamer and sword from droga. Also Fungi tunic is the best twink gear there is till 55 or so.<br />
<br />
As in regards to race if I had to start over my warrior now I would most definatley choose ogre with RZ deity. To be unstanable from the front is usefull at all levels and awesome starting stats do help you out at lower levels. Trolls and their regen is awesome till around level 30. After that it doesnt help much. Also if you have shity graphics card do not pick a race that doesnt have a night vision aka human and barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoC is not the only answer for non raiding warrior<br />

<br />
Aye, Fungi is a must needless to say.<br />
<br />
However, the three weapons you mentioned aren't really in the picture for a low-lvl warrior. Last a checked a GSoT was req lvl 55, and the Drogan weapons are both rec 56 and have had their procs rolled back to at least lvl 50. That leaves 49 levels that they'd not proc, not to mention being at full stats and/or damage, now that that bug has been resolved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ogres that follow RZ or CT can wear nice cultaral armour.<br />
<br />
Same with other races, think except iksar have cultaral armour they can wear.<br />
<br />
recom lvl is 45, but stats are good at about 30, and then you can grow into them.<br />
<br />
checking bazaar before you make toon for what is available would be a good thing.<br />
<br />
If you want to go overkill, getting Lodi belt is also a good idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if paying for a BOC means settling for 200 less AC then its very understandable that you forego the BOC. but dropping an anger proc in favor of a dps proc should never be done on a weapon like BOC which could never justify such a price unless it were purchased for THE ability it excels in already which is agro. put a good dps proc on a weapon you use for secondary tanking if you like. like a war marshal (2hs) or something.<br />
<br />
now to answer your first question about is it ever good to give up agro for dps when you are main tanking (ok you didnt say main tanking but lets pretend for now that you did) ...<br />
<br />
id say .. pretty rarely. maybe at low levels but at high levels better agro means the mob can be killed faster and that means less heals for YOU. the manna the healer saves can be spent on a nuke that will do more damage than any extra dps you give up. <br />
<br />
*sigh* .. sometimes i think casters WANT me to have less agro. they sit down and a slowed mob tromps on over to them and stands there in a slowed daze. but the caster wont get up off his tush. then finally he gets smacked for 1200 damage and he sits back down. so maybe you are right .. i think some casters just like to get hit and too much MT agro stands in the way of that :)<br />
<br />
... ok im on a roll now. /em tanks a blue con. only other groupie is a cleric. cleric is sitting down. big bad tank at 20 percent health no sow. cleric sitting. tankie doesnt notice how much push hes getting and pushes mob right on top of sitting cleric. mob quads cleric and cleric takes 1500 damage and dies an instant and painless death. warrior at 20 percent health stares at mob with 30 percent health. can he run to zone? doubtful with no sow and 20 percent health. /disc mighty strike. warrior gets mob to 3 percent but dies. warrior wishes he had bought that anger III aug already and didnt still need 50 more adv points. warrior concludes .. &quot;a tank cant have too much agro&quot;.</div></div><hr />

What good is aggro if you die within seconds of getting it?  Then work on getting a good aggro weapon if you are going to tank for your guild.  If I recall correctly, ac cap for Velious/luclin was around 1250ac.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What gear I can afford really isn't an issue. If I spend enough time doing the buy-sell game in the bazaar I can basically have infinite money (as it stands I have 813k as of logging checking trader this morning). <br />
<br />
I am going Woodie/Rallos for obvious reasons...fierce heraldic gear is great and Wood Elves are by far the coolest race :) Perhaps I am a little too pre-occupied on having a really neat character, but I still don't want to sacrifice any amount of tanking/aggro holding. Was looking to get away using an Angered or Yaked Split Blade along with an Anger3'd BoC, but it seems that I should still stick to either the ballpeen hammer of striking or the SotBS....sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakanzzar</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another weapon to consider, if you have the cash is the SoD from ST. This will set you back about 150k instead of 400k, and also is a very good aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
If you are playing a WE (I play a DE) get gear that has AC, STA and HPS. Your sta will not max till a lot later in the game than other chars. And as mentioned above, aggro is no good if you can't take a beating :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoD on Torv is almost the same price as a BoC, and rarer it seems like. Plus the thought of tanking dragons with something like looks like a two-year-olds toy is somewhat...disheartening. I got a BoC this morning, Custom Cowl, Pernicity Cloak, Grimling Contraption, Mithril Gaunts, Fierce Arms/Gaunts/Wrists/Legs/Neck/Waist, Fungi, 6/65 rings and 35hp earrings, plus a Horn of Hsagra for when I get dual wield...I think I'm good to go myself.<br />
<br />
EDIT: While I am thinking about it, would it be worth taking the guild to kill the stupid rat in Dragon Nec and looting a Willsapper? Good aggro from that or not? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a crapload of weapons to choose from, many that will be great for aggro purposes. BoC aint cheap no matter how much it costs...<br />
<br />
Agnostic aint necessarily bad either. They get screwed out of cultural armors, but the 'neutral' deity faction is helpful in many regards.<br />
<br />
Of the various racial abilities, Slam is the biggest one to consider. This has been discussed here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6557  The other racial abilities are not to be overlooked, or undervalued, either.<br />
<br />
Corner tanking is situational at best. Positioning, in general, everyone needs practice on and can be done with the high majority of mobs without major complications. It's usually just a matter of coordination.<br />
<br />
And as it's been said so many times before: Play what you like, any 'lacking' by any race can be overcome later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i didnt know about the almost unlimited budget.<br />
<br />
given that the fungi is a no brainer up to about level 50 after which you wont notice the regen much. after that switch it out for ac. i recommend aug'ing a proc'ing weapon rather than the split blade. dont worry too much about dieties since the great cultural armor that certain deities allow you to buy is poorer quality than what you will likely buy when you reach your 50s. the argument about agro doing you no good if you cant take a beating obviously isnt going to be your problem. no agro is too much agro even at lower levels since it will allow you to multitank and keep agro on several mobs at once at lower level. since its clear you will be up to the task for surviving the beating why not also draw the agro to keep the beating on yourself?<br />
<br />
it is said luclin mobs have an ac softcap of 1250 since they hit so hard that you cant mitigate at all anyway. yes .. serious .. this is the party line. i know it doesnt make sense but thats what they all say. maybe what they really mean is 1250 is the armor LOWER cap. my ac of 1650 buffed allows me to mitigate most luclin mobs a huge amount over what lower ac players take from them. so dont buy into the luclin 1250 line. there is however a soft cap for the much easier mobs you will fight in the first 50 levels. for those mobs you will mitigate so well that high ac is overkill and hitpoints will be your friend. once you hit the upper 50s or so you will want to strike a sane balance between the two and dont even bother asking what that balance is. everyone seems to have a different opinion. i have never been one rounded in my life so if you are seeking high hitpoints to keep from being one rounded just remember. before level 60 it is highly unlikely you will be asked to tank anything that hits that hard ever. you probably wont be asked to (or allowed to) before level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well unless something within my guild changes in the near future I will really be the only warrior who plays a lot. I am leveling this toon especially to be our main tank, partly because I have the means to do it, partly because I need something new aside from my Beastlord, and partly because I am guild leader and feel that it's my job to do it. So it's not really about being &quot;allowed&quot; to so much as when I am high enough level we can actually do some of the stuff that we want to and start advancing up the Velious ladder and early Luclin stuff. We have so far run out of stuff that my beastlord can tank when we did Nathan Illuminious in Katta last week (god that fight sucked)...fun having a high crit of 85 with a 42 damage weapon :(</div></div><hr />
