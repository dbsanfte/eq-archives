Interesting read.<br />
<br />
Text as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Intoduction <br />
<br />
Since SOE is trying to lure me back into playing EQ by giving me a free 14 day trial subscription I decided to use that time doing some parses i've always wanted to do on the effects of ATK rating on melee dps. Not the actual value of my dps, but rather its effect on the two main factors that make up melee dps, average damage per hit and the hit ratio. For the latter it has been known some time that strength and pure attack buffs have no effect on it, but i've seen several posts recently of people that didn't know/believe this. Plus, it never hurts to check this these things because you never know if SOE have changed the underlying mechanics since the last investigation. <br />
The effect of ATK rating on the average damage per hit is more complex. A good description of it would considerably help with making theoretical dps predictions for weapon comparisons, understanding the effects of lower 1HB, 2HB and piercing skill caps, and buff/focus effects. <br />
<br />
The results presented here are by no means all-conclusive, for one they've been done against just one mob, a green con at that (the Katta banker), but sensible conclusions can still be drawn from them regarding more realistic, in-game situations. <br />
<br />
<br />
2. Theoretical background <br />
<br />
It's long been thought that ATK is actually the sum of two separate numbers, one representing a 'to hit' rating and one representing a 'damage' rating. The 'to hit' rating is determined by the offensive skills only, buffs have no effect on it. Once the weapon skills are capped there is no way to vary this part of the ATK rating except thru skill modifiers. <br />
There are two formulas i will refer to later on. The general formula for the melee dps of a weapon is <br />
<br />
melee dps = swings/sec * Hit ratio * average dmg/hit. (equation 1) <br />
<br />
The average damage/hit itself can be represented as <br />
<br />
average damage/hit = n(ATK) * base damage + damage bonus. (equation 2) <br />
<br />
Base damage and damage bonus are weapon- and level-dependent. With weapon skills at the cap, the ATK rating enters into dps only thru the multiplier n. The relation between n and ATK is the main focus of this investigation. <br />
Swings/sec can be easily calculated. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. Parse set-up and details <br />
<br />
All parses were done with my Lvl 65 beastlord (Magelo profile in sig), attacking from behind against the banker in Katta, a Lvl 1 unkillable NPC that doesnt fight back. Only weapon melee damage was parsed, no kicks or slams. The only relevant offensive AA skill is BF5, which only function in this case is to increase the sample rate by 15% anyway. <br />
Weapons used are: <br />
HtH: Waning Light Katar, 16/22 +13 <br />
1HB: Club of the Ice Ocean, 14/27 +13 <br />
2HB: Staff of Flowing Water, 42/34 +38 <br />
All weapon skills are at the cap, i.e. 250 HtH and 225 1HB, 2HB. <br />
<br />
Variation of the ATK rating was obtained with various buffs and swapping out equipment. Unbuffed parses were performed overnight. Parses with buffs on require some user interaction, and in those cases i also used Celerity simply to speed up the sample rate. Sections of the log file where an ATK buff had faded were removed before parsing the file. <br />
<br />
<br />
4. Results <br />
<br />
A total of 7 parses were performed. I dont seem to be able to get this into a readable table so i hope this format will do. If not, i've put an Excel workbook online, link here. The graphs further down will make things clearer as well <br />

6. Discussion <br />
<br />
6.1. Hitratio <br />
The following graph shows all observed hit ratio as a function of the ATK rating.<br />
http://members.chello.nl/~pg.deheij/graph1.jpg<br />
<br />
It should be clear that although the hitratio for HtH is higher then 1HB and 2HB because of the higher skill cap, ATK buffs do not effect the hit ratio at all. The weighted average for HtH is 71.18+/-0.38 % and for 1HB and 2HB it's 69.29+/-0.35 %. The ratio is 1.027. In some old parses i did way back when i was lvl 62, tanking lvl 50-52 mobs, the hit ratios were lower of course, 57.2% vs 55.6% resp., but the ratio is almost the same, 1.028 <br />
<br />
6.2. Dualwield ratio at Lvl 65 <br />
I mention this here because Tastian's excellent parses showed recently that the dualwield rate at lvl 65 is 82.7+/-0.8 %, which is considerably higher then the dualwield rate calculated from the old formula (skill+level)/400 (77.5%). Test #4 of my parses was done without any interruptions and is therefore suitable for dw rate calculation. In my case, dual wield rate = (OH swings/MH swings) * (OH delay/MH delay) = (15498/15366)*(22/27) = 82.2+/-0.6 %. This confirms Tastian's finding. <br />
<br />
6.3. Swapping MH/OH <br />
I performed test 4 &amp; 5 to make absolutely certain that having a weapon in the OH or MH makes no difference to either hit ratio or n (well, actually i did these 2 parses first, because with the CotIO in the MH and WLK in OH i'd get approx the same amount of swings). This, fortunately, turns out to be the case. One implication of this is that you never have to parse a weapon in both the MH and the OH; just substitute MH damage = OH damage + damage bonus and apply the dw rate and you're done. <br />
<br />
6.4. Effect of ATK on n. <br />
In the next graph the values of n are plotted as a function of ATK.<br />
http://members.chello.nl/~pg.deheij/graph2.jpg<br />
 <br />
In the range of ATK values used here, the relation between n and ATK can be considered linear. I doubt this apparent linearity extends ad infinitum, at some point you'll probably get diminishing returns when adding more ATK but i cannot access this range. The 1HB and 2HB data fall unto the same line, whereas the HtH data has the same slope but is shifted along the ATK-axis. if you'll recall that ATK is a composite number then it's easy to explain why. HtH ATK has a higher 'to hit' part then the other 2. The shift this causes is 33 ATK, and that number can't be a coincidence. 33 ATK = 25 (difference in weapon cap) * 1.33 (the attack modifier for melee classes). <br />
Replotting the data against ATK-skill*1.33 yields a single straight line with a slope 0.00338+/-0.00006:<br />
http://members.chello.nl/~pg.deheij/graph3.jpg<br />
 <br />
The linearity and the fact that 3 different type of weapons can be plotted on a single 'master'-curve (but its only a master curve for this particular mob, more on that later) has some interesting repercussions which i'll discuss in the next section. <br />
<br />
6.5.DPS <br />
As i said in the introduction i didn't parse dps directly because its actual value is irrelevant to real everyday in-game conditions. The different tests can not be compared directly in terms of dps either because some were done with no haste, some with full haste and some where i was hasted only part of the time. There's no need to make a direct comparison, with parsed values for average damage/hit and hitratio the melee dps can be readily calculated for any haste using Equation 1. In fact, since i have a master curve, i can calculate what my dps would be with any given weapon(combo) and haste from the relation between n and ATK. AA skills such as BF and Ambidexterity are also easily incorporated since their effect is known. But it would be the dps against this particular mob, in this particular position. <br />
Against higher level mobs the value of n will undoubtely be lower at the same ATK rating, either by a shift downward or a change in slope or both (the first will certainly happen, the latter, if it occurs at all, will be a small effect i suspect). But what won't change is the linearity of the relationship between n and ATK (or general shape if you extend the atk range). Higher level mobs will also give lower hit-ratios as will tanking instead of hitting from behind. But the ratio of hitratios between HtH and the other weapon skills doesnt seem much affected by this. <br />
Because of this, a single parse of any weapon in a particular situation will give you all the information you need to calculate the melee dps of every other weapon available. Parse the hit-ratio and the average damage/hit, extract n and you're good to go. Changing from one weapon to another in which you have the same skill changes neither hitratio or n. Changing from e.g. HtH to 1HB you can recalculate the hitratio by dividing by 1.027 and adjust n by subtracting 33*0.00338=0.11. If ATK rating is changed in some other, e.g. by an Avatar proc then its still possible to adjust n; the change in n is equal to the change in ATK rating * 0.00338. With eqs 1 and 2 the melee dps for the new weapon can then be calculated <br />
<br />
For a general weapon comparison, or a standard weapons ranking, you need to be able to calculate quickly without doing any parsing at all. In order to do so, standard values for n and hit ratio need to be agreed upon, and proc dps will have to be incorporated in a smart way. It's possible to do so, but that's a another story entirely. <br />
<br />
The effect(ivess) of individual buffs such as Ferocity can also be calculated <br />
<br />
6.6. &quot;You need high ATK for 2HB to be effective&quot; <br />
This is a statement i come across frequently on this board. I have wondered where it originated from for some time now, since theoretical considerations tell me that the opposite should generally be true: dualwielding profits more from high ATK then 2HB. I now have the ammunition to shoot down the original statement once and for all. <br />
Since ATK doesnt affect the hitratio, the only increase you'll get in your dps when upping your ATK comes from the increase in average damage/hit. A fixed increase in ATK will give a fixed increase in n. The associated increase in avg. dam. will be lower however, because of the damage bonus. The higher the weapon's base damage is compared to the damage bonus, the more benefit you get out of the same amount of ATK <br />
Dualwielding is therefore favored by high ATK because: <br />
- the OH doesnt have a damage bonus at all, meaning it gets full benefits of the additional ATK <br />
- 1H'ed weapons generally have higher base damage/base delay ratios. <br />
<br />
edit: as Eatbugs pointed out, there's a painful typo here. The last sentence should read: 1H'ed weapons generally have higher base damage/damage bonus ratios <br />
<br />
There is one effect that helps 2HB more then a dualwield combo, if the dw combo has a HtH weapon in it. The HtH's higher natural ATK means that a absolute ATK increase will be relatively lower then for a 2HB. For example; suppose you have 1000 ATK using 2HB. Adding 500 to that is an increase of 50%. The HtH ATK would be 1067, and adding 500 to that is a (500/1067) = 47% increase (note: you should really only consider the 'damage' portion of ATK, but the principle is the same). The effect is small, and at very high ATK ratings becomes negligible. <br />
<br />
From my own parses i can extract the following numbers. Calculating base dps using equation 1, with swings/sec set to 1/base delay for MH and dw_rate/base delay for OH, and using the parsed values of hitratio and average damage i find: <br />
WLK/CotIO: 21.99 dps at 1129/1061 ATK and 30.94 dps at 1471/1404 ATK, an increase of 40.7% <br />
CotIO/WLK: 20.32 dps at 1061/1129 ATK and 29.21 dps at 1404/1471 ATK, an increase of 43.8% <br />
SoFW: 25.34 dps at 1059 ATK and 35.31 dps at 1401 ATK, an increase of 39.3%. <br />
A smaller increase with the 2HB then with the dw combo's. And the base_damage/base_delay ratio of my weapons aren't even as great as some other 1H'ers out there. The difference here is almost entirely from the OH. Upping the ATK even further wont change the picture; even when the relation between n and ATK levels off completely, 2HB will never catch up. <br />
<br />
<br />
7. Conclusions <br />
- Hit ratio depends on offensive skills only, ATK buffs have no effect on it <br />
- Confirmation that the dualwield rate at lvl 65 is higher then previously assumed <br />
- In the ATK range between 1060 and 1470, the multiplier for the base damage, n, depends linearly on ATK. A master curve can be constructed to account for differences in weapon skills. <br />
- A change in ATK gives a corresponding change in n equal to (0.00338+/-0.00006) times the change in ATK <br />
- With these results its possible to calculate the melee dps of any weapon in a particular situation once you've got a parse of a single weapon in that situation <br />
- There's no truth to the statement that you need high ATK for 2HB to be effective. Dualwielding will generally benefit more from high ATK then 2HB <br />
<br />
<br />
8. Further considerations, recommendations and future plans <br />
We won't ever get the full picture of ATK, average damage, hit ratio in relation to mob level, not unless SOE releases the source code to the public. But i hope this investigation helped a little in understanding some of the basic underlying mechanics. A next step could be getting some general idea how ATK against a green con compares to ATK against a blue con. For instance, is 1400 ATK against a green the same as, say, 1600 ATK against a blue or 1800 ATK against a red. You'll never get exact values, even among blue cons there will be differences (the change in damage distribution i've found actually suggests that he's not a typical green con either, but has a fairly high AC). But a general order of magnitude is already tremendously helpful. The hit ratios wont be same of course, but hit ratios can already be fairly well estimated against a variaty of cons. <br />
Extending the ATK range further would help to reinforce some parts of this investigation, but it won't provide much new insights so this has lower priority for me. <br />
I only have 5 days left on my free trial subscription and dont plan to return to EQ anytime soon, but i may not have to. Parsing dps in terms of average damage and n allows for comparison with other people's parses, because haste% doesn't matter, the weapon doesnt matter and neither do position or combat casting. It should even be possible to use data from other classes, as long as they are on the same basic damage table. So I'm trying to gather data from various board, but results so far are somewhat depressing. Most dps parses that are posted are missing one or more vital details; sometimes ATK rating isn't mentioned, often the dps only is given, or the average damage includes kicks, special attacks and critical (which add to the average in a non-linear way). So I'd like to ask everyone who posts dps parses to include as many details as possible (log them with a /say so you wont forget) and to parse in detail. Your dps is uninteresting (and i mean that in the friendliest possible way :) ) but average damage is worth its weight in gold (a couple of electrons weight that is) <br />

Plenty of people play the game.  But since the manual doesn't exactly describe what the fuck half of our numbers do, we have to find out ourselves.  There's nothing wrong with that at all, in fact, it's commendable.  <br />

<br />
Where are you disagreeing with him here? He's stating that ATK does not benefit 2handers more than it does 1handers (or h2h). This is been known for quite some time by the non-retard crowd and proven in a mess of parses (as you know). Where he states:<br />
<br />
- the OH doesnt have a damage bonus at all, meaning it gets full benefits of the additional ATK <br />
- 1H'ed weapons generally have higher base damage/base delay ratios.<br />

He is either miswording what he's trying to say or doesn't take into account that the DB actually affects max hit, thus if the OH had a DB, higher attack would definitely benefit DW (1H) more than 2H. Which is why we will probably not see a DB put on the offhand, ever, unless they make some really funky 2Handers.<br />

Everything in the post has been proven many many many months ago.  Nothing new.  /yawn <br />
<br />
Or in some cases, years ago.. *nod*</div></div><hr />

The parses clearly show that the benefits of strength have been upgraded in the past. The common knowledge is that strength raises the max hit but does little for dps. Now it seems that getting +X attack from strength has the exact same effect as getting +X attack from a pure attack buff or vengeance item. That means that as long as you dont have your strength capped you're better off getting +STR gear instead of the very expensive Vengeance gear. Not much of an issue for the ubers, but important for the little man</div></div><hr />

Actually I think he means exactly what he says.<br />
<br />
For example, if you have a SoT it's 54 damage ( which is affected by atk ) and 36 DB ( which isn't ). If you have a shinai and a quarm hammer it's 23 + 26 = 49 damage and still only 13DB.<br />
<br />
Even taking into account the offhand not swinging every hit, you can see that the proportion of dps that does not come from damage bonus is going to be significantly larger for the 1handers.<br />
<br />
Adding a damage bonus to the offhand would actually decrease the percentage amount that ATK improves dps for 1handers although the actual increase would remain the same. ( E.g. you go from 80-90 instead of 70-80 )</div></div><hr />

It hans't been upgraded.  I still have parses from late kunark showing a 69 str buff increasing my dps by 10%.  And these were four hour parses a piece.<br />
<br />
What I think he is saying with the atk effecting DW more is that if a mob had such incredible ac that you ALWAYS hit for minimum damage then a 1/30 two hander would out damage two 20/20 one handers until you got enough attack to make use of the damage rating of the weapon.  But that scenario is so far from happening that it really shouldn't be considered when comparing equivalent two handers and one handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;nice parses... quick question on dual wield. Am I reading it right that the offhand goes off over 80% of the time that the mainhand does at L65? Does this apply to warriors? <br />
<br />
I thought that was a lot higher than I remember L60 dual wield being, but our skill cap hasn't changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
From this guide on damage modals (which I still use, heh, to compare weapons when thinking about upgrades):<br />
http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=66<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The second difference is the Probability of Dual Wield. As mentioned earlier, there is no guarantee that your Offhand weapon will strike every round of combat. The probability of a successful Dual Wield is based on your current Level and your current Skill Level in Dual Wield. The probability of a successful Dual Wield is represented by a percentage, the most you can ever get being 78%. &quot;<br />
<br />
So once the skill cap gets to its peak, it's 77.5%, which Xaas rounded up to 78% in his age old guide.<br />
<br />
The interestig point from this person's parsing is of course this tidbit:<br />
<br />
&quot;I mention this here because Tastian's excellent parses showed recently that the dualwield rate at lvl 65 is 82.7+/-0.8 %, which is considerably higher then the dualwield rate calculated from the old formula (skill+level)/400 (77.5%).&quot;<br />
<br />
Which has me wondering, now, what the Dual Wield rate is, at 65, with ambidexterity. How much of an improvement is Ambi?<br />
<br />
I know someone's going to send me to the Ranger's Glade now aren't they?<br />
