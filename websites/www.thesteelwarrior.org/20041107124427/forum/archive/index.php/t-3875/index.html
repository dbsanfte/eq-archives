<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">issue with new graphics card... just upgraded from a GForce 2 to a GForce FX 5600 today at everytime i get to char select my comp frezzes... any ideas? i know my system can run eq just fine before this change, and i have the current drivers from the disk that came with card</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i just upgraded mine to, and i have that problem randomly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all I can think of is overheating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Post your complete system specs and I'll ask the techs at where I work and get back to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your mobo came with some kind of Temp measuring devide and a software along with it, check the Temp inside the case, maybe like Iskandar said, its overheating. Is the cooler on the vid card working well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">after some work and tech support i have gotten it down to one of four problems...<br />
<br />
Overheating<br />
Not enough power (only a 250w power supply)<br />
Broken Card<br />
not compatable with MB<br />
<br />
i dont think its the first or the last but could be... this afternoon i'm going to have a friend test it in his comp to determin if its the card/power or MB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not enough power, go get a 400w supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not enough power (only a 250w power supply) <br />
<br />
Agree this isn't even close to enough...I had a similar issue a couple years back...once I upgraded to 425watt never saw a repeat (my computer used to lock at random on the char screen).<br />
<br />
About 70 bucks and 20 minutes to replace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ditto, I vote for the power supply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also agree it's most likely powersupply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It is overheating your system will shut down randomly not just freeze up.  If it wasn't compatable with your MB you would know because it would fried the board or just the AGP slot.  Power Supply could be that but might not be.  Broken card good chance on that as well.   Did you try and see if your motherboard has an updated BIOS if so download it and install,  also download the latest Graphic drivers from Nvidia and the newest Direct X.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my problem<br />
<br />
it crashs EQ, and comes up with a window saying i can send my system specs to sony along with the bit of code that caused the crash.<br />
<br />
or it freezes to where i cant CTRL ALT delete and i have to restart, if its a power supply problem should mine just crash(reboot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gerick does the EQ randomly crash or at a certain point.  How frequent does it do so.  For the freezing I get the same problem lately  I have no clue if I just let it go and do nothing it goes back to normal.  It seems that EQ has been using more and more CPU and system resources lately sometimes I have my task manager open and notice a huge spike at times when either logging in or zoning.  I think LDON may be the blame but I can not be certain.  I did notice something before LDON I can have Nortons run a virus scan, download 100megs off the web and still have no perfoemance problems in EQ at all but now it will cause my CPU usage go crazy, zone time longer, or will freeze EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think you need to update your eq settings to your new graphics card.  Your ini file still has the GF2 in it and I think thats why your crashing.  Thy this<br />
<br />
Put in your username password and it will take you to server select.  Exit.... then options... then select your graphics card and  a few other options.<br />

Hope that helps<br />
