<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2004-08-17%2018:14:04<br />
<br />
The only one I can see off the top of my head that's Warrior is:<br />
Resolute Defiance - Upgrade to Warlord's Tenacity.  Instant self heal of 3000/4000/5000 with a DoT of 410/545/680 per tick for 11 ticks. <br />
<br />
I don't know, from an outside point of view, the sheer size of that heal looks good, although you're going to lose 1.5x that with the DoT (unless there's a way to get rid of it).<br />
<br />
The &quot;Press the Attack&quot; one might be Warrior, although it just has some effect.<br />
<br />
There's also a lot of effects that look similar to those &quot;Openings&quot; abilities.  Also, notice that Shamans received a group HoT that has Endurance Regen on it, it seems.  Perhaps they're finally going to add abilities that use Endurance other than disciplines and Incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the dot part doesn't do the full damage because of PvP penalty (because the dot come from the warrior himself).  A 5K heal is quite respectable, and certainly worth using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol... but the only AA we see so far is an upgrade to a GoD AA that virtually no one uses?  Nice. :p  I really want to have to max out the GoD AA that totally sucks so I can get this new thing... uh huh...<br />
<br />
And how nice, even more and better dire charms.  wtf... haven't the devs figured out yet that charm is the most overpowered thing in the game?  Looking forward to L70 chanters DCing through even more old content.  I suppose they'll put in regular charm upgrades too.<br />
<br />
Sheer will is probably a monk ability but might be extended to other meleers.  Rage looks like it's maybe for rogues but also might be given to other meleers.  Ancestral Aid also looks like a possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>fenemonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The whole rage line (Furious Rage 1,2,3 and Untamed Rage 1,2,3) seems 100% berserker to me.   LMAO at Heart of Stone...  gogo mage defensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wondering about Statis, a 15sec stun up to lvl 68 is pretty damn powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Monks already have purify body.  I think Sheer Will will be warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the rage line with better effects will be for Berserkers, and the lesser line will be for Warriors.  <br />
<br />
And 50% mitigation on classes that can't tank and can't hold aggro doesn't really mean anything.</div></div><hr />

/agrees</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DC hasn't ever been really &quot;powerfull&quot; and won't be still really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Depends on what level they cap it at.  When DC came out it was pretty damn powerful.  And I suppose chanters are getting a higher level regular charm too.  wheeee....<br />
/wave more 1k+ dps pets<br />
<br />
Point is they do so much of value to a group already without being made into a superb dps class too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>fenemonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The new DCs cap at level 55.  You can see the max level for players' charms on Lucy if you go to the Raw Data section and check the &quot;max1&quot; value.   Chanter's level 69 charm caps at level 69, gonna be some sick dps there heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wanted some AA's like this:<br />
<br />
Flurry Awareness<br />
This ability makes you generate a FLURRY message that other players can see whenever you flurry. The other players will be more impressed by you 10%, 20%, and 50% of the time.<br />
<br />
Alcohol Mastery<br />
The first rank of this ability allows you to raise your Alcohol Tolerance skill beyond 200. At each additional rank, your stats will actually improve when you consume alcohol, but will be penalized when you are sober.<br />
<br />
Triple Wield<br />
This ability allows you to use a third weapon in your teeth. You must be wearing a one-handed weapon in your face slot in order to triple wield.<br />
<br />
Ideal Warrior<br />
This ability puts you into automatic mode. You will automatically auto-attack nearby mobs that attack your group members, taunting whenever you do not have aggro, and automatically using disciplines whenever your health drops below 20%. When not engaged in combat, you will auto-follow the nearest group member, even across zone lines. When resurrected, you will automatically loot your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Charm isn't going to be a big deal.  Whatever's charmable can already dual wield most of the time anyway, and mob DPS doesn't really jump up that much 66+ besides the auto dual wield part.  A blue Mastruq/Ratuk/Kyv that you can charm is easily as powerful as their red counterparts (minus a small difference in max hit).  <br />
<br />
A max cap of 55 also limits how this can be used in PoP zones, not to mention at level 70 you won't be getting very much xp in a zone with level 55 mobs).<br />
<br />
I'd imagine you'd just see some utility charm mobs placed at level 55 throughout various GoD zones like the odd light blue DCable mobs in PoP zones.</div></div><hr />
