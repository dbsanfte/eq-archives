<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lochr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was briefly asked in the &quot;Too many weapons&quot; thread, but I thought it might merit discussion in its own thread. Does anyone know, or has tried to parse, the proc rates of augs when used on a weapon with an inherent proc, and one without?<br />
<br />
The cleric board has a thread on the augment removal currently on test, and the new solvents are quite affordable. I haven't augged my GSoT with anger yet because, well, it seems kind of silly to spend 1100 points on a weapon worth 100pp. But I would if I could reuse the augment sometime in the future. I'm in a small family guild that doesn't raid, so I'm not likely to improve my current weapons any time soon.<br />
<br />
Question: would the anger augment proc more on, say the 34/28 smithed sword from GoD, the GSoT, or would it proc the same amount?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess is that it would proc the same amount but it's always better to put a Agro Augment on a weapon that already has a proc on it.</div></div><hr />

A procing weapon only.<br />
Cant tell you how many warriors I see Anger III a SBoD and wonder how an unauged SotBS and CHoS steal aggro from them.<br />
<br />
If your going to put an aggro aug on a weapon, it only makes sense to aggo aug an aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the correct answer is with 2 agro procs you are less likely to hit the dreaded no agro proc at all streak. so you can count on at least one proc if it fires to hold agro.<br />
<br />
thats the thinking behind it.</div></div><hr />
