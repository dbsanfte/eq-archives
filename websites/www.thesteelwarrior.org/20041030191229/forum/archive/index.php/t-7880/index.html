  Bought a couple of the AC10 Augs from BB camp the other night.  When I put one on my AMY Chain mask (face), the net result was 17 AC.<br />
<br />
Let me explain, so it sounds right in type.  AC w/o the Augs was 1232. Adding the 10AC Aug I figured it would rise to 1242, but instead it rose to 1249. <br />
<br />
The second went on my Amulet of Mummy wrappings (neck), and had a net increase of 15 AC.  The other slots that the Augs could go into (Forged Shoulderpads, Cloak of the Maelstrom, Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt) already had minor Augs in them.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering - and will be experimenting with when the patch makes available - is how the placement of the AC Augs is affected by either their slot placement, or the type of item they are added to.  I don't  think this behavior exists with other Augs (HPs, resists, etc), and I seem to recall throughout my Warrior career that putting on a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic netted more than its listed 12 AC; and the Enameled Black Chestplate raised AC by quite a bit more than its listed 25 AC.<br />
<br />
If this idea holds out, and there is no forced need to place Augs, it could be that placing these AC Augs adds more AC when in plate-type items, versus chain, leather, or cloth.<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me get my thoughts down on paper (er, pixels, er, whatever!)<br />

<br />
AC on gear (and augments) is multiplied by 1.6 when worn.  An AC10 item should provide (on average) 16 AC as reported on your inventory window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That increase is a warrior class AC bonus I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, the previous posters are correct..it's a modifier. The slot or item type shouldnt matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Possible exception would be shields.  Since the new info came out about shield AC counting over the normal cap, it would seem that an AC aug in a shield would be worth more then one somewhere else (although it wouldn't show up in your stats).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The difference you're seeing between one giving you 15ac and the other giving you 17ac is just due to rounding.  Obviously multiplying by 1.6 will not give you a whole number every time and the game only shows AC that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valkir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all for setting me straight on this.  I'd noticed a long time ago the higher AC given than what was listed, but never made a connection to a set multiplier.<br />
<br />
A Happy Fourth of July to all!<br />

<br />
but we still need to find an AC aug to fill the secondary slot (at least there is none in LDoN).<br />
<br />
EDIT : sorry, I found one 20AC aug : &quot;Ashen Claystone of Aegis&quot;, must come from GoD.</div></div><hr />
