<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone test out the dx 9 changes on the test server and their impact on the graphics aspects of game (less lag in zones, faster zone times etc?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I logged on test and I cant tell any difference. I dont think its the full implementation of the new graphics engine yet. I am not sure if this is just an intermediate step to get people to upgrade to DX9 or what.<br />
<br />
But as mentioned here(http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19633):<br />
<br />
&quot;They have also added addtional display filters that you can turn on spell effects for:<br />
<br />
- my spells<br />
- group spells<br />
- raid spells<br />
- all pc's<br />
- me + npc<br />
- group + npc<br />
-raid + npc<br />
-all spells&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the DirectX 9 upgrade is to weed out some people who use really old cards. As far as I know, voodoo cards and some older cards that EQ works with but doesnt officially support don't have any DX9 compatible drivers.<br />
<br />
Its a good and bad thing. Its bad that less people will get to play, but its good that they can finally tweak the graphics engine a bit more, and actually make it perform decently with luclin models on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I currently have DirectX 8.1.  I'm told that, once you upgrade to DirectX 9.0, there is no way to go back.  So, is there any downside to the upgrade?  (I have an NVidia GeForce2 MX 200 on one computer, an NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti4200 on the other.)  Given the problems SoE has had in the past with required upgrades, I am a bit suspicious about how this might screw things up royally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The real reason they are doing it is to force people to upgrade thier graphics cards now while playing EQ so that they are dx9 compliant for EQ2.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile people like me who have cards that are not dx9 copliant but still run EQ well are stuck having to buy a new vid card if we want to play in GoD. Personally I think they should have said somthing about this before they started offering pre-orders of GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I think they should have said somthing about this before they started offering pre-orders of GoD.<br />
Well, they're putting this on Test, which is not where GoD resides (that's Beta, which already requires dx9), so this may end up affecting you regardless of if you order GoD or not.</div></div><hr />
