<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A Knight Defensive-like mitigation capability would defeat the purpose of balance changes introduced by SoE because other classes tanked too much like Warriors.<br />
<br />
&quot;....warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; &quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot; <br />
The Arch Overseers proved that with a party of 72, all PoTime bosses could be killed without using a Warrior to MT.<br />
<br />
The Warrior survivability advantage had become narrow, and with 72 members in a party was not required even against (then) current content most difficult mobs.<br />
<br />
SoE made needed balance adjustments to Warrior including the &quot;-1 DI&quot; mitigation change. Later they added Sturdyness - 500HP's for 60AA.<br />
<br />
Obviously, these changes would not have much effect where a large party could make adjustments which allowed other classes to MT hard hitting named mobs.<br />
<br />
However, in a smaller party, the flexability to compensate would not necessarily be present.<br />
<br />
In some of the GoD trials, the designers created named mobs with (approximately):<br />
DB=400<br />
DI=80<br />
Stun Immune<br />
No AE<br />
No Proc Effects<br />
Slowable<br />
With few enough HP's that they can be killed in under 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
No one should be shocked that Warriors have an easier time MTing it in a 6 person group.<br />
<br />
If such a mob had been created say for the Beserker Epic and plunked down in EJ, then players may well have concluded after awhile that is was one group doable with a Warrior MTing. If a Paladin was the MT they better get a few more people.<br />
<br />
This is the way mobs have always been in EQ.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Not all mobs are equally tankable by the three Plate tanks with the same number of people.<br />
<br />
Warriors have a mitigation advantage including Defensive that make them the prefered MT vs. hard hitting (high DI) named mobs.<br />
<br />
This is the way EQ has been for quite awhile.<br />
<br />
Paladin calls for a Defensive-like mitigation change so they can successfully MT hard-hitting named mobs in the same-sized group as a Warrior is an attempt to co-opt the reason for Warriors to exist.<br />
....warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. <br />
Those words or anything like them appear in no other class description.<br />
<br />
If (at this point in the game) fighting a mob that hits for 2100HP's  with a 6-person group isn't a &quot;brutal battle&quot;, then I don't know what is. It might not be an appropriate mob in a Trial, but it is entirely appropriate for Warriors to be prefered when fighting it.<br />
<br />
Knights have spellbooks. They are not Warriors that can buff, heal others, Root, GRC, HT, etc. Perhaps the period where for all practical purposes they were Warriors with Spellbooks confused some of them.<br />
....warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. <br />
Instead of this Warrior attribute, Knights get Spellbooks.<br />
<br />
I invite those with views this topic to express it here where your voice will not be stilled nor will you be shouted down because your arguement is persuasive. (Kinda sad when the TSW Outhouse contains more cogent and civil discussion than other site's Class Balance forums).<br />
<br />
Edit: thread was unOuthoused - an injustice that shall not stand!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was almost set to support Knights wholeheartedly on this whole trials thing until some facts came to light.<br />
<br />
 1) It is not necessary for all guild members to be so flagged. It is also not necessary for 85% of all guild members to be so flagged. It is also not necessary for any number of guild members to be flagged higher than ONE.<br />
<br />
 2) Paladins and SK's both have tanked these mobs successfully.<br />
<br />
 3) Many of the Paladins pushing for changes HAVE NEVER ATTEMPTED THE CONTENT IN QUESTION, NOR ARE THEY ABLE TO AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY GEARED/LEVELED/FLAGGED.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Now, all that being said, I feel it's past time that Paladins, being a defense oriented tank, should get some kind of Fortitude/Weaponshield disc, and the /shield ability. It also may be time for all healing classes to have their heals looked at in the form of Ancient spells.<br />
<br />
 But eliminating Defensive? Giving it to Knights? Giving Knights additional HP's? Sorry, don't support it, never will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Partha,<br />
<br />
Can you show me where it's written by Verant/SoE that Paladins are the Defensive Tank? I believe Warriors are the Defensive Tank and that Paladins are the tank that casts priestly spells.<br />
<br />
If such a phrase was associated with Paladins, it is in contrast with Shadow Knights, not Warriors.<br />
<br />
(I'm not busting your chops, just looking for information/clarification)<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I merely assume so based off of the fact that Warrior DPS &lt; SK DPS, when you add in the spellbook. When you add in the Paladin spellbook - well, they do come off looking like a better long term answer for survivability to me than Warriors.<br />
<br />
 Warriors DO get the 'rockstar' thing for 3 minutes and 12 seconds, but against 95% of the mobs out there, it seems counterbalanced to me by stuns against stunnable mobs, heals and group heals, root CC, pacify ability at lower levels.....<br />
<br />
 Basically what I meant is if you need 3 minutes of virtually guaranteed no death against tough content, you want a Warrior. When you're looking at 'normal' difficulty stuff that doesn't force you into odd group compositions, a Paladin might still be after all the changes the long term solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So basicly what I hear is:<br />
<br />
Warriors should have a unique Defensive capability that makes them prefered MT's vs. hard hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
The spells Paladins recieve to balance this ability - stuns against stunnable mobs, heals and group heals, root CC, pacify ability at lower levels, [buffs] gives them a group preference whenever Warrior survivability is not a greater advantage.<br />
<br />
Sounds balanced to me.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's pretty much how I see it. Where I'm at (BoT and below), the Knight/Warrior situation has never been more balanced, IMNSHO. I don't see groups saying anymore 'gotta get XXX to tank with' unless they're the completely anal. Of course, when my guild goes and does heavy content, they prefer taking a Warrior, but Paladins and SK's in the guild CAN do the heavy lifting at that initial penalty. Life is good, and these groaners piss me off. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, IMO if Paladins have a legitimate gripe it's that too hard-hitting mobs are in the trials and that their spellbook has not kept pace with bona fide normal experiance zones (questionable) and insuring a high-level raid role (probably true).<br />

They are not Warriors that can buff, heal others, Root, GRC, HT, etc. Perhaps the period where for all practical purposes they were Warriors with Spellbooks confused some of them. <br />
<br />
Maybe the class description as &quot;warrior/cleric hybrid&quot; confused some of them, too ... *does not* say &quot;clerics with swords anywhere&quot;.<br />
<br />
From an aggro/utility point of view, it never felt so hybrid-like to play a warrior as it does now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe some do read this as W(capital 'w')arrior plus Cleric and believe they should tank all content like a Warrior, buff better than a Cleric, and walk on water.<br />
<br />
Others read this as a class based on Warriors and Clerics, but unable to replace either in their narrow specialization.<br />
<br />
Please note the specific reference only in the Warrior Class Description to becoming the focus of the mobs attacks. The lower Knight Taunt skill cap is evidence they were not supposed to have superior aggro to Warriors. Frodlin has a lovely quote from SoE/Verant supporting this if you need it dug up.<br />
<br />
You'll know when you are a hybrid - you'll have a mana bar.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What irritates me is that some Pallies seem to think we want &quot;more utility&quot;.  This probably stems from the fact that it is thier utility that counterbalances our innate mitigation and discs.  What they miss is that most Warriors don't want nor care about utility.  We signed on to tank, to be the best tanks, and to do nothing more than tank.  The fact that they do have utility is what makes them secondary tanks.  It's the sacrifice we made to be the best in our area and it's a sacrifice we happily make.  I wasn't even happy about the whole healing will thing, but seeing as it's a total waste of End it doesn't bother me too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, what's really going on IMO is that some Paladins having stuck it out to level 65 believe that there should be three co-equal Tanks. They manage to see that Clerics should be the Prime Healer, but are dissatisfied that Warriors are the prefered MT vs. hard-hitting mobs at least until they are mastered and near end expansion equipment allows others to MT them.<br />
<br />
The only way to achieve their goal is to reduce as much as possible our survivability advantage and how much content it is an advantage to having. They suggest our abilities and disciplines are a spellbook. They overlook the fact that even if this were the case then they would have 2 spellbooks. Their ploy is to contend we are a hybrid and there should be &quot;Tank Parity&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course the fact that their combined Tanking ability and powerful priestly spells would make them the premiere tank in the game is just happenstance.<br />
<br />
We are different classes and just like Clerics, Druids, and Shaman have different roles with overlap in normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BB: &quot;Not all mobs are equally tankable by the three Plate tanks with the same number of people.&quot;<br />
<br />
I completely agree that some mobs should require more ppl present if you don't use a warrior as MT. Now if we could bring more than 6ppl in a trial to offset not having a warrior tank I don't think you'd be seeing so many disagreements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paladin calls for a Defensive-like mitigation change so they can successfully MT hard-hitting named mobs in the same-sized group as a Warrior is an attempt to co-opt the reason for Warriors to exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Same as above, it's more a question of not being able to increase the amount of ppl present to offset the inbalance then wanting EQUALITY to your tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Partha: &quot;3) Many of the Paladins pushing for changes HAVE NEVER ATTEMPTED THE CONTENT IN QUESTION, NOR ARE THEY ABLE TO AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY GEARED/LEVELED/FLAGGED.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe there's a reason we haven't attempted it. Suicidal comes to mind. <br />
<br />
But should it be acceptable that a warrior and a paladin of equal level/aa/gear be so far apart in their capabilities to do these encounters? My guild doesn't consist of only paladins, it has warriors in them, warriors that are geared equal content wise (IE: they don't have PoTime gear since we're not there only EP) and these warriors are capable of MT'ing content in GoD where I as a paladin am not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, all that being said, I feel it's past time that Paladins, being a defense oriented tank, should get some kind of Fortitude/Weaponshield disc, and the /shield ability. It also may be time for all healing classes to have their heals looked at in the form of Ancient spells.<br />
<br />
But eliminating Defensive? Giving it to Knights? Giving Knights additional HP's? Sorry, don't support it, never will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most paladins don't want to eliminate defensive PER SAY, you'll notice if you bother looking that there are FAR more suggestions at knight increases in the form of abilities and spells at MAJOR costs then there are at removing /def. <br />
<br />
<br />
BB: &quot;Well, IMO if Paladins have a legitimate gripe it's that too hard-hitting mobs are in the trials and that their spellbook has not kept pace with bona fide normal experiance zones (questionable) and insuring a high-level raid role (probably true).&quot;<br />
<br />
It isn't questionable BB. Paladin spellbooks have NOT scaled with expansions. Why is it so hard for warriors to understand we don't WANT to be warriors. What we TRULY want is a role BOTH in raids AND in groups. On raids we have gone from being THEE ae class to the &quot;hey he's only at 99% health let me top him off&quot; class. Our tanking in PoP after incite was well BALANCED, warriors were the prefered MT for boss encounters (a few being the exception) until content just plain didn't really matter anymore. BUT, there wasn't such a discrepency when group tanking. Any of the 3 classes were 100% AS capable to fill that role which meant you could choose any of them. You didn't choose the paladin in groups because he had utitily, you chose the paladin because he could TANK just as well as a warrior for that content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another thing that irritates me is people equating 1 small part of the game to the entire game.  The GoD trials may need help.  That does not mean that the tank classes aren't balanced or that Pallies should tank as well as Warriors.  Seems like you can't have any discussion about class balance anymore without the damn GoD trials being brought up, which very, very few players are even capable of doing at this point.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Paladin spellbooks have NOT scaled with expansions.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I call bullshit.  Pallies have gotten new spells with every expansion.  As with all classes, many of these spells are worthless, but Pallies still got very useful unique spells and have a very vital role in pretty much every raid I've been on.  Particularly against AE mobs and raids where off-tanking is vital.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Taragor,<br />
<br />
Well and calmly said. And yes, it is concievable and reasonable for an EP Warrior to MT the Tipt and Vexd named while a barely PoTime Paladin cannot. It takes roughly one expansion greater in equipment for a Paladin to do that which a Warrior can do earlier.<br />
<br />
Go through Magelo and look at the first 100 or 200 Warriors and Paladins - there's a difference even without concidering Defensive. Warriors are more effective vs. hard-hitting mobs - that's their niche.<br />
<br />
Can an EP Cleric be the main healer in these trials while a PoTime Druid cannot? How about a pre-Ep Cleric?<br />
<br />
That EP Warrior is going nowhere without your guild. The trials lead to raid content. <br />
<br />
I agree if even 8 people could enter these trials there would be much less concern.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">But should it be acceptable that a warrior and a paladin of equal level/aa/gear be so far apart in their capabilities to do these encounters?

<br />
 This question keeps being brought up, and keeps getting answered, and it seems Paladins don't want to hear the answers.<br />
<br />
 Name an expansion where all the raid level mobs were tanked by Knights at the same time as Warriors in the high end game.<br />
<br />
 Did Knights have to gear up to tank Velious, or did they tank Velious equally as well as Warriors when the content was first attempted?<br />
<br />
 Did Knights have to gear up to tank in Luclin, or did they tank Luclin equally as well as Warriors when the content was first attempted?<br />
<br />
 The trials, whether anyone likes to hear it or not, are RAID content. Sony's new twist is that it's a raid with a maximum of 6 people. Raid caps are nothing new; raid caps of 6 are, and a bit offputting for those who (I suspect) are now used to the 72 man PoP cap. (Remember the complaints about 36 man raids?) However, the cap still does NOT make it 'xp group' content.<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, once again, Knights of a certain gear level certainly ARE tanking in GoD. The fact that YOU or YOUR GUILD have not reached that level of gear != broken content, no more than a guild in Velious that was decked out in old world gear could not have a Paladin tank AoW made THAT broken content.<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, I can tank content in GoD. Not well or efficiently, but I can. To suggest that a non raid geared Warrior will tank as well as an EP geared Paladin, even WITH defensive added in, is misleading at best and falsehood at worst. Define what you mean by 'I can't tank content in GoD'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting a uniquely named washed down cleric spell in LDoN does not equate usefull. Getting a 90hp increase fast casting save the day heal spell when you double/triple/quadruple the dmg output of mobs does not equal usefull. Uniquely named yes, worth more than a replacement for toilet paper when you run out, no.<br />
<br />
and have a very vital role in pretty much every raid I've been on.  Particularly against AE mobs and raids where off-tanking is vital.  <br />
<br />
What exactly is the purpose of my group only 850hp heal when we have clerics/druids/bst casting mgb'able hots? Seriously, with the advent of those aa's paladin group heals are VERY outdated.<br />
<br />
As for offtanking, with warriors having been given incite and the like they are just as capable of offtanking as we are. I am NOT saying that paladins cannot do it anymore, just that warriors can do it just as well. Also a warrior offtanking WILL live longer than a paladin until the add is either a) mezzed b) killed <br />
<br />
<br />
 Originally posted by Battleblade<br />

<br />
There's a few things to factor in with this.<br />
<br />
1) Can the druid perform his other abilities? <br />
2) Will he be picked for the group for those other abilities?<br />
<br />
I believe the answer to both questions is yes. Once again it comes down to numbers. Limiting a trial to 6 ppl while requiring a MINIMUM of 3 specific classes leaves very little room for others. <br />
<br />
Now you have to ask the following question. <br />
<br />
Should the group for 1 of it's last 3 spots select a paladin for his offtanking abilities, minimal healing capabilities with the added boon that IF the cleric dies and the paladin survives he can rez the cleric.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Do you pick a DPS class to reduce the amount of time it takes to kill the mobs thus lowering the odds of 1 or 2 rounding MT kills. Not to mention making 1 of those classes a necro gives you rezzing abilities equal to that of a paladins with the added caveat that he can FD / drag to a safe area to do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd also like to make an observation and please tell me how you'd feel about this. What if there was no gain from the trial apart from a flag? What if there was no xp, no loot, no augs etc. Would warriors be so pleased that they'd have to do stuff to cross ppl over to later zones at a complete waste of their time? <br />
<br />
Or worse, what if the augs and gear upgrades in trials are NEEDED for ppl to survive the trash in the raid zones? What happens now with paladins not being very viable or desired in those trials? They can't upgrade their gear to fill that role, so now they must wait until raid zones are farmed and they have access to upgrades before having even an offtanking role.<br />
<br />
I agree alot of this is speculation since raid zones have not been breeched yet, but you play the same game I do, you know the mentality of SoE when it comes to progression and mob difficulty in those progressions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it was easy to misunderstand what I was trying to say. As it stands right now today, warriors in my guild &quot;EP capable and geared&quot; are able to tank the first few trials in GoD, whereas I as a paladin cannot, even though we are of the same gear level. Now I don't have a PROBLEM with not being able to tank the named. I have a problem with not having access to those trials period because in the end in a FORCED environment where only 6 ppl can be present I am a very weak link.<br />
<br />
Also Partha the 1 group raid mentality is unacceptable. There has NEVER been an expansion where all players could not be gear upgraded at the same time in the lifespan of EQ. Yes warriors were the only option to MT since the dawn of time, BUT, even though I couldn't MT the end mob I DID atleast have a chance to participate in those encounters, and more importantly, have a chance at upgrading my gear not only for myself, but to be of more use to my guild. This is not the case with the GoD trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Taragor,<br />
<br />
Re-read what you wrote. In essence it's a statement that your spellbook is inadequate.<br />
<br />
If, as you claim, Incite made Warriors the preferred Add/tank off tank in raids (untrue for a variety of reasons) are you advocating nerfing Incite since that's the source of this alledged difficulty? I take damage better than you. Do you suppose that with a Bow, Crystalline Silk Nets, DBoW/EoE /w Anger III augs, Symbol of the Plansmasters, and a Taunt button I can't do the job without Incite? Um you ought to read what Incite does. Seriously you think it means something in the raid context.<br />
<br />
If you are ever to do better than a Warrior as an add tank/off tank you need a Root that works, stuns that ocassionally interrupt, and the ability to help keep your group healthy.<br />
<br />
Remember saying the Druid has another role? So do you - off tank/Combat Medic/CC. You can't do any of this better than a specialist - none of it. But if your spells were more effective it would help you in raids, in groups, and finding a spot in 6 person trials.<br />
<br />
Every trials group looks to add a 2nd resser now - it's that important. Try hard and you'll figure out why a Paladin would not be preferred to a Necro (it's not a Necro's ability to Tank). Every group I've been in has room for a second healer. Why not a Paladin instead of a Shaman or Druid (they don't Tank either)?<br />
<br />
Paladins have presented themselves to other players and to SoE as primarily interested in tankng like a Warrior - something that in the end isn't going to happen. Focusing as much attention on the fact that backup tank, Divine Stun, Healing, CC, and Res in one package is a lot rather than downplay the spellbook might have gotten Paladins the few improvements they needed to be more valued then just as an 18% less damage MT with inferior survivability. In raids we know better - but it's haunting you in min/max groups.<br />
<br />
I don't think PoN posters can get SoE to nerf Warriors enough or give Paladins enough survivability to make up for the fact your main problem is found in your spellbook.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer it if there was no gain from the trials other than flags which btw don't have to be obtained by everyone in your guild. In fact, that's a great idea.<br />
<br />
What if full PoTime and augments from LDoN hard were required to farm those augs in the trials. Would the many complainers from PoN stfu and gear up form the previous expanisons. Or would they still be pressing to have classes, mobs, something anything change? Make it stop OMG LOLZ I've lost my group role!!!<br />

<br />
 Quite frankly, were MY guild having to pick 6 people to advance through a trial zone, I would be a very weak link also. It still does not invalidate the content, nor does it validate the response from PoN posters.<br />
<br />
Also Partha the 1 group raid mentality is unacceptable. There has NEVER been an expansion where all players could not be gear upgraded at the same time in the lifespan of EQ.

This is not the case with the GoD trials. <br />
<br />
 You are correct - this is NOT the case with the GoD trials. However, NOTHING about these trials really matches ANY previous content in EQ. That may make it unpleasant for any tank not at the top of the pecking order, but there is an upside!<br />
<br />
 YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THESE TRIALS TO ADVANCE. EVER.<br />
<br />
 There's no 85% rule. There's no 100% rule. ONE guildie of yours must survive all this. I find NO reason to NOT like the idea of not having to do these trials to survive except for the fact that it damages egos to be 'not enough tank' to tank this thing. Well, I'm really sorry, honestly, but very probably the number of tanks in this game who are never able to do them is likely to be a lot larger than those who can, and it will not prevent any guild that wants to from progressing.<br />
<br />
 If nothing else, consider these trials like the Olympics for your guild. Put your best 6 out there and have them run the event and win. Continue on and do the raids past it. Don't be like a Scottie Pippen with 1.8 seconds on the clock and refuse to play because the ball is put in the hands of a better 3 point shooter.</div></div><hr />

FALSE<br />
I build my own groups all the time because I got sick of sitting lfg.  I'll gladly take a paladin in my group, and most of the time the paladins I group with in a pickup situation aren't nearly as durable a tank as I am(my gear is not the uberest by any means, but it ain't too shabby either).  I take them anyway for the utility they bring with them.  <br />
If it happens that the pally has roughly equal or better hp/ac than I do, we usually argue about who gets to take the night off and do substandard DPS and wait for a disaster to require us to step up and get beat on too (which if your CC is worth a damn really doesnt happen that often). <br />
I'll grant you that in min/max, my group has to be the perfect group situations (some folks are way too anal about group makeup) there is usually only one tank, but that doesnt mean it has to be that way for success.<br />
I've never done a GoD trial, and probably never will, but from everything I've read here, you don't HAVE to do one to progress.  If you did, I'd see your desire to be better at it as a legitimate grievance, but as it is, it sounds like a small minority of knights don't like the fact that they're not the premier tank in the game anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Unique spells=Not washed down cleric spells.  Paladins and SKs both do, in fact, get thier own spells that nobody else has.  BSS is a good example of a Pally unique spell.  And realize that I'm not in a top end guild.  We've just now managed to kill AoW for the first time (done Grummus twice and Carprin).  MGB HoTs are not always available to us, and Paladins fill this requirement nicely.  Occasionally we will use Druids in place of Clerics to free them up for group heals, but more often that not it isn't an option for us.  I can't speak for a guild that is EP geared with 100+ members, though.  Just pointing out that Paladins are not obselete throughout the game, even if they might be at the top, which I still don't think is true.<br />
<br />
I can' speak for the end game, but I do know that our Pallies still group heal during AE fights.  Usually our Clerics and Druids are concentrating on the MT/RT and off tanks.  As far as off-tanking, when you are in a fight were adds spawn in the middle, Pallies and SKs can get and hold aggro much faster and better, which means the next CH that lands on the MT doesn't lead to a squished Cleric/Druid.  That and most of the time our Pallies and SKs can keep themselves healed without eating up another healer or with just Quiescence in addition to self healing.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I just cannot subscribe to the interpretation that because Warriors actually are the best at pure melee tanking now (as they should be) Knights are now useless.  Certainly the Knights in my guild still play a very vital role in almost every raid.  There are also raids where Warriors are nothing but background noise.<br />
<br />
Again, if the situation is purely in GoD, that's where it should stay.  I see no balance issues anywhere else in the game at this point.<br />
<br />
PS - I don't disagree with you on the GoD trials, assuming that what you are saying is correct.  Limiting a EP/Time guild to a 6 person progression raid is pretty silly.  At the very least, there should be a variety of trials that can be done with different group makeups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Paladins are not the defensive tank, however, they ARE the defensive hybrid. As opposed to the SK, being the offensive hybrid.<br />
<br />
Paladins bring many tools that enhance a party's survivability.<br />
<br />
That being said, many Paladins take their spellbook for granted.  They think, that just because other people can do what they do, better, they suck. But what they don't seem to recognize is that, while those people are better in one thing, they're much worse in others. <br />
<br />
Take for example warriors vs paladins. Warriors can tank better, aye. But they have no other use. No buffs, rezzes, heals, root, stun, the like.<br />
<br />
Take cleric vs paladin. They can heal better, aye, but they can't tank or do any real damage to speak of.<br />
<br />
The strength of the paladin is in his versatility. He one of only TWO classes in the game with a group heal, one of only 3 classes in the game with a rez, one of two classes in the game with fast heals. This really illustrates the paladin's role.<br />
<br />
I've said it before and I'll say it again... warriors pay for defensive by having absolutely no spells, and pay for our other bonuses by having absolutely no utility of any sort. The only way to give a hybrid defensive is to give warriors spells that are just as powerful as what the hybrids now possess, OR to remove hyrid spellbooks from the game and give them an incite-like ability for aggro.<br />
<br />
It's funny how evey time I've said that to a hybrid, as to what they'd have to give up to get it, they've shut up about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it was true - there are Paladin weildable aggro weapon. Wouldn't take much to augment one. There, all fixed. Paladins have better aggro then Warriors again. (Doesn't mean a thing).<br />
<br />
The &quot;Our spellbook is useless&quot; argument rears it's ugly head right on time too. Hey, if your spellbook is useless, prove it to SoE and get another phat heal, a stun that works, and a higher level effective root. Geez.<br />

Can Knights offtank/Add tank the yard trash? My own personal observation is yes. This would lead me to believe they can MT normal expericance groups at least throught Vexd and Tipt and will be able to function as Add Tank/off tanks on raids (given the normal mobs I've seen).<br />
<br />
I think it's one thing to set up an experiance group in the picnic area in PoFire and another to start pulling named mobs out of the open field. There's nothing different about GoD experiance camps.<br />
<br />
While certainly Knights are Tanks and should be able to MT an increasing number one-groupable named mobs (and raid boss mobs) as they accumulate an expansion's improved equipment, this ability is driven by acumulating the equipment, not being given Warrior-like mitigation advantages.<br />

Re-read what you wrote. In essence it's a statement that your spellbook is inadequate.<br />
<br />
Truth be told there is alot of work that needs to be done to our spellbook. The problem is that we will never receive any upgrades to it until the other priest classes do or we'll not only be battling with 1 class (warriors) but 3 (clr/dru/shm). Either way it's a losing situation for us. :)<br />
<br />
If, as you claim, Incite made Warriors the preferred Add/tank off tank in raids (untrue for a variety of reasons) are you advocating nerfing Incite since that's the source of this alledged difficulty?<br />
<br />
I didn't say it made warriors the prefered offtank, I said it gave warriors the ability to offtank very well whereas pre incite knights generally covered that role. It was just a mention to show other areas where the utility of knights was dwindling. Not completely, just partly. And NOWHERE did I say I wanted them to NERF it. I believe warriors needed it and am glad it wasn't a ducktape solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are ever to do better than a Warrior as an add tank/off tank you need a Root that works, stuns that ocassionally interrupt, and the ability to help keep your group healthy.<br />
<br />
That means tuning our spellbook which SoE seems COMPLETELY against unless they give the ability with twice the power to 6 other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every trials group looks to add a 2nd resser now - it's that important. Try hard and you'll figure out why a Paladin would not be preferred to a Necro (it's not a Necro's ability to Tank). Every group I've been in has room for a second healer. Why not a Paladin instead of a Shaman or Druid (they don't Tank either)?<br />
<br />
Simple answer. I don't have the heal capacity OR the manapool to be an effective 2nd healer. My MAX heal is 5 sec cast for a total of 1125hp, that barely covers a hit let alone a melee round. This is why paladins are not in those groups as healers.<br />
<br />
Paladins have presented themselves to other players and to SoE as primarily interested in tankng like a Warrior - something that in the end isn't going to happen. Focusing as much attention on the fact that backup tank, Divine Stun, Healing, CC, and Res in one package is a lot rather than downplay the spellbook might have gotten Paladins the few improvements they needed to be more valued then just as an 18% less damage MT with inferior survivability. In raids we know better - but it's haunting you in min/max groups.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with you on this. Pre GoD you didn't see paladins complaining that they needed more tankibility compared to warriors, you did see mention of spell upgrades/tweaks though. We've been asking for those since before PoP. What did they do? They gave abilties that were our domain (group healing) to a bunch of other classes. To make it worse, they gave them those abilities WITH mgb capabilities. They gave us MORE watered down versions of cleric buffs with LDoN. They gave us more stuns which only really help in our tanking, they gave us a root which IS nice except a root isn't a snare, it can, and usually does break WAY before it's full duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think PoN posters can get SoE to nerf Warriors enough or give Paladins enough survivability to make up for the fact your main problem is found in your spellbook.<br />
<br />
I don't think most of PoN wants warriors nerfed as much as they want to have an identity again. Forget for a second you are a warrior. Imagine how a paladin feels. Back in kunark we were useless, then came velious where we got a small boon but were still a third wheel more often than not, then luclin where well, pretty much all tanks were useless, then comes PoP, a HUGE expansion with MAJOR zones and ALOT of content, paladins all of a sudden find themselves INVITED to groups, not from sitting in guildchat and begging but from TOTAL strangers, so the paladins are like &quot;WOW, so THIS is what it's like to play a usefull class&quot; now comes GoD which IS NOT kunark, BUT go back a few month and paladins started slowly losing their roles, mgb HoT's pretty much eliminated that role for us, ldon spells that were of no value, warriors getting the incite line(which once again I AGREE with and don't want it nerfed)., unlinked discs, mitigation upgrades. GoD, Where the content has obviously not only been tuned in regards to high EP/PoTime level but taking into consideration the mitigation changes to warriors. NOW, go back to thinking you're a warrior. You saw how you felt during PoP when nobody wanted your class unless you were in GOD equipment and maxed out AA's and think how you felt. Paladins had NOTHING for a LONG time then got a NORMAL role (the incite changes IMO balanced our classes) and now we're looking at losing any real purpose again.<br />
<br />
IMO I think they should scrap the cleric &quot;buff&quot; line from paladins completely, and replace those spells with group only (with maybe 2 or 3 mgb'able) mana draining type spells (like yaulp) that STACK. (Man am I so SICK of having ALL my spells THROWN back at me). Just an example, make AoTC a group bonus spell with the same ac/hp but no mana regen at let's say a cost of 30 mana per tick. ETC. (BTW that's just an example of what I meant for the style of spells) having a bunch of spells like that would give paladins a bigger role both in groups as emergency tank AND utility. etc etc etc. <br />

Anyhow, sorry this was so long.</div></div><hr />

If fixing the spellbook is the solution, then why have PoN posters almost exclusively focused on Warrior mitigation?<br />
<br />
Paladins can MT in normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />
Paladins can (afaik) add tank/off tank in raids.<br />
<br />
Most if not all of the trials are not a requirement for everyone to complete.<br />
<br />
Warriors have a long-established MTing advantage vs. hard hitting high DI mobs. (Although some Paladins and SK's HAVE successfully completed trials without this advantage).<br />
<br />
Non-Warrior tanks gain the ability to tank these hard hitting high DI mobs as players acquire end-expansion equipment.<br />
<br />
Put a mob like this in the middle of EJ as a Beserker epic quest mob and it might well be one-groupable with a Warrior MTing and require a couple more people if a Paladin is MTing. Therefore it's not Warrior mitigation that is the issue, it's the forced 6-man encounter vs. a mob where Warriors would clearly have an advantage.<br />
<br />
I'm seeing poor encounter design and insufficient useful utility in the Paladin spellbook being used as an excuse to call for a Warrior nerf or to give Paladins an unwarranted narrowing of the Warrior survivability advantage vs. high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
Explain to me again what the real (not contrived) problem is again please and why nerfing Warriors or giving Paladins Warrior-like mitigation is the solution and not changing the encounter or requesting spell upgrades to allow Paladins to better mitigate with Paladin only stuns that at least ocassionally stick, heal meaningfully at current mob damage level, and Root in order to increase usefulness in CC.<br />

 There's no 85% rule. There's no 100% rule. ONE guildie of yours must survive all this. I find NO reason to NOT like the idea of not having to do these trials to survive except for the fact that it damages egos to be 'not enough tank' to tank this thing.<br />
<br />
Not having the hassles of flags like PoP is a boon to EVERYONE. Remove all the gear and xp in the trials to leave all classes equal in gear level and you'd probably get alot less complaints. But you need to stop focussing on JUST the trials. Nobody knows what the mobs are like beyond them, but if history serves us right, they will be close to equal to or harder to what you have in the trials and if paladins can barely tank trials how do you think they'll fair against the raid zone content?<br />
<br />
<br />
Goradain: You're also not fighting mobs that have 2k+ ae's. There is a BIG difference between EP and old content/low tier pop JUST like there's a big difference between EP and PoTime. As you reach the higher end that 850hp heal does very little.<br />
<br />
Daemonwynd: If you're going to tell me to stop downplaying my abilities to the core classes that have ONLY that ability then stick to THAT. Don't go comparing my spellbook to a warrior tanking. Compare my tanking to a warrior tanking. Secondly, my spellbook compared in SPELLCASTING power to any of the other classes that have those same type of spells is the weakest.<br />
<br />
As I posted on PoN the ISSUES with upgrading paladins is that BOTH their parent have but 1 single role. Warriors tank, clerics heal. So increasing the power in direct relation to those 2 instances steps on the toes of classes that have but THAT ability, which in the end is unacceptable. The problem is that SoE refuses to STOP giving us washed up spells and give us UNIQUE spells that STACK. Read what I wrote to BB about the spellbook changes and we'll continue from there.</div></div><hr />

I think Paladins can tank all of the non-named mobs in the trials I've seen just fine and that their only difficulty is the named mobs.<br />
<br />
In raid content they will, if recent history serves, be more involved with add tank/off tanking/CC than MTing the named mobs. If the trial mobs are representative of the raid adds, then Paladins should do just fine (with the caveat that I do believe the interrupt duration on Divine Stun needs increasing, heals need upgrading, and IMO Paladins should get as good of a Root as any class posseses).<br />

 The day you lose the ability to cast in combat will be the day I compare tanking straight up between the two classes.<br />

/boggle... I'm assuming you're lumping in the defensive ability in &quot;a warrior tanking&quot; there.<br />
<br />
Of course I can't *just* compare warrior tanking to paladin tanking. If I were to just do THAT, paladins would appear underpowered. Weren't you the one that was trying to discuss heals and only heals in another argument?<br />
<br />
Fact is, you can't JUST talk about one facet of a class and one alone when talking about hybrids, or even talking about calss balance, because if you try to do that, the hybrid's going to look relatively underpowered, every time.<br />
<br />
In regards to abilities such as incite and defensive, you're damn right I can compare a spellbook to the warrior's combat abilities. That's the balancing point. Either you have one, or the other.<br />
<br />
Secondly, my spellbook compared in SPELLCASTING power to any of the other classes that have those same type of spells is the weakest.<br />

If you're comparing your spells to the PURE CASTERS, of course they are. You're doomed to come up short if you're comparing it to them. Versus other hybrids, they're as powerful as any.<br />

The problem is that SoE refuses to STOP giving us washed up spells and give us UNIQUE spells that STACK.<br />
<br />
Bull, &quot;they refused to stop&quot;. They did a long time ago giving you lower level cleric spells and started working on giving you your own spells that fulfill a role that they envisioned. Spells like BSS, HP buffs that stack with druids and shamans, group heals that complement main healer spells nicely, fast heals, etc etc.<br />

We're in agreement on this BB. Where paladins are not in agreement is that we are not a real viable choice for tank in those trials which DOES have upgrades both in gear and in augs. So in the end for now we're just falling further behind.<br />
<br />
Non-Warrior tanks gain the ability to tank these hard hitting high DI mobs as players acquire end-expansion equipment.<br />
<br />
With the unfinished state of GoD right now there isn't any end-expansion, so knights which are being looked over in the trials are not gaining current level equipment.<br />
<br />
I'm seeing poor encounter design and insufficient useful utility in the Paladin spellbook being used as an excuse to call for a Warrior nerf or to give Paladins an unwarranted narrowing of the Warrior survivability advantage vs. high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
I can agree with you on this point and I'm sure alot of paladins would feel the same. The question isn't why we want to be your equal, it's where do we even stand a CHANCE at SoE giving us something that will make us wanted. Yes it sucks that this affects your class directly, like I keep repeating, paladins have 2 parents, both of which have but 1 role in the game and those roles don't stack very well., As long as SoE is hellbent on giving us washed up cleric spells and not uniqueness across the board, we're stepping on either warriors or cleric toes when we get an upgrade SPECIFICALLY because both paladin abilities do NOT stack.<br />
<br />
Explain to me again what the real (not contrived) problem is again please and why nerfing Warriors or giving Paladins Warrior-like mitigation is the solution and not changing the encounter or requesting spell upgrades to allow Paladins to better mitigate with Paladin only stuns that at least ocassionally stick, heal meaningfully at current mob damage level, and Root in order to increase usefulness in CC.<br />
<br />
As I mentionned to you in my last post, alot of it is speculation because we don't know what's beyond the trials. You say that paladins are currently able to tank trash in trials and with limited success named mobs. The general concern (as I say speculation) is that the trash in the raid zones will hit like the named. (look at the dmg output from PoJ boss compared to BoT trash) If trash is anywhere near that level then NO, paladins will not be viable offtanks because no guild will be able to dedicate that many healers to that role. <br />
<br />
Now if you really need an answer as to why speculate and call for changes without facts, you know you really don't need me to answer you. The longer things are left as they are, the harder it will be for any changes to be made. And once again I mention to you that SoE has shown its complete unwillingness to revamp our spellbook. <br />
<br />
The challange might increase deeper into the expansion, but we can expect it to also provide us with some improvements along the way. It's supposed to be a challange.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where will those improvements come from? <br />
<br />
For a warrior improvements comes from gear. Even though paladins gain some improvement from it also, there's a discrepency because to have improvements scale proportionally we would also need to gain improvements from spells, and nobody in their right mind can honestly say that the spell upgrades paladins received with GoD will improve them in ANY way for the difficulty of the content. Add to that factor the already weakened powers of our previous spells to end of PoP/PoTime content and you've decreased the effectiveness twofold.<br />
<br />

Given the information that most of us have, there is absolutely no basis to call for a Warrior Defensive nerf or for Paladins to get Warrior-like mitigation (the subject of this thread). It was uncalled for, agreed?<br />

Hiding the spellbook and saying, let's just talk about tanking isn't going to cut it.<br />
<br />
BB, I would agree with you if paladins were regularly looked at for anything else except as a tank. In groups no matter what you say we do NOT get picked up for utility/our spellbook. SURE it happens, but I have no reason to lie about the facts. I've played a paladin as my main since the start and we ARE trying to have a proper discussion here. Believe me, unless it's friends or we're fighting content that dies so fast that having pal/war in group is not an issue, it doesn't happen. In raid situations we do have more than 1 role. That role which you've described as offtank/cc/medic would be great if it wasn't equalled or surpassed by so many other classes. <br />
<br />
Now before you stop reading THINK. Should I ONLY be able to do those duties once we've farmed the hell out of the content we are in or should I be able to do it from the get go. <br />
<br />
The fact that paladins are hybrids and that the mentality of all non paladin classes is that we should only be 2nd or 3rd best at anything creates a SERIOUS problem when those abilities have no purpose 2 or 3 spots down the road. I can't heal anyone that's 100% full health or keep them alive healing for 1125hp when mobs hit 4 times that hard. I can't buff someone except with BSS if a cleric is present. I can't CC mobs if they are immune to root. I can't offtank and live if mobs are immune to stun, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
You're asking me why paladins feel they should have their tanking abilities increased when I say we need spellbook upgrades. Once again it goes back to SoE. They just will not give us abilities that are not overshadowed by other classes. A sk that has a necro present still has all his spells available to him because offensive spells stack. Same goes for bst and even rangers if they were so inclined to do so. Paladin spells do not. Therein lies the problems. If you want to look at my spell book as a balancing factor, you MUST take into account how much of it is unutilized when our casting parent (cleric) is present. Now put a cleric in the group and any other class as tank and you eliminate even more of our spells. You have to admit that there's a difference between having 50 spells available and being able to use them for a purpose at all times.<br />

Of course I can't *just* compare warrior tanking to paladin tanking. If I were to just do THAT, paladins would appear underpowered. Weren't you the one that was trying to discuss heals and only heals in another argument?<br />
<br />
My response was in regards to the first quote you wrote. I wasn't implying to split the abilities of the paladin. I was implying that comparing the counter abilities of my 2 parent classes was disingenious. <br />
<br />
BTW just as a side note. Dunno about yours but I've seen some clerics dish out some major DPS (casting obviously) when they've got free reign to do so.<br />
<br />
In regards to abilities such as incite and defensive, you're damn right I can compare a spellbook to the warrior's combat abilities. That's the balancing point. Either you have one, or the other.<br />
<br />
Until the day they scale proportionally to eachother I disagree. <br />
<br />
Want an example? (FORGET INCITE, that ability was NEEDED period.)<br />
<br />
Your increased DPS and mitigation pre-GoD and post-GoD increased your class role ALOT more than the spells I received. If you want to deny that then there's no point in us continuing this discussion because you'll just want to be blind to the fact.<br />
<br />
Remember, paladins gained NO tanking mitigation upgrades and no DPS upgrades (achieved for warriors through unlinking discs and all). All we gained were spells. Ironically you keep saying I'm a combination of two classes and should not be equal to those classes. Fine. But don't you find it strange that I got (albeit crapola) upgrades from my casting parent but ZIPPO from my tanking parent. Not saying EQUAL upgrades, saying SOME. <br />
<br />
If you're comparing your spells to the PURE CASTERS, of course they are. You're doomed to come up short if you're comparing it to them. Versus other hybrids, they're as powerful as any.<br />
<br />
This unfortunately is the biggest bunch of BS. No other hybrid has so many of their spells rendered useless when their parent class is present. <br />
<br />
Spells like BSS, HP buffs that stack with druids and shamans, group heals that complement main healer spells nicely, fast heals, etc etc.<br />
<br />
You already have spells that stack. Some of them are even unique.<br />
<br />
Now REMEMBER, you said UNIQUE and STACKING.<br />
<br />
We have a total of 2 unique buffing spell lines. 1 group, in the form of BSS and AoTC, which is self only.<br />
<br />
BSS does NOT stack with SoT and SV. So there are stacking issues<br />
AoTC is self only which invariably doesn't give a benefit to the rest of my group members and it doesn't stack with Nine.<br />
<br />
All the rest of my buffs are watered down versions of cleric spells. Even the ones from ldon which have a unique name. Doesn't matter that ours is called guidance and the cleric version is called aegolism. They are the same except ours is weaker and of course don't stack.<br />
<br />
Heals: Consider the dmg output from a MELEE ROUND in EP let alone GoD. And then consider the heals I have. Find me 1 heal that is atleast EQUAL to 1 melee round and then maybe you'd have a case. But telling me I have heals when I can't heal 1/4 of an attack means what exactly? That the MT will die with neg 3k hp instead of neg 4k?</div></div><hr />

I did not intend to seem to be claiming much full raid experiance in GoD. In one exploration and attempt to kill a named (the one that charms) it seemed broken.<br />
<br />
However the yard trash did not hit for a lot that I experianced nor the mobs inside the building.<br />
<br />
My primary objection to the posts asking for Warrior mitigations nerfs or Paladin mitigation increases are:<br />
1. It doesn't address the fundamental Paladin problem which IMO is the spellbook. If you are going to ask for a change, ask for the right one.<br />
<br />
2. It's based on speculation that near content adds get a lot harder.<br />
<br />
3. After several expansions when Warriors knew they had major problems and finally got fixed - two months later (ok, some protested the day of the fix) the call goes out to nerf Warriors or to improve Paladins and undo half the changes.<br />
<br />
Paladins pretend unless they have substantially the fullness of skills of their parent class they are inadequate generalists. Nothing is further from the truth. In a group with a Paladin, I notice his DPS if and only if he's using SU and Holy Forge against undead. Otherwise the melee who's doing the real damage is a Monk or Ranger.<br />
<br />
I /ooc in PoK everyday - Looking for Brells SS please will donate generously. In three months I've gotten it twice total (I do want it) because the Paladins are all grouped.<br />
<br />
I't take a group heal after DArb any old time. I'll gladly get hit by LoN. No Cleric? I'll gladly take Paladin buffs. Heck, 90% Res, bring it on.<br />
<br />
Paladins hit named mobs in zones for flags they don't need. A good sham excuse to ask for the Paladin/Warrior balance to be changed, but that's all it is.<br />
<br />
The awesome augments? Please, If I'm going to farm them I'll kill the Maternal Cragbeast or whatever she's called. She's not hard for goodness sake. Other augs drop off yard trash in earlier trials. A Paladin wants to be in the group, come on board. Some of these augs are being farmed without Plate Tanks - they are that easy.<br />

There never was an issue other than tuning a flag encounter that everyone didn't even need to complete.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>LastLizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">This fear of paladins crying for warrior nerfs is pure paranoia. <br />
The unreasonable paladins might cry for nerfs (like the unreasonable warriors did in PoP), the reasonable paladins for upgrades for their class - upgrades we already recieved.<br />
I retired my warrior shortly after the release of PoP in favor of my rogue, because it royally sucked to play him, with the upgrades I feel the warrior class is better than ever and close to overpowered - even in old content (can't comment on GoD, don't plan on getting it).<br />
<br />
I also box a friend's pally grinding AA in PoI (highest we can fight as duo) and the spellbook and &quot;versatility&quot; of the class are highly overrated (&quot;the grass is always greener on the other side) - please don't comment on the pally spells if you have no 1st hand experience.<br />
His DPS is pathetic so I have him sitting on his horsie and throw me a few heals. If I melee with both, he will run OOM sooner or later - and his tanking is a good mile away from mine (even though his equipment and AA are in better shape).<br />
All he really contributes is 1 buff (aego or 9 from PoK &gt; pally buffs) and healing that can barely keep up with tier1 mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simply a case of &quot;the grass is greener on the other side of the fence&quot;. Other than the fix which was needed to bring us BACK into balance, we've gotten only as much as you have. Remember who got the 5 new levels of spells while the melee got jack, PLUS the benefit of all the new gear? Yeah. Paladins. You got the same increase in DPS, and while you admittedly didn't get the -1 DI, that was a BALANCE CHANGE, not expansion related. Outside of simple balance changes, you got exactly what we did. Even in GoD. You get a crappy new spell, we get a crappy new spell. Joy.<br />
<br />
Remember, paladins gained NO tanking mitigation upgrades and no DPS upgrades.  (achieved for warriors through unlinking discs and all). All we gained were spells.<br />
<br />
Bull you got no upgrades. What a completely dishonest comment. You got just as much improvement from PoP as we did. &lt;I'm being generous and saying the same and not more with your 5 levels of powerful new spells.&gt;. Hopebringer vs Jeldorin, anyone? New Focus Effects? Armour that's hands down better than anything that's come before? As for the unlinking of discs being a DPS, that's just not true. Between their End cost, small DPS increase, short duration, and long reefresh, their DPS addition over the long haul is negligible. Any significant DPS increase we've had, has come through new weapons alone.<br />

<br />
This isn't something the other classes don't have to deal with either. Druids and Shamans have a lack of fast heals, shamans don't *HAVE* a heal that's significantly more powerful than a paladins. Druids and Clerics, their healing output is nearly the same as before, but they're supposed to keep a group alive. Paladins have the luxury of just going &quot;my heals aren't good enough, I can't do it, it's not my job anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let alone Rangers and Beastlords, your fellow healing hybrids... their 428 heal is approaching healing laughable levels in God.<br />
<br />
The only way paladin heals will be rebalanced and made more powerful, is if ALL healing in the game is rebalanced. I don't see that happening, because that would trivialize the game. You're balanced relative to the hybrids and to the other healers, give paladins more relative healing power and the other healers are gonna start bitching.</div></div><hr />

This thread is in direct responce to numerous threads and posts where Paladins do not deal honestly with the GoD trial situation, Warrior/Paladin balance, and in fact do call for unwarranted (at this time given what we know) changes that would affect this balance.<br />
<br />
What you choose to call upgrades the Warriors already received, SoE called &quot;needed&quot; changes done for balance. In otherwords for several expansions Warriors were underpowered in a couple of areas. Since the Phase 2 melee changes were put on ice, it shouldn't be surprising if for an expansion or two they boost pure melee a tad (I do not know if they are doing so, just pointing out the proclivity).<br />
<br />
The fact that I solo PoI easily (and I don't use PoTime weapons to do it nor disciplines) when bored tells us just how much you exagerate. Paladins solo better than Warriors hands down no question. If you can't manage to have the Paladin  tank for the Rogue it's more of a testament to your equipment level or aptitude then class balance.<br />
<br />
Paladins do not out tank Warriors vs. hard hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
However in content where their stuns and root work, they are a machine.<br />
<br />
And there is the Paladin problem. Those spells which make them unriviled as a Tank and a decent healer in LDon Easy as Pie lose some value at some point as they move through increasingly harder content.<br />
<br />
I have never heard anyone say let's get the Warrior for DPS. Warrior and Paladin DPS is a non-issue. (Except as a matter of personal pride).<br />
<br />
Taragor<br />
So in the end for now we're just falling further behind. <br />
And there's the source of your confusion. I have 11500HP+ buffed, a &quot;-1 DI&quot; mitigation advantage, and a Defensive discipline - there is no posibility of &quot;catching up&quot;. As you begin accumulating armor from the end of a new expansion you will begin being able to MT hard hitting mobs that I could do before having any of that expansion's armor. Warriors are &quot;unmatched&quot; vs. hard hitting high DI mobs. It's in our Class Description and our abilities and stats reflect it. It is not your class's role.<br />
<br />
The augments can be farmed with Paladins in the group doing the farming.<br />
<br />
In normal experiance groups and add tanking/off tanking in raids the Warrior &quot;-1 DI&quot; change doesn't amount to much because the mob DI's are not high/Warrior greater maximum HP's are often excessive and unneeded. Paladin utility is and ought to be sufficient to give them advantages in performing THEIR role.<br />

<br />
Pally are considered by many to be the best in XP groups.  Pallys are also favored often in LDONs.  I can do both as a warrior though I do not have snap aggro.  The players that group with me must show a medium of some intellligence.   If I loose aggro as I tell  them truthfully its they who will loose &lt;wink&gt; in the long run so watch the slows on the initial seconds.  But big bosses has always been our forte and I hope it stays that way!  You can't have it all.   I suspect a few malcontents are doing all the whining as is usual.<br />
<br />
Pallies that whine should grow up.   Its not very chivalric all you tough knights!   So should warriors who whine as its not very macho.  Complaints are ok if you can back them in facts.   Sure some pallies want defensive but some warriors would also  like a Lay on Hands.  Neither makes sense in the conception of the class.  Just a few greedy folk who want Sony to give them everything in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to quit wanting Verant Game Designers to make them the  best.  Play well and you will get groups even with these percieved limitations.  The game designers should not be required to make you a better player.  Crafty warriors can in fact get the job done aggro wise and have all through this issues and although its not easy it can be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It all counts, Taragor. Remember, for the initial encounters with new content, Warriors are almost exclusively preferred, unless the encounter is tuned to Knights. Always has been.<br />
<br />
 However, once survivability of the encounter is not an issue, Knights get an equal if not better shot at the MT slot merely because of the spellbook making it easier, unless the encounter is tuned to Warriors. Why do you consider that unfair?</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it's possible to find an old world mob with DB=300 and DI=80 that is one-groupable by a Warrior and a challange with a Paladin in the group instead.<br />
<br />
Somewhere there is a list of older content DB and DI values. The higher the DI the more likely a Warrior is to be prefered to MT the mob unless the mob has a DS, procs, or effects that dictate otherwise.<br />

The Provoke line was carefully crafted. It in fact comes pretty close to suggestions made and supported by many Paladins.<br />

<br />
You've always had doomsayers in EQ BB, and it's not only paladins, it's all classes that has them. Prior to the launch of GoD paladins whining about the abilities that warriors received were generally doing it for 1 of 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1: They're dopes and believe they should be the superclass of EQ<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2: They saw the MUCH needed aggro change BUT also discovered that SoE had unlinked discs AND given a dmg mitigation boost.<br />
<br />
(Please look at this objectively before you reply)<br />
<br />
Would you agree that aggro being a non issue warriors have always been the BEST tank in EQ up to and including PoP? (I'll deal with GoD a little further)<br />
<br />
I for one can tell you this. Warriors have always tanked better than any other class when dmg mitigation was an issue. Or like you like to call them hard-hitters. This was the case in PoP pre-changes and is still the case today.<br />
<br />
Now, in comes the aggro issue. Even with the superiority that you had mitigating dmg, you were being passed over for lesser tanks that could gain and hold aggro reliably. How many groups died, raids whiped etc etc etc because the chosen tank didn't have the survivability that warriors had? <br />
<br />
-In a group setting I'd say more ppl died (not necessarily whiped) because warriors had trouble keeping aggro off slowers and healers.<br />
<br />
-In raid situations I'd say you probably had the same amount of whipes either way though I'd tend to favor a small survival advantage to warriors MT'ing simply because they can take so much more dmg AND did sort of have a half ass way of getting aggro.<br />
<br />
Now, no matter how you look at it, this wasn't balanced. TANKING was, but AGGRO wasn't. You need both to be balanced. <br />
<br />
Step 1: Aggro<br />
<br />
SoE introduces the incite line. This in its form I believe was almost nailed 100% on the nose of perfectly implemented. Warriors now have a tool to deal with aggro that isn't dependant on the RNG which means they can safely retake their place as MT in raid settings and are equal value in a group setting.<br />
<br />
We in agreement on this so far?<br />
<br />
Step 2: Unlinked Discs and improved dmg mitigation<br />
<br />
THIS is where you start seeing the majority of the paladin fears.<br />
<br />
I won't go deeply into the discs because simply put, paladins discs (all 2 of them not counting fear and resistance obviously) are just plain bad.<br />
<br />
Imp Dmg Mitigation: <br />
<br />
Ok. This obviously stems on whether or not you agree that pre-changes warriors were superior in this (remember we're not discussing aggro here just the survivability part)<br />
<br />
Warriors were superior to knights. Why then increase them further? <br />
<br />
The HP gap had shrunk quite a bit so they could have looked at making GoD gear more class specific with higher HP on warrior stuff then knights who need to also gain mana. This would have increased the gap between your class and mine.<br />
<br />
This would have given another (albeit small) edge in your role as MT.<br />
<br />
Instead (though I must admit I saw a war only bp from trials with 300hp on it dunno what the pally equivalent looks like, so they may have worked on the gear also) they increased your dmg mitigation. Now increasing warrior dmg mitigation is one thing. BUT, tailoring the mobs in the expansion SPECIFICALLY to that improvement means much more. IE: Low HP mobs with insane dmg output.<br />
<br />
-Now combine all warrior changes and improvements (aggro,discs,dmg mitigation, aa) <br />
-Now combine all the paladin changes and improvements (spells,aa) <br />
<br />
How effective are your changes to GoD content? <br />
How effective are paladin changes? <br />

A group heal after Div Arb does seem great, and generally works well. BUT, consider the following. The greater the hps the MT has the lesser the group heal is affective after it. If you're taking 2k hp from each member I still only heal for 850hp. TRUE it's better than nothing, but does it truly matter if the MT is the only one getting hit?<br />
<br />
<br />
A Paladin wants to be in the group, come on board. Some of these augs are being farmed without Plate Tanks - they are that easy.<br />
<br />
Not disagreeing, but do you find this right? the non plate tanks I mean.<br />
<br />
There never was an issue other than tuning a flag encounter that everyone didn't even need to complete.<br />
<br />
This is where we disagree the most. The issue isn't just tanking. The issue is that for the past little while paladins have lost little bits and pieces of ALL their roles to other classes.<br />

...which is a pointless comment to make, because they never have free rein to do so.<br />
<br />
But was this the nuke you were talking about?<br />
<br />
Really? Interesting since on PoN YOU have posted that when you play your cleric you sometimes throw in nukes for the heck of it because you need not worry too much about your tank.<br />
<br />
BTW, it has nothing to do with that specific spell. It has to do with first hand knowledge. I've known some clerics who've been nicnamed wizzywannabe because they'd dish out alot of DPS on any mob. Make those mobs undead and it's scary.<br />
<br />
Simply a case of &quot;the grass is greener on the other side of the fence&quot;. Other than the fix which was needed to bring us BACK into balance, we've gotten only as much as you have. Remember who got the 5 new levels of spells while the melee got jack, PLUS the benefit of all the new gear? Yeah. Paladins. You got the same increase in DPS, and while you admittedly didn't get the -1 DI, that was a BALANCE CHANGE, not expansion related. Outside of simple balance changes, you got exactly what we did. Even in GoD. You get a crappy new spell, we get a crappy new spell. Joy.<br />
<br />
I'd answer to this but there's so many things wrong with that statement I'd be writing a book. Here's the top 3 in point form<br />
<br />
- BALANCE: You had AGGRO issues not dmg mit issues<br />
- New gear: Last I checked PoP had warrior gear also (don't tell me the stats were the same that's not the point)<br />
- -1 DI not expansion related: RIGHT. Cause warriors needed the -1 DI to tank PoP<br />
<br />
 You got just as much improvement from PoP as we did. <br />
<br />
What the hell are you talking about? We're discussing GoD here not PoP.<br />
<br />
BS, you say? One word.<br />
Beastlord.<br />
<br />
Really? Hmmm, you REALLY want a list of how many bst spells still work when a shaman is present compared to a paladins when a cleric is present? No matter WHAT role the parent class of either is playing.<br />
<br />
Of which BSS is preferred by the majority of people. <br />
<br />
ASSUME AE fights. I will agree<br />
ASSUME no AE. <br />
<br />
-Int casters want it for no other reason then to see a bigger total hp #. NOT because they need it. (they also wouldn't gain from the atk of SoT or SV so why bother getting that)<br />
-Clerics DO want it all the time<br />
-Slowers DO want it all the time<br />
-CC DO want it all the time<br />
-MT/Offtank want it MOST of the time (can be replaced if offtanking isn't preset. IE if a bunch of mobs come in ppl able to tank will just grab at will)<br />
-MELEE will NEVER want it. (Remember not AE fights)<br />
<br />
ALL that being said. I'm glad you define my BUFFING spellbook as BSS. <br />
<br />
Bitch much? Nearly all casters have self buff that have stacking issues and don't give more than an indirect benefit to the other group members.<br />
<br />
Where you going with this? We're discussing TOTAL buffs that paladins bring to a group remember? And the reason I mentionned AoTC is because warriors believe it gives paladins an edge. (not agreeing or disagreeing just stating why) otherwise I wouldn't have said anything.<br />
<br />
  Druids and Shamans have a lack of fast heals, shamans don't *HAVE* a heal that's significantly more powerful than a paladins<br />
<br />
Only putting this snippet so you know I'm replying to your healing part. <br />

I refuse to discuss this section with you PERIOD. I went through this with you on PoN.<br />

Bottom line you pallies get spells our nifty abilities didn't even go live.<br />
<br />
Half your changes HAVE gone live.<br />
<br />
 I got np with the aggro issue but gear is still better for you as you get double the benefit with mana and HPS. I say they give up their spells and I mean all of them then they can get the defensive!<br />
<br />
I do NOT disagree about the gear. I've always found it ridiculous that you have gear for all classes that have USELESS stats on them. <br />
<br />
As for giving up our spells to get defensive. Please point to where I'm asking for defensive in this thread. Yes other threads on PoN have that topic but please stick to what we're discussing here because I am not in any way shape or form asking for your /def disc.<br />

It all counts, Taragor. Remember, for the initial encounters with new content, Warriors are almost exclusively preferred, unless the encounter is tuned to Knights. Always has been.<br />
<br />
However, once survivability of the encounter is not an issue, Knights get an equal if not better shot at the MT slot merely because of the spellbook making it easier, unless the encounter is tuned to Warriors. Why do you consider that unfair?<br />
<br />
The disagreement comes from the single group aspect. Warriors have exclusively been preferred (rightfully so) for end zone bosses etc. BUT, all the content in zones leading to that end boss was tuned so that any of the 3 classes could do it. Not only that, but the zone was open to unlimited amounts of ppl which meant you could have the warriors mt/st etc and have knights offtank/cc etc. <br />
<br />
With the trials (and I really hate that all of this focusses on those events when I'm trying to show the diminishing role for the whole expansion) you are limited in numbers. add to that being limited further by requiring specific classes for 3 of the 6 spots.<br />
<br />
I understand they are trials that are not required by everyone to advance. In a way though that's almost even more of a slap in the face. Not because I want to be your equal in tanking, but because I just do not bring enough to a 6 man group in that environment as a secondary role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Taragor,<br />
Would you agree that aggro being a non issue warriors have always been the BEST tank in EQ up to and including PoP?<br />
Absolutely not. Warriors have been The Heavy Tank that is &quot;unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; That's our role.<br />
<br />
Paladins have been the most effective group tank for quite some time even aggro excluded from concideration. Originally they held this title because of LoH, Root, stuns, and Pacicfy. They lost it when it was perceived that in a normal experaince group they required more healing than a Warrior. They got it right back when Ssra/VT/Seru equipment gave them Warrior-like HP's and more copius amount of mana raised them head and shoulders above Warriors.<br />
<br />
Just look at this - extreme, but let's not pretend that Paladins didn't have major group experiance tank advantage fairly early on.<br />
<br />
Warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853928) <br />
<br />
Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853934)<br />
<br />
And even your looooooong post misses the whole issue. Paladins are not Warriors. They do not share the Warrior charatersistic of being &quot;unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just because they could in PoTime doesn't mean it was 100% right.  SoE has done what they could to give Warriors a mitigation and max HP advantage having the most effect in raids.<br />
<br />
Now, Sir Tank find YOUR role.<br />
When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm. <br />
describes Warriors.<br />
<br />
(Hint - your role is not being unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles and apparently Warriors were supposed to be able to taunt effectively as well.)<br />
<br />
That's right, Add Tank/off tank/Combat Medic/CC/GRC and Boss MT whenever Warrior survivability does not compell your raid leader to select a Warrior. Now petition SoE to make you effective doing those things.<br />
<br />
I can't Combat Medic/CC/GRC worth beans and I'm not supposed to be able to do so. However as you gain end-expansion equipment the odds are very good you will be able to MT named mobs and bosses. You can't wait the two months needed for this to start happening?<br />

<br />
 /sigh.<br />
<br />
 Knights can and do tank everything up to and including these named. Do I need to go over to SK.org and PoN and dig up the posts for you?<br />
<br />
 Therefore, any of the 3 classes can do all of the content in zones leading to the end bosses. Now, you COULD argue that it's more 'risky' with a Knight, or that it requires more healing with a Knight, but guess what? It's been that way with every expansion with raid level content when you first meet that content.<br />
<br />
 Further, Paladins and SK can STILL offtank/cc in these groups with a Warrior MT. I don't know how much more anecdotal evidence you need from other Knights to get this. Now, if you want to argue that it takes a well-geared Knight to do this stuff, I'll agree. As long as YOU agree that it takes a well-geared Warrior to do this stuff, too. It's not a cakewalk by ANY means.<br />
<br />
 Thirdly is the sticking point - the 6 man cap. Believe me when I tell you that I and any other Warrior who is not or at any point was not in the MT rotation in their guild knows exactly what it's like to feel useless. We know exactly what it's like to have to 'sit on the sidelines' while others jump up and do the thing we're supposed to be able to do, but can't, whether because of class, gear, level, AA's, what have you. It's very ego-crushing.<br />
<br />
 But Ego-crushing encounters DO NOT make for Class Balancing arguments. Especially when the encounter in question IS an end-zone boss (Whether or not people like to admit it), when it's a boss for a trial that no one EVER has to do, and when you DO do it, it only has to be done once and never done again unless you're farming gear. It doesn't invalidate the class as a whole, it doesn't prove that the classes are 'imbalanced', and it doesn't affect 95%+ of all Warriors and Knights in game.</div></div><hr />

Really? Interesting since on PoN YOU have posted that when you play your cleric you sometimes throw in nukes for the heck of it because you need not worry too much about your tank.<br />
<br />
Tossing a nuke every now and again is not &quot;doing good DPS when they have free rein&quot;, and you know it. Yeah, I toss nukes when I can, but to call cleric nukes good DPS is laughable. Oh, and those undead? Aren't those the undead that make up a tiny minority of EQ, and which Paladins like you like to use as a stand for claiming how pointless their anti-undead abilities are? Yeah, I think so.<br />
<br />
BTW, it has nothing to do with that specific spell. It has to do with first hand knowledge. I've known some clerics who've been nicnamed wizzywannabe because they'd dish out alot of DPS on any mob. Make those mobs undead and it's scary.<br />
<br />
It has everything to do with this spell. That nuke? Yeah, that's THE BEST cleric nuke. Buddy you were claiming about dishing out tons of DPS? Well, this is the best one for him to use to do that DPS, use any other and he'd be doing less. And it's that inefficient, that long of cast, that long of recast. It INHERENTLY LIMITS cleric DPS to be inferior to just about anyone else.<br />
My warrior is the second least (melee) DPS class in the game, and he handily outdoes cleric DPS. It's not even close.<br />
<br />
Clerics don't do good DPS, period. They're too busy healing. Even when they're not healing, their spells are designed to not be able to to sustain any good level of damage. Claiming that clerics are even capable of doing good DPS is just plain ludicrous. With the noted exclusion of AE'ing, of course, which is almost entirely limited to raids anyway.<br />
<br />
By your own standards, Paladin DPS would have to be good DPS as well, and I'm fairly sure I remember you bitching about poor pally DPS on PoN.<br />
<br />
So which is it? Or do you withdraw your claim that clerics do good DPS?<br />
<br />
- New gear: Last I checked PoP had warrior gear also (don't tell me the stats were the same that's not the point)<br />
<br />
Thank you for proving my point for me... we BOTH got good stuff out of PoP. But all that int/wis/mana that use warriors got no use of, and found useless? Guess what, YOU got use out of it and we didn't. This is commonly known as knightemization, where a given piece of armour adds more comparatively to a hybrid than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Point one was not understandable, so I'll ignore it, btw.<br />
<br />
-1 DI not expansion related: RIGHT. Cause warriors needed the -1 DI to tank PoP<br />
<br />
This magical -1 to DI that is supposed to be so good makes a pretty insignificant difference for me on a day to day basis.<br />
<br />
On another note, if you're that certain that they put in the -1DI JUST for warriors because of GoD... well, two words come to mind here, and that's conspiracy theorist. And one more... paranoia. It was a BALANCE change. It was done for EVERYONE. LDoN, PoP, GoD, everyone.<br />
<br />
They put in -1DI so as to address the gap between warriors versus knights in damage taken, nothing more. They felt it wasn't wide enough. It's a small enough change that it doesn't matter much at all, considering defensive was changed to accomodate it. That's right, There was NO net increase in warrior power tanking named with the DI change. The only difference is in XP group mobs, and even THAT is very minor.<br />
<br />
What the hell are you talking about? We're discussing GoD here not PoP.<br />
<br />
Really? If you look above, it appears to me that we were talking about PoP.<br />
<br />
But no, we're not talking about GoD specifically. We're talking about the game as a whole. Those changes you were referring to? Those were balance changes, made OUTSIDE of expansions. You're attributing them to GoD like it's some big conspiracy to put Paladins on the sideline. That's not the case. Those balance changes were needed, they were put in. Deal with it. Just like us warriors dealt with Paladins getting 5 new levels of spells while we got jack and shit in PoP.<br />
<br />
Really? Hmmm, you REALLY want a list of how many bst spells still work when a shaman is present compared to a paladins when a cleric is present? No matter WHAT role the parent class of either is playing.<br />
<br />
Um. This is your claim from earlier.<br />
<br />
No other hybrid has so many of their spells rendered useless when their parent class is present.<br />
<br />
I could care less about the amount of spells that are still useful, I'm  interested in a count of the BST spells that are made useless when a BST/SHM are in a group as opposed to the PAL spells that are made useless when a PAL/CLE are in a group together. That WAS your claim, after all, that more paladin spells are made useless when their parent is in a group than any other classs. Nice try to twist it around tho.<br />
<br />
Do you want to admit that your claim was completely false and wrong, or do you want me to prove it for you?<br />
<br />
ALL that being said. I'm glad you define my BUFFING spellbook as BSS.<br />
<br />
Prove to me where I defined your buffing spellbook as BSS.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I didn't think you could. In fact I can easily prove the exact opposite. Remember my comments about cleric buffs stacking with shaman and druids, anyone? Yeah, that comment is completely full of it. Again.<br />
<br />
Where you going with this?<br />
<br />
I'm not &quot;going anywhere&quot; with it. I simply made the point that the buff that you're pissing and moaning about of having stacking issues and not helping other classes, is something that nearly all the casters have to deal with with their self buffs. so in other words, quit yer bitchin, we all gotta deal with that.<br />
<br />
Altho it does go to show that if you bitch about stuff like spell stacking which nearly ALL casters have to deal with like it's a problem, which it demonstrably isn't due to the fact that jsut about everyone has to deal with the same thing, it sheds a completely different light on all these other things you're bitching about.<br />
<br />
I refuse to discuss this section with you PERIOD. I went through this with you on PoN.<br />

BB,<br />
<br />
You are honestly telling me that the warrior class is a less effective tank than paladins unless tanking a boss mob? That's ludicrous. <br />
<br />
Forget perceptions if you will, your class is designed to take dmg better than mine is and no gear/spells I have will change that. BTW, you're bringing up pre-PoP which I hope you remember had paladiin spellbooks at HALF the usable spells we have now.<br />
<br />
In regards to the magelos you posted. What pray tell were we suppose to be tanking of any value once we had that gear? EITHER of our classes. You can't say paladins gained more from the end game gear when you're farming the end game for lack of anything else to do. That's illogical.<br />
<br />
<br />
And even your looooooong post misses the whole issue. Paladins are not Warriors. They do not share the Warrior charatersistic of being &quot;unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles&quot;.<br />
Just because they could in PoTime doesn't mean it was right.  SoE has done what they could to fix this.<br />
<br />
See the paragraph at the start: <br />
<br />
In a nutshell, I haven't stated anywhere that I want to be your equal. I'm so much on the defensive in these replies I don't even have a CHANCE at giving ANY type of suggestions as to how the class COULD be improved WITHOUT stepping on toes.<br />

 Posted by Partha<br />
Knights can and do tank everything up to and including these named. Do I need to go over to SK.org and PoN and dig up the posts for you?<br />
<br />
Is the outcome the same if you consider all guild levels? The answer is no. <br />
<br />
Farmed PoTime guild paladins can tank these encounters with difficulty at a loss of dps due to higher healing required. BUT, EP/Early PoTime warriors can tank the trials whereas the paladins in those guilds cannot.<br />
<br />
Now yes, I know that GoD is geared towards the high end game. I agree that you need to be at a minimum level to even consider doing real GoD content. <br />
<br />
Consider this though:<br />
<br />
EP geared warriors can do this content with difficulty and the proper group makeup. There is no group makeup (being limited to 6 ppl) that allows an EP geared paladin to do the same.<br />
<br />
But even having said all that, it's not been my reason for discussing this with you. As I said, it's not that I WANT to be able to tank the end mobs, it's that I want a purpose in the group. Now to have a purpose in the group other than as the main tank I need a spellbook that scales with the content. Which it has not.<br />
<br />
- More stun immune mobs actually lowers my current spellbook<br />
Not to mention those mobs eliminate any dmg mitigation I'd gain from the stuns thus making me susceptible to dying alot faster. (remember that you're limited to 6 ppl and the healler HAS to concentrate on the MT)<br />
<br />
- I cannot get GoD spells unless I'm present to loot them since they are no drop. So until I can do the content my class gains no upgrades.<br />
<br />
- GoD spells just plain didn't scale with the content difficulty. There was only slight upgrades to all the class spells but it affects paladins moreso. No, I'm not being egotistical about it.  Paladins have been asking for spell upgrades way before any melee changes or GoD came out. We were ignored mostly I'd assume on the basis we had such a strong hold in our tanking role.<br />
<br />
Thirdly is the sticking point - the 6 man cap. Believe me when I tell you that I and any other Warrior who is not or at any point was not in the MT rotation in their guild knows exactly what it's like to feel useless<br />
<br />
And IMO that is wrong. That is a fundamental flaw with EQ. The issue wasn't there pre MT content because you pretty much needed warrior after warrior to die to achieve anything. So all warriors within a guild had the same role. Ttank till you drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Define good DPS within the role of the class. Saying cleric DPS is low due to having other duties comes out to how low paladin DPS becomes constantly trying to stun a mob to mitigate dmg. As for the undead, I just said it was scary, not that they were plentiful in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
It has everything to do with this spell. That nuke? Yeah, that's THE BEST cleric nuke. Buddy you were claiming about dishing out tons of DPS?

It INHERENTLY LIMITS cleric DPS to be inferior to just about anyone else.<br />
<br />
Are we to assume that all casting classes use but 1 nuke? Didn't think so. Combine the top 3 DPS spells and you increase the dmg output.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Even when they're not healing, their spells are designed to not be able to to sustain any good level of damage. <br />
<br />
Compared to what class? And to what lvl? Take a warrior not using offensive discs and pit him against a cleric who's fully geared in offensive gear and tell me how big the gap is. <br />
<br />
By your own standards, Paladin DPS would have to be good DPS as well, and I'm fairly sure I remember you bitching about poor pally DPS on PoN.<br />
<br />
Care to explain this? <br />

<br />
Cleric:<br />
<br />
Live mob: Ancient chaos censure: 1320dmg 7sec recast time<br />

651dmg undead<br />
<br />
Cleric:<br />
<br />
2640dmg live<br />
9600dmg undead<br />
<br />
So which is it? Or do you withdraw your claim that clerics do good DPS?<br />
<br />
I think the above is a clear answer<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This magical -1 to DI that is supposed to be so good makes a pretty insignificant difference for me on a day to day basis.<br />
<br />
On another note, if you're that certain that they put in the -1DI JUST for warriors because of GoD... well, two words come to mind here, and that's conspiracy theorist. And one more... paranoia. It was a BALANCE change. It was done for EVERYONE. LDoN, PoP, GoD, everyone.<br />
<br />
The damage mitigation of warriors pre changes was sufficient for all expansion content. So why would they now that the end game has been farmed so much you have leather wearers tanking PoTime gods adjust the dmg mitigation of warriors except for what was yet to come. Conspiracy? No. Logic? Yes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I could care less about the amount of spells that are still useful, I'm  interested in a count of the BST spells that are made useless when a BST/SHM are in a group as opposed to the PAL spells that are made useless when a PAL/CLE are in a group together. That WAS your claim, after all, that more paladin spells are made useless when their parent is in a group than any other classs. Nice try to twist it around tho.<br />
<br />
Fine, for simplicities sake I'll give you an example. Can and will a bst slow a mob on inc? Let's add to that since bst become viable tanks in alot of content with the right gear. Will they use that slow for pulling said so mob even when a shaman is present? The answer is yes. Why? Because the spell has a purpose for each and every individual mob whereas my casting of guidance is of no purpose with the cleric casting virtue. It comes down to stacking issues again. Defense does NOT stack. Offense does.<br />
<br />
I'm not &quot;going anywhere&quot; with it. I simply made the point that the buff that you're pissing and moaning about of having stacking issues and not helping other classes, is something that nearly all the casters have to deal with with their self buffs. so in other words, quit yer bitchin, we all gotta deal with that.<br />
<br />
Oh God would I love to see you quote me saying that I have issues with AoTC. I sure as fook don't and never nor will ever (unless new spells come out that have stacking issues with it) When I raid or xp I go out of my way to get virtue. Doing ldon with no cleric, no big deal I'll find a cleric for virtue so I can use AoTC. The premise was my buffing utility to groups and AoTC is not a group buff. <br />
<br />
<br />
Course you don't want to discuss this section with me. It happens to be one of  the Paladin's strongest nontank roles.<br />
If you didn't want to talk about it, you shouldn't have brought up spell stacking.  <br />
<br />
No. I don't want to discuss this issue with you because you're completely irrational in your behavior towards it using your shaman as the counterpoint. Which in a war/pal debate has no meaning let alone the fact of the 15 million other utilities the shaman class has apart from healing.</div></div><hr />

Last time I checked bst had nukes and dots (not saying they always use them) but the fact remains they have them, and can use them even when a shaman is present.

I'm telling you that there are pluses and minuses to Paladins and Warriors in normal experiance groups.<br />
<br />
Even if there were not, the category tank in one area does not make us equivilent in another. That's a false categorical syllogism.<br />
<br />
Warriors having Defensive and Paladins lacking a well-defined raid role are unrelated. That's a magical thinking logical fallacy<br />
<br />
Warriors getting the Phase 1 changes and 500HP's for 60AA and Paladins claiming their Add Tank/off tank/Combat Healer/ CC role is jepordized is a post hoc ergo propter hoc logical fallacy.<br />
<br />
Now you go right ahead and build an illogical tissue paper argument designed to support your conclusion. Hopefully we'll restrain ourselves until the very end and not seem to agree with any unconnected factoids as you attempt to contruct this masterpiece of persuisiveness.<br />
<br />
There is as near as I can determine exactly 1 good argument -and I'm going to be really nice and tell you what it is because I grow weary of the pure BS that emanates from most PoN posters.<br />
<br />
People play EverQuest to have fun. An add tank/off tank/Combat Healer/CC role is not as fullfilling as MTing tough mobs. Therefore Paladins are compelled to try to narrow the gap and blur the distinction beween Warriors and Paladins. It's not that your spellbooks are useless, it's that they do not allow you to MT tough mobs like Warriors. The add tank/off tank/Combat Healer/CC role is actually quite nice as a secondary raid role. You don't wish to give up your spellbooks, that's part of the fun. In truth you DO want to be Warriors with Spellbooks.<br />
<br />
This would explain why you don't play Warriors and why Warriors are discussed whenever a Paladin role is the topic - Occam's Razor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Its all about game balance in the end.   This tanking uber DI  mobs is the warriors calling card.   I hope the people at Verant are not going to change that.   Others may want like SKs and Pallys but you can't have it all.  They have an aggro edge and spells and we have a DPS edge and mitigation learn to live with that and we all can co -exisit!<br />
<br />
 Tanking the uber mobs has always been warriors job.  Sure some pallies can do it but is it really  the designer defined role?  I play with a paladin often and they are truly masters of aggro.  I would never ask for a nerf to stun aggro or the class.  We are different in many ways and yet we co-exisit.  To give them defensive is too much IMHO.  <br />
<br />
Each class can't do it all.  They have always strove to force grouping for tanks.  I know warriors were the baseline originally but who is to say they are or not.  I would say rogues are it for melee DPS, warriors for mitigation, monks avoidance and paladins for aggro and  those set the scale to which others are measured.<br />
No class has it all nor should they.</div></div><hr />

Only once the paladin surpasses the warrior in gear. You've stated it yourself time and again both here and on PoN. When first entering content (which btw generally tends to be xp area type first) warriors are selected as tanks.<br />
<br />

The 500hps for 60 AA is just plain retarded. Moreso than my extra 25dmg on a bash for 46AA. I don't have issues with warriors having a gap over knights in hp/ac.<br />
<br />
As for our role being jeopordized you need to stop thinking only warrior changes. Because it's not just that. It's warrior changes + other class changes + content changes that affect it.<br />

<br />
And I'm here to say that it's because of bigotted warrior mentality as the above that there is no way to define proper class balance. Do you for one minute believe that the paladin class is unique to EQ? That it's never been represented in any other rpg/mmorpg/game? <br />
<br />
I've been playing paladins since D&amp;D. No I'm not trying to compare the power of a paladin in D&amp;D to EQ, I'm trying to show you that for true paladin players (the ones that stuck it out from pre kunark till now, not the ones that pwrlvled a pally when they were so sought after) the variety is what brings us joy. Sure I love tanking boss mobs. It's cool, it's fun, it's a challenge. But it's not my purpose in this game. The only time I volunteer to tank boss mobs is on very old content or if we start losing tanks left and right, then I'll step in to try to give healers a chance to grab a proper target. How many times must this be repeated. The majority of true class knowing paladins do NOT want to eliminate warriors by taking their job.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I'll have you notice that once again every warrior that has been posting to this thread in reply to stuff I've written in EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR REPLYS has always brought up nerfing/want your job/be gods attitude when in my last reply and really since my first reply in this thread I've yet to EVER and I do mean EVER say I want your job or purpose, or role, or power. etc etc etc. Every post I've written after the first one you replied to (which incidently you said was calm and well explained) I've been in pure defensive mode primarily rerepeating every single time that I've yet to even mention any changes. Every reply from you guys has been attacks at what you're assuming I'm getting at, or you're just plain using the mentality of the PoN doomsayers as counterattacks which 4 pages later brings us back to where we were on page 1. That is NOWHERE.<br />
<br />
To you BB I'll go even further. A few posts back you mentionned you believe paladins needed upgrades in their spellbook, yet look at the reply and quotes you've made, then look at my replys. I'm not disagreeing with what warriors should have the ability to do I'm trying to stop the infuriating unwillingness of warriors to take the WHOLE package into consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Taragor,<br />
<br />
Read your first paragraph or two. You keep using the word tank as if it were MT.<br />
<br />
Sigh. My Paladin can easily kill more light blue mobs naked except for a Windblade but self-buffed than an equivilent Warrior. It is not true that Paladins need to be better equipped than a Warrior to tank.<br />
<br />
When facing a hard hiting mob, Paladins have to gain sufficient power from equipment to make up for Defensive that they need much better equpment than a Warrior. Matching a Warrior's ability to survive the most brutal battles is not your role and only because mobs become trivialized are you able to do it.<br />
<br />
In all cases I can think of vs. low DI mobs with reasonable DB values Paladins outperform Warriors when they are able to cast.<br />
<br />
As a whole package, Paladins are primarily melee with other capabilities that provide value but do not all reinforce their melee capability. If anything else were true, Clerics who are primarily casters could use their casting abilities to reinforce their melee as well. Having a caster side that heals, buffs, etc prevents Paladins from having &quot;Tank Parity&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wether you think it's fair or not, SoE appears to count a heal as having nuke-like impact on a fight. Your non-personal melee support spells are accounted for in this way.<br />
<br />
However, to be useful spells should support a role. It is for this reason that an Add Tank/off tank/buff/Combat Medic/CC/GRC/Res raid role is most approprite for Paladins. Those spells which are a part of Paladins as a whole package have (or could have if properly adjusted) value in such a role.<br />
<br />
There is not just one Tank. There are many.<br />
Warriors are best suited for The Heavy Tank - preferred against high DI (generally named or raid boss) mobs<br />
<br />
Paladins are best suited for The Utility Tank - preferred when a Heavy Tank is not required and buff/Combat Medic/CC/GRC/Res capabilities are useful.<br />
<br />
Our differences determine our group preference and raid roles. Because of our unique capabilities we have our niches where in fact competition is minimized. I can not compete with a Utility Tank when one is needed. You can not compete with a Heavy Tank when one is needed. A race horse and a war horses are both horses but they serve different roles because of their characteristics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Beastlords cast Spiritual Dominion, Ferocity every 2min (single target) and if there are 0 paladins present, they can cast Spiritual Vigor.  That is the extend of their buff spells (which it seems you were comparing) which are available when a shaman is present.<br />
<br />
offensively, depending on mana regen available we cast highest ice nuke (frostspear unless you have the GoD DD's) and highest poison dot (scorpion venom unless you have the GoD DoT) on mobs that will last 3 minutes or so.  We have to wait until MT has decent aggro (80% health or so, depends on mob) before DoTing b/c scorp venom has huge aggro and the mob has to last for the 7 ticks after that point, so it's not used in exp groups or trash clearing.  But just for completeness i'll concur that its feasible for a bst to cast 2 nukes and 2 DoTs (if the bst has frost spear + GoD DD or GoD DD + Ancient GoD DD.  The 450 DD is barely worth the casting time.  also if he has the GoD DoT, the 9DPS plague never gets mem'd.)<br />
<br />
Defensively, we cast slow, which is overwritten by our parent class, but I'll include it since its typically for add/aggro control.  we also have Chloroblast for healing.<br />
<br />
AA wise we cast Paragon of spirit.  <br />
<br />
Personally i'm no where near end game and with only FT7, Bo9, VoQ, SD, and bard song i'm not casting dots at all because keeping Ferocity up requires FT30 and 150 raw atk on 3-4 rogues is &gt; 20ish dps, and thats only if i keep scorp venom up on mobs at all times.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins cast BSS and AoTC buffwise.<br />
<br />
Offensively, paladins keep between 2-5 stuns up typically, YMMV.  They also have a wimpy DD, DD proc buffs, and decent Undead DDs (comparable to Bst DDs)<br />
<br />
Defensively, paladins have root, single target heals, group heals, fast heals, HoT's, etc.  Oh lets not also forget RGC, which is limited by content (useless if no curses being cast) number of heals memmed vary.<br />
<br />
AA wise you have DS and HoP.  I won't even count LoH as bst has nothing comparable to this, but it is a spell/ability that you can cast that is not blocked/negated by your parent class.<br />
<br />
<br />
So lets compare?<br />
buffs: Paladin:2  Beastlord: 2<br />
Offense: Paladin: 4-8  Beastlord: 2-4<br />
Defense: Paladin: 1-4? Beastlord: 1-2<br />
AA spells: Paladin: 2 Beastlord: 1<br />
<br />
Heck even if you throw in the 3 Pet buffs we use exclusively on our pets you're still beating us on useful spells.  Avg's are probably better for this little comparison because the more stun's a paladin has mem'd the less heals, and vica versa, same goes for bst buffs/spells.</div></div><hr />

Matching a Warrior's ability to survive the most brutal battles is not your role and only because mobs become trivialized are you able to do it.<br />
<br />
Using the stupid trials as an example again, that boss mob is a fundamental part of the whole equation. Or do ppl kill everything in the trials and then leave without wanting to kill the end boss?<br />
<br />
<br />
In all cases I can think of vs. low DI mobs with reasonable DB values Paladins outperform Warriors when they are able to cast.<br />
<br />
When was the last time content was based on low DI? Even with my stuns functioning in alot of pop the higher you go in the expansion the less likely I am able to achieve a successful stun (fizzles/resist/immune/interrupts) so though I may achieve close to a warriors mitigation there are too many factors against it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Define melee. I have the worst melee dps in the game except for clerics. My stuns do not help my melee side. My heals do not help my melee side. See what I'm trying to get us looking at? <br />
<br />
Let's take a different approach. <br />
<br />
Assume an xp group in EP. that has a warrior MT and a cleric as healer. Now, I don't know about fully geared PoTime players but when I xp in the EP we tend to pull single mobs, CC has little purpose though you may get an add once in a while. This can be dealt by mezzing (if chanter or bard present) or by rooting which too many classes are capable of doing to list. Buffing. Ok I can give the MT BSS. Does it matter? Not really but it's nice. Of course remove the pally and put in a ranger or a beastlord and you can get the equivalent value at a little less in the hp dept but with an increase in atk. Rezzing? Irrelevant mostly with GY's. That leaves me with healing and DPS. Lowest DPS class so that eliminates that purpose. That leaves secondary healing.  You'd be better off with a druid or shaman for that role since they will bring the rest of their package with them.<br />
<br />
A 1 trick pony only brings 1 trick. That is where warriors and clerics have their own issues. The paladin issues is the culmination that changes to their class infringes on the 1 trick pony classes.<br />
<br />
If I were to make a case for leaving the differences between tanking classes the way they are today. Do you agree that paladin spellbooks need to be looked at? If so, how do you think the clerics would view this? Is it more acceptable to lower the desirability of clerics compared to warriors? <br />
<br />

<br />
No it's the combined usefullness of both hybrids complete spellbook when the parent class is present that was being compared.<br />
<br />
Offensively, paladins keep between 2-5 stuns up typically<br />
<br />
Depends on the level of the paladin and the lvl of the mob. At 65 you'll generally not have any paladin have more than 3 stuns memmed. Cease (for pulling and extra aggro) FoA for actual effectiveness and QWoS for emergency purposes (long casting/high mana cost) (not including ancient since nobody has it) Once the paladin has DS he'll generally rid himself of 1 of the memmed stuns.<br />
<br />
They also have a wimpy DD,decent Undead DDs <br />
<br />
I've yet to ever meet a paladin that uses our live DD. :P It's literally pointless considering the amount of dmg. 1 melee round does more dmg.<br />
<br />
 The undead DD though a bit more potent sucks up way too much mana and is more detrimental in the long run to not be used also.<br />
<br />
 paladins have root, single target heals, group heals, fast heals, HoT's, etc<br />
<br />
Root: Always<br />
Single target heal (I'm assuming you're speaking sup heal/ToN and such) Not sure about lower levels but at 65 never unless I'm soloing.<br />
Group heal: WoM always<br />
Fast heals: LoN always<br />
HoTs: Only if I solo really trivial content<br />
<br />
A side note. You mentionned we cast AoTC. We considering this seeing as it's self only whereas SD and Fero are not?<br />
<br />
Heck even if you throw in the 3 Pet buffs we use exclusively on our pets you're still beating us on useful spells. Avg's are probably better for this little comparison because the more stun's a paladin has mem'd the less heals, and vica versa, same goes for bst buffs/spells.<br />
<br />
How many spells do you have that will affect mobs lvl 66+ that you'll use? All<br />
<br />
Paladins? 0 (discounting nukes since as I pointed out above I lose DPS using them)<br />
<br />
The only offensive ability a paladin has on a mob lvl 66+ is divine stun which is a 1sec stun and has a 7sec recast time with all aa's invested in it.<br />
<br />
Also note that your spells remain constant in power. SD is SD whether the target is low tier PoP with 5k hp or PoTime geared with 10k hp. <br />
<br />
Paladin heals decrease in power as mob dmg increases. So my fast 850hp heal that was very good in low tier PoP struggles to make a dent of difference on 1 melee round from a PoTime mob.</div></div><hr />

Surviveability is different for all classes up to where you are. Soloing comes to mind as not being very rewarding for warriors where most knights seem to be able to accomplish this up to Tactics and maybe a little higher with out a problem.

Going from that quote if the trials were adjusted down or knights adjusted up. Then I think it would be only fair that warriors ability to solo also almost match a knight. We have a harder time soloing than any other class except maybe a cleric. Utility is not such a bad thing. Think about it.  <br />

<br />
If you wanna argue semantics here's one.  Paladins are not the worst Melee DPS, so stop claiming that.  End game paladin does more melee dps than both an end game bard (swarm kiting excluded :P ) and an end game beastlord.  with our pet we pull ahead of paladins (but not SKs, heh) but that 40-65dps buffed dot we call fluffy certainly has its own hindrances and benefits, and the benefits certainly are not scaling in PoP nor does it look like they'll scale in GoD.  What used to be a 4500ish hp off tank in low CC groups back in Tier 1 is nothing but a speed bump that gets demolished in higher end pop, unless I completely stop doing any DPS and concentrate solely on keeping him alive.  In GoD there isn't a thing that I can do to prevent it from getting 1 rounded, the green bar goes from full to gone faster than the server can transmit the health to my PC.</div></div><hr />

When was the last expansion based on low DI???? LDoN. What a selective memory!!<br />
<br />
Your argument, which you dance around quite a bit without making, is (I think):<br />
<br />
Q. If Paladins are less capable than Warriors as Tanks and do not have value from their spellbook in the presence of a Cleric, what does this leave us?<br />
<br />
A. Paladins<br />
<br />
I don't know what your equipment looks like, but assuming it's PoTime:<br />
<br />
You can exp tank in GoD. Tell me otherwise, please.<br />
<br />
The value of your spellbook is the value of your spellbook. Have a problem with it, write a nice analysis and convince SoE you are right. They seem to be reasonable people. They fixed Warrior aggro control and widened the much too narrow survivability gap.<br />
<br />
Paladins can exp tank in GoD.<br />
<br />
Complaining about killing named mobs? Just what percentage of named mobs should you be able to kill one month into an expansion? I'm curious. The Matronly Whatsherfish is pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Paladins can get augments.<br />
 <br />
Now that we've extablished you can exp tank and even kill a named mob in a group, what else should you be able to do? Complete all the trials? hahahahahahahhabahahaahhaha<br />
<br />
Ya, sure if they dumb them all down so a Druid can main heal (wouldn't want a Cleric monopoly) and Paladins can MT. np.<br />
<br />
I hope to reach the trials that many sub 10k HP Paladins are complaining they could do but it was tooo hard in a couple of weeks if I'm lucky. &lt;- 11500HP buffed Warrior.<br />
<br />
Please, any class that can solo Gorenaire and MT every mob in PoTime really is only going to convince readers of PoN that their kung fu is weak.<br />
<br />
Players are already waking into incomplete content. Obviously the trials are supposed to be hard. I can't believe people are complaining that they can't do the equivilent of marching into the Rathe Council and complete it one month after PoP release.<br />
<br />
And some are too impatient to even get themselves to 8000HP's unbuffed. They haven't come close to farming previous content dry.<br />
<br />
Do you think AO, BoTS, TR, FoH, Afterlife, Conquest, Dark Horizon, etc. Paladins can't do Vexd and Tipt? (PoN posters complained 2100 hitters were toooooo hard)? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
Paladins get flags.<br />
<br />
IF Paladins can't add tank/off tank this content then, depending how advanced their guilds are, there's cause for alarm.<br />

Semantics.  You claimed paladins had the least amount of available spells when their parent was around.  you were proven wrong.  Beastlords have, At Best, an equal amount of spells available to them.  Your heals don't scale?  Funny, neither do mine.  Your stuns cap?  funny my stun's from pet proc cap too, at 61st lvl actually.  shit's immune to root/stuns?  hell half the mobs i face *atleast* mitigate slow, if not completely immune.  you see the same shit that affects you affects me too, but instead of accepting the fact that you were proven wrong, you have to continuously change the argument around so it seems like we are arguing something else.<br />
<br />
let's see. forget what I said. But because I say different then you I am wrong? If that pleases you fine.<br />
<br />
Are you a healing hybrid? no<br />
Are you a tanking hybrid? no Though you do a fooking nice job of it with the right gear<br />
<br />
Comparing YOUR heals to MY heals when my SECONDARY role is partly MEDIC (as so many warriors like to put it) is ridiculous and as deserving an answer as I would give Daemonwynd.<br />
<br />
Your pets inability to stun a mob over lvl 61 has nothing to do with my inability to stun a mob thats above 65 when those same stuns is what GIVES me the ability to mitigate SOME damage so I can LIVE.<br />
<br />
In regards to mitigating your slows. Do they land? yes do they do SOMETHING yes? Mobs don't PARTIALLY get stunned. They are or they aren't. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you wanna arguement semantics here's one.  Paladins are not the worst Melee DPS, so stop claiming that.  End game paladin does more melee dps than both an end game bard (swarm kiting excluded :P ) and an end game beastlord.  with our pet we pull ahead of paladins (but not SKs, heh) <br />
<br />
Is your pet part of your class? yes it is. Calculating beastlord DPS without factoring in their pet is only calculating half your class. There are a few exceptions where it is generally prefered NOT to have a pet unless you have the pet hold aa, and even fewer encounters where they won't allow you to have them even with the aa. <br />
<br />
I'm curious. Anyone ever parse beastlord DPS with full out casting? Not saying it's better than paladin DPS just curious.<br />
<br />
[Q]but that 40-65dps buffed dot we call fluffy certainly has its own hindrances and benefits, and the benefits certainly are not scaling in PoP nor does it look like they'll scale in GoD.  What used to be a 4500ish hp off tank in low CC groups back in Tier 1 is nothing but a speedbump that gets one rounded in higher end pop, unless I completely stop doing any DPS and concentrate solely on keeping him alive.  In GoD there isn't a thing that I can do to prevent it from getting 1 rounded, the green bar goes from full to gone faster than the server can transmit the health to my PC. [/B] <br />
<br />
Interestingly enough I pay $13 bucks a month to be an 8k speed bump.</div></div><hr />

It's also the soloing utilities though that usually make a knight the very much preferred off tank in small guilds that push the limits of where they can go. I might could off tank but that also requires a healer to come out of the rotation or a shaman. But it still requires 2 people coming off the focused mob.  <br />

You've lost me a little on this. Until my last guild I've always been in small guilds and no way in hell was I MT'ing anything. <br />

When was the last expansion based on low DI???? LDoN. What a selective memory!!<br />
<br />
Would you have prefered I said PROGRESSING expansion? LDoN is static. it's always the same doesn't change nada zip zero. To me that's an addon. <br />
<br />
You can exp tank in GoD. Tell me otherwise, please.<br />
<br />
The value of your spellbook is the value of your spellbook. Have a problem with it, write a nice analysis and convince SoE you are right. They seem to be reasonable people. They fixed Warrior aggro control and widened the much too narrow survivability gap.<br />
<br />
Myself i cannot I'm only in EP gear. You should know, you've put me down on PoN because I only have 6k unbuffed. :)<br />
<br />
As for the suggestion to SoE it's been done. Net result? nothing.<br />
<br />
The only way to upgrade the paladin spellbook is to either step on the toes of the priest classes by giving us meaningful heals or by giving us varied unique group/raid friendly spells.<br />
<br />
4yrs. 7 expansions. 1 unique group/raid friendly spell. Do I really need to spell it out?<br />
<br />
Complaining about killing named mobs? Just what percentage of named mobs should you be able to kill one month into an expansion? I'm curious. The Matronly Whatsherfish is pretty easy. <br />
Now that we've extablished you can exp tank and even kill a named mob in a group, what else should you be able to do? Complete all the trials? hahahahahahahhabahahaahhaha<br />
<br />
YES. I SHOULD be able to complete all the trials. The primary low level ones as an alternative tank to a warrior, the deeper harder ones as a VALUED MEMBER IN A DAMN SIX MAN RAID.<br />
<br />
Please, any class that can solo Gorenaire and MT every mob in PoTime really is only going to convince readers of PoN that their kung fu is weak.<br />
<br />
How many mobs in PoTime have been tanked by non plate classes? <br />
<br />
I find it ironic how you have SO many issues with a PLATE TANK CLASS tanking PoTime but not non tank chain/leather/robe wearers.<br />
<br />
Players are already waking into incomplete content. Obviously the trials are supposed to be hard. I can't believe people are complaining that they can't do the equivilent of marching into the Rathe Council and complete it one month after PoP release.<br />
<br />
Tell me you didn't have complaints ACROSS THE BOARD from all classes about the difficulties with PoJ trials due to the restrictions and the specific class requirements.</div></div><hr />

You didn't miss the nerf. You missed READING the post. It STATES the only stun I have is DS above lvl 65. And warriors use our stuns as a dmg mitigation tool. Well guess what. above 65 I have 1 stun to mitigate. ONE, not 2, not 3, ONE. Stun duration? 1 sec. Yup really mitigates alot.<br />

Thank you Partha for finally hitting the nail on the head. The biggest issue with all this. <br />
<br />
1% of paladins CAN tank these trials to gear up. 20% of warriors CAN tank these trials to gear up. See a discrepency?<br />

When i said you lost me I'm assuming you're speaking as a warrior.

I'd feel just fine if they took out the loot from the trials. Keep them normal experiance, and dropped the loot on random mobs on a bossless experiance version of the trials.<br />
<br />
I think one of the problems with this discusion is the fact that a lot of your information comes from members of #3 guilds on servers that have been in PoTime for 2 months and the many casual players that post on PoN. This gives you one viewpoint.<br />

Reading top guild websites will give you another.<br />

The problems seem to be that content isn't complete. A couple of the trials are real tough and some top guilds are doing them with some difficulty.<br />

I cant see your guild page forom work so I have to ask instead.  Where are you adn your guild at in progression?  I am about the worst geared knight in my guild , raid buffing out at 7825hp/1404ac, adn when/if I try to OT most ele mobs I get raped if the healers dont jump on my asafp.  Admittidly I am short of def aa's (c3s and ca1 only), but even when trying to chain cast my heals (1.5 cast times) I am interruppted more often then not.</div></div><hr />

I am always hopeful that Warriors will be &quot;unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; and that brutal battles will be kept in the game to make that survivability worthwhile.<br />

Paladin - Defensive Tank with a spellbook<br />
Warrior - ordinary fighter with some stances<br />
SK - Offensive Tank with a spellbook<br />
<br />
To achieve this, Defensive has to be removed.<br />
<br />
To answer your other questions.<br />
The point is that there are some issues other than killing the boss in many of these trials. I believe a second Reser is a must. Gaters must either be chain mezed or stuned. Repops and roamers can kill you. Etc. A Paladin really does have advantages is getting you to the named. However if things don't go smoothly when killing the named a Paladin does carry more risk of failure - too much IMO and the mobs needed to be toned down.<br />
<br />
The problem is how much challange has to be removed from the game to satisfy 7000HP unbuffed Paladins?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">We are just now coming into Tier 2. I usually come out at 8300HP and 1500ac give or take 50. We usually go in with me as MT and a Paly for the back up.  Any adds that are not mezzable we  have the SK's move to OT unless we can have them  rooted. Or in the case  me and the paly die we have a 65 SK just finishing off LR5 that moves to tank, he has most of his offensive AA's though where as I started my offensive AA's.  When the sk was working on offensives I was toataly on defensive. Now the SK has 145AA's and I am at 126AA's. So far he has been supised by LR4 and wondering why he was so worried about getting a title first.  I just finished off CF3 and Flurry3 as the only offensive AA's for me at this point and now I have to go back to the HP AA's before I can look at offensives again or atleast the first 2 100hp upgrades.<br />
Honestly up to how awake the healers (since we usually have low numbers)  are I usually either die right off on the boss mobs or I die when it's at 10-15% and the Paly finsihes it off. The utility spells pay off a lot on the adds though more in being able to survive until a heal can make it where as with a warrior and not enough back up healers you can get the aggro np now days  but even a chardok royal would have me dead full defensive in 20-30 secs fully buffed if a healer didn't try to sneak a heal in.  Haven't tested that but pop would be even worse if I had to try it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the survivability advantage I'm having trouble with. You've stated it time and again and it's a known fact that for a knight to tank the high end mobs he needs to be fully geared in that contents best gear, whereas warriors sporting gear from the previous content can do it. Where/when did you lose the edge? Unless you're talking the closing gap for hp/ac. This I believe could have been delt with gear tweaking not mitigation changes.<br />
<br />
You're also avoiding my question again as to why it's such a high crime for a plate tank class in full end game gear to tank PoTime but the fact that non tank &quot;chain/leather&quot; classes do it also doesn't bother any of you.<br />

<br />
<br />
The problem is how much challange has to be removed from the game to satisfy 7000HP unbuffed Paladins?<br />
<br />
Give paladins a valid secondary role and keep the content just as challenging.<br />
<br />
Some Paladins still smarting from the Phase 1 Melee changes looked at this as a good time to work towards &quot;Tank Parity&quot; and were more interested in discussing Warrior nerfs or Paladins upgrades than adjusting a few trial mobs.<br />
<br />
No BB. Most paladins are so sick of being completely ignored by SoE in regards to our spellbook (which we've been complaining about since kunark) that we've lost all hope of SoE leaving their *vision* of what type of spells we should be able to cast.<br />
<br />
Let's try a little productive thinking for a min.<br />
<br />
***These are just my opinions off the top of my head and are not written in stone and in no way represent the paladin community***<br />
<br />
-Eliminate the cleric buff lines on paladins<br />
-Remove /shield from warriors<br />
-Remove Divine Intervention from the game<br />
-Make zone bosses untankable without /def except for a *few* encounters that are based on fear/endurance drains etc.<br />
<br />
-Give paladins 2 or 3 group yaulp type stacking buff lines. By yaulp I mean mana draining while in use. Make the highest lvl ones mgb'able at double the mana cost. (You could also have the mgb'able buffs as discs with refresh timers in the 10ish-12ish mins and durations in the 2-3min range)<br />
-Give paladins the /shield ability. With the removal of Divine Intervention and the need for /def on end bosses it would actually serve a greater purpose. Especially since paladins do have the ability to heal themselves somewhat.<br />
-Tweak the healing efficiency of paladins <br />
-Move all melee (paladins excluded) to 1 melee DPS table higher<br />
<br />
<br />
There's more that would need to be done but you get the idea of what I mean. This allows for paladins to still be able to xp tank or to have a secondary role with buffs that benefit everyone. Remember that with the mana drain component to the buffs we can't have them running all day long since we need to reserve mana for stuns/heals/root. Buffs could be in the ac/hp/%dmg mit/HoT's etc. It's also in no way asking for a warrior nerf unless you take offense at the removal of the /shield ability.<br />
<br />
Before I get slammed for this I'm writing this *cold turkey*. I'm just trying to give a vision as to what could possibly be an option to the future of the game and our classes.<br />
<br />
***To the SK's that may be reading this***<br />
<br />
I apologize for not including you in this but I'd be doing both you and the warriors a disservice making suggestions without proper knowledge of your class.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: dang coding typo again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Define good DPS within the role of the class. Saying cleric DPS is low due to having other duties comes out to how low paladin DPS becomes constantly trying to stun a mob to mitigate dmg.<br />
<br />
No. I'm saying cleric DPS is low period. Whether they have other duties is irrelevant, they are physically incapable of good DPS at the best of times.<br />
<br />
Are we to assume that all casting classes use but 1 nuke? Didn't think so. Combine the top 3 DPS spells and you increase the dmg output.<br />
<br />
No. It doesn't, in sustainable terms. And even in burst, you won't reach very far out of the gutter in worst DPS of everyone. Because you're limited by mana regen. Even using the ONE spell you're going to run yourself out of mana. Adding more even more inefficient spells to the mix just runs you oom quicker. Where you get more burst damage with 2 spells (assuming you can spare the slots), you get even less sustainable damage, so it all  evens out.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter HOW many spells you mem, you still can't put out any kind of decent DPS as a cleric.<br />
<br />
Compared to what class? And to what lvl? Take a warrior not using offensive discs and pit him against a cleric who's fully geared in offensive gear and tell me how big the gap is.<br />
<br />
What classes? How about ALL of them. Here's a bit of an idea for you... IF a cleric was free to ignore healing and nuke at will, for a cleric to sustain 81DPS, which involves CHAINING his best nuke, he HAS to maintain a mana regen of 162mana per tick. And such a mana regen level is nearly impossible. At 80 mana per tick, which is a MUCH more reasonable level, the cleric's only doing 40DPS. Yeah boy, that's sure a lot of DPS...<br />
<br />
Oh, you want me to compare to my warrior? Okay. My warrior does TWO TO THREE TIMES the DPS.<br />
<br />
Care to explain this?<br />
&lt;snipped for brevity&gt;<br />
<br />
And the Paladin's going to be chain casting and not using his weapon, and not using his undead disc. Weren't you just bitching at me about discs that increase DPS? And yet you'll chain cast on a mob instead of using your weapon and disc? /boggle, can you get any more unrealistic?<br />
<br />
The damage mitigation of warriors pre changes was sufficient for all expansion content. So why would they now that the end game has been farmed so much you have leather wearers tanking PoTime gods adjust the dmg mitigation of warriors except for what was yet to come. Conspiracy? No. Logic? Yes<br />
<br />
No, it's called differentiating warriors from the hybrids. Conspiracy? Yes. Because while it WILL make a small difference, they DID NOT do it BECAUSE of the expansion, which is what you're insinuating if not outright claiming.<br />
<br />
Fine, for simplicities sake I'll give you an example. Can and will a bst slow a mob on inc? Let's add to that since bst become viable tanks in alot of content with the right gear. Will they use that slow for pulling said so mob even when a shaman is present? The answer is yes. Why? Because the spell has a purpose for each and every individual mob whereas my casting of guidance is of no purpose with the cleric casting virtue. It comes down to stacking issues again. Defense does NOT stack. Offense does.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to get sucked into debating that with you, you're completely evading my question.<br />
<br />
You claimed that NO OTHER hybrid has as many spells that are made as useless as a paladin's when their parent class is in a group. Do you admit that that claim was a load of bull, or must I prove it?<br />
<br />
Oh God would I love to see you quote me saying that I have issues with AoTC. I sure as fook don't and never nor will ever (unless new spells come out that have stacking issues with it) When I raid or xp I go out of my way to get virtue. Doing ldon with no cleric, no big deal I'll find a cleric for virtue so I can use AoTC. The premise was my buffing utility to groups and AoTC is not a group buff. <br />
<br />
AoTC is self only which invariably doesn't give a benefit to the rest of my group members and it doesn't stack with Nine.<br />
<br />
That sure sounds like you're bitching to me. And no, the premise was UNQUE buffs that STACK. Of which AoTC is one.<br />
<br />
No. I don't want to discuss this issue with you because you're completely irrational in your behavior towards it using your shaman as the counterpoint. Which in a war/pal debate has no meaning let alone the fact of the 15 million other utilities the shaman class has apart from healing. <br />
I'm not irrational towards it at all, thank you very much. I'm just actually concerned with class balance.<br />
<br />
No BB. Most paladins are so sick of being completely ignored by SoE in regards to our spellbook (which we've been complaining about since kunark) that we've lost all hope of SoE leaving their *vision* of what type of spells we should be able to cast.<br />
This is so full of crap, I can hardly believe my ears. Sony has NOT ignored you since Kunark as you claim. Sony has GIVEN you dozens of new new spell additions, a role as a combat healer with your fastest heals in the game, among other things. Hello, 5 new levels of powerful new spells in PoP, that are role defining???<br />
Jesus, it's really starting to appear that you're only concerned with bitching and whatever makes the class look bad, and don't particularly care about the truth of the matter.</div></div><hr />

No. I'm saying cleric DPS is low period. Whether they have other duties is irrelevant, they are physically incapable of good DPS at the best of times.<br />
<br />
Really? Care to explain to me then how a cleric could have over 100dps on a Vulak raid? ON vulak? Since I don't have the parse anymore though you'd have to take my word for it. And well, we all know where that will lead us.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the Paladin's going to be chain casting and not using his weapon, and not using his undead disc. Weren't you just bitching at me about discs that increase DPS? And yet you'll chain cast on a mob instead of using your weapon and disc? /boggle, can you get any more unrealistic?<br />
<br />
I honestly have no clue what you're referring to with all this. As for my undead disc. Would you PLEASE look at parses. Tell me exactly what my DPS increase is using it.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it's called differentiating warriors from the hybrids. Conspiracy? Yes. Because while it WILL make a small difference, they DID NOT do it BECAUSE of the expansion, which is what you're insinuating if not outright claiming.<br />
<br />
Differentiate? Really? How? Knights tank all of PoTime. How does increasing mitigation to warriors differentiate them? Warriors were able to do it with previous tier lvl gear and knights couldn't. THAT's a difference. Saying that warriors can now tank it 2.5% BETTER than they could but AFTER knights can is idiotic.<br />
<br />
You claimed that NO OTHER hybrid has as many spells that are made as useless as a paladin's when their parent class is in a group. Do you admit that that claim was a load of bull, or must I prove it?<br />
<br />
In no way shape or form has my stance changed on this. BEFORE you decide to prove this how about we stick to usable group oriented/mob specific spells. In other words don't start stuff like they only get resist poison and shamans get endure poison etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
That sure sounds like you're bitching to me. And no, the premise was UNQUE buffs that STACK. Of which AoTC is one.<br />
<br />
And you say I get into semantics. <br />
<br />
Wanna be anal? It's UNIQUE but DOESN'T stack with 9. happy? <br />
<br />
Once again, the spell comparisons were in conjunction with secondary roles within a group. As it is a self only spell, it doesn't serve the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not irrational towards it at all, thank you very much. I'm just actually concerned with class balance. <br />

That would be interesting, since Condemnation, with no resists does about 81 dps if you chain cast as fast as possible. Perhaps focused out with Rizlona's you could hit 100dps if you were doing nothing else. You could probably also bump that up if you alternated Condemnation and Judgement, but you have to really being trying to burn as fast as possible and doing nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Taragor,<br />
SoE's responce to the narrowed Warrior HP advantage and frankly AO's tanking PoTime with non-Warriors was the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change. Frodlin and I fought it out on the boards hammer and tongs.<br />
<br />
Unlike a fixed HP increase, it's scalable and not subject to erasure by mudflation. Since it's effect diminishes with lower DI mobs it has minimal effect on normal experiance grouping and normal (lower DI than bosses) raid adds.<br />
<br />
I opposed it because it has no effect on non-melee damage. SoE's fix, which Frodlin supported, was correct. However, IMO they remained sensitive to the fact Warriors are very very concerned with HP's. Thus Sturdyness was added - 500HP's for 60AA.<br />
<br />
IMO, these changes provide a significant but not gamebreaking survivability advantage to Warriors targeted directly at their role as Raid MT and at MTing the hardest hitting non-Raid named (high DI) mobs.<br />
<br />
It also did not imbalance normal experiance grouping for the three Plate Tanks nor remove Knights from their commonly accepted role as Add Tanks/off tank in raids.<br />
<br />
Several of us anticipated the effects of this in future expansions and one thing was perfectly clear - in order for Knights to remain successful Add Tanks/off tank in raids, SoE could not create high DI adds.<br />
<br />
This is precisely the error they made in designing the trials. Knights attempting to complete the trails would have to MT high DI named mobs - territory that by design was significant Warrior advantage.<br />
<br />
What were they thinking?<br />
<br />
If looks like these mobs or the encounter will be adjusted.<br />
<br />
IMO, where we were headed before SoE tossed in the Trial monkey wrench was:<br />
<br />
Tank population/role<br />
50% MT (Warriors) (excepting mobs specifically designed to exclude them)<br />
30% Add Tank/off tank/healer/CC (Paladins)<br />
20% would be  Add Tank/off tank/DPS (SK)<br />
<br />
Each class was well on their way toward successfully filling these roles.<br />
<br />
It required three things of SoE:<br />
1. Provide any spells and abilities needed to insure that each class was preferred and effective in these roles.<br />
<br />
2. Be careful that these changes do not unbalance normal experiance group preference.<br />
<br />
3. Design content accordingly.<br />
<br />
I believe our enthusiastic designers not wanting to be limited by the narrow thinking of the past said &quot;#$% that, all the rules are gone. Boss mobs will juggle aggro like a ball and you have to deal with the situation as it unfolds.&quot; How innovative - chuck out the rules (lol).<br />
<br />
So which is it SoE? Chuck out the rules in the name of challange or support the roles as they have evolved with approprite spells and abilities?<br />
<br />
I honestly do not know what SoE's intent is. As the old saw goes, surprise me, but don't do the unexpected :D. I will say as a former designer I was conservative as all hell and the Trials look like an error to me that would not have occured under a strict design regime. There's always room for innovation, but rule #2 is Get it right (#1 is Ship it on time!).<br />

It's been stated that the undead disc gives on the order of a 20-30% increase vs undead. Very fuzzy with this one, but it is a significant increase.<br />

Increasing warrior mitigation makes them overall tank better in experience groups. Raid nameds are not effected by this due to having defensive's design changed to take the DI change into account. So your claims are misleading.<br />
<br />
In no way shape or form has my stance changed on this. BEFORE you decide to prove this how about we stick to usable group oriented/mob specific spells. In other words don't start stuff like they only get resist poison and shamans get endure poison etc.<br />
<br />
I figured you would never admit that your claim that more paladin spells are rendered irrelevant with a casting parent in the group was just plain false, so I will prove to you how your claim is just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
Talisman, IoS, Sta, Agi, Haste, poison and disease resists, are ALL rendered useless by a shaman in a group.<br />
<br />
For Paladins, symbol, AC buff, HB are rendered useless in a group with a cleric. <br />
<br />
There's your proof. Contrary to your claim, paladins are NOT the class who has the most spells rendered irrelevant with their casting parent in the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the -1 DI change does not change anything in regards to warriors and tanking nameds if you're talking about any mob that uses defensive.<br />
<br />
As I already stated, defensive was changed to 45% mitigation instead of the old 50% mitigation just before the DI change went in - when they very first added the discs into spell data on test, it WAS at 50%, and it went live at 45%.<br />
<br />
I remember this very well, because I saw the change and went WTF at the time.<br />

You are correct, as I well know, that the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change its not additive to Defensive. However, when Defensive is not used and on those mobs taking longer than Defensive's 3 minute effect the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change provides a scalable Warrior melee mitigation advantage.<br />
<br />
While you may be generally correct since most non-raid named mobs do not take more than 3 minutes to kill, I'm sure if you reflect a bit you can think of several non-raid named mobs that do take more than three minutes to kill.<br />

If you knew how many times we've lost that cleric to aggro you'd understand lol. For this particular parse that I have on Vulak he did literally nothing else except nuke. He also has gear to increase dmg, reduce cast times etc etc etc (not familiar with all the different focuses) I know he also has the aa's to increase dmg.<br />

* Just quoting the end part since my reply will encompass all the different parts. I'm wearing my keys thin from the 6 pages long replies :)<br />
<br />
I agree with you in your assessment. it's also why I believe pre-GoD, post phase 1 melee changes you had the closest balance the game has ever had between the 3 plate classes in regards to tanking.<br />
<br />
the DI modification to warriors as I said was not the greatest issue, reason being that pre-GoD paladins even without the mit upgrade tanked just as well as they did after. The content of EQ at the time was based on previous dmg tables.<br />
<br />
Even though Daemon swears up and down and refuses to admit it. SoE DID take the modification into consideration when they created GoD and based the power in direct proportion. Which in the end means that knights do lose alot of ground specifically because the content is all DI dmg based. The outcry is that even though we don't know what's beyond the trials there's absolutely no reason to believe that this will change. <br />

I'm really not trying to be insulting but when exactly did warriors start having problems with their dmg mitigation while xp'ing? If they can TANK zone boss mobs AFTER /def is gone they sure as hell can survive xp mobs.<br />
<br />

<br />
Look you can argue all you want. IF a cleric is IN the group I can ONLY cast BSS. How friggin hard is that to UNDERSTAND?<br />
<br />
Now if you want to bring offensive spells into the equation bsts can use all their lvl appropriate spells on all lvl mobs.<br />
<br />
Paladins only have stuns as *VIABLE* offensive spell which are all rendered useless for their purpose *except divine stun which is an AA but we'll count it if you like* the minute a mob is 66+. That means don't come blabbing that my stuns work because they still generate aggro those are NOT their primary purpose.<br />

Do you have any other proof you want to share?<br />

<br />
My point is that there is absolutely no conceivable logical way in hell a non tank class should be able to tank current content zone bosses. Even geared in the best equipment of that content. And whether or not paladins are in direct competition to you it means (sorta) that non tanking classes tank equal to paladins when gear is equal. How should WE feel. :)</div></div><hr />

Quit wriggling. I'm still waiting for proof. Alternating condemnation and judgement will run the cleric OOM, lowering the sustainable DPS.<br />

Nope, I'm not dreaming it. I'm going off of what I've read from other's posts. It IS a significant increase, more than 2-3%, that's for sure. How much more is open to question.

Your bitching about resists being taken into account doesn't change anything. There's all the OTHER spells that are made irrelevant too, which still means that guess what, beastlords have more spells rendered irrelevant than paladins. You're still wriggling.<br />
<br />
Look you can argue all you want. IF a cleric is IN the group I can ONLY cast BSS. How friggin hard is that to UNDERSTAND?<br />
<br />
what's magically stopping you from casting fast heals, and HoT's, and group heals, and stuns? They are certainly not irrelevant even with a cleric in the group.<br />

Paladins only have stuns as *VIABLE* offensive spell which are all rendered useless for their purpose *except divine stun which is an AA but we'll count it if you like* the minute a mob is 66+.

<br />
Not entirely, there's still the proc imbue. But close enough. You're not an offensive hybrid, you're a defensive hybrid, though. So arguing that paladins are so poor off because they only have a few offensive spells paints a false picture of reality.... their role is centered more around defensive abilities such as heals.<br />
<br />
non tanking classes tank equal to paladins when gear is equal. How should WE feel. :) <br />
<br />
Non tank classes tanking equal to paladins. That's rich. That's also just flatly untrue. Only monks have the same kind of damage taking ability, and they don't have the aggro generation that's equally as important.<br />
<br />
As for non tanks not being able to ever tank... is it really that black and while for you?<br />
<br />
Non tank classes should be able to tank progressivley less well than their tank counterparts, and less and less well the more of a pure caster you are.  That's exactly how it is now. It's not just tank classes can tank and everyone else can't.</div></div><hr />

With a damage focus, Rizlona's, Blessing of Reverence, and perhaps a spell haste focus item, it is theoretically possible for a cleric to hit 100dps casting just Condemnation as soon as it refreshed, for as long as mana holds out. If they were feeling plucky I  suppose they could melee as well while the spell refreshes. Adding the effect from ornate or elemental gloves would also considerably extend the mana supply. They could probably keep it up for 3 or 4 minutes depending on mana regen, maybe more. But this raises two questions:<br />

I don't need to look it up. I'm a paladin, I should know the way my discs work. BTW now that I think about it and your vehement refusal to believe, would you happen to be meaning my AA ability SLAY UNDEAD rather than my disc holyforge? Because yes, I do gain more than 2-3% with SU over longer fights (hard to judge on short fight since I may not get any slays at all) But holyforge EVEN with Slay Undead does NOT equal more than 2-3%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They didn't.<br />

Can we thus agree that the only reason to increase it was for future content? I mean, what other reason would there be.<br />

This is why I don't discuss spells with you, because you act like a 5yr child when discussing it. I couldn't give two flying fooks if beastlords had 500 spells that were rendered useless when their parent class was present if their &quot;primary used all the time* spells were still used and as valid. WHICH IS THE CASE.<br />
<br />
The CASE is that they have MORE remaining to be USED. <br />
<br />
Using the mentality of they lose MORE and not they lose from what they USE leads nowhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not entirely, there's still the proc imbue. But close enough. You're not an offensive hybrid, you're a defensive hybrid, though. So arguing that paladins are so poor off because they only have a few offensive spells paints a false picture of reality.... their role is centered more around defensive abilities such as heals.<br />
<br />
You're beating around the bush. When I said offensive spells I didn't mention my nukes because they are useless. But my stuns ARE my offense AND defense. They are an integrated part of my class to allow me to do my role as tank. Thus losing ALL of them reduces my tanking abilities. (Discounting DS which has a 1sec stun component and is used primarily on casting mobs.<br />

Non tank classes tanking equal to paladins. That's rich. That's also just flatly untrue. Only monks have the same kind of damage taking ability, and they don't have the aggro generation that's equally as important.  <br />

Put up or shut up.<br />
<br />
Can we thus agree that the only reason to increase it was for future content? I mean, what other reason would there be.<br />
<br />
I've already stated what other reason there could be. To further differentiate warrior tanking from hybrid tanking in terms of damage taken.<br />
<br />
This is why I don't discuss spells with you, because you act like a 5yr child when discussing it.<br />
<br />
You're accusing ME of acting like a 5 year old child? Pot, Kettle, Black.<br />
<br />
 I couldn't give two flying fooks if beastlords had 500 spells that were rendered useless when their parent class was present if their &quot;primary used all the time* spells were still used and as valid. WHICH IS THE CASE.<br />
<br />
That's not what you claimed earlier and made such a big deal over. In fact you didn't mention that at all. Your claim was specifically that &quot;more paladin spells are rendered irrelevant when their parent class is in a group than any other class.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's amazing the lengths you'll go to, to not admit when your claims are completely full of it.<br />
<br />
Using the mentality of they lose MORE and not they lose from what they USE leads nowhere.<br />
<br />
The buffs that I mentioned are used by both paladins and beastlords, with the sole exception of the resists. So that statement is completely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Thus losing ALL of them reduces my tanking abilities. (Discounting DS which has a 1sec stun component and is used primarily on casting mobs.<br />
<br />
And how and when, pray tell, are you losing your stuns, hmmmm? That's right, you're not.<br />
<br />
 You're just in plain denial about this. Until you're willing to look at the REAL EQ of today discussing this is futile. [/B]<br />
<br />
So very ironic, coming from you.</div></div><hr />

 No, because Paladins can be brought not as MT if they cannot MT, but as secondaries. Also, guilds are MORE likely (In fact, I dare say HIGHLY likely) to take classes through to get gear upgrades than, say, a pickup trials group. (Of which there are none and are unlikely to be none for the next 18 months.)<br />
<br />
YES. I SHOULD be able to complete all the trials. The primary low level ones as an alternative tank to a warrior, the deeper harder ones as a VALUED MEMBER IN A DAMN SIX MAN RAID. <br />
<br />
 And, as you yourself failed to argue against when I pointed it out, THIS HAS BEEN DONE BY KNIGHTS, BOTH AS MT AND AS SECONDARIES.<br />

<br />
Your average cleric will run himself compelety out of mana in less than three minutes doing that.... it's nowhere near sustainable.<br />
<br />
My warrior, the SECOND WORST melee DPS in the game, handily outdoes cleric DPS.<br />
<br />
Considering clerics are one of the 3 worst DPS classes in the game, to call clerics being able to do good DPS is to say that paladins and enchanters able to do good DPS as well, and that the actual DPS classes do insane amounts of damage.<br />
<br />
Let's call a spade, a spade here, shall we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">You are missing a few factors. As I said, it's entirely possible to hit 100dps with just Condemnation at the cost of about 125 mana/tick with the proper focuses. I didn't say it was good DPS, it's just 100 dps, which is what Taragor said. Whether his guildmate actually did it or not, I don't know, but it's not outside the realm of possibility, depending on the length of the fight. Just how long is a Vulak fight anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Yes, there's a lot more factors to take into account. Along with the focuses which clerics typically don't have, and which even if they have them have a variable effect, and there's the lack of specialization, and resists will also drag the DPS back down again.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a Time level cleric can do better, but then, everyone else does that much better then as well, so relatively speaking I don't think there's much if any change. The Time cleric is still going to have to deal with the same problem of mana inefficiencies.<br />
<br />
None of them make a real big difference, certainly not a 25% increase over what's possible unfocused.<br />
<br />
It's not in question whether or not a cleric can do DPS... but whether they do GOOD DPS or not is a completely different story. Relative to the other classes, they simply don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">/sigh....I was really hoping to avoid this...<br />
It was stated that he has a damage focus,  spell haste focus, and all the relevant damage AAs. For the purposes of this discussion, we will assume that the focus effects are the ones found on easily available bazaar bought items.<br />
So:<br />
Condemnation: 1100 damage, 6.5 sec cast time, 7 sec recast time, for a base DPS of ~81 DPS. <br />
<br />
Spell Haste IV and Blessing of Reverence will take the cast time to...what...4.9 secs? That brings us up to ~92 dps.<br />
<br />
Improved Damage IV will add between 1% and 20% additional damage, for an average of just over 10% additional damage. We'll use 10% to make it easy. We are up to 101 DPS.<br />
<br />
Now add Rizlona's, which adds another 1% to 15% of that base 92 DPS, so lets say 8% addional, so that's 108dps.<br />
<br />
Now let's take crit AAs into account, I'm not sure exactly how much full crit AAs add, but I'd guess 10% is in the ballpark. So now we are up to about 120 dps, before resists, using nothing but Condemnation.Which, if you are counting, is very close to a 50% dps increase over the chain casting it non-modified.<br />
<br />
Aganst a mob that has had MR debuffs, 100 dps seems quite reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
Add SCM3 and Ornate Guantlets, and the mana cost is about 256 per cast, every 11.9 secs, so about 128 mana/tick.<br />
<br />
Pretty nice what full focuses can do, isn't it? Can we be done with this discussion now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">It was stated that he has a damage focus, spell haste focus, and all the relevant damage AAs. <br />
<br />
Where is this? The only statement I see to that effect is from you, speaking entirely theoretically. <br />
<br />
That being said:<br />
<br />
Yes, that is possible, and that's also reaching the greatest possible amount of DPS from that class, which also hinges on the cleric being able to nuke exclusively, which is a rare occurence to say the least.<br />
<br />
But sure, say the cleric can do that. He's going to run out of mana, he can't sustain it.<br />
<br />
Secondly, let's compare to what the other classes are going to do for DPS when they have the same sort of wicked setup.<br />
<br />
Take the wizard with the same buffs and such, and he's still doing that much better for DPS.<br />
<br />
Take the warrior with 130% haste, fero, plus all the relevant damage AA's, and HE is doing that much better too.<br />
<br />
It really changes nothing, the cleric is still doing poor <br />
DPS compared to the other classes.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the chances of a cleric being able to nuke alone, PLUS have the damage focus, PLUS the AA's, PLUS the bard? That happens about as often as.... well, let's just say almost never.<br />
<br />
Your math's off, btw. EVEN with all that, it's 110DPS... before resists.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I'll admit... with ALL of that, it's possible to hit just over 100DPS. Happens about as often as you see a blue moon tho, and it's not even sustainable. Even with that, my warrior witohut even great buffs or all the offensive AA's or even using discs can exceed it.... and he's one of the worst DPS classes in the game.<br />
<br />
Can clerics do DPS? Yes. Is it GOOD DPS? Only as much as paladin DPS is good DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Where is this? The only statement I see to that effect is from you, speaking entirely theoretically.<br />
You ought to read a bit closer...<br />
<br />
For this particular parse that I have on Vulak he did literally nothing else except nuke. He also has gear to increase dmg, reduce cast times etc etc etc (not familiar with all the different focuses) I know he also has the aa's to increase dmg.<br />
<br />
I never said it was good DPS compared to others. I never said is was sustainable indefinately, but then again, it doesn't have to be. I really couldn't care less. I think your little discussion is completely assinine, and I gave up trying to follow it long ago. My only interest is that you denied that Taragor's cleric could do 100dps. I started running the numbers in my head and realized that wasn't right. I showed he can, provided the fight duration is not too long. Geez man, it's hard for you to admit you are wrong, isn't it?<br />
<br />
By the way, where is the mistake in my math? I would appreciate it if you would point it out. I will be more than happy to admit I am incorrect if you could show me where. Are you sure you didn't leave out Rizlona's in your calcs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Actually, I just admitted I was wrong above. I'm sorry, but I didn't consider the possibilities of a cleric that has EVERY focus possible... that happens rarely at best. <br />
<br />
Anyway.<br />
<br />
Now add Rizlona's, which adds another 1% to 15% of that base 92 DPS, so lets say 8% addional, so that's 108dps.<br />
<br />
8% more on 92 is 7.3 damage, so 99 total, not 108.<br />
<br />
And you're right, this conversation IS asinine, it's what I get dragged into when I call Taragor on his claims that are so full of it.<br />
<br />
Like his claims about paladins being the class that has more spells made irrelevant with a casting parent in the group than any other, for example....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">I'm afraid your math is off.<br />
Improved Damage IV will add between 1% and 20% additional damage, for an average of just over 10% additional damage. We'll use 10% to make it easy. We are up to 101 DPS.<br />
<br />
Now add Rizlona's, which adds another 1% to 15% of that base 92 DPS, so lets say 8% addional, so that's 108dps.<br />
You see, ID4 took the damage up from 92 dps to 101. When adding the Rizlona's damage, the percentage increase is calculated from the 92 dps, not from the 101 dps, which, if you read closely, is what I was saying above. Perhaps it would be simpler to say it as:<br />
92 + (.10*92)+(.08*92)=~108</div></div><hr />

-A bard in the group casting the right song<br />

-chain nukes<br />
<br />
He can hit about 110DPS with resists.<br />
<br />
At what point is it acknowledged that that's reaching?<br />
<br />
I would say that a situation like that comes up MAYBE... .1% of the time. 1%, being extremely generous.<br />
<br />
My elemental guild alone, which has farmed the crap out of VT, only has one or two clerics out of the entire roster that actually have both focii. Let alone having them in a situation WITH a bard in a group where they can chain nuke and ignore healing.<br />
<br />
That's reaching almost as much as talking about the possibilities of keeping a tank alive in Elementals with Chloroblast. =P<br />
<br />
In the actual game on a day to day basis, this just doesn't happen. Well. It happens about as often as the warriors with Rampage AE'ing with Earthshakers.<br />

<br />
Balance does not mean that Warriors and Paladins tank nearly the same. It means rather they they do not displace each other in their usual roles and that each has roles where they are useful. In groups we share the same basic role with neither having an overwhelming advantage that precludes the other from finding a group slot. In raids, our roles diverge.<br />

If the Dune series, the word Gaflah was coined - it's the distraction used to avoid the issue at hand.<br />

And I've already answered you that this would equal to a whopping ZERO in the game pre-GoD. Differentiating means to make a difference.

No, because Paladins can be brought not as MT if they cannot MT, but as secondaries. Also, guilds are MORE likely (In fact, I dare say HIGHLY likely) to take classes through to get gear upgrades than, say, a pickup trials group. (Of which there are none and are unlikely to be none for the next 18 months.)<br />
<br />
On general principal I would agree with you if the paladins secondary role itself didn't become a cruth. Remember you are limited to 6 ppl. <br />
<br />
-If you decide to have a paladin to offtank you need a minimum 2 healers. This would also be the case if you had a warrior offtank, mob dps output requires it. This leaves you a total of 2 group slots for DPS and Slow/Haste<br />
<br />
-With the dmg output we cannot act as secondary healer with our current healing spells.<br />
<br />
-DPS efficiency is very low. Considering some of these encounters (quoting what I've read from players that have done them) are on timers, you run the risk of running out of time.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ok let me ask you this then. When should the paladin be able to achieve this? What I mean is, is it only acceptable for the paladin to be in full PoTime gear to be able to do both roles? The MT part I can live with in the deeper trials, but the offtanking role? I mean it is a paladin core role is it not? And core should be from an equal gear level of warriors. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Daemon is correct.  During the &quot;Class Balance&quot; period a while back, Verant/SoE did admit that Warriors were not keeping pace with the hybrid classes in many areas, however the encoding at the time precluded altering the Warrior class due to it being the major parent class of all hybrids.  To alter Warriors in any meaningful way would have altered Hyrbids as well, which would have made the altering pointless.  It took a recoding of the system to allow SoE to alter defensive and offensive tables independantly for melees.  After that (IIRC) Paladins were given the Warrior Defensive Table a slightly lesser offensive table while SKs were given the Warrior Offensive table and a slightly lesser defensive table (hence the Paladin being the &quot;defensive hybrid&quot;).  There were also changes to the Monk, Ranger and Rogue tables.  AFAIK Paladins and Warriors shared the same defensive table and defensive AAs up until the Warrior mitigation bonus and GoD AAs were implemented.  But this is all purely based on what I've read from the devs and patch messages and not from any parsing.  Of course, I could be mistaken.  My memory is like swiss cheese.

Gave you a nice point by point refutation here. Did it on PoN as well.<br />
<br />
A Paladin is primarily a tank and has other non-tank related capabilities. A Warrior is a tank who sometimes does general DPS. A Warrior's role in this game is to be:<br />
&quot;....unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; and  &quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
If you disagree with SoE's assertion that the Phase 1 Melee changes were needed and you are unable to accept that Paladins should not be equivilent to Warriors in greater than 95% of the game's content and still have a spellbook containing useful spells not needed to achieve this state, then you need to write a game so that you can make the rules to suit yourself. Make Paladins 100% Warriors and 100% Clerics for all I care. But make it a one player game, because no one else will want to play it.<br />

Actually I'm pretty sure it could too.  At least most clerics, that is.  I laugh when I hear in game about an SK not being able to do much damage, that they're just a tank. /boggle. Sometimes actual 65 SKs say this and it just frightens me they can't change their tactics.  okay, /derail off  <br />
<br />
Really I am pretty sure he cant.  Parsed over a 40 minute LDoN w/ just my haste buff on him he worked out to 20 dps.  I was also ML so he wasnt always on a mob the whole fight but I dont think that would bring it up a whole lot.<br />

Ok I see either I was really unclear or you guys want to play the quantity vs usability game. Here goes.<br />
<br />
Assume lvl 65 xp content<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
<br />
stuns 2<br />
buffs 2 bss/aotc<br />
Root 1<br />
weap proc 1<br />
Heal 3<br />

<br />
Beastlord<br />
<br />
DD: 2<br />
DoT: Only 1? I'd say possibly 2 but I'll take your word for it<br />
Spiritual Dominion 1<br />
Ferocity 1<br />
Pet procs 1 (sorry if you want to calculate mine gotta calculate your pets)<br />
Heals 2 (1 you 1 pet)<br />
Pet buff atleast 1 (calculate aotc calculate pet buff)<br />
Spiritual Vigor 1<br />
<br />
total = 10<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to calculate as to utility towards your group. Beastlords have 3 spells they contribute to the paladins 1 when their parent class is around.<br />
<br />
Or are we counting all the spells? you know like 10 stuns + 14 heals + etc etc etc. Cause if we're doing that sure I have more. It's stupid, but fine you win.</div></div><hr />

I frankly don't care.  On more than one occation Symbol actually was a good thing to have so I carry around a stack of peridots for emergency.  The reality is that most of the time it won't be used.  The question is this really much of a bonus?  Some make it out to be a big deal.  I don't think Clerics or Paladins care their spells don't stack.  I would rather burn the Cleric's mana anyway. ^_^<br />
<br />
As for Cleric's DPS they can get some serious stuff pumping.  Of course when at FT 15 sporting a lot of focus effects plus add in weapon procs (and not I'm not talking about the summoned one) is it any surprise?  I actually don't mind if a Cleric pumps 70+ DPS as long as they didn't do it with summoned junk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol. When playing an admittedly lower level Paladin my spell gems are far from empty even when grouped with a Cleric. I actually have predefined spell gem setups that I load at need.<br />
<br />
Lessee, Combat in normal experiance groups looks like:<br />
Light of Life, Wave of Life, Force of Akera, Holy Might, Force, Pacify, Divine Might, Instrument of Nife and Root. Oh, and LoH hidden under the driver's seat.<br />
<br />
It takes a good portion of my mana bar to heal to full, but that no big deal since with FT7 and KEI mana is not a big deal given that I heal no one to full.<br />
<br />
Now, what does Aeka's gem bar look like in normal experiance groups (I like quessing games)?<br />
Light of Nife, Wave of Marr, Force of Akilae, QWoS, Cease(?!), GRC, Pious Might, Ward of Nife, and Shackles of Tunare. Oh, and LoH (and a few other goodies) hidden under the driver's seat.<br />
<br />
(I'm probably waaaaay off)<br />
<br />
In a normal experiance goup fighting dark blues say me in KC and Aeka in PoF picnic area, I think we are both in pretty good shape.<br />
<br />
Should we decide to hunting named mobs with our groups, there are mobs we can and mobs we can not do. My group can't take on Gorenaire - Aeka's group can.<br />
<br />
So what then is the Paladin &quot;problem&quot;?<br />
<br />
1. Heals haven't kept pace. Easy to check I would think. &quot;My&quot; mobs hit for up to 100HP's and I can heal for 410HP's. Aeka's mobs hit for (in GoD) up to 1kHP's and best heal is ~1kHP's.<br />
<br />
Yep, heals haven't kept pace<br />
<br />
2. Higher level mobs have more stun immunity.<br />
<br />
Well, QWoS and Divine Stun aren't too shabby IMO. I suppose there are more mobs that are 100% stun immune, just like there are more mobs that can't be slowed.<br />
<br />
3. Pacify no longer works.<br />
<br />
4. Root doesn't work when you move past trivial mobs.<br />
<br />
5. I don't mitigate damage as well as a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Neither does my 53 Paladin (who fell asleep a couple of months after Kunnark was released and woke back up three months ago). Those Warriors hit Defensive and there's no keeping up with them. I guess that's why they MT hard hitting named mobs. <br />
<br />
Now to my Paladin, Defensive is still kind of novel. But Aeka, for you it's the way things have been for most of the time you have played the game.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that upgrading heals (probably for several classes), perhaps another difficult to resist higher level stun, and an Advanced Root would fix most of what is wrong with the Paladin class.<br />
<br />
Oh, I left out that Paladins don't mitigate as well as a Warrior. Ahhh, Warriors have Defensive - you aren't a Warrior. Still, Paladins should mitigate better than non-Plate classes. So, I think moving Warriors to &quot;-2 DI&quot; and Knights to &quot;-1 DI&quot; is in order.<br />
<br />
But for a class that was very clearly the preferred class in experiance groups until 2 short months ago, it's a little hard to believe you are useless now.<br />

I'd say you're fairly close. Though I doubt he has GRC loaded (unless GoD mobs use curse) or he's just trying to fill his spell gems. :)<br />

<br />
You'd need heals raised across the board for dru/shm/cle if you raised paladin heals  (which you mention further down). The issue is that raising heals across the board means you still need to keep paladin heals much less effective for priest classes not to complain, which in turn reduces the power of said heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, QWoS and Divine Stun aren't too shabby IMO. I suppose there are more mobs that are 100% stun immune, just like there are more mobs that can't be slowed.<br />
<br />
FoA has alot more value than QWoS and they both lock at the same mob lvl (65). QWoS is just way too slow to cast when tanking even if a mob is slowed. When not tanking the pushback on it would annoy the hell out of the tank. :)<br />
<br />
<br />

I agree. And the argument wouldn't be there about the loss of usefull spells when our parent class is present if it were still the case.<br />
<br />
Simply put, would you consider all your spell lines which scale to 65 more usefull since the change? or would you say it's made zero difference?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily.  Depends on how you improve them.  IMO, Pally heals should be &quot;Battle Heals&quot;, being that they are fighting.  I would think that giving Paladins fast single target heals and fast group heals with long recycle times (kinda like LoH, but on a smaller scale).  Say at the top end a single target 1500 point heal with a .5 second cast time and a 20(or more) minute recycle and a group 1k heal with a .5 second cast time and 30(or more) minute recycle and possibly another one that's self only (just pulling those out of my arse, but you get the point).  This would give pallies more effective emergency heals without requiring upgrades to other priest heals.  IMO, this is one of the Pallies primary roles anyway - emergency/backup heals.  Also, I dunno if they get it or not, but IMO Pallies should have the Mark of Karn line (should have a better line that Clerics, even).  Most clerics I know don't even keep this loaded and I think it is a great spell line for long melee-based battles.  Then there is the Yaulp line.  Why have pallies not gotten a group version of this that stacks with everything?  This could have a fast cast and fast recast (maybe a longer lasting version of Yaulp 5 to avoid twitch-play) and give a small ATK buff+small mana infusion+mana regen as if sitting for the whole group.  SKs get group mana taps, I think Pallies should get at least a small one, too (not a tap, per se, as Pallies don't do that).  Yaulp is definitely a Battle-Buff, thus should be well-developed in the Pally arsenal.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that have these type of fast emergency heals would make Pallies better able to handle these types of encounters without degrading Druid/Shammies heals?  I think it would make them a little less dependant on the RNG for the tough mobs, but not too powerful where Warriors aren't preferred.<br />
<br />
Whatever changes are made, I won't say the the Pally spellbook doesn't have room for improvement.  SKs get tons of very useful spells.  I do not believe, however, that pallies need anything from the warrior side of the house, though.  I think more unique abilities or enhancing current abilities are the answer, not cannibalizing the other classes out to band-aid up the problem.</div></div><hr />

Why are you asking me what you were counting? It was your claim.<br />
<br />
<br />
It makes zero difference anyway. The fact remains that Beastlords STILL have more spells made irrelevant when the shaman is in a group than a paladin  with a cleric in the group.<br />
<br />
And btw, &quot;fine you win&quot; is a cop-out. It's not admitting whether or not your claim was wrong or not, it's nothing but a cop-out where you tell me I win an argument to try to shut me up so that you don't have to (OH NOS!) admit to being wrong. Whether &quot;I win&quot; or not is not what's being asked, and is irrelevant. What's being asked is if YOU acknowledged what YOU said was wrong or not.

Well, first we'd have to start with an honest question, wouldn't we? This is Kether's 'What are Paladin's the BEST in the game at?&quot; question dressed up in a new costume.<br />
Players have capabilities, capabilities lead to spots in groups and in raids.<br />
<br />
I'm a Shaman and I want to start a group and notice a Warrior and a Paladin nearby but no Cleric. I grab the Paladin. As fate would have it, Paladin buffs and Shaman buffs sing a nearly perfect duet.<br />
<br />
I'm a Druid.....<br />
<br />
I'm a Cleric and I'm going to do Miragul's or Mistmore or a zone with lots of adds and I can only get an Enchanter (sorry, no Bard or Shaman). Going to need some help with CC and another Resser sounds good to me in case I bite it.<br />
<br />
I'm a guild and I need a Tank to do adds. They are going to pop 4 at a time and I can only devote a Druid to heal this tank. We've got this pile of adds and are going to AE. Want some good Wave Healing action going on. Gah, have to tank these and keep them at 5% but can't kill them.<br />
<br />
The list is endless.<br />
<br />
Warrior = 100% Tank, role Main Tank (and general DPS while waiting to MT)<br />
<br />
Cleric = 100% Healer, role Main Healer, Rotation Healer<br />
<br />
Enchanter = 100% Control, role Mezzer/debuffer<br />
<br />
Yep, whenever a Warrior's survivability (including Defensive) does not increase the likelyhood of success vs. a pile of Paladin utility the Paladin is preferred.<br />
<br />
The Warrior niche is Heavy Tank who is more effective than any other tank vs. high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
The Paladin niche is Tank/spot healer/buffer/CC/GRC/Resser.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness our differences prevent us from competing for exactly the same role in all groups for all purposes. If the only fighter job was Heavy MT and Warriors, Paladins, SK's, Monks, Rangers, Beastlords, Beserkers, Pets, etc. felt they should equally perform it, the game would bite. Fortunately who MT's depends on the circumstances. Against a high DI mob, the best choice IMO is the class designed to tank it.<br />
<br />

Can we play the honest game here?<br />
is all too obvious.<br />

Sure, you get a group fast heal, but what about single target or self?  I've seen lower level SKs tank mobs using lifetaps and not need a heal the whole fight where I would need several CHs.  SKs don't mitigate as well as Warriors, but thier abilities make this a moot point most of the time.  Pallies should be no different.<br />
<br />
Was thinking, wouldn't it be nice if Pallies got a super-MoK AA?  Say 100 points a hit that lasts 20 seconds?  Would have to have a fairly long refresh on it, but it would give them something to compete with all the MGB heals other classes get as it would stack with everything.<br />

<br />
No BB that wasn't my intention. And though you think I really had nasty ulterior motives you actually answered the question.<br />
<br />
In all 3 scenarios you did not have a warrior present. This leads to the answer. The paladin was chosen as a tank not for a secondary role.<br />
<br />
My point wasn't that we weren't prefered during that time. My point was that we were prefered as tanks. Now remove the preference or an equality in that role and we don't have a role, because in the views of the player base on EQ paladins in a group setting serve but 1 real purpose. Tanking. <br />
<br />
Sure I can do other things but in 99% of all cases those abilities are overshadowed by a lack of their need and from weaknesses in them so they are not taken into consideration.<br />

You ought to give it a rest - you've pulled out every half-truth, crooked question, and attempt to define yourself into a pursuaisive argument that has been done 100's of times before.<br />

In PoTime (sorry, you'll have to take my word for it) against Quarm, Wave heals are darned useful. I've known Paladins NOT to melee in that fight precisely because their secondary role was so important.<br />

Concidering the normal experiance group game is relatively balanced, the only thing left for you to argue is that you can not MT high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
You never have been able to MT a mob with DB=300 DI=100 in a single standard group anywhere. Look up the previous content mobs and find a mob with DB=300 and DI=100 and go try to tank it in a single standard group - you can't.<br />
<br />
Heck, try Rumblecrush - he's easy. You still can't (although many high-level Paladins can).<br />
<br />
Warriors have intended advantages MTing high DI mobs.<br />

This is optional alternative flag content that will be nerfed so you can handle it when the time comes.<br />

Not saying you'll get anything Taragor.  Just making suggestions.  Sure, you get a group fast heal, but what about single target or self?  I've seen lower level SKs tank mobs using lifetaps and not need a heal the whole fight where I would need several CHs.  SKs don't mitigate as well as Warriors, but thier abilities make this a moot point most of the time.  Pallies should be no different.<br />
<br />
The only theory I can come up with is that we have other non self heal spells thus giving us self only ones would only increase the amount of healing we can do in a tanking role. This would most likely lead to paladins being able to MT current content much sooner and may lower the desireability of warriors.<br />
<br />
Was thinking, wouldn't it be nice if Pallies got a super-MoK AA?  Say 100 points a hit that lasts 20 seconds?  Would have to have a fairly long refresh on it, but it would give them something to compete with all the MGB heals other classes get as it would stack with everything.<br />
<br />
Believe me when I say paladin jaws all over norrath and beyond dropped when the ability to mgb group heals were introduced with nye a one for us. Not because we want what everyone else wants, but because we had what others didn't have and were surplanted on it.<br />
<br />
Want a drastic *which would really not be overused* ability that I'm still against because the penalty to the player is too high?<br />
<br />
Turn Act of Valor into a 2k mgb heal with a refresh timer of 60mins that is not reactivated upon death. That  may actually make it usefull, though I completely and utterly disagree in the concept that I have to take a FULL XP death loss in ANY of my abilities. Remove that restriction and I think you'd start looking into the right direction. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just brainstorming here.  Take it as you will. <br />
<br />
I have no issues brainstorming alternatives to making my class usefull. As I said, I want to be a paladin, not a warrior. :)<br />

I'll take your word for your answer to my next question.<br />

<br />
Both your reply and my last 1 used the single goup environment. We weren't discussing the effectiveness on raids but the purpose of a paladin in a group. Why bring this up?<br />
<br />
You never have been able to MT a mob with DB=300 DI=100 in a single standard group anywhere. Look up the previous content mobs and find a mob with DB=300 and DI=100 and go try to tank it in a single standard group - you can't.<br />
<br />
This is almost equal in relevance to me saying find me any other 1 forced 6 man group encounter that paladins cannot tank.<br />
<br />
This is optional alternative flag content that will be nerfed so you can handle it when the time comes.<br />
<br />
There you go using the *nerf* word again. I thought I'd made my stance clear that I didn't want a *nerf*. I want purpose. If that can be achieved by SoE giving paladins true purpose in a secondary role in a 6 man group that I can be looked at equally to all the other classes out there with the exception of warriors (assuming the warrior is the MT) then that's fine. With the current state of things that is not happening.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">The only problem I see with yet another MGB heal for Pallies is it isn't unique.  It's overdone.  There are several classes that can already do it.  The reason I brought up MoK is because I think it's one of the most underdeveloped and more unique spells in the game.  I think it would be a very good addition to Pallies, particularly since it is a combat enhancing spell.  I like to see unique skills/spells.  It allows for more creativity with strategies and more room to expand characters that should be verstile.  As for single-target and self emergency heals, I don't really think these would make Pallies preferred over Warriors against the type of melee DPS I've heard described.  With discs and mitigation bonuses, Warriors would still have a more comfortable margin of error.  I think that skillful use of these types of heals would allow Paladins to handle the heavy DPS without relying on luck so much, though.  The drawback is that if it is given to Pallies too easily (early) it can gimp alot of older content.<br />

Having never done GoD myself, I'm not well equipped to respond to that, but I'm never against classes getting improved in thier own forte, just so long as they don't become overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a flawed assumption and you know damn well it is. Under no circumstance can you tell me you failed because you weren't a paladin. You're so USED to the fact that your abilities have no interruptable factors involved that you use that same premise for spells. It's wrong,  flawed, and beyond the scope of comparison on a 1 to 1 basis. It also leaves the door wide open to how many times the paladin COULD have died due to the fact that he has lower dmg mitigation then you do.<br />
<br />
As for paladins succeeding. You just admitted to completing 3 out of 4. I'd say warriors are succeeding also. <br />
<br />
Or are you implying that because it can be done by a minority of paladins under no circumstance should a warrior ever fail.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you are unaware Warriors were discussing a stand down not too long ago over the need for a substantial Warrior advantage vs. boss mobs.

<br />
And the relevance in this? You threatened a stand down and got what you wanted. Hmmmm, wonder if paladins have a standown will they get what they want. <br />
<br />
There's a CLEAR fact here that you just REFUSE to accept. Prior ANY change in the game, your role as SUPERIOR class vs hard hitting mobs was NOT in jeopardy UNTIL said mobs were being FARMED month after the encounters had been beaten to death.<br />
<br />
Last I read one of your biggest bitches was your inability to find a spot in  XP groups. I wonder, you're always saying there's room for both paladins and warriors in groups, why didn't you just assume your second role of melee.<br />

You wanna be anal about it. Fine.<br />

<br />
I agree it's overdone. Unfortunately it seems to be the only way SoE is willing  to adjust paladin. <br />
<br />
In regards to group/raid oriented spells we have the BSS line and heals. Nothing else. Sure it would be nice to have 1 or 2 unique lines, most paladins would even take it at the loss of the cleric buff lines, but as I mentionned with the new berserker class who seem to be geared to be doing exactly that, I have trouble seeing SoE doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
**** Someone turn on the Bat Signal!! Joker's on the loose and running wild! ****<br />

The wildest claim is that since Warriors got Provoke to fix aggro problems in PoP, Paladins should get Defensive or Warriors should lose it since Paladins lost their role as Aggro Tanks. When told OK, Warriors will give up Incite they say that's not fair, you don't need Incite because of PoTime (PoP) equipment!!! lol You didn't need it so we should get your defining ability hehehehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">I couldn't really care less for Pallies who want to be Warriors with spellbooks.  It was suggested that the Pally spellbook is lacking and Pallies do not always have a role to play.  I'm simply suggesting ways that Pallies could have more unique and creative roles to play.  Pallies who want to be Warriors aren't being realistic and generally aren't worth bothering to argue with.  Hybrids are intended to be extremely flexible while never really being the best in any one area.  SKs are IMO the most well-done hybrid.  Thier parent class doesn't decrease thier effectiveness at all.  Most of thier spells are geared specifically toward combat (i.e. fast casting melee enhancement spells).  I think Pally spells should move more toward the same.  I can see the point that Pallies are hurting for a secondary role in groups (particularly against non-rootable, non-stunnable, non-AE mobs).  Adding and enhancing just a few spell lines would increase thier desirability in the secondary tank role.  Look at it this way.  SKs are geared towards increasing the offensive (DPS) abilities of the group.  Paladins, being their nemesis, should be geared towards enhancing the survivability of the group.  To some extent, they are, but not nearly to the extent that the SK is.  Group spells such as group Yaulp (increase mana regen, ATK) and an Improved MoK line would accomplish this.  I'm not saying those spells in particular, I'm not a game designer or anything.  But I don't think it would be wrong to see Pallies getting new spells like those.<br />
<br />
For the Pallies who want to take Defensive and remove the mitigation gap, I say STFU.  This is the Warriors role.  This is where we shine.  If you want to improve your class, it should be in a way that allows you to bring something different to the table.  Removing the advantages from another class is not the answer.<br />
<br />
As for the Berserker class, I can't comment.  I haven't seen what they can do.  IMO it is a mistake to bring another class into the already crowded playing field.  Near as I can tell they don't really bring anything unique to the game anyway.   At first glance, they just took alot from the other classes and threw it all together.  If they wanted to bring a new Hybrid to the table, how about a Mage/Warrior hybrid?  At least the formula for that is already there (see SK/Pally/Ranger classes).</div></div><hr />

Review what has been written by at least a half-dozen posters here and on PoN - yourself inculded.<br />
<br />
There is this belief that a Paladin should tank like a Warrior they should have spellbook and Warrior should have abilities. Since both would tank alike, Paladins would be Warriors with Spellbooks containing buffs, heals, Res, GRC, Root, stun etc., etc., etc. And the Warrior utilities would be....... Lessee, looks like Paladins are veritible gods and Warriors are scrubs - sounds nice.<br />
<br />
However regardless of the utilities, Warriors signed up to be &quot;....unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.&quot;<br />

I suggested this before and you poo poo'd me. Make a list of PoN posters that have said this. Make a list of PoN posters that have raised an objection after the fact when SoE made &quot;needed&quot; Phase 1 Melee Changes. Please don't say the word &quot;fair&quot; again.<br />
<br />
I leveled a Paladin to 50 with 190 days played and then discovered that I had indeed pressed the button that said I wanted to be the #2 Raid Tank Class but have a spellbook.<br />
<br />
Reconcidering, I made a Warrior because I wanted to MT hard hitting mobs. I leveled that Warrior from 1 to 65 with another 450 days played to get to the point of MTing the hardest hitting mobs in the game. Even then I made a Dwarf (no frontal stun immunity) Agnostic (no diety armor) Warrior - maybe I should petition for a race/diety change 'cause I didn't know.<br />
<br />
It didn't occur to me to just continue on and level my Paladin to 65 and then say (paraphasing) -<br />
<br />
It's not fair, I want to be on the All Star Team too. I don't care what the history of the game is. I don't care about the class descriptions. I didn't sign up to be a #2 Tank. I should be #1 too. I should tank like a Warrior with a Spellbook. Let Warriors have some kind of utility. If I don't get what I want I'll quit and so will others.<br />
<br />
Of course to be effective this should be followed up with -<br />

If SoE caves in and makes the Warrior+cleric y'all want you STILL won't be happy. Someone will be better equipped than you -<br />

It absolutely doesn't matter either way. In BOTH CASES beastlords still lose the use of more spells when a shaman is in a group than a pally when a cleric is in the group. Beastlords being the hybrid buffing master with many more buffs than a paladin could ever have, lose just about ALL of them at any and every level of the game with a shaman in the group.

I have to say, more and more I'm finding the entire Paladin community very disappointing.  <br />
<br />
I'm done with this discussion.  Paladins are calling the Warriors blind, yet it seems Paladins aren't even willing to discuss anything less than tanking like Warriors and taking our few unique abilites away.  I'm all for Paladin enhancement.  I feel that compared to SKs, they are somewhat weak on thier unique abilities (spells and /discs).  But if all Pallies are gonna do is ignore every suggestion except exactly what they want theres no point.  At least Warriors were open to suggestion from all sides of the problem.  Most of these Pallies can't see any further than thier own ego.<br />
<br />
My closing statement is the same as I've said many times before.  If the problem is with GoD, the solution is with GoD.  I see no problems pre-GoD with class balance.  That doesn't mean that there isn't room for improvement, it means overall the 3 tank classes are competitive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And my contention has always been that the tank classes were very balanced in PoP up to the point where they made the melee changes. The provoke line was required because paladins had a big edge in the aggro dept which made them prefered in xp situations. But that change it itself pretty much put us the closest to complete balance ever. The dmg mit with the GoD content (and I REALLY can't see how ANYONE can deny 1 is based for the other) is where the problems lie. <br />
<br />
BTW, in regards to changes in the class from other abilities and not by taking away from warriors. Please go back and reread the normal posts pre GoD and you'll see we've been trying that approach for eons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most players contend that in experiance groups Tanks are extremely balanced right now.<br />
The Warrior and Paladin raid roles are the same as they were before the melee changes.<br />
<br />
Well, what's different?<br />
<br />
Warriors are &quot;......unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.&quot; High DI values on mobs are the mechanism used to ensure that they are &quot;unmatched&quot;. The recent &quot;-1 DI&quot; Warrior mitigation change made a Warrior mitigation advantage vs. hard-hitting mobs always present, and not just when the more powerful Defensive discipline was used.<br />
<br />
Paladins can not handle high DI mobs as easily as Warriors. Nontheless, SoE put  high DI named mobs in single group trials in GoD. Paladins are succeeding vs. these mobs by using 2 healer groups and having some luck, but the mobs are difficult.<br />
<br />
Paladins have a legitimite complaint. These encounters specifically contained high DI mobs that players indicated in advance of GoD's release would be difficult for Knights. <br />
<br />
It is rumored SoE will be fixing this.<br />
<br />
Some Paladins claim this is not enough. They want to be able to tank anything a Warrior can tank in any venue (and still have a spellbook).<br />
<br />
Others claim:<br />
the tank classes were very balanced in PoP up to the point where they made the melee changes.<br />
In otherwords, they prefer a &quot;balance&quot; that almost all players and the game's publisher agree was not balanced. A &quot;balance&quot; that heavily favored Knights in ALL non-raid content. And because of their perception that SoE made unneed changes to Warriors, they believe Paladins should have their Tanking ability increased.<br />
<br />
It would be more honest to just admit they want to be Super Tanks. Many of these players have advocated making Paladins Warriors with Spellbooks on numerous ocassions. They do so at every opprotunity and given any excuse.<br />

Preach what you pray BB. You're telling ME I'm acting like a stump and you refuse the overall situation. 1 group. 6 ppl. NOT raid. PERIOD. <br />
<br />
Do you REALIZE that the ONLY reason this is being coined as a RAID, is that it's the ONLY leg to stand on warriors have for being the SUPREME class in them. PERIOD. <br />
<br />
I don't recall PoJ trials EVER being termed raids EVEN when warriors were a prefered until you had knights that could SURVIVE (meaning gear equivalence) the boss.<br />
<br />
The Warrior and Paladin raid roles are the same as they were before the melee changes.<br />
<br />
Really BB? And you've done raid (RAIDS not you imaginary 6group crap) in GoD? <br />

<br />
Again, this only leads to ask. If you HAD the advantage WHY did you need the upgrade? Oh yeah, the gap wasn't big enough. <br />
<br />
Of course, the fact that the new content is geared on PURE DI has NOTHING to do with it, and it leads to NO disperity between the classes. <br />
<br />
Paladins have a legitimite complaint. These encounters specifically contained high DI mobs that players indicated in advance of GoD's release would be difficult for Knights.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming none of these indications were from warriors seeing as you all refute that the adjustment to your class had anything to do with GoD.<br />
<br />
It is rumored SoE will be fixing this.<br />
<br />
Knowing SoE they'll screw the pooch and mess it for everybody. :)<br />
<br />
Some Paladins claim this is not enough. They want to be able to tank anything a Warrior can tank in any venue (and still have a spellbook).<br />

I'm only 1, stop referring to me as some. You told me on PoN you didn't want to argue the same topics on 2 boards. I've been telling you for 8 pages I don't want you putting the words of other paladins in my mouth in this thread.<br />

<br />
***Not pro for this just a question***<br />
<br />
It's ok for warriors to be favored for everything but not ok for another class to be favored for something? Oh wait, we're not talking about another class, it's specifically paladins.<br />
<br />
It would be more honest to just admit they want to be Super Tanks. Many of these players have advocated making Paladins Warriors with Spellbooks on numerous ocassions. They do so at every opprotunity and given any excuse.<br />
<br />
It would be more honest for warriors to say they don't want anyone else to be a tank and just give everyone spellbooks so they always have a spot in a group/raid.</div></div><hr />

 I've seen lower level SKs tank mobs using lifetaps and not need a heal the whole fight where I would need several CHs.  SKs don't mitigate as well as Warriors, but thier abilities make this a moot point most of the time.  <br />
<br />
Ummm.  What level where these SK's and what were they fighting?  I can do it now against old world mobs, but that is using Touch of Inny (400ish heal) and a ID4 item.  If it werent for the fact I have SCF3 and ToL2 I would spend alot more time clicking away at my Noci Bp.  I had a cleric once in LGuk ASSUME that I was going to tank and keep myself healed using a #@()%*#)! 45 hp lifetap!  The best lifetap SK's get pre mid 50's is the 49 quest spell.  280hp tap nice cast time, and a recast of about 8 minutes.  If I were to load my 3 best lifetaps and try to melee and self heal MOST exp mobs I would be FDing faster then you can say Incoming (if I wasnt dead already),<br />

The high DI mobs in single group trials will be changed because they are unfairly easier for Warriors to MT than others. If such a mob was in EJ, it would not be changed. If it was at the end of one trial, it might not be changed. It's being changed.<br />
<br />
Yes Taragor, I've been in a GoD raid. Have you? How many trials have you done?<br />
<br />
SoE saw fit to give Warriors a &quot;needed&quot; always present &quot;-1 DI&quot; mitigation change to widen a survivability gap that had narrowed to ~500HP's. Now if that upsets you, too bad.<br />
<br />
I in fact pointed out on PoN that a continued Add Tank/off tank role for Paladins depended on SoE not putting high DI adds in future content prior to the release of GoD.<br />
<br />
Taragor stated:<br />
It's ok for warriors to be favored for everything but not ok for another class to be favored for something? Oh wait, we're not talking about another class, it's specifically paladins.<br />
Warriors have a designed in, long established advantage against high DI mobs (Defensive) re-inforced by the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change that is consistant with our description as &quot;unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would suggest compared to Warriors, Paladins are favored as better -<br />
Healers<br />
Buffers<br />
Curse removers<br />
Rooter<br />
Stunners<br />
Ressers<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
while being equally desired in experiance groups and with an Add Tank/off tank/Combat Medic(which IMO needs work)/CC role on raids. They are also the prefered MT on those mobs were their abilities outwiegh the Warrior advantages vs. High DI mobs. Given they can MT anything in PoTime I believe they are generally capable of MTing in raids if less prefered vs. high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
Given all the things Paladins are favored for, I think a Warrior advantage at their specialized Tanking survivability characteristic is not unwarranted.<br />

Once again you're simply denying (or omitting) the fact that you HAD those advantages BEFORE the changes. You tell me that if I wasn't happy with the changes SoE made because the *GAP* in hp/ac between our 2 classes was PERCEIVED by warriors as being TOO small I should just suck it up, means you're just egotistical and want MORE MORE MORE.

<br />
The survivability gap was perceive by SoE as too narrow. Warriors brought it to their attention, they examined the issue, they changed it, and they specificly stated that this was a &quot;needed&quot; change.<br />
<br />
Paladins are not going to be better than Warriors at survivability or Clerics in healing. You combine lesser abilities in both sets of class abilities to produce a total package.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Taragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">BB: It's always a question of goading.<br />
<br />
I concede that I'm not in the end content of GoD where you are and, yes, it is difficult for me to argue those specific circumstances. The issue though is that these always start with a fundamental balance through the whole and not part. <br />
<br />
For instance, the mention that SOME paladins have achieved this makes it OK the way it is. Though changes have been made to the expansion that actually eliminates that possiblity in some cases.<br />
<br />
Elimination of chanter pet tanks for instance.<br />
<br />
You'll also note that I've never had issues pre-GoD post changes to melee because the small changes to your mitigation did not in any way shape or form alter the balance between our 2 classes. Warriors were the supreme tanks untill paladins were in the best gear but paladins had a very viable role as offtank.<br />
<br />
With the content of GoD being based on a paladins weakest area in their tanking abilities it does become an issue. Not because we want equality to you in the primary role of tanking, but because SoE created situations where gains are made that are unattainable by anything except warriors until a much later time, which leads to a greater disparity between our classes.<br />
<br />
It's your unwillingness to conceded that paladins should be a viable option as tank outside the box and your repeated assertion that it IS raid content even if based on a 1 group scheme that guiles me.The suggestions that have been made by both our classes have lead to no productive solution primarily due to the fact that SoE alone are the ones that can alter content and not the player base. If players had a direct impact on balancing issues I think you'd be pleasantly surprised that paladins would be looking for much better alternatives in their spellbook then their dominance in tanking.<br />
<br />
Now we discover that SoE IS making changes (though none seem to know exactly how) and warriors are not looking at it as a balancing decision (even though warriors have mentionned time and again that the environment needed adjusting), they're looking at it that they're being pushed asside and that paladins want their role.<br />
<br />
Which is it?</div></div><hr />

Stop being a putz Partha. In ALL those expansions I could gear up just as fast as a warrior could, therefore staying on a level playing field. Paladins didn't have to wait to be in PoTime gear to be able to act as offtanks in EP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">Let me be just a clear as possible, then I will drop it.<br />
<br />
Read the Warrior Class Description and the Paladin Class Description. We are not the same class.<br />
<br />
Mobs that are MT'd by a Warrior because of his superior survivability may right now be a thing of the past much beyond the trials. SoE can by encounter design determine who tanks what. Our differences make this possible.<br />
<br />
(I have encountered such a mob that can not be MT's by a single Warrior MT already in GoD).<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, Warriors are entitled to the &quot;unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paladins are entitled to &quot;fight toe to toe&quot; and cast spells.<br />
<br />
IMO if the average unnamed mob in GoD hit for 2000HP's, then we'd all need a mitigation adjustment (or better equipment). In such a case, named mobs should hit for 3000HP's and be tankable at first by Warriors by virtue of their &quot;unmatched ability to survive&quot; until such time as equipment allowed Paladins to bridge this initial advantage.<br />
<br />
There is no utility that I could be given short of a Paladin Spellbook that would induce me to continue playing a game where my choice to opt for Pure Class specialized superiority vs. hard hitting boss mobs instead of a spellbook was awarded to another class with a spellbook.<br />
<br />
The Warrior role vs. hard-hitting boss mobs is very long standing.<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to believe given the Warrior support for a stand down because of narrowed survivability (and a couple of other issues) many would in fact take their entertainment pp elsewhere and tearfully wave goodbye.<br />
<br />
While Paladins may not care or even the guilds that these Warriors belong to, I believe it would happen. Warriors do not want their long-standing specialization adavantage to be given to a hybrid. To my mind equally as valid as a Cleric asking CH not be given to Paladins.<br />
<br />

<br />
 Two points, which you've still never refuted.<br />
<br />
 1) Ikkinz is after PoTime, it's not in EP.<br />
<br />
 2) Raid level mobs that have been tanked by Paladins from a new expansion have not been tanked by Paladins until after passing with a Warrior and farming of the level after that for gear and upgrades. Now, you can still bitch about the idea of a 6 man raid, but Sony seems to think that's a viable idea, much like level capping Naggy/Vox or flagging requirements or keying or capping max raiders at 72 or 54 or 36 or.......6.<br />
<br />
 (PS Paladins have still tanked these, so you're still wrong)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Drathos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">I have come to learn that trying to talk logic to palladins the equivalant of trying to explain the theory of relativity to a 5 year old. I have come to understand the class more and more. It is not balance they want. It is to be the undisputed heavy weight tank. The only true fix to their problem will be for Sony to get rid of the two &quot;needless&quot; classess Warriors and Clerics. Why have parent classes? Give the Palladins all the abilities of clerics and warriors. Add in an endless mana bar and endless endurance for discs and they will finally be happy.  They will finally think maybe they might have utilty and purpose in a group. I mean the game is horrendously unbalanced as it is. I mean oh my god warriors got Incite and it is guaranteed snap aggro at a push of a button. Warriors never die becuase our new mitigation boost means we can solo the avatar of war now.......<br />
<br />
<br />
   Er wait sorry got carried away there let me get back to reality. Palladins want to be balanced or do they want to be overpowered while all the other classess are &quot;balanced&quot;. It is oaky in their mind that the premeire tank spot in group or raid should be their sole possession. I love hearing that warriors are wanted or can even perform in a DPS role.  I think the classess are as closed to balanced as they can be...well except for level 18 beastlords with their epics.... But let me try to explain a logical concept. I remember reading up and looking at the classess. I wanted to be a warrior because Sony said we were the tanking class. We were the undisputed best at it. So by the intent of the game if in all area that a knight is equal to a warrior tanking then the balance is skewed and the game is not working as intended.<br />
<br />
   See I won't pretend I want balance. I will state it like it is and was meant to be. Warriors were INTENDED to be the BEST TANKS in the game period. No ifs ands or buts. We are supposed to be ahead of the hybrids. Personally I think our mitigation should be even higher than it is.  Does this mean I think the knights should not be able to tank? Nope. I think they should be able to tank proficeintly and stand up to most mobs in the game and prefer comparably if a bit less effectively. See all these people point to our new abilites and say well you all got a spell book. You can use your discs more often. You are overpowered.  It ain't a spell book junior. You want to know what its like Cast your stun only once every 30 seconds, for a heal it would have a 10 minute refresh time and for your root, or lull it would have again a 10 minute refresh time. While we are at it you will not be able to get KEI, paragon, flowing thought or any kind of mana regen.....<br />
<br />
    As it stands now I know of exactly zero knights that have problems finding groups. They are still the prefered tank in most groups grinding out exp or ldon. Why you may ask? Its that spellbook they would have us believe is useless. The lull they secretly use when noone is looking so they can perpetuate the rumor that it doesn't work. The root they sneak in again when noone is looking.  Or against undead they sneak in their slay undead and pop hits for 1-5k and then say they can't do dps. I hesitate to throw all knights into the same bucket. I know more SKs that seem to be more intelligent players overall and understand to the difference between warriors and them. They understand that groups love them for their group heals, mana taps, harm touch and aggro mod on the warrior if one is there. I think the root of the whole argument is that palladins are players who rolled what they thought was the power toon just to find out they are unequivocally the best and their egos can't handle it.<br />
<br />
    I enjoy knowing their is still content that almost requires a warrior. I enjoy getting tells saying we need a Warrior to mt. It lets me know that the class I chose is needed. I chose to have no spells, no true solo ability, no save my own ass ability. I chose to not have anything to fall back on besides my armor and equipment. I chose to be group and gear dependent to be the UNRIVALED BEST tank in the game. And sadly it just ain't so except for 1% of the game and even with 99% of the content in the pallys realm they can't stop whining about unbalance. So Ill say it bluntly if you ain't happy, sell your gear, give me your plat as payment to listening to you whine about nonsense, turn your spellbooks into your guildmaster and roll a warrior. Otherwise STFU and learn to actually play your class becuase few things add so beneficially to a group or a raid as does a well played pally. Who realizes this game is built on groups and teams and they don't always have to be the star of the game.<br />

It's OK for warriors in MUCH lesser gear to be able to tank a 6 man RAID better than paladins in full PoTime gear. It's OK, because it's a RAID. <br />
<br />
That's BS and you know it. Incidently you HAVE said that the encounters needed adjustments NUMEROUS times and you sit there day in and day out telling me I don't have a fucking clue what I'm talking about, cause I'm not in PoTime and that the content is OK. DECIDE. It needed tuning or no? If it doesn't, WHY then did you at some time believe it needed it. Did you change your mind because a PALADIN tanked it? So it needed ADJUSTMENT because no warrior believed it was possible and BANG OMFG a f*cking paladin tanked it successfully, QUICK call out the dogs. <br />
<br />
<br />
IMO if the average unnamed mob in GoD hit for 2000HP's, then we'd all need a mitigation adjustment (or better equipment). In such a case, named mobs should hit for 3000HP's and be tankable at first by Warriors by virtue of their &quot;unmatched ability to survive&quot; until such time as equipment allowed Paladins to bridge this initial advantage.<br />
<br />
What's the magic hit number? As long as it's low enough a warrior can offtank it off the bat it's TUNED properly and paladins can take over after the guilds farmed the content for a while? (Talking trash here not named)<br />
<br />
Forget Ikk, forget Kod'taz I can't even tank the first trial, you know, the one where you START. Warriors on the other hand in my guild CAN tank the first. second. maybe 3rd (not sure) but ME, because I'm a paladin I can't even do the lowest. Yeah. that's what I call class balance. <br />
<br />
But WAIT, that's in a tanking role and that's your domain. Well, what else will I do. You can spin my spellbook and my horse as much as you want it WON'T get me into a group as a secondary class. <br />
<br />
<br />
While Paladins may not care or even the guilds that these Warriors belong to, I believe it would happen. Warriors do not want their long-standing specialization adavantage to be given to a hybrid. To my mind equally as valid as a Cleric asking CH not be given to Paladins.<br />
<br />
This is the biggest bunch of BS I've ever seen. Like any warrior has EVER given a shit for anyone else apart themselves. Well maybe clerics and chanters since they heal and haste them and can't tank.<br />

He still hasnt answered my question =\ damn pallys.<br />
<br />
Question? Last question I see from you was to Goradain. Am I missing a reply?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u187"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p187">Taragor,<br />
<br />
Trial:<br />
The first 4 trails are not mandatory. A guild raid gets you those flags. These are make-up tests for those people whose guilds don't want to redo the raid. As such, those that don't do the raid can be dragged though in special groups.<br />
<br />
Any Warriors that might be successful in completeing some one-group trials before your guild is flagged? Well they frankly aren't going very far - the trials lead to raid content.<br />
<br />
You are disturbed because Warriors in lesser gear might be able to do the trials and you can't? Can a Cleric in bazaar gear do them? You bet.<br />
<br />
Did you know there were alternate methods into several PoP zones that could be done by a group too?<br />
<br />
Experiance Group:<br />
Warriors do not use Defensive to kill experiance mobs. In an experiance group that's what you are after - killing mobs and getting experiance. If your experiance group inadventantly pops the Monsterous Mudwalker should you be able to kill it? No, because it's a:<br />
<br />
Named Mob:<br />
Might be dangerous. Might not be prudent to try to kill it. You or your party might not be able to kill it. There might be rules (sorry, Vox under level 53 please) (sorry, Quarm 72 people or less please) (named in Fire Trial PoTime sorry, 18 people please) (named in PoJ trials 6 people please). You are not guaranteed to be able to kill a named.<br />
<br />
Should they fix those 6 person mobs? Sure since it's begining GoD content I think Druids ought to be have a fair shot at the loot. They ought to be able to function in their primary role - main healer. But that doesn't mean they should be made to heal like a Cleric. Or their secondary role, that doesn't mean they should heal like a Cleric (Clerics can be 2nd healers too). Or tertiary role nuker, but that doesn't mean they should nuke like a Wizard.<br />
<br />
Yes, Paladins and Shadow Knights too.<br />

<br />
 Well, you said Paladins didn't need to farm PoT to tank EP. Well, GoD &gt; EP, so you do. Anyways, maybe you didn't need to farm PoT, but you damn sure needed to farm EP to have a shot at tanking named, which is what the trials boils down to for 99% of the Paladin complainers who have posted, both here and at PoN.<br />
<br />
 Secondly, you yourself have just admitted the problem. The first 3 trials represent a step in your guild's progression. Warriors in the guild, by virtue of Defensive and Defensive alone I'd guess, are able to tank them. Paladins cannot yet. Of course, your Paladins aren't geared from those trials yet, either. I'm betting they're not highly Time geared, either.<br />
<br />
 So where exactly is the problem that Warriors are tanking the boss mobs at the limits of your progression? We've done that EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION SINCE /DEFENSIVE WAS IMPLEMENTED.<br />
Your guild will progress, will farm these things, will gear up for the later stages, and guild Paladins will be able to tank these named that are a stumbling block right now. It just takes time.<br />
<br />
 Now, if you want to argue that your guild won't run people through gearing up for progression, then I'll argue that your guild will fold as soon as all the other classes get tired of the attitude, quit, and smear the guild's rep all over the server for not gearing up ALL the guildmembers who attend. It's a pisspoor guildie who won't shepherd a fellow guildie through a trial for a flag/key/whatever.</div></div><hr />

I am not saying this to be rude. I know what your equipment is like. That's why you are getting creamed. A Cleric can get by with some pretty inferior equipment just as easily as a Warrior.<br />

  And to help you the answer is NO---Why, because I am not a tank. And your class is a generalist class, they do not specilize in anything. The moment you got handed spells from my spell book is the same moment you lost the ability to be equal to a warrior when  it comes to tanking. Thus LIKE it LOVE it and learn to LIVE with it, that is the way EQ has been since the begining. At absoulty no time since the original beta has a pally been able to take abuse better than a warrior.

<br />
As a small point of fact: I still have an agro advantage in the eyes of many.  It sure as heck isn't getting me into trial groups.  In fact I don't want agro in many group configurations.  Are you guys still going to clobber me over the head with this?<br />
<br />
Balance should evolve with the game.  Since the game is not static what defines balances has to change too.  If Discord is going to be defined by many six player runs and some classes aren't performing well in these things then that is a problem reguardless how &quot;pretty&quot; they were sitting in the past.<br />
<br />
One last thing: I've always said that any class that is assigned a role should have all of the tools necessary to achieve it or they should stop trying.  It has nothing to do with whether Paladins are equal tanks to Warriors.  Either Paladins can tank or they should stop.  Dancing around this saying that Paladins can't ever be equal to Warriors is silly especially when Paladins and Shadowknights are supposed to tank.  <br />
<br />
These trials should be tweaked to give Paladins and SKs a reasonable shot at succeeding as tanks in these things or we should get SOE to remove these half broken skills from these classes.</div></div><hr />

SoE made two (2) &quot;needed&quot; changes. They gave Warriors adequate aggro control. They restored to Warriors the &quot;.....unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; with the &quot;-1DI&quot; change.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean Paladins can't tank named high DI mobs. It does mean that insted of buying this ability from a spell vendor they have to gear up. They might even need more support to be able to do it.<br />
<br />
The days of Paladins being Warriors with Spellbooks are over. Using differences between classes to create additional roles like Add Tank/off tank/Combat Medic is much more sensible and consistant with LOOOONG established expectations and Class Descriptions.<br />
....remove these half broken skills from these classes.<br />
Too shy to come right out and say you want Defensive nerfed so there is less of a difference between Warriors and Paladins when fighting the &quot;most brutal battles&quot;? You weren't shy on PoN. On the day that happens, the Paladin spell book must be removed from the game.<br />
<br />
Give it up. Your aim to make Paladins the Premier Tank in the game with powerful clerical spells while Warriors attempt their Stinging Blow Discipline isn't going to fly with Warriors or with SoE.<br />
<br />
The game may change and evolve, but our basic Class differences should not. Read the Warrior and Paladin Class Descriptions - they should be as true a year from now as they were 3 years ago.<br />

Guess what!? That is all the tanking warriors get to do 95% of the time.  The other 5% (hell it's probably less) of the time you are propped up in front of some almighty ass-raper.  And guilds have shown YOU can even do this on PoTime mobs!!  What you really are saying is...&quot;we go toe to toe with a mob 95% of the time..i'm a stupid fuck for complaining about nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I 've recently played a druid up to level 63.  Guess what I've seen?  A paladin with 5.9k buffed HP's just as easy to heal as a 9k warrior (me).  I even had rounds where I never tossed a single heal on him (this is in BoT groups) because he kept the damn thing stunned the entire fight.<br />
<br />
Fact=Paladins get defensive in GROUP SITUATIONS...it's called their stuns...and I'd be happy to run a test anytime to verify this.  Stick a warrior under defensive and Paladin with a decent mana pool and gear side by side I'll bet if anyone shows to be the better tank it will be the Paladin.<br />
<br />
You coem to these boards whining about inability to tank a tiny sliver of content.  Content that is meant to challenge guilds that have been farming Time for almost a year and you expect us to really take you seriously?<br />
<br />
Read soem other threads, or read this one.  You don't NEED this content to progress.  Hybrids can tank this with appropriate gear/skill.  Stop calling for game wide changes because of this one little pissy thing.<br />
<br />
Hybrids tank.  They offtank, they are preffered in LDoN hards for stuns (splitting mobs reducing damage).  They tank special raid encounters (Tallon Zek comes to mind).  They do shit with half the gear a warrior needs.  The only time this is reversed is when.. <br />
<br />
A) mob is immune to stun (tiny sliver of total game content: Read a few GoD trials)<br />
<br />
B) Raid level mobs where again stun immunity is a factor (no &quot;knight defensive&quot;), and the sheer amount of DPS put out makes a warrior preffered.  And even raid level mob tanking CAN BE achieved by a hybrid with the proper amount of farmed gear.<br />

My RL brother.  64 (now) SK.  CoD Entrance mobs (non-greaters).  I was playing a 65 Shammie and 65 Warrior.  Puller screwed up and pulled 2 and my Shammie Computer crashed.  My brother off-tanked 1 while we killed the other.  He did not need a heal the whole fight (without using discs).  He was using the BoT tower SK weapon.  Both mobs were unslowed.  He has just over 7kHP buffed and CA/CS1.  I have close to 8300HP buffed and CA/CS1.  He was OOM by the end of the fight, but still at 40% life.  I had to be C-Healed 3 times.  I often bring our lower level (55-63) level guild member to CoD entrance to help grind them up (along with my Alts 62 Druid and 63 Cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I am aware of the sidequests to gain access to some of the PoP zones. <br />
<br />
The difference between the 2 BB is that doing those sidequests do not grant you access to gear beyond your level. This is the case with the trials in GoD. It's not even a question of equality. A VT geared warrior in a VT lvl guild can do trials that an EP paladin cannot. Now this in itself is not even the issue. The issue is that just like you are protective of having players gain equipment way beyond the lvl of their guild, so am I.<br />
<br />
Yes you have every right to believe that everyone should put in the month and month of effort to go through PoTime, I agree with that, I understand that. But I want players to have to put the month and month of effort it took me to gain access to the elemental planes. <br />
<br />
The extra kicker to myself and other players in my situation is that not only can those VT players do something I cannot (and once again not strickly from a tanking point of view, secondary role would make me just as happy) by doing so they are passing me in gear quality in leaps and bounds. Because the loot in the first few trials are almost equal in quality to PoTime which surpasses EP quality gear enormously. (relatively speaking)<br />
<br />
Experiance Group:<br />
Warriors do not use Defensive to kill experiance mobs. In an experiance group that's what you are after - killing mobs and getting experiance. If your experiance group inadventantly pops the Monsterous Mudwalker should you be able to kill it? No, because it's a:<br />
<br />
It's not just the experience, it's the player gear progression that's really the issue. For instance, I'll XP in PoE over Sol Ro any day because the XP in PoE is better even though I stand to gain loot from mobs in Sol Ro (ornate molds) Why? because I have access to better gear upgrades in EP, I have no interest in it. For xp I want the maximum I can gain which is in EP.<br />

The only counterargument to that is that paladins don't have a realistic secondary role in a 6 man group.<br />
<br />
Posted by Partha<br />
Of course, your Paladins aren't geared from those trials yet, either. I'm betting they're not highly Time geared, either.<br />
<br />
Assume the acceptance of having to be geared in that content to be able to tank it (or once again have a viable shot at a secondary role). How do I get geared in that content if I cannot do it?<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to argue that your guild won't run people through gearing up for progression, then I'll argue that your guild will fold as soon as all the other classes get tired of the attitude, quit, and smear the guild's rep all over the server for not gearing up ALL the guildmembers who attend. It's a pisspoor guildie who won't shepherd a fellow guildie through a trial for a flag/key/whatever.<br />

There's never been a precedence in the history of the game where an event limited to 6 ppl was farmed to gear up a guild. Had EP / PoTime been setup like that I think Quarm would still be alive :)<br />

Never in the history of EQ have knights been a third wheel to the extent we are now in trials except kunark. (NO I'm an NOT crying Kunark please keep reading :) )<br />

Once again, it boils down to desirability of a class in the situation. <br />
<br />
Tier 1-3 PoP:<br />
<br />
Who tanked the bosses in raid situations? Warriors<br />
<br />
Elemental Planes:<br />
<br />
Who tanked the bosses in raid situations? Warriors<br />
<br />
PoTime:<br />
<br />
Who tanked the bosses in raid situations? Warriors<br />
<br />
Now in all those instances paladins served a purpose specifically due to the fact they are greater than 1 group. This meant you needed multiple classes to do the content and though warriors by their right tanked the named, paladins contributed to the advancement of their guilds on an equal footing. Not as MT but as a secondary viable role.<br />
<br />
A 6 man environment that is used for xp/gear where paladins are not viable for either of their roles is attune to LDoN where warriors were not getting groups because of aggro issues. Why? because as a secondary role (DPS) they were surpassed by other classes thus limiting their usefulness. Same applies to paladins in the GoD trials.<br />

I still don't see this BB. You HAD the advantage before the changes in unmatched survivability, only once content was farmed for month did knights become capable of doing what warriors were doing from the get go. The only way I can see where you needed an increase in that survivability was to make it impossible for paladins to EVER be able to do what you do. And honestly, that just isn't acceptable given time. Unless SoE is willing to make the changes where no other class is capable of offtanking or xp tanking except for all 3 plate classes.<br />

The difference between the 2 BB is that doing those sidequests do not grant you access to gear beyond your level. This is the case with the trials in GoD. It's not even a question of equality. A VT geared warrior in a VT lvl guild can do trials that an EP paladin cannot. Now this in itself is not even the issue. The issue is that just like you are protective of having players gain equipment way beyond the lvl of their guild, so am I.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Again, why does Taragor keep talking about VT gear like it's some kind of pre-elemental crap? Guess what? A VT geared warrior probably has better gear than an EP paladin. If he doesn't, he sure isn't giving up much.</div></div><hr />

 You say that like you are unable to tank even the trash mobs in the trials. No offense, but I can't tank any of them. Should they be retuned for me? No. In order TO tank them (if I ever do), I'm going to have to invest a good deal of time in upgrading my character, both in AA's and gear. Unfortunately for you, you're in the same boat. As to how you get geared to do that content?<br />
<br />
 If you are able to tank the trash mobs, you would serve as a viable selection for a group as a second rezzer (pointed out to be a huge advantage), a downtime healer, ghetto CC, offtank, the list goes on and has been suggested. Now, I know exactly what you're going to say next:<br />

 Wait one.<br />
<br />
 First you talk about not being able to tank the named. That's a function of Warrior superiority with raid content, and not a valid bitch.<br />
<br />
 Then you switch the talk to not being able to tank the content at all, named or trash. That's a function of yours and your guild's progression, and not a valid bitch either UNLESS your crew was one of the ones who has farmed Quarm a ridiculous number of times and couldn't do it at all.<br />
<br />
 Then you switch the talk to the fact that gear drops there to upgrade you, and you can't get in on it because of a lack of group spots. When I point out to you that a proper guild is GONNA gimp classes through and gear up the ones they carry, now you're gonna say that's ludicrous?<br />
<br />
 It's a group of raid level named mobs that provides raid level content. Paladins don't tank raid level named's in the first month of an expansion. Paladins don't tank raid level named's until they've passed that bottleneck and started getting gear from past the bottleneck. They certainly don't come up to it in that first month and tank it as well as a Warrior in /defensive.<br />
<br />
 If your bitch is that you're not the star of the show, then I'm sorry. Knights aren't thoroughbreds. They are the dray horse. They aren't the fastest out of the gate, but they are perfectly viable and are much steadier to work with for everyday stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">Battleblade you dont see the problem. You simple dont see the problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is damm easy. We have 16 classes and only 6 groupespots. Real balance is when all 16 classes have a arround 1/4 chance to get in. That is the perfect balance in everquest with 16 classes and 6 spots. Nothing else. No warrior bullshit. No knight bullshit. No cleric balance bullshit. Real balance is when every class has a 1/4 chance to get in a groupe. I hope we all agree with this if not. It dont make sense to talk about balance.<br />
<br />
The GoD situation is way worser then you want let it look. It is not only the trials which make problems. It are 90% of the GoD nameds. Noone go to GoD for exp. You go there for aguments, progress and items and they drop in most case from nameds which only warrior can tank.<br />
<br />
So in GoD the 1/4 balance is total and without a question total broken. The moment you can only take 1 class to make something in a groupe the event is not balanced. You can call it raid, guild progress what you want. It is a damm groupe and so it should be a 1/4 chance for every class to make this. If this is not the case and everyone with a brain will agree that this isnt the case in GoD it is broken. It is that simple. Every class need to share his spot with other classes for EVERY single groupe encounter or the encounter is broken.<br />
<br />
There are many way to fix this problem. But in the end it is that warriors have to share there spot with other classes that this events are balanced because they made the decision that it is a single groupe encounter and we have more then 6 classes so every class has to share his spot with others. If this are for raids where morethen 6 can go it is no problem when only warrior can tank because the other dont get excluded. But the moment only 6 can join it is a single groupe and so the 1/4 rule have to fit or it isnt balanced.<br />
<br />
The simple question is this. <br />
Do you agree that there should be a 1/4 chance for every class to get a groupe in every single groupe encounter? <br />
No = you dont want balance.<br />
<br />
Do you agree that warriors have to share there tanking slot with other classes and other class have to be able to tank aslong it is only a simple groupe encounter?<br />
No = you dont want balance.<br />
<br />
Do you agree that warrior are the only one which can tank nameds in GoD save?<br />
No = you are not realstic.<br />
<br />
If you agree with this 3 question you have to agree with it that GoD is broken. If you dont agree you are ether not interested in balance or you are not a realist.<br />

NO&lt; Warriors don't agree, Knights are secondary tanks, until a Knight has ALL the loot from the expansion, they can NOT tank the RAID content.  You are the one that doesn't get it. <br />
16 classes 4 slots, NOPE, not with as Warrior tanking in a GROUP. We are WAY more dependant on having a Cleric than Knights. Get this, 50% of my groups have druids as main healers, and it is HARD as hell everytime! SKs have spells to feed the group mana/hps. Paladins can back up heal, esp bump everyone up to max hps after the battle. Paladins can pacify pull, SKs can FD pull, Warriors can train their group! <br />
You want your RAID content fixed, well fix warrior UTILITY in groups then so the classes are BALANCED. To fix Knights in Raids so they can tank as well as Warriors, SCREWS Warriors (which you don't play) by leaving us STILL not as useful in a group. We live on raids, or we suck, plain and simple!<br />
Any Knight saying a warrior brings just as much to a GROUP, is a LIAR, plain and simple. Plus, at least Alan plays a Paladin at SOE, NO DEV PLAYS A WARRIOR, thats why they don't care.<br />
That means, you want your tanking improved, Warriors want a Pacify type ability, and healing ability added so they can function better in groups!<br />
Paladin=3rd best healer+pacify+stuns+2nd best tank (tied)<br />
SK=Life taps+pet+FD pull+2nd best tank(tied)+best DPS of tanks<br />
Warrior=1st tank+2nd best DPS........nothing else!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u206"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p206">You dont unterstand it.<br />
<br />
We have 16 classes. In a perfect system every class is special and we have 16 slots in the groupe. Everquest isnt perfect and so you need to share your spot. The moment it is limited to a groupe and only 6 classes can join you need to make that the spots get shared or the balance dont exist. It is that simple. The moment one class have a 100% need it mean that the other 15 classes have to fight for the last 5 spots which give them a lower chance. If another class is needed it make that 14 classes fight for 4 spots. If another class is needed or from one class to it is that 13 classes fight for the 3 last slots etc. As more classes are fix needed for GoD groups as worser the situation get.<br />
<br />
If this is perfect balanced a warrior should be able to make it with a druid/shaman as healer. A knight will need a cleric to heal. So Mainhealers can go with any tanks. Maintank can go with anyhealer. 2. tanks have to need a cleric. 2. healers have to need a warrior to be able to make it.<br />
<br />
Yes a groupe with cleric/warrior have it to easy then berhaps. But it is way better to have something to easy for 5% of the players then when you exclude 60% of the players from it because they cant make the 'needed groupe'.<br />
<br />
Btw. everyone which say knights are the prevered tank for 99% of the players out of GoD is an idiot. 99% of the players out there dont need a tank for the things they do and this hit warrior and knights the same way. Special players which have time gear. Every class can tank out of GoD. There are only more or less effectiv at it. Rangers, Beastlords, Monks, Roques etc. all this classes can tank and i know many which like to take dps classes bevor real tanks simple because they can make more dps and more dps = You are more effectiv at the end aslong you can keep the one which got it alive. The most effectiv way to make exp is simple to take 1 snare kitter and 5 dps classes and kite mobs arround. <br />

Time equiped people I don't see as special, but EQ addicts. 99% of the people don't even have access to the Plane! All the classes can NOT tank in an adventure when ZERO players have PoT equipment, or Elemental. Thats what these &quot;special&quot; people don't get, you mess up Tank balance at your end, it trickles down to destroy EQ at the REAL end. The 99% without ANY Elemental gear or esp Time gear! We don't feel sorry for the PoT people, you are pretty much disliked by the 99%. You just have WAY to much time on your hands to play EQ.<br />
Paladins and Sk bring WAY more to a group than a warrior, no we aren't lying, and you aren't lying. But your perspective is WRONG, because you are one who can dedicate way to much time to a GAME! It is DIFFERENT when you have ZERO pieces of Elemental or Time equipment. Thats what you don't see.<br />

I can name probably 10 rare named spawns in Kod taz alone that are clones of trash mobs (some blue cons) that all share a loot table for 15 or so augments.<br />

The moment you can only take 1 class to make something in a groupe the event is not balanced. You can call it raid, guild progress what you want. It is a damm groupe and so it should be a 1/4 chance for every class to make this. <br />
<br />
There is no sign in Ikkinz that says no paladins allowed, you can make a group with a paladin in it and win , what the hell.... you cant win it without a cleric either! So what you SHOULD be saying is that the moment you take TWO classes to make a group is unbalanced...which is BS anyways. I dont see druids up in arms  over that. So you dont tank the named (or do after the war dies , happens alot)? Big fucking deal.  Everquest has alot more to offer than a couple named in Ikkinz, okay, yes the heartstriker in tipt has some DPS but hes slowable, doesnt count in my book.  Also if you cant tank the god trash then take that as a sign your not ready for it yet.  (with the exception of yellow con Kyvs, those will kill anyone in 3 seconds)<br />
<br />
Onto my next counter-bitch<br />
<br />
This is where noone can see eye to eye, I was reading over an the PoN forum, and I saw a ton of people refering to Ikkinz as an &quot;exp group&quot;.  Now when I think Ikkinz, exp group doesnt come to mind, its not just a &quot;damn group&quot; like you seem to think, it is a very challenging !!TEST!! If exp is what your after you need to look elsewhere, I know I do.  As for the sake of just being able to complete it, I have failed the first one many many many times, countless hours spent reclearing respawn to die again and again, and my point that im not doing a very good job of making is that , warriors dont have it as well off as you seem to think..... we are at the mercy of those around us, the clerics (dru, shm etc..) make or break the deal.<br />
<br />
WITH THAT SAID.<br />
<br />
I LOVE having paladins in my groups, they are probably the class I pick first when making a group, because they make a good team, they all seem to be playing the piss poor DPS card for this humongous bitch fest but its not true, any paladin with time weapons does exceptional dps with the right AA. (Hello SU, WRU?) I've also had my ass and my clerics ass saved by well placed paladin heals, *WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE*, they are heals for the right moments, you do not have a useless spellbook, your heals are not meant to keep ANYONE up against a creature with such ferocity indefinatly. I could name 50 other things that I love about pals but thats not what im posting here for.   My main focus is that people have roles in any group no matter what the situation, there is no fucking PALADIN MT OR NO PAL AT ALL groups like you say.<br />

You've completely dodged the Issue.  This isn't about Defensive.  It's about you whinning.  I'll repeat.  hybrids can tank xp groups.  They can tank raid mobs.  They can offtank.  They can tank ANY GoD trials- this has been proven.  YOU have a spellbook, and utility, if occasionnaly you come up agaisnt an encounter where you don't tank as well as a PURE warrior consider it tradeoff for the previous mentioned spells and utility.  You CAN do it.  You just need to try harder and get better gear.<br />
<br />
I'll ask you one more time.  where do Warriors get to tank ANY MORE than those times you mention above????<br />

If your answer is &quot;raids&quot; then STFU and DIEIRL because it has been proven you can tank raid level mobs as well.  If I was a mod here I'd ban you for dodging serious discussion.

I cant take you guys seriously. I think it is bullshit. The moment i have to wait that 3 'special' classes log in that i can do stuff is the moment i wait most of me time that this 3 classes log in and then i have to fight agaisnt 13 others that this 3 join me and 2 friends and not one of the other 13 which wait on this 3 classes. There simple dont exist enough warriors, clerics, enchanters to support a groupe for the 13 other classes. So they have to fix it in one or another way or they loose a lot of customers. I will do GoD and not the same bullshit i done the last year. I dont buy a new expansion to read on a message board about how warrior, clerics, enchanter and 3 lucky random classes have fun there. I can be one of the 3 luckys which have fun there but this dont solve the problem for the others which waiton the warriors/clerics/enchanters to have fun to in GoD.<br />

Instead, you opted for a snappy spellbook with a DIVERSE set of abilities.

<br />
Not our problem if you have MT envy -- EVEN THOUGH you can MT pretty much everything in the game anyway. Think of it this way: in what expansion have knights EVER tanked cutting edge content right out of the box? Why should it be different now?<br />
<br />
I guess the transition to not playing in God-mode is more painful for some knights than others.<br />

 You don't need to do trials to advance. If you do the trials to advance, the named mobs are raid type mobs. GoD is NOT LDoN. GoD is NOT Hard LDoN. GoD &gt;&gt;&gt; Hard LDoN. Even IF you decide to do these trials, these are NOT meant for pickup groups. The Ikkinz trials are Time-level GUILD advancement tests.

NO&lt; Warriors don't agree, Knights are secondary tanks, until a Knight has ALL the loot from the expansion, they can NOT tank the RAID content.  You are the one that doesn't get it. <br />
16 classes 4 slots, NOPE, not with as Warrior tanking in a GROUP. We are WAY more dependant on having a Cleric than Knights. Get this, 50% of my groups have druids as main healers, and it is HARD as hell everytime! SKs have spells to feed the group mana/hps. Paladins can back up heal, esp bump everyone up to max hps after the battle. Paladins can pacify pull, SKs can FD pull, Warriors can train their group! <br />
You want your RAID content fixed, well fix warrior UTILITY in groups then so the classes are BALANCED. To fix Knights in Raids so they can tank as well as Warriors, SCREWS Warriors (which you don't play) by leaving us STILL not as useful in a group. We live on raids, or we suck, plain and simple!<br />
Any Knight saying a warrior brings just as much to a GROUP, is a LIAR, plain and simple. Plus, at least Alan plays a Paladin at SOE, NO DEV PLAYS A WARRIOR, thats why they don't care.<br />
That means, you want your tanking improved, Warriors want a Pacify type ability, and healing ability added so they can function better in groups!<br />
Paladin=3rd best healer+pacify+stuns+2nd best tank (tied)<br />
SK=Life taps+pet+FD pull+2nd best tank(tied)+best DPS of tanks<br />
Warrior=1st tank+2nd best DPS........nothing else!  <br />
<br />
As a Paladin I have a few problems on wht you are saying here.  WE are TANKS that is wht we do.  Now can we tank raid encounters like Warriors?  Our Versitality helps out in many places and gives us many jobs to do in a raid.<br />
<br />
Now when it comes to XP groups we are Tanks just like Warriors.  While we still have many things we can do many other classes do it far better. The biggest thing we bring to a group is that we TANK that is what we do.   When you take this from us we sit at the LFG just like we did in Kunark.  Yes we have improved far beyond the Old Holy Trinity but when you NEED 1 class or another for said XP group it is not right.<br />
<br />
Now you say no developer plays a Warrior?  Every class through out the history of EQ when things are not going right for them says this.  Yes even knights during Kunark.  So this and $2.50 will get you a drink and a candybar. <br />
<br />
Now I don't think Paladins should be Tanking the Boss mobs.  A guild has the versitality that Warrior needs.  When something does not go as planned or in a group off someplace else you need Kinghts.  We both have our roles in raids and I am happy with mine.  I always have belived Warriors need some more versitality Cleris got some, so why not Warriors.  Good RL friend of mine used to play one and the two of us talked alot about what needed to be done.<br />
<br />
Now I havn't spent much time in GoD so I amnot going to respond to anything going on there.  I just have to listen to those that have been there there and experienced it.<br />

<br />
1) Paladins are the 2nd best tank, best group healer, 4th best direct healer, 2nd best HP buffer (in the absence of a Cleric)<br />
<br />
2) Shadowknight are a very close 3rd best tank (Paladins edge out SKs due to the fact that Paladins are more defensively oriented)<br />
<br />
3) Warriors are the specialist Tank class, and are 3rd to last for DPS (only Bards and Paladins have lower DPS). A ranger in melee will roughly equal our DPS (and surpass with a bow), while Monks, Rogues, Beastlords (with pet), Berzerkers, Shadowknights (with spells and pet), and all the pure caster classes all surpass warrior DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Such an ability can make a Paladin Warrior-like on ANY mob thus significantly reducing the Warrior advantage vs. high DI mobs when it is appropriate for us to have it.<br />
<br />
This would create a class that is a Warrior-like on the only ocassion it matters and a Paladin at all other times. A VERY sweet and unbalanced arrangement.<br />

That you talk from raids when you talk about a single groupe encounter. That are simple not raids. Aslong you talk from raids when you talk about single groupe encounters we will not find a way to solve this. I agree that with raids warriors need to keep there maintank role, but in groups knights need to be able to tank anything what warriors can tank. The moment you can add more then a groupe to this flags i agree with it is a raid and have no problem that only warrior can tank. Aslong this is not a raid and only a single groupe a knight need to be able to tank it.<br />
<br />
There 3 way to solve this.<br />
<br />
1.) Make it a raid and let more then 6 poeple join this.<br />
2.) Upgrade the healerclasses that one healer can keep a knight tanking alive for single groupe nameds.<br />
3.) Upgrade the knights that they can tank the nameds with the existing heals.<br />
<br />
This is not a raid. A raid is more then 6 persons or you can call Hard LDoN assisin missions raids. You can call everything which is limited to 6 persons a raid. <br />

Here's the rub.<br />
<br />
If knights are upgraded, it will further trivialized all group content from the past two expansions.  Additionally, it will make tanking raid-level names even easier for knights to do.  I see a lot of knights asking for upgrades without thinking about PoP and LDoN -- where they are already the preferred single-group tank.  Knights only think about GoD without looking at all the expansion content that people still use.<br />
<br />
If healers are upgraded, then we have the same problem of trivializing PoP and LDoN content.<br />
<br />
If the encounters are tuned down so knight can tank them, then they become trivial for warriors to tank them allowing more people to win these difficult encounters and get flags they shouldn't be able too.  Make no mistake -- these encounters are HARD for Defensive warriors which is needed to keep the masses out (those of us who are not Time+LDoN geared).  Adding a raid to these encounters just trivializes them and bypasses the gear requirement.  (18 people in VT/EP loot &gt; 6 People in Time+LDoN loot.)<br />
<br />
The only option SoE has is to keep GoD as it is.  Any changes to it now will either trivialized ALL previous content or open the door for sub-geared people to get Time+ loots.</div></div><hr />

You know what the problem some Paladins have when discussing this? They rolled a Druid and after years have passed they insist they should be a Cleric - actually, they want both.<br />
<br />
Paladins should NOT be Warriors with Spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Read our Class Descriptions. That's what we are and that's what you are. We are different classes. Warriors are unmatched in their survivability, Paladins can't match them.<br />
<br />
The same handful of Paladin make dozens of proposals:<br />
<br />
Remove Defensive from the game (but don't make Warriors &quot;-4 DI&quot; so their average mitigation stays the same and they just lose burst mitigation).<br />
<br />
Give Paladins Defensive. Hahahahahahahahhahahaha<br />
<br />
Drain Endurance - See remove Defensive above.<br />
<br />
Give (approximately, I couldn't focus on it - my eyes spun) Paladins 200AC, 3000HP's, 500ATK, 15 Shielding<br />
<br />
Improve healing to the point that greater Warrior survivability is meaningless.<br />
<br />
Tweaking a stun to get you though the GoD trials is unacceptable to some Paladins. Two versions of the trials is unacceptable. Nerfing the hard hitting mobs is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Many of you dress up the same goal repeatedly in different clothes thinking Warriors and SoE will be too stupid to realize you are saying - Warriors should not have an advantage vs. high DI mobs that has existed since Kunark. In your minds the 100% Tank should not be &quot;....unmatched in the ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot;<br />
<br />
I realize Paladins got used to God Mode - HP buffing better than a Cleric, a 100% heal, Plate/All equipment that provided you more value than a Warrior, Warriors squandering their DKP on Aggro Weapons AND DPS weapons, a narrowed Warrior HP advantage that frequently didn't even exist, MTing any mob in the game, having such superior aggro control that it was known thoughout the game, owning zones packed with undead for a few golden weeks in LDoN, Developers being shocked by the amount of hate generated for the mana on a resisted level 9 stun, etc., etc. etc.<br />
<br />
You've been the Golden-Haired Child for YEARS while Warriors have been the Red-Headed Stepchild.<br />
<br />
After great struggle in the face of this inbalance and Absor insisting classes weren't THAT far out of balnce Warriors had enough.<br />
<br />
SoE finally looked at the problem.<br />
<br />
Warriors got &quot;-1 DI&quot;, Provoke, and 500HPs for 60AA. And some of you are DETERMINED that not only these changes are undone, but that Warriors lose Defensive too!<br />
<br />
It's done. I have to believe your Patron at SoE is being watched. We will have balance and some of you will cry like babies on the way.<br />

Alot of that if not all also applies to Warriors.  Most Knights nevre have wanted to be as good as a Tank as Warriors we just want a chance to be a contributing member of a group.  Most of the time this means  we are the tank.<br />
<br />
Now if all Tanks were able to do thier job in PoP and LDoN but not in GoD.  Then the problem is with GoD.   If you fix GoD there ar batter ways then makeing Healers better or making Knights bigger or even toneing down the Trials.  You just make them different.

Have to disagree with you on that one.  Of course if you remember back in Kunark there were just 3 needed classes, Warriors, Clerics ,a nd Enchanters.   That ofcourse was the old Holy trinity becasuse only certain classes could do certain things.  With Warriors taht meant tanking while knights litterly sat at the zone for hours lfg. That was juat as wrong in Kunark as it was for Warriors during PoP.  Now if only Warriors can tank in GoD it is wrong again.  No one class should dominate a normal pick up group because they are a must to progress furtheror get xp.<br />

Thanks for listenign BB really means alot.  Now do I think Knights need a diferent version of defensive?  No, and any Paladin thta thinks we should is full of it.  All it would do is make lots of old content Trivial and make us nothing but Warriors.  If there is a problem it is not with the classes as much it is with Content.  1 expansion should not make a class not needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">A couple of points I would like to make:<br />
<br />
1) I had a main as a cleric.  I got bored of finding no groups, so I started a warrior because of the tag line &quot;best in combat&quot; from SoE.<br />
<br />
2) I started a warrior in 2001.  I hardly ever got groups.  I only managed 27 AA from 2001 to 12/2003.  I got berate/incite and have managed 73 AA from then till now.<br />
<br />
3) I often get voted to be DPS instead of MT in groups when a paladin (due to their spell books) and this has happened when I had 1k more HP and/or 300 more AC and/or higher level.  I didn't think it is fair, but nothing short of nerfing paladin tanking or giving warriors stuns will fix it.<br />
<br />
4) I have a close Paladin friend that is still (with buffs) 300 hp ahead of me.  He has completed GoD trials with this group: pal, wiz, wiz, clr, enc, *.  All 65 and 200 to 300 AA.  The * represents them taking ANYONE for loot.  He has little trouble and has maybe 1 or 2 elemental drops (and no time drops.)<br />
<br />
5) If I had know what I know now, I would have started a paladin.  Today, now paladins are more desired.  I don't have WA5, a BoW (from RZtw), a bloodfrenzy, sturdiness AA, or PoTime access.  If I had those things, maybe life would not suck so bad.<br />
<br />
6) I will never replace the paladin in #4 until I have many stun spells (along with other paladin skills.)  Defensive doesn't buy me anything in exp groups.  The wiz, clr, enc group of IRL friends in #4 has point blank told me they prefer to have the paladin tank regardless of how many more HP, AC, AA, etc I may have.  Well, presently he has me beaten by 300 HP, and I have him beaten by 150 or so AC.  I doubt they will change their minds when I am better (if I ever am.)<br />
<br />
7) If the whole world would rather have a paladin, why are seeing so many paladin complains?  I just honestly don't understand their problem.  If they believe they should have our defensive skill, what do they expect warriors to do?  Delete our characters and create a Paladin?<br />
<br />
8) Also, stun is still more than twice the raw hate of berate/incite.  And can be casted less than 10 seconds apart.  Incite is 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I dont want /sheild.  Give it to the whining Pally's.  I would rather SoE do something useful and not restrict all the spells/abilites to those that can get through the trails.  My play times restrict me ever going to GoD other then running around in Natimbi picking stuff off and maybe getting a few of those rare drops.  If SoE were to add a buyable no drop version of the spells/abilities I think more people would be happy about the spells.<br />
<br />
I dont want defensive either, but if they were to give knihgts something then I think Weaponsheild (or a lesser version of an auto PARRY disc) would be the best best.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to see classes unable to contribute in content their guilds are working their way though. I also don't want to see the Warrior characteristic of being better able to tank high DI mobs become meaningless.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to state that in their experiance Paladins are unable to contribute, that's fine. Explain where this is, why it's happening, and how it might be fixed. Then it might be discussed.<br />

IMO - In the case of the GoD trials, the high DI named mobs don't leave much room for Knights to contribute. The trials should be fixed.<br />

<br />
Naw, I don't want Defensive nerfed any more than I want Complete Healing nerfed.  However I've posted many times that these two things have done more to harm the game than anything else besides broken content (doors that don't work, NPCs that don't respond, etc.).<br />
<br />
Defensive is fine as a way to extent mitigation efficiency.  It becomes a problem when it becomes the only way to mitigate.<br />
<br />
As for Defensive, you'll find posts that I say I hate the idea.  If SOE does this it will be out of sheer laziness.  They are so bankrupt for ideas on how to make things challenging they create trials like this then I guess I shouldn't be so surprised when they can't come up with a good way to get out of it.  It will be a very sad day when SOE announces the only way to make Paladins work in Discord trials is to give them some sort of Defensive.  Bleh.  You guys can keep your albatross.

From my point of view the GoD trials are just a microcosm of the high end game.<br />
<br />
IMO Paladins shouldn't have DA. Weapon Shield would have made more sence.<br />
<br />
With WS the &quot;burst mitigation&quot; differnces between our classes close some but not a lot. Bump all Plate wearer's by &quot;-1 DI&quot; and there is the kind of clear difference between Knights and non-Plate wearers that there is between Warriors and Knights.<br />
<br />
With Paladins having WS and &quot;-1 DI&quot; fidling with stuns, stun immunity, and DI regulates who can tank what with superior equipment letting classes overlap toward the end of the expansion and on all trivial mobs.<br />
<br />
I guess what irrated me was the number of Paladins that concluded - Well if we tanked just like Warriors we wouldn't have any problems. IMO if SoE would provide you with some role identity and the tools to do it you wouldn't have problems either and the game would be better as a result.<br />
