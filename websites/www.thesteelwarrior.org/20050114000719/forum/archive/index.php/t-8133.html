<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judana</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, I have a 65 elemental shaman and I'm raising a warrior for 2-boxing. I've got him up to 56 and have what I feel is a solid but not spectacular setup for him.<br />
<br />
The warrior's magelo is here:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1069859<br />
<br />
I have about 100k to spend, though I'm looking for &quot;impact&quot; pieces, eking out a few HP/AC here and there isn't as important to me as making a significant difference in how Judok performs. I was told in the serverwide channel that the only real droppable upgrade for my weapons would be a BoC. I don't raid at all with the warrior so any non-duoable weapons are out of reach. Are there any upgrades that you feel I can duo? I also don't have LDoN or GoD on this account so augging/LDoN gear is not an option. <br />
<br />
Now that I've told you there's really nothing I can upgrade with, what can I upgrade with?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best buyable upgrade that has no lvl penalty is Helmet of Rallos Zek (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25209), it would really blow your toon.<br />
unfortunatly I don't remember easy upgrade for lvl 56 as sleeves/bracers/boots expect more FH but there is much better.<br />
just wait a bit more for more accurate answer.<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />
Yoda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judana</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I'm picking up pretty consistently from the other threads is that I'll be gimping myself rather heavily if I don't grind some LDoNs for a pair of anger3 augs. I dislike adventures on my shaman, obviously haven't done any as a warrior. Is it worth the cost of the expansion to go grind a couple of augs and then be done with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The anger augs are pretty fundamental to warrior class balance today.  Weapon Affinity AA from GoD is good too.  Warriors with non-raid-gear really need both of these crutches to do their jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svan</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">valorium rings, 2x bloodmetal, loyalist shield of honor, ornate pants, FH bracer, amy mask or FH mask, FH sleeves, FH boots are all in your price range. could also 1 group a shade rock amulet or something.</div></div><hr />
