    Well it seems to me the guild I am currently in is lacking some serious DPS. So what would you suggest as far as weapons go for pure dps. On a side note I am looking for a one hand slash and one hand blunt. hopefully in or around the 10 k price. <br />
 <br />
I have 2 handed covered, Windblade and Truncheon of Doom.<br />
I feel like my one handers are lackin.let me know what ya think and Once again Thank you.<br />

<br />
With that said the best 1hs weapon for under 10k would have to be a frostbringer.  1hb maybe guard captains mallet which you might be able to get 2 of for 10k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few things to keep in mind though, warriors aren't damage dealers.  Other melee classes WILL outdamage you.  I am not sure what your guild is trying to kill but the easiest DPS upgrade you could make is a better haste item IMO.  You will have a hard time though getting one for under 10k though.<br />
<br />
Eodin has some good advice.  The Frostbringer will last you a long time.  I used one until 63 when I finished my epic.  The GCM is another very good weapon for the money.<br />
<br />
Your weapons are certainly fine for your level.  I still do not have a Windblade at 63 and probably never will.  I can't justify spending 30k to upgrade from a 45/44 to a 50/44 2hs.</div></div><hr />
