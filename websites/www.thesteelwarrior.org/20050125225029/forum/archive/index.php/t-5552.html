<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I spent DKP on the Ornate Greaves mold that dropped on our Anival the Blade raid.<br />
<br />
I was wearing FH pants, given to me as a gift.  (I plan on passing them to another warrior in the guild tonight).<br />
<br />
I had been saving my DKP religiously for two months trying to land better weapons than what I have. After many weeks of bad drops on those raid targets or not hitting those targets anymore I finally gave in and decide to better some of my gear.<br />
<br />
The Ornate Pants are pretty nice, but should I have waited? Here is my thinking.<br />
<br />
I could have done LDON yes, and gotten the Greaves of Suffering. BUt I already upgraded my pathetic helm to the Helm of Suffering and still have to augment it 3 times.<br />
<br />
I just dont do enough LDON to get ANOTHER set of armor and then have to worry about augmenting it 3 times to match the stuff provided by the Ornate.<br />
<br />
I just raid and XP for AA too much to wait and get LDON groups together and only have about 3 hours a night. <br />
<br />
My current weapons are in magelo, its the standard CHoS and Sword of Bloodsworn combo (how long can that last?)<br />
<br />
Since I am MT in XP groups all the time I am just concerned about holding agro.  I was looking and waiting for months to upgrade to Spike Driver and Great Blade of Storms combo. Should I be concerned about my weapons Proc'ing and me losing that 5 DEX on my pants?<br />
<br />
What would you guys have done? (No I am not MT on raids. I am actually meaningless in a horde of warriors we have show up each raid so main tanking is not my goal OTHER than XP groups)<br />

<br />
5 DEX will not make the difference between you holding or not holding aggro.  <br />
<br />
PS - I'm looking at the exact same upgrade myself.  Hoping to see some Ornate Greaves soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you should have waited.  The greaves are a ridiculously small upgrade to FH to be spending DKP on.<br />
<br />
It is an upgrade for sure, but in a DKP system, you need to get the biggest upgrade you can for your points, and in my opinion, you didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would really depend on how many points he burned on them, which he didn't say.  That and how tired he is of having Cultural armor, which personally I'll take ANY upgrade to at this point.  Of course, actually finding an upgrade to it isn't that easy pre-elemental/VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That figures heh<br />
<br />
Oh well live and learn I guess<br />
<br />
We get 10 points per raid, and that was a 15 pointer for first time kill<br />
<br />
I blew 190 on them :(<br />
<br />
But from what I have seen and what mobs we hit, it would be a hella long time before anything like that rolled my way again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch, that is alot of points.  I think I would have passed ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I guess I am not an Ogre for nuthin then......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you made the right choice, you upgraded HP AC and resists and you're going to be able help someone else upgrade with your FH pants.<br />
<br />
Also both the weapons I know you are wanting you're still in the running for because one is WAR only and most people above you has it or is saving for something else, pretty much the same with GBoS. The points you spent can be made up in a week or two. The weapons you have are good for aggro in xp groups btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it was that bad of a choice.  The ornate greaves are actually really good.  Aside from the two pants you can get from Vex Thal, Umbracite Plate Greaves and Leggings of Fiery Might, there are no real viable raid alternatives other then ornate.  You have to admit, warriors get the fucking shaft on available legs (What we do get are great, but they're very few and far between).  Of course, you could consider Royal Attendant as well, but those take a lot of LDoN farming to acquire.  <br />
<br />
On the plus side, you now have better greaves and, if worse comes to work, you now have a stamina clicky in case you don't have a shaman in your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah so far the 3 pieces of Ornate I have aquired are really great for clickies even after I die<br />
<br />
I can do 300 hp shield of the arcane<br />
<br />
I can Haste myself<br />
<br />
and now I have Health<br />
<br />
Plus I have clicky boots for Str of Kunzar and a ring I got in Fear for a lame ATK buff clicky heh<br />
<br />
And I hardly ever group with a shaman really, so I guess I got that going for me</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I don't understand this.  You are sitting here with AC 40, 5 sta, 80hp pants.  There are only a handful of items which could be considered upgrades to this item for the low end raiding warrior and none of them are a HUGE upgrade.  Why the fuck would you bother?<br />
<br />
5ac and a few HP and some miscellanuous stats is NOT worth spending money, or DKP or whatever on for me.  Hell, if there were non RZ/Tribunal warriors in the guild, you would have been better off keeping the FH and giving the ornate out to them because THOSE are the people who are really fucked.<br />
<br />
If you can wear heraldic you should be happy as hell.  Look at the poor bastards that can't.  Why are you so eager to get rid of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a general rule in a DKP system, you should always upgrade the item that gives you the biggest upgrade. What I normally do is to rank the items I have against the items I have the potential of getting, then sort them by the amount of the upgrade. If you are really motivated you can do this with an Excel spreadsheet. Once I have everything ranked, I use that as a guide to what I bid on. I tend to only go for items that are a top 4 or 5 upgrade for me so I am always upgrading the item that needs it the most. You can get a lot more out of DKP this way and you are a lot less likely to upgrade the same slot in quick succession.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't say FH wasn't good Haass.  I just said I was tired of having them.  I've had FH for over a year now even as the rest of my guild has progressed through several sets of armor.  Elemental and VT are both a ways off for us.  I would not choose to upgrade my Greaves before several other slots, but if I could get them cheap (meaning nobody else was bidding), I would take them.  I don't know why it's such a big deal to you.  I wouldn't spend 190 points on them, but they are still an upgrade, even if a small one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, my wife created my warrior for me, and I didn't know any better, so my warrior is Agnostic.  I would be ecstatic to be able to wear fierce heraldic, because I could have afforded it, but instead I had to piecemeal my gear together.  I am looking forward to 55 and getting some ornate.  :)  I agree, save the ornate for the poor agnostic bastard warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd have stuck with FH.  As an agnostic I was kinda hosed so I never had the FH option.  I ended up just getting Miraguls greaves which are close enough to FH quality.  No way I'd spend points or cash to upgrade to Ornate now.  If I get a drop off Gaukr, great, I'll use that upgrade but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, lets try this logic on for size.  See my boots of the storm?  Cost me less money than an Ornate Greaves mold sells for, and would give you a bigger upgrade.<br />
<br />
You could get a helm + vambrace mold for the cost of a greaves mold, and you would get a bigger upgrade out of it.<br />
<br />
Runebranded girdle?  Seriously dude...CoF + Heavy Rubi Girdle EASY for the price of an Ornate greaves mold.<br />
<br />
How about an elemental bow?  That'd tack on over 100hp on you right there, all of that for less than what an Ornate greaves mold would sell for.  <br />
<br />
It's not a big deal to me, I just think it's foolish to waste DKP, merit, or plat on an upgrade so ridiculously small when there are other options available for you to upgrade.<br />
<br />
You've had the same greaves for a year?  I don't understand why you're not happy about that.  Your guild has progressed thru several sets of CRAP while you've been wearing some of the best stuff obtainable for a long time.  That's called &quot;Bang for your buck.&quot;  You probably paid less than 30k for those greaves, and people in your guld have laid down platinum piece after platinum piece and DKP after DKP for lesser upgrades.   You're telling me that you want to do the same?  Okay dude, it's your money/dkp/merit.  I can tell you right now tho that if ornate greaves fell into my lap...even if I looted them, I probably sitll wouldn't wear them.  I'd sell them because the 100k I could get for them would be more useful than 5ac and 10hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">190 dkp to see a pally crie: priceless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Double Post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I wouldn't argue with you that the helm and vambraces would be a better upgrade.  And upgrading my greaves are not even close to being a priority, like I said.<br />
<br />
As for the RBG, I'm just holding out for a Xana Neck and CT Belt (he drops them alot for us).  Unless Grieg decides to throw me a bone and drop his belt or we are able to master PoS minis in the near future.  Also, CTs cloak is high on my list (or Mujakis, if all else fails).  We kill them alot ;P  I'm not totally ignorant of how to choose equipment.  I am looking at Ornate to boost my AC, though the Helm, BP and Arms would be my first choices.<br />
<br />
I think you missed my point about the FH, though.  I think it's sad how easy those greaves are to obtain and how hard it is to find a suitable upgrade.  As much time as I've put into raiding, it would be nice to have something that every tom, dick and harry can't get.  FH is very nice (which would be why I'm still using it), but not having a viable (i.e. worthwhile) upgrade to it until the very top end when you got it at the bottom is sad, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fafnir</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't sweat it - the ornate are better.  Sure, other stuff might have been a more efficient upgrade on a per point / per pp basis, but that's fine.  All's well that ends well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still wear HT legs even with mostly EP gear;  At this point, I could afford to buy ornate legs even, but the upgrade is too smal to even bother with imho. No way would I ever spend dkp on them. <br />
<br />
If your guild really isn't hitting anything worthwhile for warriors, it is not doing a very good job in keeping warriors happy in the long run and you can allways consider moving on to another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wasn't much of an upgrade.  I considered getting ornate pants to upgrade my fierce heraldic, since I can go drop BoT minis pretty regularly on my server I could definitely get them in an exp group if I was willing to work for it, but really 5 ac and 10 hps isn't worth it in my book.<br />
<br />
On the upside, you will probably wear them for a long, long time, so it's not like you spent points on something that will get replaced next week.  You will have that extra 5 ac 10 hps until you get to the elementals, which is pretty good.  I am willing to take a smaller upgrade if it is the best item available to me for that slot and I know I won't upgrade it for a few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still wearing 4 pieces of FH in EP...been wearing them for 14 months or so now...yes compared to what is dropping around me now, they are beginning to show their age...but I was grateful I never had to worry about Ornate armor, as it was never worthwhile to blow DKP or PP on :)<br />
<br />
As soon as the Raex drop that I need, I will be upgrading for around 30ac and 100hp...thats a worthwhile upgrade.<br />
<br />
If you can wear FH then only get ornate if it's rotting or cheap, or it drops for you exping...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kakgumu</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK...so you made a bit of a mistake.  it's certainly nothing you can't recover from.  But, just to make you feel a little better listen to this.  Mind you, my guild is in PoTime now and at Quarm.  i STILL have 2 pieces of FH cultural on...STILL.  AND...i'm still wearing the Greig Haste belt. I, like you, am about the 6th or 7th warrior in the guild and as such i don't see much in the way of equipment upgrades.  About the only time i get a serious upgrade is when that drop would otherwise rot.  With all that said, if you've had your FH greaves for over year, let me introduce you to LDoN!!  Good grief dude!  That is the VERY first thing you should do is put in 1 or 2 quick adventures with your guildies every night before/after raid.  In a month or 2 you'll have enough to get argueably the second or 3rd best legs in the game!  Not to mention the exp isn't terrible and some of the mini boss drops will yield some decent PP in the bazaar if they aren't outright upgrades for your group.  LDoN is THE saving grace for guilds exactly where you are.  I know because that's exactly where i was before i joined my current guild!  Do yourself a favor and start working toward the Roayl Attendant of Sand equipment...you'll thank yourself later! :)<br />
