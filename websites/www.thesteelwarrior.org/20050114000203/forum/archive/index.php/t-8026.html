From my understanding, the haste cap is at 100%.  Now a 50% haste would make a 14/18 a 14/9 but what of the 100% cap?  I know there is still delay because I am reading script of weapon swings.  At what pt does the weapon still have delay?  I guess this is a deciding factor regarding haste gear upgrades and their worth.  Now I understand that there will be times  that you dont have a chanter or bard but we are a grouping class so there should always be spell haste.  At high level haste, would it be better to use a more damaging but slower weapon?  Please advise.<br />

no. 100% haste would, technically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">once again, Haste theory :<br />
1. 0%  Haste ~&gt; no swing speed change.<br />
2. 100%  Slow ~&gt; no swing at all, thus it's the limite we can't go further. We have to wait an infinite delay before a swing hits.<br />
3. 100%  Haste ~&gt; you swing twice as much (obvious, isn't it)<br />
4. we can go further above with 200%  , 300%  , etc ... to infinite haste (continuous hits)<br />
<br />
this give the formula : Length_of_Time_of_a_Round = 0.1 * Delay_of_the_Weapon / ( 1 + Haste%  )<br />
<br />
so with a weapon of delay 18, the normal round lapse is 1.8s ; at 50% it goes to 1.2s ; at 100%  Haste it goes down to 0.9s ; at max overhaste it achieves ~0.78s with 130% Haste ; and on the opposite at 70%  slow it goes up to 6s. it this time periode can can successfully swing / double / triple / flurry depending on your skills and wielded hand (afterall you are always successfull at simple swing with your primary hand :) ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and haste cap is not 100%.<br />
Haste cap is level based, class based and there are certain things spells/songs/discs that disregad that cap all together.<br />
Also haste is not directly related to delay instead it related to total dmg output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, well one could guess that 100% haste is twice as much damage, hense the 50% delay reasoning.<br />
<br />
Item haste caps at (level + 1)%, stacks with casted spell haste to a max of 100% more potential damage, or 50% less delay, however you like to think of it. Monks have an exception that their epic stacks with worn and casted spell haste. Bard songs also stack, I think only certain ones will though, not completely sure, for overhaste. Spell + item + bard songs are the only way we can go over 100% haste. I think some discs have an overhaste component also, but not any of the warrior discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and the hoop of speed from PoT has a clicky of 5% over haste too, so we can achieve 105% without a bard, and 45%  (cord of temporeal weaving for exemple)+ 30% (ornate glove for exemple)+5%  (Hoop of speed for exemple)= 80% selfbuff with PoP !<br />
<br />
typically the Haste calculation is Total_Haste = Min( Haste_v1 + Haste_v2 , 100%  ) + Haste_v3<br />
worn and tribute are Haste_v1<br />
spells and clickies are Haste_v2<br />
bard song and some exeptions are Haste_v3<br />
and on each Haste version, only the max is used so the hoop of speed or the monk epic are overwrited by a biger Haste_v3 from a bard, same clickies or procs (see exe axe) are overwrited by a better spell buff. <br />

<br />
EDIT : Right the ornate is 30%  not 50%  , I must stop considering my dreams as true ... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the ornate hands clicky is 30% haste</div></div><hr />

no.<br />
the icons may &quot;stack&quot;, at least for some haste spells, but you only get the higher spell haste of the two. monk epic click has side effects tho (some ac and atk).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste doesn't decrease delay, it increases the number of swings you get in a certain time frame. Right now I believe the fastest you can get is 130% or so with a bard play Rizlona's. If you want to know what your delay figuratively is, use this formula: 100/(haste%+100)*weapondelay. At 100% haste you get 100/200 (.5)*weapon delay, thus cutting the delay in half. <br />
<br />
A side annoyance of mine, people need to stop going by the old &quot;1 spell, 1 item and 1 song&quot; mantra for haste stacking. It's true sometimes, yes, but more often than not it is false. Only some song hastes stack on top, not all. Anyway, /minirant off.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Made something more clear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">right Athrias, my distribution of haste source within the three categoriy was too simple and can drive into dead ends cause of its too racial order (worn/spell/song) , but at least the v1/v2/v3 haste formula and the effect of the total haste on swing number formulas are the closest to what we have experienced.</div></div><hr />

It's an annoyance of mine as well.  People keep saying it and it's just simply too annoying.  All bard hastes, with the exception of Rizlona/Vah Shir/Muse/Ervaj songs, do not stack with enchanter/shaman/beast hastes.  Other things in it might stack, like in Warsong of Zek, but the highest haste takes effect.  If I hear one more monk say they have 140%+ haste with only an enchanter I'm going to smack him.</div></div><hr />
