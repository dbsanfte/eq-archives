<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorereaper</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, it's been a while since I posted and I've made a lot of upgrades and leveled from 55 to 63... am halfway to 64 now. I would like some suggestions on what I should upgrade first (equipment/weapons) and what I should upgrade to. And any ideas on where I should be going for the fastest XP based on my current equipment. I also have 18 AA's with CS3 maxed and I was thinking of doing ND3 next. When should I do this? Should I wait till level 65 or 70 now?... I do have the OoW expansion. Thanks for your advice, it is much appreciated. <br />

<br />
There are many upgrades you could go for to replace it with.  just troll around some of the weapon threads for some ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, like Ven said, get rid of that sword.  The last thing you want is an agro reducing weapon.  CHoS and SoTBS will work just fine for you.  If you want the biggest bang for your buck, get the HoRZ.  It will give you 21 raw ac and 40 HPS.  No other piece of armor will net that much AC and Hps.  Slap the 10 ac augs from LDoN in your waist, back, neck, shoulders and face.  Stick the 40 hps augs in the Helm, legs, bp, arms.  While you are getting those ldon points, you can also get better gear from hard missions.  34 ac gloves with 90 hps, 34 ac boots with 90 hps (or close).  Slap some anger augs on the weapons and yer good to go.<br />

Any other advice on where would be best for me to XP right now? And what LDoNs do I need to be running to get points for the anger augs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For anger augments its everfrost for slot 4. 1150 for an anger 3, 510 for an anger 2. Also xp, I think you could probably do well in Qinimi with a good squad behind you. Chance of some nameds that drop ac + hp augments (if I recall correctly) Alternatively you could try LDoN hards for xp, because of the chances to upgrade (incidental and not very much, but upgrades nonetheless)</div></div><hr />
