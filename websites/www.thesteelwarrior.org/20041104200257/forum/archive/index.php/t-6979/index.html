<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenfo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just restarted my 65 halfling war recently, and my buddy got me some crowns of elemental mastery to sell for lots of cash-- ( 100k a pop ). I am fully equiped except for Legs/Boots/Gauntlets... was hoping for some good suggestions on those slots. Currently I was thinking of getting one more crown and getting Ornate boots/gaunts, then Greaves of the Orcish master. Seeing as how your all skilled warriors, and I havn't played in near a year, any feedback would be much appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A magelo profile would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenfo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just need to know of some good legs. I have no legs and only plan on buying one pair, so waiting until I get some feedback.<br />
<br />
Once I get home, to a computer that can actually go to Magelo, I will make one and post it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fierce heraldic if you worship rallos zek<br />
ornate if not. i worship rallos zek so i don't know much others</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd go for warlord gauntlets instead of ornate.  The reason is, you can always sell the warlord gaunts later if an upgrade becomes available, whereas with the ornate you just lose the plat forever.<br />
<br />
Similarly, there are good tradeable boots with 75 to 90 hp and good ac (forget the name...I'm pretty sure they are listed on a recent ldon post on this board).<br />
<br />
Both the gauntlets and boots normally go for around 90k on Emarr.<br />
<br />
As to the greaves, if you like ldon, I'd go for those.  If you want something quick you can buy now (again, losing plat forever), ornate is good.  It also depends on your sta - if you're not capped already or don't always have a shaman around, the extra 30 sta would be nice.  by the way, I don't know about your server, but the cheapest I've ever seen ornate pants for on Emarr is 140k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenfo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I made a magelo. Sorry it took so long--- http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543561<br />
<br />
I have 100k to spend to fill those 3 slots missing.<br />
<br />
Edit-- My AC and atk are off for some reason, I have 1234 ac on the dot and somewhere in the 1200s for attack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My best recommendation are the three LDoN hard plate drops.<br />
<br />
Warlord Steel Gauntlets<br />
Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites<br />
Mana-threaded Bone Bracelet<br />
<br />
Each have 75-85hp each, and about the same AC as the 1492 Takish gear.  Nice stats and saves on them as well.  If you only have 100k left though, I'd pick either the gauntlets or the boots, if you get any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenfo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, Legs please... got bracers just need legs-- I know what I will be getting for gaunts/boots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, Legs please... got bracers just need legs-- I know what I will be getting for gaunts/boots<br />
<br />
Since I'm guessing you don't like ldon, I'd go for the ornate greaves.  Plus, it looks like you could use the clicky sta buff since the sta on your magelo isn't maxed.<br />
<br />
By the way, if you do like ldon, I'd go for the Tak greaves (1492 @ nro camp)...I personally like these are better since you can augment them to fit your needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenfo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like LDoN, I just need to get those equipment slots filled before I start playing. I can tank fine now, but I dont wanna tank w/o pants! =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe...just play a barbarian...they only wear skirts anyway!<br />
<br />
I just made due with the Blood Runed Greaves until I could afford ldon.  Of course, if you're not agnostic, cultural is good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I see nothing wrong with a halfling with no pants ..<br />
<br />
I would go with the ornate greeves if I were you .. if you can find for 100k</div></div><hr />
