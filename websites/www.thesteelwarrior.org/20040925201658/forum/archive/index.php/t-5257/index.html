Conclusions so far are rather surprising.  They certainly aren't what I would have predicted!  More testing's needed but here's what we think so far...<br />
<br />
1.  There is a significant chance - sample sizes are small as yet, but it's quite possibly a chance in excess of 50% - that a direct heal will generate zero hate.  That's right, none at all.<br />
<br />
2.  Where a heal generates hate, the aggro caused is based off the total non-critical amount actually healed - in other words, a heal for 1,000 generates a fixed amount of hate whether the spell used was Supernal Light, Complete Healing or whatever - and a critical heal for 2,000 generates the same hate as a non-critical heal for 1,000.<br />
<br />
3.  &quot;Unused&quot; healing doesn't generate hate.  In other words, if I cast a CH for 8925 but it only lands for 4k, the amount of hate I create is based on the 4k rather than on the 8925.<br />
<br />
We haven't proved whether heal aggro is capped or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very interesting tests, though some of it isn't terribly surprising to anyone that's played a healer. I know when a friend was healing me versus factioned mobs, he didn't take a faction hit some of the time, even through several CHs. Good stuff, thanks for posting the link.</div></div><hr />

I knew this during velious.  My poor fuckin clerics were the last to get to ally CoV faction because healing the tank alone did not always generate a faction hit.<br />

We pretty much already assumed this, because nukes are the same way.  Partial resist for 3, full damage for 1000, crit for 2k all generate the same aggro.  Aggro isn't generated by the number, it's generated by the spell.<br />

See above.<br />

Clerics are behind the times.  It's good that they're starting to learn what their own stuff does tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, there were Yelinak fights where we had clerics in the rotation all the way through the 5-15 min fight chaining CH and didn't get a faction hit when he died.  Only way to guaranted a faction hit is to do some damage to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Glad to see Mikar testing again (this is the guy who proved how DI works, and how cha affects it), but yeah, a lot of that thread is common knowledge from over the years. Now that he's laid the basics out, and what we already know has been proven, maybe he can prove something we don't know.<br />

Healing the tank alone doesn't ever generate a faction hit in velious. It's why Green Ceramic Bands (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=23590) are common among clerics; to get a bit of damage between heals, and get the faction hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, so did I.  But there's a difference between what you &quot;know&quot; from experience playing the game and what we've actually gone out there and tested.<br />
<br />
Clerics are behind the times. It's good that they're starting to learn what their own stuff does<br />
<br />
We knew.  At least some of the people who play clerics aren't total idiots.  What we're starting to do is prove it - and that's a different thing.<br />
<br />
To use examples that would be familiar to a warrior - I've seen people tell me that they &quot;know&quot; that the SoD procs more often than the BoC.  For years, warriors &quot;knew&quot; that a successful taunt would turn the mob to face them.  Then someone went out and did the actual testing and we found that sometimes, the stuff that people &quot;know&quot; turns out to be bullcrap.<br />
<br />
In fact, like you I was already aware that not every heal generates a faction hit when I started the test.  But that's one of the main reasons why I chose to participate, because to think you know something is treacherous.<br />
<br />
I also &quot;knew&quot; that some direct heals do generate hate; you can't play a healer (or a tank) in this game for long and not know that.<br />
<br />
I believed that warriors would be interested in the proof - not just the assertion - so I posted it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Meh, dont get upset. Haass always posts like that. I have wanted to shake the boy violently on occasion, but the more you see him post, the more he grows on you.<br />
<br />
He's the resident hardass. You should see him unleash on people that deserve it LOL.<br />
<br />
Jak<br />
<br />
p.s. send one of those confused proc-estimators to Haass and see what happens rofl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasn't upset; I spend enough of my life reading messageboards that I encounter Haass (I mean his equivalent - most messageboards have a Haass) on a fairly regular basis.<br />
<br />
I just wasn't going to let some hardcase dismiss a round of perfectly valid tests with what amounted to, &quot;Well, duh, we already knew that.&quot;  Until you test, sunshine, you don't know - you just have an opinion.<br />
<br />
Complete the following rhyme:<br />
<br />
Tests are tests.  Parses are parses.  Opinions are opinions and they all smell like...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a nitpick.  That did not at all turn out to be bullcrap.  An unfortunate side-effect of that testing that now people read the first couple pages of the thread and come across with a totally different (and incorrect) conclusion than than what we actually discovered.  I tried to keep this from happening by linking the summary post a the beginning of the thread, but please don't quote me as saying taunt doesn't work like we thought it did :cool: .<br />
<br />
You have a point though.  Saying &quot;clerics don't know how their class works and I do&quot; is the same thing a few choice posters from shadowknight.org did to us when we were doing that taunt testing, and it's not fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also like what you think happened 4 expansions ago is even valid anymore.</div></div><hr />
