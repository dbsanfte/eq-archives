<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, for the last couple of days I've been going over the new weapons that can be smithed in GoD.  And trying to figure out what it will take to make them and if it's worth bothering with.   Here is what I see.<br />
<br />
The quality of the weapons varies from completely worthless to half way decent.  For example, of the 2h slash weapons, the first easiest weapon to make results in a 20/40 2hander.  Now a 20/40 would have been considered half way decent, in Kunark.  These days, it's not even something you'd use on a twink.  So complete garbage except if you're looking for smithing skill ups perhaps.  However, the best weapon I found stats for in the 2hand catagory was this:<br />
<br />
Velium Gemmed Great Sword<br />
Damage: 34<br />
Delay: 28<br />
STR: +14, WIS: +14, INT: +14, AGI: +14, SV FIRE: +14, SV COLD: +14, SV MAGIC: +14<br />
<br />
1 Type 4 slot<br />
1 Type 7 slot<br />
Recommended level of 65.<br />
<br />
Okay, that's half way decent.  Not something anyone in a guild that has gone to NToV or beyond would necessarily want, but not bad for your run of the mill player.  On a side note, have they ever adressed the problem with 2handed weapons and a speed of 28, or will this weapon have the damage bonus of a 1hander?  Anyway.  So I start investigating what it will take to make one of these and other similar weapons.  First off, just for smithing, you have to perform a series of quests for a smithing NPC in Abysmal Sea.  It's not particularly hard, it involves either doing a &quot;freebie&quot; version of the quest where the NPC gives you the materials for some combines and you give the NPC back the results.  Basically you end up having to do 400 successful two and three item combines and returning the results back the NPC, one at a time (by that I mean unstacked).  Or you can do a slight variation to the quest where you provide the materials and you end up having to do something like 120 successful combines and handing in the results to the NPC.  These quests are supposed to be &quot;teaching&quot; you how to work with the new GoD materials, aligned ore and shimmering ore, to make aligned steel bars and shimmering steel bars.  <br />
<br />
So, I figure what the heck, and I crank through the &quot;freebie&quot; version in a couple of hours, 400 successful combines aren't too hard for something that trivials at a skill of 54 when your skill is 235 before bonuses.  Got that out of the way, thinks I.  But wait, there's more to it.  There are jewelcraft subcombines for the smithed weapons.  So you either need to have a friend with jewel crafting willing to do 400 successful combines in their own &quot;freebie&quot; quest, or 120 successful combines in the quest where you provide the materials.  Well, the jewelcraft subcombines all seem to go trivial at around 120ish or so, which isn't a horribly high skill in jewel craft, so to save myself some grief down the road and to avoid imposing on friends or dealing with a second toon, I crank out the &quot;freebie&quot; version of the jewelcraft quest on my Barb Warrior.  And it took considerably more than 400 combines to get the 400 successful combines I needed.  I probably did close to double that, since I started out with a jewelcraft skill of 0.  But I did get it to 54 before I finished, so I wasn't completely annoyed.  I'll have to up my jewel craft skill into the high 100s at some point down the line, but that can be done.  And I end up learning the &quot;secrets&quot; of processing raw pale nihilite and raw shimmering nihilite into pale nihilite and shimmering nihilite, lucky me.<br />
<br />
But wait, there's more.  To do the jewel craft portion of the subcombines you need a special  jeweler's kit, a reinforced jeweler's kit.  To make this reinforced jewelers kit you need to complete, you guessed it, a quest.  The quest requires three items be turned into an NPC, two of which can be purchased off the vendors in the Abysmal Sea, so far so good, the third is a no drop &quot;Turpeta Shell&quot; that seems to drop rarely off the cragwalkers in Natimbi and a few other places in GoD.  Lovely, so if I want to proceed I'll need to camp cragwalkers in Natimbi, or what ever the turtle critters are called.  Well, I'm not quite ready to say to hell with it, yet.<br />
<br />
But wait, there's more.  It seems that to make the &quot;crappy&quot; weapons all you need is aligned ore and raw pale nihilite.  But to make the &quot;decent&quot; weapons you need raw shimmering nihilite and shimmering ore.  And it seems that while the bazaar has literally tons of aligned ore and raw pale nihilite available to be purchased, there is not one single piece of shimmering nihilite or shimmering ore.  None.  Zero.  Nada.  Zilch.  The big goose egg.  Apparently these items are fairly &quot;uncommon&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, in smithing there seems to be two catagories of uncommon.  There is the &quot;You'll see some once in a while and while the drop rate isn't great it does at least drop&quot;.  And there is &quot;Drops?  Drops?  We don't need no stinking drops!&quot;  For example, PoP has been out for over a year now and there are still smithing related drops from the elemental planes you will not see in the bazaar for any price.   Granted these items would be used to make some pretty decent armor.  But all the same, after a year of farming an expansion you'd expect the drops to be showing up in the bazaar, right?  And when one or two of some of the rare but not quite so rare drops do show up in the bazaar, people want 10k, 15k, or more per item for them.  These are items that you'll need at least 3 or 4 of per attempted armor combine and the odds are extremely good they'll poof in the forge.  I don't know about most people, but I blanch at the idea of throwing 60k or more worth of items into the forge knowing that I'll probably get back nada.<br />
<br />
Now, if shimmering ore and raw shimmering nihilite have drop rates anywhere nearly as uncommon as the drop rates for the smithing items out of the elemental planes, I'm probably better off dropping the whole idea right now after only having wasted a few hours jumping through SoE's hoops.  But I have to wonder, why even bother putting smithing into GoD if the idea is to let people either make extremely subpar weapons or to wait on drops that are liable to never be available?  Anyone remember waiting for swampwood staves to show up out of Cazic Thule?  It took a couple of years for them to up the drop rate enough find some in the bazaar from time to time.<br />
<br />
I know, some people are probably going to say &quot;well why not go hunt/camp these items for yourself.&quot;  Well, the thing here is, if I wanted to go hunt/camp items for myself, I wouldn't bother with smithing supplies since there are so many dropped items that beat most smithing made items all to hell.  If you are capable of hunting in the elemental planes, you're sure not going to bother with the armor smiths can make with the drops from there.  And if you're capable of hunting in the zones where shimmering ore and shimmering nihilite drop, you're sure not going to care about using the weapons that can be made from them.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm completely disappointed in GoD.  It offers a player like me a whole lot of nothing.  I may eventually hunt in the first few zones, but there is no way I'll spend any time in deeper.  I'm unable and unwilling to commit the kind of time necessary to acquire the dropped gear needed to be even marginally successful, and they've made it impossible for me to make it for myself.<br />
<br />
And the main point to all this is, it just seems really dim to make it so that only the people who won't need or want the items that can be made by a smith have access to the drops they need.  And the last two big expansions, PoP and GoD, have done exactly that.  By the time you're capable of hunting for the drops you're way better geared anyway.  And add to that the fact they're rare as hell, means there really is no point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*shrug* Doesn't matter, I won't be hunting in KodTaz.  It holds no interest for me.  So I won't be gathering any myself, and if the bazaar is any indication, they're not very common anyway.  My point isn't so much that I can't or won't hunt in GoD, which are both fairly true, but that smithing hasn't really fulfilled the promise.  I spent a lot of time and energy to pursue the skill to have it dead end into either making crap no one really wants, even myself, or being unable to acquire the components needed for things anyone would want.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is I haven't had a major gear upgrade since cultural armor came out and I stopped raiding regularly.  And the only thing that even looks like it would have any potential would be the PoP quested armor, if I am willing to come up with several hundred k to buy the molds.<br />
<br />
Smithing seems to really have fallen to the wayside although they attempt to keep up the appearance that it's a useful and active skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't see that the original poster is asking for anything for free:<br />

He does hundreds and hundreds of subcombines that take hours.<br />
He undertakes JC with a Barb warrior (this, in and of itself, suggests that he can't be all that interested in easy rewards).<br />
Now he finds that the bottleneck appears to be a drop rate that is so low that it's impossible for him to come up with any formula that suggests that this type of smithing is worth the time/effort/risk. (Not just &quot;worth it&quot; in a normal opportunity-cost-analysis sense, but in the am-I-a-complete-sucker-for-doing-this sense.)<br />
Then he points out that if you have developed your character to the point that he can make this reward, the character has got to be too advanced to use the reward.<br />
He has a number of complaints, but none of them have to do with asking for free stuff.</div></div><hr />

macro quest doesnt take any effort sorry<br />
<br />
not saying he used it but just pointing out that tradeskill mastery does NOT neccesarily represent any time spent playing or effort in game, i could achieve the exact same results with some ebayed plat and macroquest in about a week and only actually be at keys maybe 2 hours setting things up and refilling bags of supplies</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may surprise you, since you're obviously thinking that you're being biting and witty, but obtaining a 235 smithing skill != no effort.  Do you have a 235 smithing skill?  If not, do you really understand what's involved with getting there?<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually, all I would like is that a skill that I spent literally months and hundreds of thousands of plat on advancing to actually retained some value as the expansions move on.  Sure, there are still worthwhile things to be made with the skill, if you can acquire very rare drops.  So rare that I doubt there are more than dozen farwater plate pieces or livestone plate pieces on my server.  I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if I was.<br />
<br />
macro quest doesnt take any effort sorry<br />
<br />
That's very nice of you, to just assume that I macroed my way through the 400 combines in smithing and the probably close to 800 combines in jewel craft.  Care to insult me any more while you're at it?  Oh, but no, you're not saying that I macroed it, but that I could have.  And therefore, even if I didn't, it's meaningless.  Well, I didn't macro it.  I did it all one cursor motion at a time.  And I really don't apperciate someone coming along and not only implying that I would &quot;cheat&quot; but that even if I didn't my efforts weren't worth spit.  Care to go be a jackass somewhere else, mmkay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My wife does tradeskills with her character.  She has a 250JC skill and every other skill at or near 200.  She has yet to be able to make more than a few semi-useful items all of which were replaced by upgrades at some point, although her skills are great for equipping friends or new chars we start.<br />
<br />
By the time we are capable of getting drops from zones where items she could make will be useful, we will have better gear anyways.  If she wants to purchase those expensive tradeskill items she will end up paying just as much for the items as for the end product because someone else is able to actually get the tradeskill items, do the combine, then sell the end product.<br />
<br />
Unless you actually enjoy doing tradeskills they are almost a complete waste of time unless you are just going to sell the item you make for plat, since by the time you can acquire the items to make the gear you will most likely have better gear already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sort of agree with you, except the mid-end items you could make and sell for plat have deperciated dramatically as time has gone on, due to the introduction of more and more droppable items that seem to be almost carbon copies of what a tradeskiller could make.  And the higher end items just can't be made because the drops for them are close to non-existant.</div></div><hr />

well if you spent most of your time doing tradeskills in a game you obviously dont care to progress in further, then sounds like you wasted a lot of time /shrugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well if you spent most of your time doing tradeskills in a game you obviously dont care to progress in further, then sounds like you wasted a lot of time /shrugs <br />
<br />
Typical, unless you're raiding you're not progressing and are therefore wasting your time.  *shakes his head*  Go away, you've nothing to input here.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions and it just really amounts to you not understanding my point.  So, I'll explain a little further.  I went with black smithing for a number of reasons:<br />
<br />
1) I could make relatively decent armor, at the time, for myself.<br />
2) I could help my friends as well at the same time.<br />
3) It was something I could do when I decided to do it.  I wasn't at the beck and call of a guild.  I wasn't stuck camping something somewhere for hours on end.  I could as little or as much as I wanted in a sitting.<br />
4) There was the impression given that as time went on if you mastered a tradeskill it would continue to have reasonable value as there would be more items added to the game you could make.<br />
<br />
And lets be clear about this, I spent a lot of time on black smithing.  I did black smithing runs all the time where my wrist was sore afterwards from all the clicking.  It cost a ton of plat as well, since getting beyond 200 in smithing is just hard as hell unless you do some very expensive combines.<br />
<br />
<br />
So fast forward to today and what do I see?<br />
<br />
1) Dropable items flooding the market that match or exceed the more commonly made black smith items, so those items I can make have very low value.  <br />
<br />
2) I can't make better armor for myself, not because I lack the skills, but because the drops can't be had.  It's being given an opportunity that is not an opportunity.  It's like working for an AA that didn't actuallly do anything.<br />
<br />
3) And it's turning out that rather than smithing being something I can control when and for how long I do, it's turning into something where I'm going to have to go camp things somewhere just to be able to attempt combines I have a very good chance of failing on to make gear that I wouldn't use if I had the gear to do the camps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why people post garbage like this I have no idea...IMHO its just a judgmental egotistic sound bite.  I guess its something to be expected from a post count of &lt;10.<br />
<br />
I think Glat's point was that for high end trade skills there should be a secondary market (that the raw material items, while rare, should at least exist in quantities to support a trade community).  I agree...one of the more interesting things EQ has offered is a level of disintermediation between the folks who exp/get primary materials and the tradeskill/secondary market community. This is one of the aspects that makes the bazaar actually fun.<br />
<br />
The challenge has always been for SoE to balance giving the tradeskill community a role w/o giving it too much influence...sounds like with GoD they may need to address that balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think there are a couple of issues coming up in this thread that are sufficiently important in their own right for us to make an attempt not to get distracted by insults.<br />
<br />
Ibithor and Fulorian have (I take it) advanced their warriors in fighting; they've made what we all know is a significant commitment of time and effort, often at some risk, to get where they are. Assuming at some level an essential element of their argument is that the level of risk they assume in advancing in this way, and the time commitment they have made, ought to be rewarded at the highest level in the game, they have a point. It would certainly be a point I agree with: committed raiding players should get the top rewards in the game (at least, if the raids they undertake succeed, heh). I can't speak for Glatius2, but I see nothing in any of his posts that suggest he would disagree either.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the assumption that Glatius2 simply macros his way to &quot;free&quot; stuff purchased through duped plat is without foundation. You can tell he's not that kind of person by reading his posts, for one thing. <br />
<br />
I note that Ibithor, to his credit, takes pains to say that he is not accusing Glatius2 of doing this. Ibithor does seem to be saying, however, that the fact that such macroing exists should make it clear that Glatius2 should not expect any non-trivial rewards for what he's doing. But look, the weapon he's talking about trying to make here is not substantially better for a tank than a GSoT, which is easily purchased in the bazaar of most servers for under 500 pp. Really, completely aside from the morality of macroing your way to making this weapon, doing so would be stupid because for less than the cost of buying the supplies for the smithing combines, you could use your online plat to buy stuff in the bazaar. In fact, you could simply buy a 65 toon outfitted in all the best droppable gear--if doing tradeskills in and of itself is a waste of time, then so is advancing your character to the point you are able to kill mobs that drop ornate molds.<br />
<br />
I suggest that we stop accusing each other of wanting free crap or being stupid for wasting our time doing something rather than simply macroing or buying pp or buying 65 toons. Of course you can do all that stuff, but why should the fact that some people have done that mean that players who would like to do tradeskills in the traditional manner should have no useful reward for doing them, anymore than because you can buy a decently equipt 65 toon mean you should have no fun advancing your non-Ebay character the hard way?<br />
<br />
However, the problem of purchased plat and tradeskill macros is directly relevant in another way. From a game design point of view, tradeskills currently function in the game as a means of removing plat from players. I have a hard time believing that the people who thought up tradeskills hoped that the main function of that system would be to drain plat from players. That this has become a central function of tradeskills is in part because of macroing and duped plat. Under these conditions, attempting to find a way to make tradeskilling fun and rewarding, while at the same time giving better rewards to players who have a deep time commitment to raiding, is a difficult problem for game designers. It is not, in my view, a problem that SONY has been able to solve.<br />
<br />
It's possible that some raiding players actually believe that  there should be no significant avenues for casual players to advance their characters. I fail to see why not, given that some means be found to supply rading players with yet more means of advancing their characters.<br />
<br />
Now, I've tried to be civil and rational. Certainly you can disagree with my take on things, but if you flame me, I'm going to offer Haass* rl dollars (or even beer!) not just to flame you but to nuke you until you are so burned that eating dry salt would re-hydrate you: because why should I flame you myself when I might be able to buy the best? You have been warned.<br />
<br />
* Haass and Goradain have the best posts in this thread so far, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It would certainly be a point I agree with: committed raiding players should get the top rewards in the game (at least, if the raids they undertake succeed, heh).

<br />
I certainly wouldn't disagree with you there.  Being a commited raider has always meant access to the best possible gear.  I wouldn't expect tradeskills to be able to generate gear that really competed with that.  But I also would expect tradeskills to generate gear that was at least on par with things like ornate, the &quot;introductory&quot; armor upgrade for PoP.  And in theory, it can.  But in practice it can't, because the freaking drops are so completely asininely rare that it's not possible.<br />
<br />
When PoP came along, they added in 6 new armor types.  Two of which, nightmare armor and hurricane armor, weren't any better for plate wearers than the cultural armor already readily available.  All those two armor types did was fill in some gaps for people who couldn't wear any type of cultural plate and add some chain that was missing .  The other 4 armor types all require drops from the elemental planes.  And create armor that runs pretty close to on par with ornate.  Except no one makes it in any quantity, for the reason I've already stated, the drops aren't there.<br />
<br />
When LDoN came out they introduced a bunch of different armor, all of which was clearly targetted for the under level 50 crowd.  None of which was even as good as cultural.  Nice to work on for skill ups or to make a bit of plat off the twink crowd, but nothing really useful.  Now here comes GoD, where we are given only weapons to make.  Weapons that aren't any better than a number of easily available dropped weapons.  Weapons smiths can't make, except for the very crappiest of them which would be completely worthless to everyone, because again the drops aren't there.<br />
<br />
I don't really mind that the gear I can make would be &quot;mediocre&quot; in the minds of the commited raiding crowd.  I do mind that I can't even make that &quot;mediocre&quot; gear because SoE won't let me.  I also happen to think that commited tradeskillers should be able to make gear that is better than the common bazaar bait.  And I'm pissed that I've spent money to buy an expansion that claims to offer me further entertainment, when what it really offers me is a whole lot of jack and shit.</div></div><hr />
