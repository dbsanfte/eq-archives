<br />
I did last night and i was seriously blown away at how much they can shine in undead dungeons. He was CCing better than most ench's, helping the sham with slows and of course theres the necro's lewt dps. then when clerics oom, theres always a bit of pumpage on tap :)<br />
<br />
plus of course necros seem to have significantly more hps than most enchs, and that, together with lifetaps, whenever mez broke they dont die so fast.  then snare &amp; of course, the possibility of rezing via EE if cleric ever buys the farm.<br />
<br />
much respect. now if only i had that much utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget that Necros can heal (125 hp for 4 ticks) and do grp taps.. be it a 720 heal to the entire group over 9 ticks, 300 mana to everyone, 30str/sta to everyone, 35atk to everyone, 18ac to everyone...<br />
<br />
I agree, much respect. now if only i had that much utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A well played necro is indeed all of the above and more.  A poorly played one is just like any other bump on the log.</div></div><hr />
