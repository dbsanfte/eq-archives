<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI, I loaded the latest Yalp and the latest EQCompanion, ran them both on the same extract of my log, and got wildly different DPS results.<br />
<br />
EQCompanion v.794beta said my CHSD+dagger produced 82.9 DPS.  Yalp v2.3 said 67.53.<br />
<br />
Folks, that ain't even close.<br />
<br />
So until I run some tests, I don't know which (if either) is accurate.<br />
<br />
Caveat Emptor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Yalp, at least the version I have (near as I can tell) does not include proc damage in the DPS calculations.  EQCompanion (No offense, cuz I know the guy posts here) has always been wrong for me.  The shit it comes up with just can not possibly be accurate.  <br />
<br />
I trust Yalp personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always been a fan of yalp, its the first parser I ever got my hands on and continue to use because its so mind numbingly simple and includes some nifty charting/html features.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQComp you just hafta fiddle with the settings. If you are parsing single mob fights it will be accurate, and even handles multi-mob fights OK generally. Any parser can get bogged down/screwed up in multi-mob fights though.<br />
<br />
 If you had 1 fight where the mob didn't die at the end, or you switched targets for a long stretch, Yalp could get thrown completely off. At least the last version I tried(long time ago). You can set EQComp to time out that stuff. Will still get artificially lowered DPS some, but like 6 seconds instead of 6 minutes of 0 time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahz, would it be possible for you to zip up and e-mail me your log file. I'd love to get to the bottom of this. My e-mail address is kai@inreach.com.<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why YALP and EQ Companion would give different results, probably the biggest one of them being the logic that decides when a fight starts and ends.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Oh, forgot to ask, if you can e-mail me the log file, could you also include your EQ Companion.INI file in the ZIP file so I have your settings as well. It would also be nice if you could mention which particular fight you compared (or if you used the combine fights feature to get a combined DPS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When using EQCompanion, I always filter it by damage done, and take out all less than 1000, then filter by DPS and take out all the extremely low lieing ones, then hit Combine and that's usually a more accurate representation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First I'd like to say that both E and Y are fine programs, and I in no way wish to slam their authors.<br />
<br />
I did some investigation, and I believe the differences in what I expected versus what was produced is due to damage shields, mostly. Both Y and E seem to include damage shield damage in the DPS. This isn't wrong if you are interested in your total effectiveness.  If you want to know how your weapons performed, it is way wrong.<br />
<br />
Here are some observations:<br />
<br />
The more I compare Y and E, the more similar their numbers. There is some fuzziness here and there, but this is to be expected.<br />
<br />
For Y, the DPS on the summary screen doesn't match that on the Fights tab.  The Ofensive [sic] DPS on the fights tab pretty much agrees with my parser (82.43 vs 85.2 respectively) if you include all damage shield and weapon proc damage.<br />
<br />
E gave a DPS of 82.9, nearly agreeing with Y and M also, again if I include all weapon procs and damage shields.<br />
<br />
Y didn't include my Epic's 100pt DD, E did.  Otherwise they seem tp produce pretty similar numbers.<br />
<br />
For E, the total fight time on the stats tab doesn't agree with the total fight time if I group and combine all the fights, which are 35:05 vs 36:03, respectively.<br />
<br />
I'd venture a guess there is a way to remove DS damage from DPS calculation for both these parsers.  Then I'll be good to go.  If there is no way, then neither of these tools is appropriate for rating weapons unless the situation is very carefully controlled. It's next to impossible to test weapons perfectly against live-fire mobs,  due to group and buff differences, etc.  But we can do adequate testing.  But the DS has to go.  Having an extra 50 ATK is one thing, being credited for a 90pt DS is quite another!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah - I believe I have determined the problem, which is the inclusion of DS damage in DPS calculation. However, I will happily send you my log file if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to drone, one more experiment.  I did an LDoN tonight with no DS except at the very beginning.<br />
<br />
E says 83.3 DPS<br />
M says 86.2 DPS<br />
Y says 82.49 DPS (on the Fights tab)<br />
<br />
This supports my belief. Another way is the get the original log file and remove the DS lines, but that's like work :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad you figured it out. Currently there is no way to remove damage shields from your total DPS. If you only want to parse your weapons, you can always look in the 'slash' or 'crush', etc. rows instead of the total row which includes kick, bash, etc. as well as possible damage shields.<br />
<br />
The stats page in EQ Companion has very crude DPS and fight time stats. I have been thinking about removing them all together because they really are not that useful now that I have implemented the fight combining feature which is far better way of getting stats from a lot of fights.<br />
<br />
I'm curious, You mentioned 'M' as a parser. Which parser is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For Y, the DPS on the summary screen doesn't match that on the Fights tab.

<br />
Correct, Yalp doesn't include non-melee damage on the summary screen (ie Proc damage).  You have to click on each individual fight to see the true overall dps.  I use both Yalp 2.3 and EQC 0.794 and both parse within 0.2% of each other consistently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DPS number on YALP's summary screen isn't DPS excluding DS etc.  It is something else, or wrong.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=<br />
The &quot;M&quot; parser I referred to above is the one I wrote.  it is very primitive in that it has no GUI, and does nothing except parse fight data.</div></div><hr />
