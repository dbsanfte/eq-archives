<br />
My warrior is now level (or at least half a bub till) 48, and my gear is litterally crap.  Unbuffed i have 2k hp and about 730 ac (give or take) and i cant go anywhere for fear of death (PoJ OWN me) and i dont have money to upgrade or w/e.  On my epic for weapons (cuz i only have a graverrobber shortblade and a defenders lightblade) i only have Chardok, Naggy, and my planes fights, the rest is finished.<br />
<br />
So my question is a. Where should i hunt to go pharming?  (Currently im going to HK and killing guards, but i get no exp, and only about .5k for two hours or so), and b. what armor should i buy that is fairly cheap ?<br />
<br />
**edit** doh, i think i placed this in the wrong section, sorry =S</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are just beginning to experience one of the most frustrating aspects of being a warrior: you're at a level where the gear you need is about to get very much more expensive, but you can't farm plat mobs like giants because they eat you.<br />
If you can spend the online time to run a bazaar trader, consider jogging over to East K and slaughtering every spider and lion you see, then selling the silk and LQ, MQ and HQ hides (pelts, not the &quot;skins&quot;) in the bazaar; all of them are needed for higher-level smithing, and the silks are needed for tailoring. You'll make more pp per hour than you do whacking HK guards.<br />
In the bazaar, search by slot, your race and amount of pp you have for possible upgrades. For many warriors, the easiest big jump in armor from where you are is cultural stuff, but it looks like you are agnostic so that might not be an option for you. In the library section of this site are a couple threads about armor sets. Except for perhaps one piece of cobalt from Karnor's Castle (a minor upgrade) you will need much more help than you can get from a pick-up group to quest or loot better armor. You'll need a bunch of help, in fact, so don't spend all your time solo farming. Help others and they'll help you. Solo farming is not going to get you the stuff you need.<br />
If you are dead broke, I'd search the ring and earring slots first. There are some good 5-6 AC rings with stat and hp bonuses for (depending on your server's prices) under 500 pp. That's the cheapest marginal hp/AC/stat boost you can get.<br />
Also if you are reallly really desperately poor and the bed leg is your best mainhand, go to the entrance of Maiden Eye and ask politely if anyone hunting near the entrance would let you loot a gorganga club. There are two such clubs, 23-34 delay, primary only, but with 11-12 damage and a damage bonus. They are a long long long way from any final solution to your mainhand problem, but they are no drop and everyone who hunts in ME has better weapons than that, so it's quite possible that they'd let you loot one for free if you are nice about it. And it will do much much more damage than the bedleg and I don't think you'll lose anything in the agro department. Don't let anything in ME hit you, though, cause you'll die. <br />
Also in the library section of this site is a list of agro weapons. Take some notes and when you search in the bazaar you'll know the better weapons when you see them.<br />
Get yourself a 2HB weapon that is usable at least for times you aren't MT and get your 2HB skill up. When you are lvl 55 you can use a Great Staff of Thunder, a very nice weapon that sells for under 500 pp on most servers. The GSoT is the poor warrior's friend.<br />
At any rate, some short term armor upgrades you can afford; if you can wear barbed ringmail, it will be an upgrade in some slots and it's in the bazaar. Search carefully by slot, take notes, try to get the best bang for your buck.<br />
Ultimately, though, that armor is only a  marginal upgrade; to get significant upgrades you'll need to fight with groups of people who are organized to kill tougher mobs.<br />
And you mention not having the epic drop from Naggy. Get a couple of levels and start going on Naggy and Vox raids if you have the chance. They both drop good haste items, and unless I'm missing something you need haste and it will take you months of farming HK to afford the 36% haste Naggy drops. On a practical level, the haste items dropped by these dragons are probably better for you than the epic drop.<br />
If you are not in a guild yet, you should start looking for one that will be happy with you and that you will be happy to be part of. If you are in a guild, start doing things for your guildmates. You will need their help to get better gear. Help them with their epics, their gear, their raids; if some of them do tradeskills, help them with drops they need.  I think the spiders in EK, for example, drop halfling parts, so look around to see if any of the higher-level shaman you know does alchemy. Believe me, you can't have too many friends among high-level clerics, enchanters and shamans.<br />
This is a minor point, but in 20 minutes and for almost no pp you can be making better arrows than you are using. EQ Traders, check it out.<br />
Finally, and this is a major point, thinking requires no plat. Think about ways to be better tactically as a warrior and to help other group members do their jobs well and people will want to group with you. They'll know your gear isn't the greatest, but if you play well your gear will actually cause people to go out of their way to group with you so that they can help you get better gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since you chose agnostic instead of Rallos Zek (shame on you!) you can't wear Fierce Heraldic which would have been a very nice upgrade. Look for some heraldic armor that isn't deity restricted. It will cost you a pretty penny, but if you save up it's worth it.<br />
<br />
I would suggest going to SolB or Lower Guk and getting xp. Levels are more important. When you hit 51, 54, 57, and 60 I think you get some nice ~150-250 hp boosts (I think those are the levels, correct me if I'm wrong it's been a while).</div></div><hr />
