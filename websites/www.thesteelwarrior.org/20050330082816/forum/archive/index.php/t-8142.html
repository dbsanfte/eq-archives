Does the effect stack with the other procs on your weapons?  I'm mainly concerned that if I have my SEWS with Rune III and Anger III, does this effect then add a THIRD proc to that?  If it doesn't, what does it do exactly and why do lots of folks like it?  Just curious as I may have a shot at this soon and am looking for anything that can help with aggro. (damn dps Time equipped melee!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, thats what it does</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It adds a third proc to your main hand weapon. It is not affected by Weapons Affinity, and is checked after the 'real' procs on your weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks for the fast replies gang!  So, I guess my next question is, is it worth it to spend my DKP on?  I'm thinking yeah, cause any more aggro generating procs that I can put on my weapons are a good thing.  But I want to make sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes they stack (in a particullar maner).<br />
<br />
if you have an A3 auged SEWS, and that you click the SotP, you wil have potentially three procs on your SEWS. but remember that you can fire only one proc at each time, that the order of proc checking is Weapon Proc then Augment Proc (never tried what happen with two aug proc) then the spell proc (you can have only one spell proc at a time, if they don't overwrite each other because they are on different buff slot then only the one closest to BuffSlot1 will fire). Moreover, the spell proc chance is not increased by WA, all of this situation goes to a sad result parsed on PoN board : with WA0 you will have aproximatly 2 ppm for each proc with a little decrease, with WA5 wil have 3ppm for the first one, almost 3ppm for the aug one and much less than 2ppm (around 1.5 if a remember) for the spell one (looks like all the before procs eat the chance for the last to proc).<br />
<br />
for more explanation look at the library there is a thread that link to other boards parses.<br />
<br />
<br />
SO yes it is worth it to have one spell buff that give proc. put it's up to you to chose the one you want depending on cost/power/accessibility.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE : with a DW combo we can thus have 6 procs firing, this his how we can get to 10 ppm with WA5</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that spell procs don't check off WA and only proc from mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinterdir</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoP logs at ~1.5ppm no matter if you are DW'ing or not, so yes you could say it procs only of mainhand and is not affected by WA<br />
<br />
What Yoda is saying though, is that you get up to 10ppm with WA5 with 3ppm MH, 2.0ppm MHAug, 2.5ppm OH, 1..5ppm OHAug and  SoP (1.5ppm) <br />
<br />
add CE Effects and you are in Proc-Heaven</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to say 3ppm for MH weap + 2.9ppm for MH aug + 1.5 ppm for MH SotP + 1.5 for OH weap + 1.4 ppm for OH aug = ~10.3 ppm</div></div><hr />

<br />
(i know i really should test if for my self on a off day)<br />
<br />
any feedback is appecieated</div></div><hr />

<br />
thing is:<br />
- most MT fights you could hold agro with a Primal Stick once you have it<br />
- what songs are you twisting right now and is it worth sacrificing one of them?<br />
- does it stack with other imbue's? ,)</div></div><hr />

I have never heard nor seen any bard song that had a proc  !  could you give us the link of this song and since you are a bard you could try to test it yourself for the stating issues (group with a knight for the spell proc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The song is like Katta's Flash of Blades or something, procs a dex debuff.  I'd think you can only proc one thing via buffs but even if not, it doesn't seem like it's worthwhile to sing a dex debuff proc instead of AC or more DS, or even Rizlona (overhaste = more aggro too I'd assume).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Katta's Song of Sword Dancing (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2604&amp;source=Live)  is the song.  I agree, there might be a very small aggro boost but it's just not worth it over other options.  Overhaste does boost aggro by the simple expedient of boosting dps :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't stack with cripple, so you won't see it used much, at least on raids.<br />
