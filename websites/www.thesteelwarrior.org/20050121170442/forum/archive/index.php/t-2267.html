My guild whacked Agnarr and Lord Mith. Marr both for the first time this week. <br />
<br />
Mith Marr was just a matter of DPS and aggro control... but it was still very satisfying to see him drop after failing a couple times in the past.<br />
<br />
Agnarr.... now that was a kill! Took us three failed attempts over the past few weeks to gradually improve our strategy, but this time the outcome was never in doubt. We had him from wire to wire. Very satisfying.<br />
<br />
Small potatoes to those of you in the elementals/time, but for this cat it was what I would call a damn good week.</div></div><hr />

It's always nice to hear when a fellow warrior moves that much closer to Raex =D</div></div><hr />
