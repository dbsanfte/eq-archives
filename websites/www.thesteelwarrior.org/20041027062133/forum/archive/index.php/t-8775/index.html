<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A question for the masses... what does everyone think is most important to keep intact for EQ2? Do you think they've left anything out from what you've seen on the website/videos/gameplay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">High end content..<br />
Killing dragons is the bread and butter in a Med Fan game and this is what EQ always brought us ( before going killing snakes, gods and some abominations ).<br />
There's a need to see a goal for high lvl, not only about gear and powers but really a big badass mob that gives you the &quot;omfg&quot; effect when you see it 1st time..<br />
<br />
And as far as I've seen, there will be dragons in EQ 2 !!!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">plus if you read into the lore scattered around, i remember reading that Naggy was freed druing whatever catastrophe tears norrath apart, and that he is currently &quot;whereabouts unknown&quot;. AoW is in the lore as being around also. wether these two, in particualr, will be fightable mobs in the game, or more storyline driven like mayong mistmoore, i do not know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Expansions with Kunark quality!<br />
<br />
Old days EQ promoted explorations - while present day EQ appeal to lazy kids with short attention span. Reward adventure and courage, like in the old days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Indeed, it seems like the dragons will remain but I think Sony might be pulling away from letting people kill gods and instead have the avatars able to be killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Terrorblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not that it has been in the game for quite some time for the average player, but they really need to go for the &quot;wow&quot; factor.  Anyone else remember back when only the original EQ was out and the first time you went on a journey from Qeynos to Freeport?  Hit Kithicor just as it turns nighttime and BOOM skellies all around.   :eek:  WOW !! OMG !<br />
<br />
Or the first time you fought a blue mob and bam! it does something totally unexpected.. &quot;WOW,  wasn't expecting that&quot;.  Anymore it's all pretty much the same ol same ol... this mob is such and such level so this mob can do this and/or can't do this.<br />
<br />
Put some excitement into the game again, some unexpected twist.  I don't like to die, but if I die to the unexpected, at least I can get a chuckle out of it.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Exactly, they need something to keep our attention beyond the 3 minutes you give a new game. If they have that; then they have sold more than 90% of the rpgs that come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Everything I have read about EQ2 is that there will be no content that is &quot;raid&quot; content.<br />
<br />
Everything in EQ2 is supposed to be killable by an average six person group.<br />
<br />
This is the &quot;difference&quot; between EQ and EQ2.  EQ will be for the &quot;raid&quot; crowd and EQ2 will be for the DAOC/WoW crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If I remember right, there are indeed a type of raid, but the max amount of players in the raid will be 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Correct Kaesorn. Supposed to differ from zone to zone or instanced quest as to how many can join per encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am really hoping to have a feeling of awe like I did the first day I set foot in Norrath.<br />
<br />
I know I am probably hoping for too much, but I really look back on the first time I ever logged in and think &quot;That was great&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i hope i can get that feeling from it too, i missed the EQ feeling, i only started playing EQ last september.  EQ2 will be interesting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarladar Davilan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think that EQ still has that WoW factor. Just we remember back to when we where killing rat's or when we where being chased by the vengful lycist and seeing that huge bear on the tundra following a barb.  all that is still &quot;Wowziers&quot; to people who have not seen it.  I mean i was totally spell bound at the sight of Quarm.  Or even during the raid event's in qvic uqua. the content to wow some one is still their and even though their are bug's and things that seem to just go bumb in the night it is still their just not every one is making it to the &quot;Endgame&quot; and so their expectation dies out with spending to much time in the bazaar and doing to many ldon's... But i preorder eq 2 hehe :) just becuase the char.'s look awesome and that video that comes with the preorder is freakin awesome tooo  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hookers and blow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hookers and blow<br />
<br />
That'd work... I was thinking anything to make the goddamn game fun again  :(   I never got &quot;burned out&quot; on the game, I just woke up one day without the desire to ever log on again.  The game just isn't fun anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Honestly I am hoping that EQ2 is fairly different from EQ. The one thing I would totally hate is to buy it and log on the first time and think This is EQ with a better graphics engine. <br />
<br />
I think they have a lot they can learn from the mistakes made in EQ and I honestly hope that they can find a way to not make them in EQ2. I know some of you will say I am asking too much, but a brotha can hope can't he?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hopefully enough of us get into beta to give them good enough feedback so we can see some good changes in the game if it needs it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hopefully enough of us get into beta to give them good enough feedback so we can see some good changes in the game if it needs it.<br />
<br />
Were talking about SOE.  The BETA is not to &quot;change&quot; anything.  It's to stress the servers (3000+ per server) and to verify bug fixes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">True, but then if they didn't listen to us, they'd end up with no customers and a dead game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">True, but then if they didn't listen to us, they'd end up with no customers and a dead game.<br />
<br />
I have noticed patches in beta that address some of the feedback given. That is as much as I am willing to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That's good. As long as they don't cave in to the gamers and they can maintain a good game also; that's what is important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Can't say a whole lot other than I am extremely impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dundanoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm that's good news. I wish they'd send me a beta key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>lilogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Or the first time you fought a blue mob and bam! it does something totally unexpected.. &quot;WOW,  wasn't expecting that&quot;.  Anymore it's all pretty much the same ol same ol... this mob is such and such level so this mob can do this and/or can't do this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so where did the WOW factor go?  Very simple.  First people who see any new major encounter go &quot;WOW, WTF was that?&quot;.  Then they try it a few times and beat it.  Within a few days, it's plastered over all the websites, strats are posted, etc.<br />
<br />
The guilds following up don't bother trying to figure it themselves.  Everyone flocks to thesteelwarriors and other similar sites, read up on the encounter and then to ahead and replicate.<br />
<br />
Understand where the &quot;WOW&quot; has gone now?  It's not about adventure anymore, it's all about loot, loot, loot.</div></div><hr />
