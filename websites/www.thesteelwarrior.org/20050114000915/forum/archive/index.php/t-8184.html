<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok was looking for some suggestions in what to do with my gear. Guild is currently starting into planes almost solro flagged and we are clearing VT each time it pops. Was looking for some upgrades so I can increase my tanking ability for upcoming encounters in PoP since we are working to elemental planes. Here is the magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1046892 . Basicaly I know I need new wep and some more hp I have about 200k to spend. BoC run about 350 and with guild killing AoW when we can and leading Cursed and PoI dragon raids hoping to snag a EB item from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly you need AA's.  But you can make a lot of improvements right away by putting some attention to your gear.<br />
<br />
Your absolute top priority should be to replace those pieces of Blazing Fennin Ro armor.  They are crap by any standard.  Keep them in your bags as clicky toys.  I would kick off your 200k spending spree by buying replacement items for those slots - practically anything would be better, but cultural or ornate would be decent investments.<br />
<br />
Most pieces of ornate would be an upgrade for you; I'd suggest spending time grinding your AAXP in SolRo, where you will get ornate drops perhaps 1/hour, thus killing two birds with one stone.  The other place you may like to spend time is in LDON to amass points.  You probably don't want to buy LDON armor, since you will be getting elemental and VT gear in time.  Aim to buy 40 hp and 10 AC augments with your LDON points.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svan</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh ok, didnt say that toon was an alt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well he is more then an alt he is my hydra. I have a well geared cle/nec I play on all raids well except for vt since I am still working on his key. My friend and I am going to Droga to camp the sword of blood and ChoS for agro weps till I can get some pure Agro weps. Just need to work on some better gear I guess been grinding EF adventures for aug/aa to get some more Defensive aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svan</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">definately look for higher ac gear. pretty much any warrior gear in VT has great ac, so get yourself keyed and grab what ya can. get your LR and ID done and you could probably do hard EFs pretty easily, the bracer that drops there would be an upgrade. once you get your anger augs grind out some more points and get some RA for slots you dont fill in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright thanks working on key we raid everyday except for fri so tough to get com2 kill/ hardcore exp grinding. Have a friend with ranger/enc who is gonna start doing ef ldons with me before raids so ca try to knock that all out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welp got a deal on BoC and grabbed obsidian smitar. Now working on some more gear down to about 36k now though. 300 points from anger 2 aug for boc not been working on ec yet. Question one any know what droppable would be best upgrade for the pp and should I finish up CS3 CA 3 or work on planar durability now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates, Bloodmetal Earring, and another Helanic Bracer. There are more upgrades but would cost more than 36k each.</div></div><hr />
