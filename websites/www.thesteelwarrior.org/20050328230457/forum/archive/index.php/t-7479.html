I was just wondering what kind of money making strategies you employed around this level and what upgrades would be pertinent. In case you don't know, prices on my server tend to be insanely inflated (confirmed after checking Bristlebane). I'm talking people trying to sell Centi Shortswords for 3k. It's so bad that as of now I'm in newbie gear, except for crusty gauntlets, and then banded in non visible. Weapons I'm using are a centi shortsword (got lucky and found one for 250 pp the other day) and a lightcrawler antenna (have had it since level 13 or so). Any ideas are much appreciated.<br />

While you can do something like farm wisps for GLS or similar things, it's probably quicker in the long run to grind as high as you can as quick as you can, until mobs drop cash gems, several plat per kill, etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually that's very encouraging. I haven't yet noticed an inability to handle things of my level, I've just noticed that others of comparable level are much more well equipped than I am. Equipment envy I guess. Well, I'm just going to start grinding, hopefully I'll last long enough to make cash for upgrades. Thanks.<br />

You may want to look at the crafted quests for some armor upgrades. You should be able to solo some of the upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">another good lowbie tip is to invest in 10 slot contaienrs ( gnome tolkits from icclad fit the bill ) .. and just keep all the drops like FS weapons; collect tradeskill items; and things of that nature. it's a ong slwo road at your level but money can be made from the upper level toons working on tradeskilling and rather purchase items than famr greens<br />
<br />
and as mentioned..just focus on levelling more and get to the zones where the more pricey items drop. levels are your best investment plan IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion the best thing you can do is just level and have fun.  Do not worry about gear too much.  When you group make sure the group splits any plat gained at the end of the night and you will build up slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrunkWithPower</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only unfortunate side-effect from the crafted armor quests is the costs for the gems to get them made.  I've found on the older servers it's cheaper just to buy armor, and the stats are better anyway.  kinda sucks the way the economy and expansions have changed the way people play the game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RonsterM</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm personally astounded at all of the &quot;vendor trash&quot; I've sold off over the &quot;years&quot; for little or no plat only to find out later that those items were worth good plat if sold in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I realize that you're only 29 now, but I'm sure that there are items you are selling for a few gold to vendors that are worth good plat if thrown on a trader.  Again, I realize these items are out of your range, but are examples of what I've come across that surprised me, as to their value in Bazaar on Tunare.<br />
<br />
Honey Berry Pies from mobs in Dreadlands.  Small Velium Pieces from spiders in Velk's.  Mt. Death Mineral Salts from gobbies in the Mines of Nurga.  The list goes on and on and there are items from every level range/zone that sell for considerably more than what a vendor will give you.<br />
<br />
The best advice is to pick up everything you can hold and swing through Bazaar before you head to a vendor to unload.  With some quick searching, you'll find those items with a high return.  In short order, you'll learn what to hang on to and what to let rot.<br />
<br />
I'm constantly finding something new that I've sold, sometimes, hundreds of for next to nothing that had much higher value if sold to players in Bazaar!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, friend!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the server economy is borked, then doing a couple of the crafted quests will make sense to look into (that is, get the drops &amp; buy the gems from vendors).<br />
If you do check out crafted, you'll be in South K. You can solo at the spires around splitpaw. Gnoll hide lariets, which drop off the gnolls there, are an underrated aggro weapon, especially once your dex gets up a bit. Gnolls also drop a mask that is a light source and might be something you want to keep for a CR run, and a +CHA neck item. If you are selling lots of loot over time to vendors, then do yourself a favor and bump your CHA before you sell (make friends with a shaman, because they have +CHA spells). It's a small thing, but everything helps.<br />
See if you can find some tradeskillers around. You can farm spider silk (tailors), and spiderling silk (smiths) and low quality, high quality and medium quality hides from EK lions or from rockhoppers (smiths again, also some tailors). You can either sell these in the bazaar or trade them directly to a tradeskiller who is skilling up on armor that would be an upgrade for you (fine plate would be an upgrade, heh).<br />
The idea of learning what stuff is needed by tradeskillers is a good one. <br />
The Centi weapon you have will work for a while on that server, I think. <br />
There are some warrior only weapons that might be a bit cheaper than general weapons; though I know nothing about your server's economy, you might check them out in the bazaar: Jarsath Trident (11/22 primary/secondary piercing, STR 5, DEX-5, STA 5, AGI -5). The combination of negative stats, piercing, and (I think) warrior-only on that weapon tends to reduce price. But you'd be interested in the damage/delay aspect. It would make a good primary weapon and you could put your Centi in the offhand &amp; bank the Lightcrawler thingy for when you get big and want to show newbies what you had to use back in the day. Also the Sarnak battlehammer (2HB, 30/40). Long ago it held aggro surprisingly well for me at your level.<br />
You might research the Goranga spiked club (12/23 1HB primary only, AC +5, STR +2). YOu can't get this yourself, but it's a no-drop item in Maiden's Eye that sometimes just rots on mobs near the zoneline. You *might* get one for free if you ask politely to loot any extra, but be careful getting there and be careful not to get aggro or you'll be making a long CR. If you can't do it now, keep it in mind for later.<br />
Finally, go to EQ traders and research fletching. You'll be able to make usable arrows and a bow in a relatively short time for not much cash. You don't have to pursue fletching in the long run, but minimal effort will at least get you a bow and arrow set up suitable for pulling/tagging mobs, and every little bit helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quato</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you answered your own question in your original post.  If on occasion you can find a Centi Shortsword for 250pp but people are trying to sell them for 3k.  It may not be the most fun to play broker - but I think untill you are in your 50-60s the easiest way to make pp by far it to play buy low sell high in the bazaar.  The fact that your economy is bad makes this all the easier.  I watched one person start with basicly nothing (300pp) and in a matter of a month he had 150k.  <br />
<br />
Personaly I couldn't enjoy playing like this, but then again a short sword of the ykesha was 120k when I was lvl 55 so its all relative.  The gear you have now is GODLY  for lvl 29 by old school standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drgncore</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first time post here, but just started a warrior cleric dual box combo on a new server that friends play on.  Basically started with nothing - tutorial stuff and that was it.  By the time I had hit lvl 8, I had 4kpp, by lvl 12, cleric had done her newbie quest armor from guild trainer, and warrior was decked out in some decent gear.<br />

<br />
Basically I was able to accomplish this by means of collecting every spider silk and spiderling silk I could muster during my lvls 5-8 in nektulos forest.  Also, before the server came down for a patch, I began vendor mining every vendor in neriak and bought all the spider/spiderling silks I could.  Vendor sells em  for like 1sp each and resell to players for 10p or so a piece.  I was able to afford those cause I had sold a stack of silks earlier for like 50p ( my bad ).  What I ended up with was 200 spiderling silks, and about 200 spider silks, a handful of pelts and a few high end tinkering tradeskill items that I put up for sale.  Before I knew it, every silk was sold, a handful of the pelts had sold and a few of the tinkering items sold.  Viola! 4k'ish plat was laid in my lap at lvl 8.  Warrior got the bulk of the gear upgrades as he's the tank and has to keep the cleric alive.  But soon will be trying to equalize the gear distribution.  Tradeskill farming and vendor mining is also a very profitable excercise.  Enjoy<br />

<br />
  That it is. In addition to silks, wolf/cat/bear pelts are very valuable. Low quality and up can be used for the padding for fine plate armors and as a result go for a very nice amount. Really, it is a very decent money maker for lower level characters.</div></div><hr />

Brewing was easy to grandmaster to level 250. I make lots of profit selling Qeynos Afternoon Tea and Kaladim Constitutions in the Bazaar. Average profit is about 5kpp a day on my server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can hit the sister island in OOT and get belts that sell for one plat to a vendor and if there is a way you can split the small hut on the hitt  you can get a 10+ plat sword to vendor. These mobs are level 25 that are static spawns... if you get one on the island that wonders around they drop the same belt and a rusty halbert and are about 15 in level...<br />
<br />
go to the enterance to CT and the lizzies out there drop fine steel and are mid 25's i believe. easy to make about 700pp in 3-5 hrs of camping there killing just for them and if you get a crusader you can finish the quests and get the armor for the SK's epic and sell it in the baz for plat...<br />
<br />
hit the gorge off east karana and the evil eyes there and get the evil eye stalks there for about a plat each and you get gems and jewlery for decent plat abd they are like level 20 or 25 if i remember correctly.. if you get the braceletts they drop that should be another 100-200 in the baz selling them...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 29 you could probably take on the mammoths in everfrost, should be nice xp and the tusks sell for 7-10pp at the adventurer camp there, there are also the spiders that drop silk for you to kill, my 35 warrior can take the mammoths down easily, and as an ogre rallos worshipper i'm not kos to the barbarians either, bit of a bonus i guess :D made over 300pp from the tusks in like 2 hours time, maybe not much but the mobs are not that hard and xp is okey.<br />
<br />
There are also a few gnoll camps in stonebrunt that drops some armor that you can sell for a bit of cash, not sure if doable at 29 though, at least not solo.<br />
<br />
Another spot is the ships in dulaks harbor, had a few blue diamonds drop here and those sell for like 100-150pp to vendor, will need a healer here since mobs seem to have a bit of hp, getting there is a bit harder and invis is a must, the path to the zone is filled with mobs that aggro, but the xp and loot is well worth the hassle of getting there, probably not to nice for a lvl 29 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not vendor any blue diamonds you come across. They are a component in cultural armor and players will pay you far more than a vendor.<br />
Also, if you do go to the Beholder's (the Gorge off EK) and kill evil eyes, you might try selling the ivory to players rather than vendoring it. Ivory is a component of Tribunal cultural armor and as far as I know (bleh, haven't really checked lately) it is not sold by any vendors. Not as much demand for it as blue diamonds, but you're much more likely to come across it, and any smith who needs the ivory...well, needs the ivory.<br />
If you go to Ocean of Tears, bring a fishing rod. Fish while you med up (assuming you'll need to med). There's a component of human cultural smithing that can be fished there. Not a big demand for it, but you never know.<br />
If you go to Everfrost, do not vendor any of the mammoth meat. It's a component of Halas 10-pound meat pies, and is not regularly stocked by vendors. The meat pies, over time, have become an uncommon method of skilling up in baking, but some bakers still make them. You won't get lots of plat for the meat, but it belongs to a specific category of tradeskill items that it's hand to have around incase you meet a tradeskill addict. If you see a baker looking for these things, give them to the baker for free. It's a very good way to meet characters who are far, far richer than you are, and believe me, that can be handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Imthe Gnomad</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, was quite awhile ago when I made my non twink warrior I played originally, but I had a little system I found for making quick cash and such, first off, he was a troll when they had Grobb for a residence and there was a quest for turnin in 4 froglok tad fleshes for a rusty 2 handed battle axe, so, I'd do the turn in, get my rusty axe, sharpen it (all the meanwhile building my smithing), then combine it with a water flask to melt it down and get a large brick of ore that sold for over a plat.  I kept doing it and smithing was going up, kept getting xp and faction, then making about 1pp profit each time, froggie fleshes sold off merchants for like 1 silver.  Eventually I farmed merchants for more rusty 2 handed swords and axes and made profit there also, eventually buying 2 opal encrusted steins for buying/selling as I smithed in profit,  eventually enough to buy some crusty armor by the time I was lvl 15.  I eventually hit Solusek A for groups then all the twinks said I could loot everything, so all the ore, FS weaps, money drops were mine, as well as tradeskill stuff that peeps were happy to take off my hands for some change.  I eventually hit 34 there and had some decent weaps, defiance in primary, centi LS in off, Shieldstorm in backpack for a 2 hander, so hopefully there may be a similar quest for ya or you can muster up some farming time, bro.  also, grouping in FM at giant fort might get ya some cash.</div></div><hr />

two eggs gets you a random peice of leather armor.<br />

Discord had no PoK so getting to far places was a pain, but....<br />
in the Paineel newbie zone, snakes there have the highest drop rate of snake egges... sometimes even up to 4 per corpse.<br />

Full suit of leather isn't too much, but you can get it on your own, and sell the extra peices you get....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groovdog</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone else said go to eqtraders. Look at what droppable items people need to ramp up their tradeskills and xp on the guys that drop that stuff. I have spent 20K in a sitting on low level tradeskill drops (these items from 20-45lvl mobs) and the margin was huge for the people I bought from (like 200pp for a high quality rockhopper hide).<br />
<br />
Of note, I wouldnt &quot;take up&quot; tradeskills (i.e. make stuff) but rather farm for high characters who dont want too (as I said above). I would pay special attention as mentioned earlier to those doing tailoring as its the worst farm trade skill (all skillups take farming to do). Silk as pointed out is just the first step and the one that you can do at the lowest level. Eventually the high quality hides drop off the higher stuff (metal off of Velks etc.) and hell even highly sought (in fact most highly sought) tradeskill stuff drops off elemental/GoD mobs.<br />
<br />
Finally pay special attention once you are higher to stuff that drops for the quests associated with the Coldain Prayer Shawl and the Aid Grimel quest. Those are the ultimate tradeskill quests and someone doing AG can expect to spend at least 300K (more likely 500K depending on your server) of farmable stuff to complete it (assuming they dont farm it themselves).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarrabas</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All depends on server economy .. especially tradeskill-items. There are servers you can earn a few 1000 plat by killing spiders for the silks and buy your first FBSS at lvl 10. There are other servers where all tradeskill-products are spammed to the market for production-cost (or even below) and regarding drops at least one trader has some hundred silks or such for a few gold pieces. Other horrible expensive tradeskill stuff like rockhopper-hides are camped 24-hrs-per-day. On Bertoxx e.g. you can sell BDs to merchants for the 238 pp as lowest bazaar pice is 239 pp (yes - they place it on trader for 1 pp profit).<br />
<br />
If you picked one of those 2nd-category-servers there is also a high chance not to get any groups as 70 percent of the low-levs are twink-alts and your &quot;crappy&quot; gear (especially whe playing the tank)  causes downtimes 'cause healer run low on mana keeping you alive as none of the twinks goes for simple blue-cons like DL at lvl 40 but will want you to tank in KC at 38. Well, it's easier for caster - they simply nuke less to hide missing armor and a dyed robes may still look *uber*.<br />
<br />
If I watch at my gear I realize 2 things: a) Like 4 years ago this gear would have been &quot;godly&quot; ...  b) today I find monks 10 levels lower and having more HPs/AC.<br />
<br />
So if you picked the &quot;wrong&quot; server you definitely WILL have troubles with strategies like &quot;first level up then cash up&quot; or &quot;check bazaar before selling to merchants&quot;.<br />
<br />
When being on such a server you can check bazaar for idiots. Forest loops e.g. sell for like 280 pp to merchants. You won't believe how many smart traders I found selling them for 150 pp or even less in trader mode (just to dump everyones prices). Or spells that sell for 20 pp to merchants can be found for 2 or 3 pp on traders. So my advice: Figure out merchant prices and check bazaar then ....</div></div><hr />
