It eats 10th ring, replenishment ect.  What the fuck is the point in using it when you have a 20 min regen buff lol.  This shit is totally useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100 x 10 HOT is a paultry sum anyway. The metric is basically a L44 Paladin HOT heal x 2.  I am stumped as to why they added it and why it was such a small amount.  You get 1000 HP back after you are done.  The question is, is your Endurance better spent doing something else or what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also if you use it while fighting on accident, it starts the timer anyways, so you have to wait 5 more mins.<br />

It's a nice skill, just needs some tweaking.</div></div><hr />

The point no warrior can solo in pop at level 63..secondly if they find a way to do it im sure they will have regen for 25 a tic...so healing will is 75 a tic for 10 tics and eats your regen buff..fucking good going.</div></div><hr />

So don't solo in PoP.  <br />
<br />
Not everything has to be useful to everyone.  I'm sorry this cancels your l33t fucking dain ring.  I'd kill for a dain ring, and I sure wouldn't be bitching about healing will overwriting it if I had one.  Perspective man, perspective.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, having solo'd, it's something I've done many times. Heck, last weekend I tried outracing one of Quarm's DoTs after we won by right clicking the Warlord's BP. It's been a tradition for me since the first time it happened against Trak the week Kunark went live.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how many level 65 Warriors carry that thing or a gauze press around with them. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
But I've also enjoyed the need on another character to carry a Glowing Stone Band in case the sun set. Thank goodness that the designers relented (I think) and it doesn't get as dark now as it once did.<br />

The endurance cost - over half my endurance each time - means I won't be using it on raids for &quot;topping up&quot; between fights.  I also won't be using it in exp groups because I will be getting healed, and I still won't want to use up my endurance.  As for soloing, what the hell is that, exactly?  Oh, right, something I haven't done effectively since level 20 or so.  <br />
<br />
The only time I see this possibly coming into play is if I'm farming greens for something, and they somehow manage to do enough damage to force downtime.  So its a /disc for farming?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a situational disc. If you like to solo in PoJ when you are bored, it comes in handy, if you had a bad pull of 5 mobs and after all of em everyone is lom-oom, you can use it to top you up *shrugs*. Last week my healer in the adv died and the monk kept pulling with the ranger healing me while we were waiting on the healer to come back to the dungeon, that disc would have come in handy between pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it has something to do with BW being faster and healing more than clicky bp does.  You know, 90 in 10 secs vs 100 in 14.5... funny that.</div></div><hr />

As it is right now just about every disc uses up too much endurance.<br />

Mend is way overpowered at this stage and to ask for anything remotely like it is pretty silly.  If it bothers you so much that Healing Will sucks so much don't use it.  You never had it before the patch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying out Healing Will lately and I think it needs to have its upkeep cost slashed to 1/3rd or so and then it'll be fine.  There's plenty of times you can use it.  If you think there's going to be a lull in the action just pop healing will, and it even goes away on its own when you don't need the heal anymore (i.e. hit autoattack).  The upkeep on Healing Will is 33 which basically uses up more than defensive/evasive/stonewall overall (10/10/11) so it is always inferior to Stonewall for sure (it can save 1K in healing easy in the 3 minutes with no real drawbacks).  If the upkeep is around 10 then you can just use it and not worry about losing half of your endurance pool, and whatever healing you got out of Healing Will will be just a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zuko</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also pay attention when you 'cast' Healing Will . Got to be standing up LOL.<br />
<br />
Methinks cloning caster's abilities without deleting the 'caster' stuff is needed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO Healing Will is 100% useless in it's current form.  If they want to make it useful make it a 500 point instant cast heal that still drains 60% of your mana.  Then I can at least use it if a heal is going to land late.  I can get almost as much healing for zero cost by just clicky my SS BP and probably more if I used Bind Wounds and had maxed AAs for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing will is pretty useless in its present form. Dunno how much it's worth it to improve it, but I won't be using it much.</div></div><hr />

I had a tiny window of time to play with the new stuffs with a couple of guildies the other day.  Yada yada ... had a wonky pull, long fight and the cleric was OOM and I was low in HP.  /bonk'd myself for having forgotten to pick up Healing Will at the time, as a top up would have been good.  We weren't at any risk of wandering MOBs, so it wasn't a big deal.  For me, 1000HP is near to 20% with the usual XP buffs.<br />
<br />
As some've said - situational, moderately useful, and mebbe not even useful for everyone.   I'm satisfied with it, as it isn't even the sort of thing I would have expected as a warrior in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll probably get flamed for sayin g this, but...<br />
<br />
We're pure melee. Having a spell like ability to heal ourselves at all is a gift horse, let alone a spell like ability that heals close to the same amount of HPS as a shaman or paladin of the same level.<br />
<br />
The fact that it's limited so much is of necessity, as, guess what, we're NOT HEALERS. It HAS to be that way to keep balance, otherwise guess how quick the pallies and shamans would be screaming unbalanced, and calling for nerfs.<br />
<br />
There's an old saying, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. If you think it sucks so bad, don't use it. I know for myself, I'll be using it to recover from downtimes, rezzes, lom healers, and the like, as I have since it was put in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno.  I get about 1300 hps from healing will, I can reuse it every 5 minutes which is handy if I want to get a bit of AA solo and don't have a lot of time for a group, and really it doesn't kill my END too much.  I have no problem with it, no way I should be able to mend or something like a monk.  Its a nice toy, and useful in certain situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why the fuck are we getting this again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used it four times now.<br />
<br />
And each time it's served its purpose.<br />
<br />
It's on the right timer. It's cost is fine. It's refresh is great considering how limited it usually is.<br />
<br />
The disc is fine for what it is. A situational skill that helps you in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Being a monk I probably have a different perspective though. I have my EMERGENCY skills that help me elude death. And so I never felt this would be one of them.<br />
<br />
Mend, Earthwalk, Voiddance and good ole crappy ass fail-when-I-need-it-MOST Feign Death.<br />
<br />
So all I ever planned to use Healing Will for was the occasional downtime healing boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wonder why they wont allow you to use clickys with it? rubbing a bracer takes no focus to do... so why does it stop me from healing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I thought it was only a 500 HP heal.  If it's 1300 then I could see some people using it for reducing downtime while soloing.  I don't see much point in soloing but some people do it.  For xp groups and raids I see zero use for it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you never have a moment of downtime between kills in xp groups or raids where you aren't 100% health, you never get rezzed, and you never lose any HP while farming tradeskill components/faction/plat, then yes, there is zero use for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jumelin</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well its better than having fuck all,,might be a small amount but its better than nothing</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, in true Sony style, they nerfed even this paltry capability.  Now, healing will can ONLY be used when not engaged in combat.<br />
Harumph.</div></div><hr />
