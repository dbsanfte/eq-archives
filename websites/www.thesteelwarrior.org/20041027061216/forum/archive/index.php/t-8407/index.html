<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im trying to find out information on doing the Ikkinz groupable trials.  We have a large portion of the guild KT flagged and now we are looking to start Ikkinz raids.  But from what I have read so far theres some trials that takes a group to do before you can raid Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
From what I read it only takes one person to start the raid.  But I am assuming you need a group to complete the trials to be flagged to start the raid.<br />
<br />
As far as tactics whatever you dont have to post those.  Just if possable post what is needed and how you start these trials to get flagged to start the raids.<br />
<br />
Thanks as always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To be honest, I don't really remember.  I gather all the information you need though is pretty easy to get from the NPCs hanging out in Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ikkinz Group Trial 1: Singular Might<br />
Speak to the NPC near the ZI of KT first. He will give you a  good history lesson and tell you to go talk to Ganek (I may have mispelled, but he a FD NPC near the  3rd temple to the south) When you run through the dialogue with him (you can be invis, but be careful, there are multiple npcs in the area, including some see invis pathers) he will give you SM Trial. The zone in is in 1 of the 3 tunnels that are at the back of the temple and go north, middle, and south (this should make sense when you see them)<br />
<br />
A lot of see invis mobs in the way here, but you can normally figure out which tunnel you need to run into before you run to save yourself. I suggest using lev and invis to go as high up the south wall as you can.  Using fortitude will help here, and you should be ok since it is unlikely you will need it for the first hour on your first couple of trips.<br />
<br />
PA , if it spawns for your trial, will be the 3rd mob you pull if you skip the roamers. Roamers respawn, nothing else does. I will leave the rest for you to learn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ikkinz Group Trial 2:  Twin Struggles<br />
Far south temple. I forget npc's name, but you have to defeat Singular Might before you can get this one. Basicly, once you understand how to get to  SM you cna get to TS easy.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz Group Trial 3: Don't remember offhand, have not beaten TS yet<br />
<br />
Good luck, Ikkinz is a lot of fun imo. And very few spoilers, so you actually get the enjoyment of learning most of the encounters yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are the trials done with 6 people only?<br />
<br />
Is there a specific group setup that works best?<br />
<br />
Does everyone that plans to do the trial need to do the dialouge with the NPC at the KT ZI?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Yes single group, you can swap folks in and out to help with different situations if needed.<br />
<br />
- Just the exp leader needs to talk to the kt zi guy. After that you can dz add / swap to your hearts content. <br />
<br />
And hope you like the zone, because your going to see alot of it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are the trials done with 6 people only?<br />
<br />
Is there a specific group setup that works best? <br />
<br />
No can be done with less ppl if u want. min=1 max=6<br />
The best group setup for trials are having warrior with 2clerics assuming ur HP aint any near 12-13k.<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter (or shammy for slow but I really do recommand u get chanter)<br />
Wizard (or somekind of burst dps class)<br />
(if ur chanter can not deal with warrior's pull get FD class here if can get dps class)<br />
<br />
I have done the trials with 3 ppl. I 3box warrior, wizard, cleric and 2 friends with cleric and enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xolerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did Ikkinz 1  4days ago, the group was:<br />
1-Warrior (My self, 2kAC, 10.5khp, 275 AAs) using Bloddfrenzy(anger3) + Aegis of earth<br />
2-Chanter (really good one, elemental geared)<br />
3-Cleric (elemental geared)<br />
4-Ranger (Time geared)<br />
5-Druid (elemental geared)<br />
6-ShadowKnight (Elemental Geared)<br />
<br />
PA was up and we killed him np, when we got to Diabolic destroyer I first engaged with Fortitude while Ranger use TS disc. Chanter did have any trouble with Adds and Cleric + Druid heals were fine to keep me up.<br />
Won Glyphed Ring =)<br />
Now will probally try Ikkinz 2 soon =)<br />

Using 1h+shield on those trials is really silly, since you wanna it is one of the few situations where your DPS is actually meaningful.</div></div><hr />
