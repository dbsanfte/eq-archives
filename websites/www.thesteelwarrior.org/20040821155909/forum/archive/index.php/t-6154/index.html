12.8% better without counting a 40% disc is not enough ?  Wow.  I guarantee you we dont mitigate 52.8% better then an Enchanter under any circumstance.<br />
<br />

<br />
First of all, &quot;12.8% better mitigation&quot; is misleading. You're comparing how much damage a paladin mitigates vs how much damage a warrior mitagates, which gives an inflated number which doesn't reflect reality. A more real comparison, and what's generally accepted, is putting it in terms of damage taken. Why is this? Because say you have a guy who mitigates 20% damage, and one that mitigates for 40% damage. The 40% has 200% or 100% better mitigation than the 20%, but in terms of damage taken, it's not half as much as the guy with half the mitigation, he takes SEVENTY FIVE percent of the damage taken by the one with low mitigation.<br />
<br />
That mitigation difference in this case means that a warrior will take 91.8% of the damage of a hybrid , so 100% - 91.8% = 8.2% less damage taken.<br />
<br />
Noone here is claiming that it isn't enough or that it should be more, thanks.<br />
<br />
And it's 45% for defensive, not 40%.<br />
<br />
Not at all surprised you've try to find whatever number is biggest, though, considering you're one of the big activists of how much paladins suck and how much they need upgraded over at PoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The parses that I've seen (and performed, myself) lead me to stop caring about the mitigation gap.  It's going to exist.  It always will.  It SHOULD always exist.  The mitigation gap is noticeable, and should be.<br />
<br />
The avoidance gap is -huge,- however.  A warrior and myself, within 50 AC of each other (no Avoidance, and I have more Shielding), have a massive difference in percentage of attacks that simply miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brodda Thepp's parses show that there's no big difference in avoidance between the classes.... there's a 4% spread, with paladin at 40.4% miss, SK (with +10 avoidance) at 44.2%, and war at 42.2 % miss. In fact, the hit percentage is within 2.2 percent between war/pal/SK.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5868<br />
<br />
Not a huge difference...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Daemonwynd, the mitigation gap is there everyones known that for a long time, look at how often Knights take spikes though thats where the real problem with Knight mitigation is, we take far far far more spikes, from my parses I took approx 2.5x more spikes than a warrior with 400 ac less than me (spikes being defined as di rolls between 15 and 20), also you're forgetting the componded effect of taking less damage overall while having more hp so that gaps actually bigger than you said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, Brael, the fact that there is a difference in mitigation has never been in question... but just HOW MUCH of a difference in mitigation exists has been a topic of hot debate for quite some time.<br />
<br />
Again, take a look at the link above, if you look at Brodda Thepp's parses, especially comparing the histograms, the evidence is that there is no such 2.5x difference in spike damage.<br />
<br />
And no, the less damage taken is not actually different from what I said. The damage taken has nothing to do with how many hitpoints you have. You state that you have to taken into account the more hitpoints the warrior has, and I say YOU have to take into account how much can be mitigated with stuns or healed with lifetaps and pally heals, and buffed with hybrid HP buffs. That makes a difference too, you know... you can't just count one thing and not count another if you want to go that way.<br />
<br />
It's a good thing I'm talking only about how much more damage is mitigated, and not often cheals need to land, isn't it?<br />
<br />
The only difference the hitpoints make is how much faster that means heals have to land, which is a VERY difficult and nebulous number to pin down. And as I said before, while yes, you have to take the increased hitpoints into account, you also have to take in heals, stuns, and buffs as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Brodda isn't the only one with parses you know, and has he even parsed the higher end GoD content yet?  I have.  It's too bad I can't stun stuff and have healing that results in 1/2 the total hp swing Paladin heals (~1/4 the healing at lower mana efficency when considering total swing).  I really dislike being compared to Paladins simply because they're a more popular class when balance is brought up because we're quite different classes and the only thing meant to be equal between us is our tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
With our top heal, it goes even further in Paladins favor if a 2nd tap/heal is thrown in.<br />
SK: 49.75 damage/sec, 54.75 heal/sec, 104.5 total swing.<br />
Paladin: 269.16 heal/sec<br />
<br />
It's a good thing you brought that up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">by all means, let's see your parses. Brodda Thepp's not the only one that parses, but he's the only one that's brought hard data to the table so far.<br />
<br />
It's a good thing that paladins are superior to shadowknights defensively, by the way. They are, after all, a DEFENSIVE hybrid. They SHOULD have a survivability edge with their spells, they SHOULD have more efficient heals and more useful ways of reducing damage... that's what they DO. Just as a SK specializes in the offensive sub-role, adding damage to themselves and others directly and indirectly with their spells.<br />
<br />
And while we're talking about abilities that help out, how about the SK's indirectly reducing the length of the fight and therefore damage taken and heals casted via their abilities to increase their own and the group's damage?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Daemonwynd heres some parses, unfortunatley the design of the fights used for parsing makes gathering samples very tedious so the sample size is low, but unfortunatley thats what there is to work with since I can't exactly 2 box a cleric and CH for a couple hours to parse the mitigation on the mobs in question (mob used in these parses is Rav Interceptor btw).  Cut some of the data since I don't think posting things such as the healing between each class is relevant to this, the main thing being watched for was how Knights/War's mitigated as far as chance of taking spikes and where the average DI for each hit was (which means the -1 DI roll undisced and benefit of the dmg reduction on each DI from defensive are removed from this comparison).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The most interesting thing about those parses seem to be they show a clear benefit for going from 2200-2250 AC to 2650 AC+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The benefit of AC was already known, most interesting thing I found was how much more often the SK got hit for higher values compared to the Warrior, have a parse of a 2650 ac war I can post as well if I find it in my logs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">good start, now show me some in the same situation with a non defensive warrior.<br />
<br />
Saying that a SK is going to spike higher than a defensive warrior is a pretty much a &quot;well, duh&quot; statement. Defensive biases data like you wouldn't believe, especially taken without its inherent limitations in cost and refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Defensive doesn't adjust the DI values (other than you being on a 20 value vs 19 value system) so it's irrelevant there, the damage value of each DI gets adjusted but as you can see I didn't even take that as a consideration, non defensive would throw what I'm looking at further in favor of my argument because the data set for the last one would only be 4 values vs 5 and when a Warrior rolls a DI20 it simply rerolls until you get a non 20 value correct?  That would make you end up spiking even less and as I've said the dps of these mobs is manageable its the spikes that destroy Knights, we're taking them far to often for any sort of semi reliable tanking.<br />
<br />
BTW you completly missed the point of the heal comparison I made earlier, check the total hp swing not just the heal part (obviously sk's will be lower there by alot), it isn't even remotely close even with the damage my heals do taken into consideration.</div></div><hr />

If this is true, then the 5% mitigation only has any effect when the mob hits in the top half of his hit range?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, after all this time the real definitive answer is unknown. I can't disagree with Frodlin except to point out that if what he was saying is true then Warriors would see a min hit below DB + DI. It could be.<br />
<br />
Others have argued (and I think provided parses) that Warriors get 20 different hit values than other classes. I'm pretty sceptical.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt that DI=19 and DI=20 is the same value. This would show up in hit distribution.<br />
<br />
I've argued that for Warriors the hit formula is effectively<br />
<br />
hit = DB+(RND(19)*DI) rather than the usual<br />
hit = DB+(RND(20)*DI)<br />
<br />
this could be determined to be untrue with a parse showing 20 discrete warrior hit values for a given mob.<br />
<br />
It would be an interesting thing to know, but I think not terribly important.<br />

N= 2  War = 1.9<br />
N= 3  War = 2.85<br />
etc etc<br />
N= 19 War = 18.05<br />
N= 20 War = 19<br />
<br />
probably some sort of truncation or rounding in there somewhere.<br />
<br />
I'll parse some stuff with my warrior and my beastlord later tonight and post the results.<br />
<br />
edit: just wanted to mention, that while warriors are hit for 20 unique values like other classes, they are not the same 20 values as other classes are hit for.  I could have sworn Min dmg was affected, but if its not, then its gotta be a rounding issue with N*.95.  After All, isn't N the number that varies and is affected based on Mitigation AC?  Its the D20 that's rolled by the EQ game engine that while mathematically different, is probably alot closer to old AD&amp;D mechanics wise than we realize.  Look at Defensive, at first it was thought that it cuts DI in half.  But Warriors under Defensive are still hit for 20 unique numbers, they are just lesser numbers than non defensive numbers.  So current thought is, it must be DI * .45 (due to the added 5% warrior bonus).<br />
<br />
Stupid question here, Does Min Damage change while defensive? if it does change when total mitigation = 50% (45 def +5 war), then why wouldn't it change when mitigation =5% (natural 5% warriors have innately), other than when the rounding of N value of 1 from .95 to 1.  if it affected DI such as DI *.95, then you would see different min hits the higher the DI of the mob.  DI = 100 mob should be DI 95 mob and have a different min hit in the formula, but if N = .95 it can be rounded up to 1 and keep the same min hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">No, minimum hit on a warrior is still the same as everybody else.<br />
It all depends on rounding.<br />
<br />
If this is true, then the 5% mitigation only has any effect when the mob hits in the top half of his hit range?<br />
That depends on the DI. If the DI is 11 or greater, your min hit will always be at least 1 lower than anyone elses. If the DI is 6 or greater, your second lowest hit will always be at least 1 lower than anyone else's. <br />

Most xp mobs in PoP have a DI of 12-18 or so for the first couple of tiers and 15-22 or so for the next couple of tiers.</div></div><hr />
