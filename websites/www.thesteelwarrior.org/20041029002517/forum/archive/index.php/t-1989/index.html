<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know of a good one? I want to get my guild into this fight as we can all use CHSD...Heck I would use both melee drops. That said I get the feeling I will need to do a bit of work to get them excited and moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would also like to see a Guide if there were one out there <br />
<br />
I am leading a Guild Event against this Dragon Friday Night</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Turn in a copper node, a bundle of super conductive wires, and an intact power cell to Nitram Anizok to start the event.  Follow him around the zone and protect him from the trash mobs that will aggro him.  When you get to the dragon area, he walks up to the dragon and it becomes targetable.  Dragon is slowable, hits for 1300, so he's pretty mean unslowed, but not bad after slow lands.  Might lose a few tanks if you can't get slow to stick early.  If you're just after the loot I think it's ok if the gnome dies after the dragon is targetable, but you won't get factory flags unless you keep him alive.  Been a real long time since I did this, so somebody probably has better infoz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To quote Fiath: Thanks B!<br />
<br />
*hmmm Faith*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One other thing, don't rely on a CH chain.  He has an ae stun.  Though it is resistable, it has a bad habit of hitting clerics at the worst possible time heh.  (500mr cleric would get stunned always at the worst possible time for us =p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Erm, so what do to keep the MT alive? <br />
<br />
Which also brings up the question...how long is this fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">remedy heals, takes a few minutes. prob need to chain cast abolish disease on your tank to keep him unslowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just use fast heals.  Fight isn't long, he has very few hps.  He also has an ae snare, I don't think there is a slow component to it, unless it's been changed recently.  When we did it I stayed snared the entire fight with no difference in my attack speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks very much all<br />
<br />
This info will really help me on this Lead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When playing the follow the gnome game use the usual &quot;mem blur&quot; techique to stop him at key spots.  We had 2-3 tanks run out front to agro trash, kill, move up, stop gnome, repeat...  The dragon as stated above is rather straight forward.  I remember his AE was a pain in the butt...but a good defensive MT with a couple of good healers will make this a nice win.  The CHSD is a fun toy ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With the Mem Blur<br />
<br />
That is Mez him when you want him to stop, then Mem Blur <br />
<br />
Or Mez, Break Mez, Mem Blue<br />
<br />
That is the tactic correct</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You need to have ONE person, usually a monk or FD class, attack the nome to stop him. DO NOT mez or you run the risk of making him depop.<br />
<br />
What we do is have a warrior usually ( since we have a lot of them ) follow behind the nome. When he gets to close to a mob the warrior will agro the nome and just let him beat him silly. When the raid force is far enough ahead a cleric / enchanter memblurs the nome and he keeps on walking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, thanks for the Info again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">is lucy accurate when it shows that the recast times on his 3 ae's are 60/45/30 sec's ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Best advice I can give you if it's your first time is have a Chanter babysit the gnome all the time.  If you don't know the way the gnome will lead you just make sure to mez as soon as you see mobs and clear them first them mem blur etc. etc.  Once you get it down pat takes about 30 minutes or so to clear to the dragon.  <br />
<br />
Best advice I can give you before you fight him is mez the gnome before the Dragon's Door.  Keep him mezzed then pull the 3 mobs in the room out and kill them.  After that rebuff/med/afk etc. until everyone is ready then have the MA and healers go in there to make sure they can reach the MA with heals.  If they are far enough away can avoid all or some of the AE's I don't remember.  Extended Range for healers is nice on this guy and OMG his snare sucks so bad I don't know why they just don't make it a root you walk slow enough.  That's about all I can remember oh and GL with getting the Hammer to drop I've heard of him being killed 20 times and still no hammer :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Xanamech does NOT slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Really<br />
<br />
I have always Heard he was slowable, but yet to see it for myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WarrdOrf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Xanamech is slowable.The follow the gnome mez/memblur method is arguably the easiest way to do it.Just have a pally ride shotgun with the chanter for any back pops you might encounter.Best bet is to mez the gnome before the door to pull the 2 mobs from inside the lair and give yourselves med/buff time.First couple of times he'll prolly chew thru a couple of tanks but after a few attempts hes such a pansy.The fight should last less than 3 mins if you have the dps.Once you get feel for it you can go from zone in to kill in 30 -35 mins.<br />
<br />
Just remember dont block the gnome or he'll depop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">prob need to chain cast abolish disease on your tank to keep him unslowed. <br />
<br />
Xanamech doesn't slow you.<br />
<br />
I have always Heard he was slowable, but yet to see it for myself <br />
<br />
Xanamech _can_ be slowed ...  if he couldn't, would be a helluva fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks I think i misread a post was all<br />
<br />
I saw the <br />
<br />
Xanamech does NOT slow.<br />
<br />
And took that as saying he couldnt be slowed, had a brain freeze, understand now, meaning he doesnt cast slow<br />
<br />
Fight happens Tonight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Our guild has farmed all we needed from PoI dragon...we babysit with chanter every time and never had a problem.<br />
<br />
Follow greyslayers method and yer golden. Slow dragon asap on spawn and fight should be 2mins or less. Always let yer MT get aggro solo a bit before raid engages though...if you ping pong him your chances to wipe go way up.</div></div><hr />
