<br />
I'm wondering if I should just stick my Aug in the bank and work on getting a weapon with Type 8 slot, or if I should return it for the70% points I'd get at this point.  I'm lvl 57, and get between 20-30 points per LDoN, so I had to do a lot to get the 510 points for this Aug....<br />
<br />
The general question is: what are some good recommendations on a first Type 8 slot weap for a War?</div></div><hr />

You mean the type 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the anger augs for non time/god weapons are from EF. Same price so you'll need to get some more wins there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer your original question, &quot;what are some good recommendations on a first Type 8 slot weap for a War&quot;, the answer is: none.  Type 8 slots are only found in zones that are harder than Elementals.  I don't think there is such thing as a tradeable item with Type 8, and I'm not aware of any type 8 weapon that is one-groupable.  Although, now that I've said that, I'm sure someone will provide an example of a tradeable and/or one-groupable type 8 weapon. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, you probably should have bought the Type #4 Anger II augment from EF instead of the type #8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popss</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sell it back and and save up for the anger 3 type 4</div></div><hr />

Type 8 items are a long way off for you unless your local uber guild decided to PL you to 65 and flag you for Time or high end GoD. Also, save up for A3, a single A3 augment in your mainhand has the same net hate as 2 A2 augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep, and it cost almost the same (2*510=1020 &lt; 1150). <br />
... but two A2 will proc more often ... so might be bettter for better chance of early aggro. I mean, it's better to get 400 hate every 24s than 600 every 35s. for the early lvl, where they don't have 305 DEX and WA5, increasing the number of proc is possible only by increasing the number of aug, so 2*A2 may be better for him than 1*A3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Follow Wandor's suggestion if you are having little problem with aggro; buying the Anger III first is the most efficient path to get where you eventually want to be. In fact, Wandor's suggestions are typically the most efficient way to get to where you will eventually want to be as a strong 65 war.<br />
<br />
However, Yoda's suggestion will get you more hate sooner. Following his suggestion would simply mean that eventually you'd probably end up selling back the Ang. II augs, though, and having to do more adventures to get Anger IIIs.<br />
<br />
Being efficient is generally better, but it really sucks if you're MT and can't hold aggro right now. It's one thing to be attempting the most efficient path, but quite another to gimp your groups for dozens of LDoNs and whatever else you do in the next 8 levels while you efficiently save up for Anger III augs. So, if your standard fighting partners are okay with your aggro generation, save for Wandor's path. If aggro is consistantly unstable and you frequently serve as MT, try Anger II or Yak on your mainhand (making sure that your mainhand is a weapon with a good innate proc-- ie, droga). If the quicker-fix Anger II or Yak stabalizes your aggro, save for the Anger IIIs. That way you only have to sell back one Anger II.<br />
<br />
It depends a bit on your grouping situation, too. If you group with the same friends all the time, you can actually explain what you plan to do in the augment department. They might be okay with you waiting for the better stuff later.<br />
<br />
Basically, you'll have to balance your current aggro needs against the obvious advantages of long-term efficiency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
type 8 weapons in PoP only drop in Time, starting at stage 2 -&gt; raidforce<br />
type 8 weapons in GoD only start dropping in Ikkinz Raid 1 -&gt; raidforce<br />
<br />
there are 1 groupable random nameds in Qvic of which one can drop a weapon, name escapes me right now, will provide it later, but it's a PoS at that stage of the game tbh. :P</div></div><hr />
