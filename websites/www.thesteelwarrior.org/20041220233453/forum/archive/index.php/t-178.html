<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok ive been playing around with magelo, reading post and such, starting to doubt my tankablity lately, yea i made that up<br />
<br />
when i made my warrior (dwarf) i followed the old castersrealm guide to stat allocation, because i had no idea how EQ worked, it had me putting stats in dex, agi, str, and stam, so spread thin, i know people say stats dont really matter you can fix it<br />
<br />
so my question really breaks down to, at lvl 50 what kind of HPand AC am i looking for, and what do i need to start doing.<br />
<br />
im not sure if 50 is high enough to start doing thurg stuff, i had collected a few indicolite items, but i dunno if i should stay focused on those things.<br />
<br />
would i be better off holding around 52 for vox raids and such and work on gear farming and AA to pass the time, <br />
<br />
<br />
summary: any recommendations on what AC and HP to shoot for, and what kind of gear things should i be working on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1K AC is a great target to &quot;shoot&quot; for.<br />
<br />
But don't try and do it right away. Just shoot for it. Once you get it, raise the bar to 1100. Then 1200.<br />
<br />
For HPs, go for as many as you can.<br />
<br />
Shoot for 3k, then 3500, then 4k unbuffed as you level on towards 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thurg is good.  Work on thurg stuff, or PoG stuff (its basically the same)  Cultural armor is great too, if you can afford it.<br />
<br />
You really should post a magelo so we can see what we have to work with. Would help tremendously when giving gear advice.  I dont wanna suggest anything cause i dont know what your wearing atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">magelo, duh, im such a newb<br />
need to make me a leet signature sometime as well heh<br />
<br />
here ya go:<br />

<br />
the snowchipper was a loot i got from helping a friend with his 8th shawl, so dont think im all rich, im very poor, main is a war, wars dont farm well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now im just assuming your hp and ac in the magelo are correct.  Magelo screws those up sometimes but if they are correct you aren't doing too badly.<br />
<br />
I would say try and find some more enchanted dwarven plate.  Slots like hands and arms.  For the old cultural, Enchanted dwarven is realy some of the best stuff around.  With the newer (blue diamond) cultural armor the dwarf warriors got F***ed over.  But as this is out of your price range i won't rant.<br />
<br />
You should pick up the enchanted dwarven arms.  The ac and hp (sta) isn't top end, but out of the droppable peices you commonly see in the bazzar there isnt' much better, and nothing beter for under 1k.  Maybe try and get an idol of the thorned for your range, you should be able to get a group down there at 51 without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Other then that i sugest is ding a few more levels then head to seb.  Fun zone and at 55 you should be able to tank there fairly without too much trouble.  Its a good zone to make plat in, and hey, you may get lucky and have a seb beserker cloak drop (random off of &lt;insert your favorite theory here&gt;.  IMHO its the best droppable peice of haste gear.  9ac 9sta, 75hp and 26% haste if memory serves....  Bonus is most people just look at the haste and price it that way so you may be able to farm your way into buying it.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, start with the enchanted dwarven.  And just go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a skull-shaped barbute. Its like 50pp in the bazaar on my server. :)<br />
<br />
Second try to save some money for Valorium Ring of Gallantry (6.5kpp), Earring of the Solstice (5.5Kpp), Vah Shir Claw Earring (1Kpp), Cloak of the Maelstrom (2.5Kpp).<br />
<br />
Maybe change the shoulders to a Tattered Mantle from Gullerback, which should cost around 200pp.<br />
<br />
Also maybe a Silver Chitin Wristband, if its not too expensive on your server. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalaz</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My general rule of thumb while levelling up was to try and get 20 x Level in AC.  Not a huge goal, but it worked out farily well for me, at least until I got into the mid-60's.<br />
<br />
As people have said, Thurgadin stuff is good armor if you can get a group in Kael.  50 might be a touch low for real Arena farming there, but in a good group you can pull it off.  Skull-Shaped Barbute is a great item for how common it is.  Might look into getting another 6 AC 65 HP ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cheap upgrades:<br />
<br />
skull shaped barbute (mentioned above)<br />
2 orc fang earrings<br />
crystal spider eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I would have the FBSS, no stats, I like stats with my haste. I spent time in bazaar buying and selling, 2 weeks actually and then i had enough to buy 3 peices of cultured. I rock now, only started with 1000pp and had 25k after the 2 weeks. So if you can hold off on lvling for a few, you might want to just work hard on trading your way up.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is me now.<br />
<br />
Also what server are you on?<br />
Are you really agnostic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">proud dwarf on bristlebane,<br />
and yea im really agnostic =(<br />
<br />
when i started EQ i came off a MUD i was a GM on, and in this game, wis was MR, str dramatically affected dmg, and dex determined how often you got hit, since i heard from IRL friends EQ was completely different i found all the info i could on the net, alhakazam seemed hard to navigate so i followed castersrealm creation guide. I would have went ogre at the time but i couldnt afford luclin, and i couldnt stand the old models (no offense to ogres) so i went with the next best war with night vision (not slandering halflings, gnomes, etc i was new and didnt understand then) so that brought me to dwarf.<br />
<br />
the cultural is really nice i like it ill try to save up for it.<br />
<br />
speaking of saving, most of my money comes from going with my 54 druid friend and chain pulling seafuries, we take turns on looting rares and it pays decent, i heard the suggestion of trading my way up through gear, and im actually doing that in effort to aquire a stonebladed axe of dismay (44/44) anyone have any other suggestions on the cash grind, i been working on my faction by slaughtering the warrens, to get a key to paineel, anyone know if the guards in paineel are truly soloable by a war?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashurr</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">YES very easily soloable (is that a word?)  at your level.  Also, just to say that 44/44 axe would be a great buy for you, it's a nice weapon and fairly cheap!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh slashurr hope u plan to stick around the boards man, it would be nice to have someone whos a confirmed bristlebane warrior be able to confirm stuff here and there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say one of the things you could do to really help yourself is get some friends and do the &quot;plate house&quot; in kael.  This is the royal house that is part of the 9th coldain ring.  If you start the cycle and finish it yusually a couple plate items drop, pretty much how i got all my thurg armor.  We got a bunch more drops that you would ever get in the arena, and it was fun to do.  <br />
     Orc fang earing wouldn;t be a great improvment  . . . save up for the earing of solstice, and Val Shir earing those are some nice earing slot items.  I'd ditch the mushroom veil for crystal spider eye's.  Shoulder slot items are where dwarves are screwed bad (just not much available for us).  I wear crested spaulders (had them since i was 40ish).  There is a easy quest (dragonic pauldrons?) if you are on CoV faction.  I would also suggest you get another 6ac 65hp ring and ditch the other one.  I would also suggest you try and sell the snowchipper, it's kinda slow and proc is not much aggro.  Get a frosty, and get something like defiance for your main hand (or just sell the snowchip and upgrade a few armor slots).  I had a snowchipper and hated it  . . . even with 255dex it never wanted to proc for me, when it did really didn;t help aggro at all.  The dwarf cultural is pretty nice, but you may find thurg is much easier to get (because cultural can be so expensive). <br />
   As far as goals just keep raising the bar for yourself, and don;t get too discouraged.  At 50 i was in full crafted barely 2k hp's and an ac less than 950.  I just kept working on it, grinding away in sebelis upgrading each slot as i could.  It would really help you if you have a good solid guild to help.  We farmed the crap outta umbral planes . . . heck even my alts have killer weapons outta that zone.  Just set yourself realistic goals, look up stuff you can camp on alakazaam (or do with guild) and eventually you'll reach your goal and then set a new one ;-).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashurr</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey kalan.. is kalantek your EQ charecters name?  I'm going to look you up sometime...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye thats meh name,<br />
<br />
i think ive seen u in PoK here and there <br />
<br />
been trying to find u to discuss that other thing u mentioned on a different thread<br />
<br />
we will catch each other....eventually</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are about to enter a few levels that I found really hard - getting to 55 is hard work. <br />
<br />
Dont sweat you equipment or stats - I am an Ogre with maxed sta and while it helps at 65 with no shammy around its of limited use really. The 44 44 axe would be a great bit of kit for you.<br />
<br />
What I did when i didnt have much cash at lev 50 was to be quite mathmatical with the equipment I could buy and the upgrade it gave me (6 ac 65 hps are unsurpassable on this formula - as also are Crusty legs for the 14 sta)<br />
<br />
If you dont mind doing it - selling the 'Chipper and get a Frosty. I would get a Snare Whip also as I used it to 58 with great agro. In the other slots try and Cobalt (Legs, Arms, Hands) as its real cheap now because Thurg MQs are dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
A good cash camp is the Geos in CC - often camped but if you could go there with you 54 druid mate you'd make a lot more than Seafuries. Unfortunately the best advice on making cash to upgrade is.... 1) Trade, suck the blood of your fellow player etc 2) Level to 60ish and go and farm Seb, Chardok, etc for the items that sell for 1K each 3) beg from ubers who cant be bothered to sell their shit<br />
<br />
Above all - enjoy your game, warriors are the best =)</div></div><hr />
