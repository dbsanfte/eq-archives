<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lynetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I am in a small non raiding guild and I like it that way :)<br />
Second I do have a cash flow issue...SOOO asking this from a LDoN perspective....<br />
<br />
I am planning on replacing my Helm of Raldukan, Helenic Tundra chest and legs with Mal Helm from EF and Tak BP and legs.<br />
<br />
Now the question I have is this....what are the best augs for those three slots? Before upgrade I have 230stamina unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Should I go for Vengence on another effect in the slot threes? and also 40hps augs for the slot 2's or should I keep going with Stamina til I max out?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice in advance. I dont have a Magello because my gear isnt good enough to warrent the cash output.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, and you can get STA augs for free as drops in the dungeons that will go in any slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Senthiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree also.<br />
<br />
I am currently working on getting myself up to more hp's as well but have opted for working towards HP augments and Vengeance and the like.<br />
<br />
besides.. once I'm bored with aa's enough.. I can always dump into inate stamina. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lynetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Regen or Vengence? or a combination?<br />
<br />
I did see the Aura of battle aug in Guk....was thinking of saving for that one too.<br />
<br />
Its going to be a long process, but I think it will be well worth it.</div></div><hr />
