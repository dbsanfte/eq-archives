<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we've all had our experiences with LDON now, and where as on a whole I tend to like the expansion, I beleive it is going to make matters worse for the plight of the warrior.<br />
<br />
1) Weapon Augmentations are nice....but all of the good aggro producing ones(stuns, snares, slows, Hate procs) are all usable by any classs so I beleive this will do very little to help in this aggro area since many of the same procs are good Direct Damage procs anyway and will be used by most classes for increased DPS.....<br />
<br />
2) While we concentrate our points we earn on augmentation our weapons with slows, stuns, hate procs, as well as DD in order to try to increase our aggro generation.  Paly's and SK's, who worry not about aggro spend their points augmenting thier armor with HP augments and AC augments.....further closing the gap in these areas.<br />
<br />
3) A couple things I have noticed in my experiences in LDON that could make matters worse for warriors going LFG for hours on end once everything gets settled down and people start to become choosey about their groups:<br />
   a)The only mobs that tend to need Defensive is the &quot;Boss&quot;  Mobs  on the seek and destroy missions.  <br />
  b)Since it is hard to tell what situations are gonna arise in these type of dungeons,  The more flexible your character class, the more multi-facetted your char's abilities are.....the more desired it is.  So a class that can FD, Tank very well, Snare, Dot....hold a mobs aggro like glue WILL ALWAYS be desired over one that can...well just tank.  Because of this I see the problems we first start seeing in PoP becoming even MORE Widespread in LDON.<br />
<br />
Overall I like LDON.....but the above things I mentioned will only make problems worse for the warrior....hopefully making the Hybrid classes non tanking abilites more useful(as LDON DEFINITELY DOES) is SOE's first step to bringing everyones tanking abilites back into balance....we'll have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. FD, snare, etc are nice but are not essential in the tank. With Mobs that max hit in the 300s, aggro lock is no longer required, as even the most feeble Enchanter can take a shot or 3. I have functioned as a puller and MT in most of my groups and the job is doable. I can get 2-3 mobs 95% of pulls through use of prox aggro and any group that can't handle 3 of these mobs really needs some serious schooling in how to play.<br />
<br />
What really sucks in LDoN is itemization... but hey, thats nothing new with SOE/VI</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I find warriors to be at an advantage for your typical group.<br />
<br />
Most paladins my level don't have SU3, so the advantage there is gone, even in the undead dungeons.<br />
<br />
I'm finding that my guild adventures are more open to having a warrior as a tank due to the DPS advantage, and since aggro lock isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
And as it was said earlier, the only downside I've seen is that of itemization... but we're getting used to that, sadly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are Correct Wulfran....those abilities are not essential in a tank......but I was talking what will end up being PREFERRED....same as in teh upper plains.....Warriors can typically do fine......but Knights are PREFERRED.<br />
Where you see mobs only hitting in the 300's as NOT requiring aggro lock.....I see as clerics having an easier time healing a SK.<br />
<br />
And Yes Frodlin, there is indeed value in a snaring tank.....but once again we lose out to some of our Hybrid-tank bretheren in that we are STILL dependant on a proc and the unforgiving Random Number Generator.....where as SK's can snare everyround untill either it sticks( as long as they have mana), or they are pretty sure it isn't going to land for some reason(immune or HIGHLY resistant).   Besides most Snaring weapons I have saw have prety crappy dmg(although they are typically pretty fast).  So to snare the mob we give up atleast some portion of our DPS, which isn't top of the list in the first place......not an Ideal solution, and in fact another reason for a group to choose a SK over a Warrior.<br />
<br />
I hope I am not coming off as a &quot;Glass half Empty&quot; kind of guy.....but I just get tired of my class getting little if no help in<br />
this game while I see Hybrid's taking over the only Role in a group that a Warrior is geared towards, while being just as powerful in the other areas as they always were.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warning, hehe  Paladin perspective here:<br />
<br />
Aggro control is a bit more difficult in general in LDoN, but since the mobs don't hit so hard there isn't as big a penalty for losing aggro.  There is a thread over at Paladins of Norrath where folks are asking if Stuns are less effective in LDoN than elsewhere.  I don't buy it, but some Paladins do.<br />
<br />
Knights are the 'preferred' tank in PoP, and groups are seemingly punished for taking a Warrior as tank.  In LDoN, Knights may still be considered the preferred tank, but groups will not be 'punihsed' by taking the Warrior.  In this respect LDoN is an improvement for Warriors over PoP.  <br />
<br />
I have to agree that the fact that Warrior abilities do not use mana is a help.  All casting classes have to watch mana use in LDoN.  There is pressure to kill mobs as fast as possible, so people tend to cast more.  This leads to rationing of mana after the first few encounters.  Warriors do not have to worry about rationing except for Defensive, and that should only be necessary for 'boss' mobs on some encounters (like the one that rubbed me into a greasy spot on one adventrure.. SPLAT!).<br />
<br />
In the adventures I have been on, off-tanking has been important.  There has been a Warrior on 2 of my 4 adventures, and they were vital to the groups' success.  One of the times I was MT, the other the Warrior was MT.  I preferred the Warrior being MT, as it left me more free to help with CC by root-parking and off-tanking.  In the groups where there was no Warrior, a Warrior could have taken my place and the group would have succeeded just as well as with me there.<br />
<br />
LDoN does not address the overall class balance issues that have been well documented.  It does provide a situation where groups should not feel encumbered by taking a Warrior though.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absor has said time and time again that expansions are not created to balance out the classes.  That would be a horrible idea, as not everyone will buy every expansion.  Classes should be balanced outside of expansions.  That being said, I have absolutely no complaints when playing -any- class, other than some being more/less boring or more/less work than others.  I'm really sick of the negative attitude around here!</div></div><hr />

I'm ready for something, anything to give. If everyone stopped bitching about it, then it wouldn't ever get attention. Granted it effects our local forum more than most others, but it deserves being addressed by the people we pay good money to as loyal customers at some point or another.<br />
<br />
Hell, atleast the old Verant would come out and say we were wrong, and continue to do nothing much like Sony does now without even a word as to what they are working on. <br />

It's quite frustrating as a consumer.</div></div><hr />
