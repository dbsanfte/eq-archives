<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxey</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone. I have started playing EQ again after over a year. So I was grouped in BoT today and although I have seen clerics melee before with their new hammer that procs (dunno its name) but this cleric actually stole aggro from me when she proc'd a few times in a row with her hammer. Which made me think, what the heck, they have given cleric what they always wanted, the ability to melee just so they don't cancel accounts but what have they given Warriors? Nothing special (ofcourse except our defensive disc from Kunark). I feel so bad seeing fellow Warriors waiting at zoneline looking for groups (yes, even ogres, and maybe especially ogres cause they are ugly harhar ;). I hope they fix our issues. Giving clerics the reason to melee is an out of the way special favor to the class. But what about us! :(</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised a cleric pulled aggro from you.  I've never pulled aggro with the proc hammer.<br />
<br />
I also hope they fix Warrior issues, and even give Warriors something fun to break their monotony. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giving a cleric a way to do damage at all without spending half their mana pool is a good thing mind you.<br />
<br />
That proc is unresistable, and does random between 75 and 150 damage every proc.  Sometimes you get lucky with several in a row, sometimes you rarely ever proc.  It's said to be around 30DPS overall.<br />
<br />
If a cleric is taking aggro from you using ONLY their hammer (not casting any stuns or whatever), then you've got more problems than just cleric melee.  That means practically any class that can melee can take aggro from you because they're doing more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have very occassionally had a cleric pull aggro if they got a lucky series of procs very early in a battle.  But it's pretty rare and usually only happens if I have hardly gotten more than a hit or two on the mob or if the Cleric has healed me in someway prior to my establishing solid aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bargran</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a lil word to say i love new cleric hammer, even if i m not a cleric :)<br />
mostly since LoTT flag NPC was bugged and we killed him even if he is invulnerable to all hits :D <br />
took a lot of time, as we only had 2 clerics :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fhylden</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hee hee, after a bugged hedge run, we vented our frustration on Thelin Poxbourne.  My proc hammer was the only real damage that landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm personally glad clerics have something to do which doesn't take mana to do.  I think they should get a similar type hammer at various levels and not have to wait till the 50's to do this.  They've ALWAYS been viewed as &quot;battlepriests&quot; who were semi-badass with 1hb's, the problem is that they have lost that in EQ, and needed it back, hence, the hammer, which was a GOOD idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen it happen once, and it doesn't make sense even when you factor in procs, and the cleric was able to do it consistently.  I didn't see all the spells she was casting since there's a lot more hammer proc spam than real spell messages but didn't strike me as she was trying to nuke or cast big heals right away.<br />
<br />
I'd say this is more like an anomaly than anything else though and certainly not something you need to worry about, aggro-wise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think a cleric with a proc hammer stealing aggro is going to happen very often.  Was in a group with somebody running a Real-time parser the other day and the cleric was doing 35-40 dps meleeing (including procs).  Not likely to draw aggro since the proc is just damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never been to BoT, but are there undead, I saw a cleric hammer that did like 10 bane dam to undead. This was hella damage, so maybe that was it =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fhylden</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the basic proc hammers are 14/18 with 10 bane undead.  The furious hammer of zek is 16/20 +10 bane undead.  That's a really nice weapon.  Unfortunately, at 63 with fully maxed offensive and 1hb skill, and with Mark of the Predator buff, I have a whopping 870 atk.  The hammer wasn't designed to actually HIT anything.  Its damage is through its proc.  If it happens to hit something, that's just bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no undead in BoT, although there are some in HoH and CoD.<br />
<br />
63 hammer is 14/18, +12 bane -v- undead.  You might think a 26/18 hammer would do some serious damage, but you'd be wrong; even against low-ac undead targets in Veksar, melee DPS without procs for a cleric is in the single digits.  Remember that a level 65 cleric is on the same damage table as a level 25 warrior and even at the highest end, a cleric won't much exceed 800ATK without buffs.<br />
<br />
If your cleric pulled aggro, she was rooting, nuking, or (most likely) stunning.</div></div><hr />

I'm convinced that's why they put Gems in-game.... to keep the LFG Warriors at zone-in's entertained....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it was more likely a combination of healing agro and a lucky round of procs, not to mention being in melee range. from personal experiance screwing around with my boxed cleric, those hammers really do proc alot, far more than any weapon my warriors uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Outside of the hideous proc spam, I like the cleric hammers.  Gives them something to do besides wear holes in the back of their armor plated pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxey</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually she only stole the aggro for a fraction of the second with her procs only but it made me think of all the changes made to the game recently. It remind me of my SK that I made in the Kunark era on Quellious and deleted it out of anger to start a &quot;true&quot; class, the Warrior. Yes, the cleric hammer is nice and all. Happy hunting to my cleric friends ;) Now with that out of the way I think I'm going to stay away from the game for some time. Till then I hope they will have addressed our issues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any idea how disbalancing that would be?<br />
<br />
Plus the paladins would start crying out for one too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch.<br />
<br />
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fhylden</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thought when I saw the cleric proc hammer was &quot;Ooh this would really kick ass on a mage pet&quot;.  But I couldn't give it away. :(</div></div><hr />
