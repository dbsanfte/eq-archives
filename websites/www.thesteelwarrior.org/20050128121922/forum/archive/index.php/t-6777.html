If it isn't though, why not just add something so that I and (probably) others can tell what threads we have been to. Maybe take the underlining off the thread topic? I don't know just trying to make a suggestion.  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They removed the &quot;mark read&quot; function when they revamped the boards.  Now it will mark a thread &quot;read&quot; if you view it for a certain amount of time, unfortunately that time is waaaaay too long, and you can't set it individually, its a boardwide setting.  I'd ask that they reduce the &quot;read&quot; time to something like 5 seconds, thats often all it takes for me to determine if I need to read a thread or not, or even to read minor updates to a thread I've been watching.<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't mind having the option to switch back to the &quot;mark read&quot; system.  I often leave TSW up in the background while I play and read as I get time.  With the current system I might miss updates to posts if I leave it up too long and it sets those threads as read due to having visited the boards.  Or if I come, read half of the threads that are updated, and have to stop to raid, or do a hardcore group, or something IRL.  By the time I come back those threads could be marked read.<br />
<br />
Having tried both, I prefer marking threads read, rather than having some arbitrary timer decide it for me.</div></div><hr />

The TSW skin has unread threads in bold face, and an indication icon.  Yer could switch to that (I'm assuming yer running the TrenZ one) for now.<br />
<br />
EDIT :: Switched skins .. TrenZ has a little blue icon for unread threads as well.  It's very tiny at 1600 * 1200 tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venox</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks Taloz. Everything seems to be working fine now.<br />
<br />
But then there comes another suggestion....<br />
<br />
I think we should have an option to switch between this &quot;futuristic&quot; forum skin and the old one TSW had (Black background/White text). I thought that the black/white color really set the tone for a 'warrior'. I'm sure there are plenty of people that like the &quot;futuristic&quot; setting on the boards but there might be a couple that like it the old way too. Is there anyway to make a setting to switch the skins?<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for all the help. :D<br />
<br />

Hmm ok found out how to change the skin on my own.</div></div><hr />
