<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi, i want to find out whether spending 250k-450k on a BoC be worth it? like issit really that good? lets hear your experiences :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say it depends on where you and your guild are raid wise. If you are just a casual gamer or your guild is not capable of getting a GBoS from the BoT Towers, then yes its worth it.<br />
<br />
I use one auged with Anger 3 and I love it. Ask yourself, will I get a better weapon within the next 6 months? If the answer is no, then buy it.</div></div><hr />

My sentiments exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it's good, but its not THAT good.  i have one from an AoW raid, and i love it.   i agree with it being an amazing item, but i dont know how anyone can justify spending half a million plat on it.  after all, its not THAT much better for aggro than a droga combo, and its not like the item has stopped dropping.<br />
<br />
i guess it depends on how good the rest of your gear is.  if youre beyond making good, strong upgrades to gear with buyable items, then go for it as you got nothin better to burn your pp on.<br />
<br />
you wont be dissapointed with its performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BoC is a really good weapon and probably over double the aggro of droga weapons, but yeah, i dont think thats worth 300k more honestly</div></div><hr />

Im not sure about other servers but on mine it seems there exists a large gap among guilds.  We either have those that cannot kill AOW or those that consider AOW an Orc Pawn and who's Warriors have way better then BoC so seeing a BoC in the Bazaar is very rare and when it is available its like 700-750k.<br />
<br />
I am VERY grateful I have mine because there was no way I was gonna loot one. Gonna Anger 3 it and mostly likely it will be in my main hand the day i delete my character :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been taking alot of considerations for agro into mind, so i figure I will tell you about what I noticed with a boc.<br />
<br />
First off, on my server there is a guild that is doin Time and doing it well but hasn't maxed every char yet, so maybe only half the war's have dark blade of the warlord. The interesting thing is that those warriors generally have an edge of eternity already, but still use a blade of carnage as their mainhand agro.<br />
<br />
anger2 = 400 agro<br />
<br />
any stun (even if resisted or immune) =450-550 agro varies nuke damage<br />
<br />
anger3 = 600 agro<br />
<br />
enraging blow = 700 agro<br />
<br />
anger = 1k agro or more (only on dbotw)<br />
<br />
It is easy not to notice the difference between a great blade of storms and a boc during groups, but it easier to see it on raid mobs.<br />
<br />
I used a great staff of thunder for along time. Then used a bloodied berskerker blade. Then I picked up a blackout on a ssra raid and wanted to try it out. So I borrowed a BoC from guild bank and fell in love. I added another stun proc to the mace. Was very nice, but still prefered the BoC mainhand. I raid tank and participate in some agro intensive groups. High flowing thought, shaman, druids and wizards. Boc is not good enough agro alone to not offhand something with atleast a stun proc.<br />
<br />
Now I use Bloodfrenzy and Blackout with each having a yak stun proc added. If i lose agro to a quick snare or slow, I have a proc within seconds later and any stun or eb proc takes agro back and I rarely lose it again. Agro is very solid except groups with a necro or wizard who have voq, but I don't have focus. I think getting a blade of carnage in my offhand.<br />
<br />
I know I mention alot of weapons, but it is to give an idea of what is better that what. BoC is not worth spending the plat on if you could benefit from buying alot HP gear, but otherwise it is a weapon you could end up sueing until you are time equiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The day I upgraded my CHSD/CHoS combo to BoC/CHDS I noticed a huge increase in my agro capabilities.<br />
<br />
It's worth it if your guild has 0 chance of ever doing AoW, or you will never get a GBoS.<br />
<br />
BoC/GBoS is a nice combo too though, so even if you do obtain a GBoS the BoC won't go to waste.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to answer your question about &quot;is boc really that good?&quot;. I would say yes, seeing as how it's the only buyable EB weapon it is an improvement over what you have. A BoC with anger3 &gt;  any other buyable weapon w/anger 3 in terms of pure agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and while you could buy some armor with that 300-500k, you can always just do LDoN as it sounds like you are not in a guild that prioritizes raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with Omnus.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't buy my BoC until I'd made sure my AC and HP were at a respectable level first.  Don't neglect your other slots.  Get the biggest bang for the buck (Solstice earring is a prime example of what I mean)<br />
<br />
The main benefit of a BoC outside of a raid environment is the high DPS XP group.  The easier you can maintain aggro, the more DPS your group can dish out.  This is much less of a factor in zones where you're fighting for mobs to pull (like BoT), but it's huge in the elemental zones where it's pull and kill as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
The Droga weapons are decent and will serve you quite well whilest you upgrade your other slots with Royal Attendant, or Ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">nobody can really tell you whether the BoC is worth it to you because we cant see your gear.  if you have strong gear that isnt easily upgradable, then yes it may be worth it to you.  if your gear is waaay subpar for BoC, then no you'd be better off with the droga set and 500k+ to spend on gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
<br />
the droga combo will get you by more often then not ... even on raid targets if people play accordingly.  strong aggro and a dead tank is not nearly as good as an alive tank with not quite so strong aggro.<br />
<br />
BoC is great .... but not 500k+ great ... unless that 500k+ has nowhere else better to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My perspective is different.<br />
I dont think a BoC is worth the money at all especially since the new warrior disciplines have come into play.<br />
Incite is far more valuable than any weapon IMHO.<br />
Boc does have decent stats, but any weapon around Copper hammer and up will do. Myself i found Great Blade of storms, Great staff of 4 winds both comparable agro while in LDoN groups. <br />
On the other hand, if you have an extra 300K+ sitting around why not buy the BoC try it for yourself and make your own determination. If it doesnt work out for you it can easily be sold to reclaim your money.<br />

<br />
I disagree completely. The Copper Hammer will not be sufficient aggro when you are grouping with elemental geared players. And incite is nice to have but in no way, shape, or form is it more valuable than an EB weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The difference in hate between stun and EB is NOT worth 400kpp.<br />
<br />
If you can't hold aggro with a stun weapon, you're not gonna hold it with your half a million platinum weapon either, no two ways about it.</div></div><hr />

btw i offhand CHoS with Longsword of Freedom sometimes and use GSoT for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">lookin at your magelo i would say that yes the BoC is worth it if you have the money.  buyale upgrades are pretty much out of the picture for ya it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have a very simple test to determine whether you should buy a BoC or not. If you have over 6k HP unbuffed, then chances are that there are very few tradeable items that you could buy that would be a significant upgrade. So, if you have 6k HP or more, buy the BoC and you won't be disappointed. I got mine at what I consider a bargain - 275k. I fully expect to use it until I have a DBotW+EoE combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I actually have to disagree with some of these statements.  When I used my BoC I found it to be kind of unpredictable, on longer boss fights it was great and produced stable aggro but exping I found that it was annoying when I'ed go through stints without procs.  This was a year and a half or so ago when farming CT was still all the rage, I found myself using my Gaud or TSBS almost exclusively.  Well as my guild farmed Luclin I managed to pick up a BF, HG and Emp and wouldn't you know that 9 times out of 10 I found myself using the Emp and bagging that insane DW combo.  I'm sure that I'll still perfer my 2h to my dual weild till I get my turn to loot a DBoTW.  Personally I'ed say keep using your GSot4W or acquire one if you don't have it and aug it with anger 3 if you're into ldon, otherwise just get the cheap 100 damage yak proc.  You'll find that with incite you're going to be holding aggro just fine for your average pickup group and doing great dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I spent 320k on mine last week...I had a guild loaned BoC for 6 months, but I was able to afford my own...not seen a BoW drop since early feb, and my DKP wont get me a SEWS for a while...so with nothing left to buy, I figured 'what the hell' and bought the BoC...if by some twist of fate i get a BoW next week, I can always just resell the BoC :)<br />
<br />
So remember, it's droppable, so you can always just resell it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are grouping with elemental geared players and you are at best a Bazaar geared Tank with a copper hammer THEY need to recognize that they need to assist you the MT in keeping agro and play differently.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thraxnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hmmm well this is wierd.. I borrowed a BoC while I was tanking from a guildie... with 295 dex (maxed for me still need a couple more AAs) it was procing after about 30 seconds of fighting... this said my Bloodsworn was procing 3 or 4 times a minute... with Windworn handblade in my other hand... so I actually got a reduction in agro off useing BoC... needless to say I switched back to my original set and continued to use them... keeping agro off the person who then used BoC/ inovators hammer..  this is without taunting or inciteing after an initial incite pull and taunt after slowing. <br />
<br />
haveing done this I'm not going ot be buying a BoC if I get one killing AoW fair enough but I'm not going to waste my cash lowering my agro ( this was observations over 5 hrs in tactics... 2hrs before I got BoC  and 2 hrs using BoC/bloodsworn then 1 back in original set)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i promise you they both have the default 2 per min proc rate .. no more no less.  you just got very unlucky.  i've had standard weapons that have procced more than 10 times in a minute .. and the same weapon will fail to proc for more than 3 or 4 minutes in a row.  in the end its all about the random number generator gods and how much they like or dislike you at any given point in time.  the base proc rate is the same on both.<br />
<br />
blade of carnage is superior in dps, stats, and in proc strength.<br />
<br />
a successful taunt after slow will bump you up to slow aggro lv if you had not already attained that level.  incite is very handy (not sure the exact initial hate value or the hate over time aspect).  assuming that the other warrior wasnt trying to take aggro its very understandable how he didnt.<br />
<br />
if you tried the same thing on a raid boss, i'm sure you would notice a nice big difference in aggro capabilities over longer fights.  once again, pretty sure that you were getting unlucky with procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I must stress again, IF you have the gear to DEAL with the aggro your gonna generate, IE if your 62, with 4500 HP BUFFED, and your trying to group in BoT where pansy mobs smack for 500~ Krigers for about 700~, you are much better off with CHoS and SotBS and buying a full set of Kizrak, rather than buying a BoC and using your current gear / AC / HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">incite is 400 agro, +70 agro per tick for 1 minute. 1100 agro<br />
<br />
Buying a BoC is worth it if you can afford it. Your gear seems very nicely set up and their isn't much more you can buy.<br />
<br />
If you factor in all averages, a Blade of carnage will generate 35% more agro than a copper hammer of stirking. Because the weapon dps is about 7% better, and agro proc with generate about 28% more agro. And on top of that you have much nicer stats. <br />
<br />
The only 1 handers that will generate more agro than a BoC are<br />
<br />
Ethereal Destroyer<br />
Hategiver<br />
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled<br />
Edge of Eternity<br />
Bloodfrenzy<br />
Darkblade of the warlord<br />
<br />
maybe a new god weapon, but I don't know of any. If you are set on buyable gear, than I can see no reason not to buy a boc. Even you get an upgrade that is better, then you can sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">great blade of storms used to be considered equivalent if not slightly better than BoC as per aggro, but the general consensus seems to be that the BoC is better aggro.<br />
<br />
if you guys had both BoC and GBoS, which would you offhand and which mainhand?  i have both and have BoC mainhanded atm, but i know that GBoS mainhand will put out a bit more dps.<br />
<br />
mainhand GBoS in xp groups for more dps ... saving BoC mainhand for when i need the aggro punch?<br />
<br />
or...<br />
<br />
just keep BoC in mainhand and dont worry about swapping them around as its not worth the hassle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">depends on what is in your group, if you got some bad ass wizards, shaman, etc. You are going to want the the additional agro from a boc.<br />
<br />
BoC is better agro overall, but it is alittle under 7% less dps agro, but remains with 28% higher spell agro. so a BoC is about 21% better agro than a GBoS. So it depends if you need that agro. Think about what you have in your group. 21% agro really helps in longer fights with high dps classes. But at the same time, if we are talking fast fight 30 secs or less, I would consider useing gbos mainhand, for consistency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I promise you they both have the default 2 per min proc rate .. no more no less.  <br />

<br />
He is correct. Both 2ppm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It is without a doubt the best 1h aggro weapon you can buy, so if you dont raid much i would suggest getting one.

<br />
You know, all the fancy numbers in the world don't change the fact that any amount of aggro that you are above the 2nd person on the hate list, except for 1 hate point, doesn't mean shit.<br />
<br />
1100 hate, 2 million hate....if you can hold aggro currently, you have zero use for more.  Most casual players (and people with 4500hps HAVE to be considered casual players these days), will rarely be in a group that takes their aggro generation to that extreme.  Stun procs WILL lock aggro thru a slow.  If you can hold it thru a slow, you've got as much as you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I agree to a point. I have found that after incite, a debuff and slow can still take agro until a proc. Just about any stun proc or agro proc should move you back to the top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
But I consider the warriors primary goal to keep control of the mob. What happens when there is a resist? You need more agro to keep up with it. But that is more rare.<br />
<br />
What I consider is when I group with really good wizards, shaman and druids. They can put out alot more dps.  Wizards most of all, yes the have an agro decreasing spell. But really what it comes down to is the agro you have, the more damage your group can deal.<br />
<br />
I have duo'd with some decent shaman, who use the &quot;bane&quot; spell from ldon, and use clicky nukes. It was tough to hold agro off mutiple dots and constant nukeing, where any more agro would have been nice, and make exping more efficient.<br />
<br />
But the guy in question pretty much ahs all the best droppable gear, so increase your stats and agro or equip an alt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">i prefer 2handers myself, but either way, its a super item. what good is pp if you dont spend it.  what better item/items could u get if you dont pickup the boc?<br />
<br />
just realize its not warrior nirvana, some ppl are noticing huge difference, but seriously sometimes it wont proc an entire fight on an xp mob.<br />
<br />
15/20 is a good ratio but debuffers are still going to pull agro on it if they go for the early slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I like the term &quot;warrior nirvana&quot; and he is right Blade of Carnage is not warrior nirvana, it alone will not solve all your problems, but is likely an impressive improvment. Depending on how things go I would like to aquire one to offhand. <br />
<br />
Damn there should have been more EB weapons in pop.</div></div><hr />
