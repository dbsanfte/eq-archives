Debating issues is one thing, but someone trying to force there ideals upon someone else, just because &quot;X&quot; dont agree with &quot;Y&quot;, dont make &quot;X&quot; wrong. <br />
The best that can come from that type of situation is to agree to disagree. Which some people just cant do. To them there the only ones thats right.</div></div><hr />

i loathe and despise conversations that end up with people calling each other assholes using a thousand different terms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talking about the issues is good though, buts very rare to find a productive conversation on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, because some adults think politics are a valid excuse to regress to playground behavior. Fucking unreal.</div></div><hr />

True that.  I try to contribute to political debates on this forum, but unfortunately all of my responses get washed away by people blowing hot air.  We know your opinions from the first 20 threads, shut up now and use logic, not insult, ya freakin mookers   :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm kinda confused...are you saying not talking about politics actually makes the country a better place?  I enjoyed the &quot;voting thread&quot; until folks decided to walk away from the subject and get personal.  If nothing else those kinda threads are good places for some folks to learn restraint...its a practiced skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quato</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Political threads here are AWESOME !! If we went to any type of political boards we know exactly what we would read based on what board we were on.  Very partisan viewpoints with a couple people fueling flames.  Here we get students, retired Military, peace corps and everything in between for the most part expressing themselves and opening doors.  Even if you disagree 100%, the more you know the better equipt you become to stand your own ground.  People generaly only resort to name calling when they feel threatened - take it as a sign that you are hitting a nerve and maybe actualy getting through a little.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to see a political discussion not devolve into some kind of grade school mudslinging, name-calling, and scream fest. This is the same for television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and especially on the Internet. So I stopped paying attention to them unless I was overly bored, like I was the day I started this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">05-15-2004, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id love to have political threads but in my experience they seem to attract a lot of trollers. people who's idea of a convincing argument is to rant and swear and call people as many names as they can think of. i know its not most of the regular posters here but the trollers sniff out those threads and try to dominate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">05-15-2004, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Political threads don't really piss me off any more than normal threads really.<br />
<br />
I hate threads about like:<br />
<br />
1. Religion (MY GOD CAN BEAT UP YOUR GOD)<br />
2. Abortion ( Goes right along with religion.)<br />
3. &quot;Attn plz&quot;</div></div><hr />

That and they can no longer form a valid argument. <br />
<br />
The day I have to use derogatory statements to validate my beliefs is the day I don't hit the submit reply button. Resorting to cuss words to prove a point shows a lack of intellect plain and simple. A message board isn't the same as a 1-on-1 confrontation. On the boards one can spend as much time as they need to make the great come-back reply that generally comes about 30 minutes afterwards in real life.</div></div><hr />
