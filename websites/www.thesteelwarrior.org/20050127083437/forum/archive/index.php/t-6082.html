I'm curious what would be recomended weapons to hold aggro at this level?  Currently I have an Elite Steelslave Stone Blade in primary and Defenders Lightblade in offhand.  However I've heard they are finally fixing the recomended dmg bug soon.  I have about 50k to work with and a lvl 65 shaman (who i'm semi-retiring for the time being) to work with.  I was planning on farming an Enchanted Sash of Wonder, Kingly Boots of SPlendor and a couple of SIlver CHitin Wristbands but I'm at a loss with regards to weapons.  Magelo below:<br />

I havent heard anything about them fixing the rec. level damage bug, but even if they fix it in tomorrow's patch, I'd still go with the CHoS/SotBS combo. the procs add a pretty good amount of dps at lower levels, and are stellar aggro items.<br />
<br />
And what's with everyone asking what weapon to use? Every thread gets the same response(s), someone should sticky a post with the chos/sotbs explanation.</div></div><hr />

Sure the procs are nice but unless you have nice stats they won't proc enough to make it worth it.  Then all you're left with is a really really nice pair of weapons with an absolute shit ratio due to low level.  Does the level damage bug mentioned improve ratio or what?</div></div><hr />

I just dinged level 49.  At level 48, my ratio with bloodsworn was 10/19.  Now at 49 it just raised to 11/19 so still isn't at the full 12/19 ratio.<br />
<br />
Also, my level 1 bazaar mule shows 1/20 and 1/19 respectively for CHoS and SotB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It may show as 10/19, but it really hits as 12/19. Trust me, when I put my CHoS on my level 24 monk he hits for full. Same with GSoB on my level 8 bard.</div></div><hr />

So if you dont believe me try it out yourself.</div></div><hr />

However they may change this in the patch tomorrow finally, but they have known a long time and have yet to do anything about it<br />

Why the hell would they let something that ridiculous go this long without fixing?  That's retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, just read in another thread that CHoS was nerfed to proc at level 50 now. I havent seen any info on whether the rec level damage bug was changed, but still, I'm thinking CHoS (And likely SotBS as well) will lower in price just a wee bit.<br />
<br />
So now, at level 32, your choices for really good aggro weapons.. is find the fastest weapon you can and hope to keep aggro that way. IIRC, frostbringer procs at level 40, so score one of those when you can. The dd proc with ac debuff is very good aggro, although I doubt it's on par with the dd+stun of CHoS/SotBS.</div></div><hr />

Your stats dont really have a huge effect on how many procs per minute you get, and even if they did lower level aggro proccing weapons would have the same number of procs per minute as chos/sotb, so chos/sotb would still be better for aggro.  I'm glad they finally nerfed the proc level on chos, weapons that good, with procs that good should not be available to level 1 twinks.  Lower levels are already too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angrif77</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice.  I actually decided to start a brand new warrior so i could get hte feel for him again right from the start.  Picked a Barbarian RZ worshiper for the ability to use fierce heraldic eventually.  Mighty nice stuff that is... never knew cultural was that good ;)  Picked up a Sword of the Bloodsworn... then they fixed the bug.  Which is fine, just need to get something until the Sword is good again.  Was thinking the age old standard like lammy perhaps.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A really decent, really cheap aggro combo would be venomous axe of the velium brood and black blade of tormenting.  Both should be fairly cheap, drop in Kael, and have decent ratios and aggro procs.  Not sure if they have a recommended/required level on them (been a while since I used them). A really good aggro combo for a lower level warrior is, believe it or not, a couple of gnoll hide lariats.  Your dps will suck, but I used to love dual wielding those for caster interrupts and holding aggro in the crypt of dalnir. (caster mobs every 2 feet in there).  For DPS lammy, centi ls, centi ss, or any number of other things would be serviceable.<br />
<br />
Edit: I said velks, I meant Kael.  I was close, they're on the same continent. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angrif77</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ven Axe does have a rec level as my ranger had one for awhile.  I had a centi SS on one of my many alts so my new lvl 6 warrior is using that for now.  I'll probably just farm a lammy with my main for him soon as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really haven't checked out the rec level fix, but if true, it's interesting.<br />
I thought for a while that everyone was so twinked nowadays that Centi SS would eventually be worth less than fine steel weapons because at least fs can be melted down for ore by smiths, lol.<br />
Anybody remember if the bed leg club has a rec level?<br />
there are also various &quot;XXX claw&quot; weapons that are pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angrif77</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got 13 and found a lammy for 1k so i'm dual wielding lammy and centi SS.  A nice enough combo for the time being.  What's funny is that even at lvl 13 the fierce heraldic BP i have in bank is almost good enough to wear already compared to the BP i have ;)</div></div><hr />
