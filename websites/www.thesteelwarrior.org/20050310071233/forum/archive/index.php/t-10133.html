<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, I picked up 2 new accounts and am currently in the process of levelling up 2 new toons so that I can 3 box with my warrior.<br />
<br />
I decided to go with a Shaman and a Ranger, but during some guild brainstorming, the Beastlord/Cleric option came up.  I ended up doing a quick pro/con comparison and here is what I came up with:<br />
<br />
PRO (Shaman/Ranger):<br />
Tracking and Snare available<br />
Balance (Shaman provides slow/healing/buffs, Ranger provides good DPS)<br />
Shaman slow is better at Beastlord slow<br />
Easier to manage characters (/autofire makes a Ranger cake to box)<br />
<br />
PRO (Beastlord/Cleric):<br />
Resurrection available<br />
Balance (Beastlord slows/buffs/provides DPS, Cleric has virtue and CH)<br />
Better buffs and heals, making harder content easier and more available<br />
Pacification indoors (i.e. LDoN)<br />
<br />
CON (Shaman/Ranger):<br />
No resurrection or indoor pacification (soloing LDoNs difficult if not impossible)<br />
Content restricted due to limited healing<br />
<br />
CON (Beastlord/Cleric):<br />
Pet push!  God, I hate pet push<br />
Managing positioning for 2 melee classes can be difficult (I'm constantly fidgeting with my positioning on the warrior) especially with pet push<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'm missing some stuff.  In any case, I've levelled the Ranger/Shaman to 25/24 respectively, so I'd really rather not start over if there's not something glaring that I'm missing.  I know that I have a ways to go before I'll be able to do anything worthwhile with them, but once the shaman gets to 65 with some healing AAs, and the ranger gets a decent bow and EQ / AM3, possibilities will become available.  These chars are really only for me to be able to do something besides greenie farming when friends/guildies aren't available to group with, so I like to think that I'll be content with 3 boxing a BoT camp or DH expedition with them.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I plan to keep the warrior at 65 until I can get all of my non OoW defensive AAs, HP AAs and WA5 (about 90ish more AAs to go).<br />
<br />
Suggestions/advice/feedback would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that WAR/CLR/ROG and WAR/CLR/DRU work best for me. If I'm fighting where I need snare constantly I will use the druid, but if I only need to snare once in a while (eg fighting undead in ldon adventures) I use the rogue and have a snare dagger for the occasional live mob.<br />
<br />
I can't stress how good having a cleric with a warrior is. CH is just too powerful to not have available at your disposal (yes druids have their 5k heal but it's just not the same or as mana efficient). Just use a ToD to slow as most everything in OoW/GoD mitigates slow anyway. My hammer even lands on red-con named in WoS without malo/tash. If you can tank the mob unslowed then slow is just a luxury. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When i use to 3 box, it was War / Cleric / Enchanter , that combo seemed to work well, if i had to choose between yours though, it'd be war / bst / cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edarila</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently 3 box a war / enc / cleric.<br />
<br />
Enchanter is/was my main at lvl 67.  The cleric is a guildee's that is enjoying his rogue more than a cleric atm and is level 67.  The warrior is the newest to the bunch at lvl 61.<br />
<br />
I would recommend only 1 melee because as you said, moving the mob/characters around between 2 different toons can be very tedious sometimes.  I often will place the war in position, switch to enchanter to start slow and then switch to cleric to start heal.  By the time I am back to the war the push is already bad enough to have to reposition him.  Having to do it for 2 different toons would SUCK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">War/beast/cleric is very good.I did ldons at 65 in crud gear with a beast/cleric who later duoed them.She was a very good player tho.If you don't need cc and you are fighting tough mobs early in your wars development it's a good way to go.Slow and ch with dps is tough to beat.Hehe actually I thot they would have been better off with a wiz/rogue than me tho.If you are fairly well geared for the content you are fighting and/or well along in aa a shammy can heal you against most xp mobs.Shammy wars can have add/snare trouble.My wife is a shammy and can mainheal me anywhere we xp,although, it can be kinda stressful in a group and aggro must be watched more closely.Rez and pacify are kewl!Anyways, when we duo our main problems are dps and pulling singles.Like you I've been playing with the idea of a ranger for ease of use and track.A necro would give us rez and eventually pulling power,both with the snare$$.Rogue snare daggers are okay mainhanded and we started one awhile back thats gathering dust since our 3rd box bit the dust.Wizards,druids a lot of classes make a good third hehe.<br />
<br />
Imo if you're like me and don't run show EQ a ranger could be a good easy to run option.A druid would probably be better while gear is weaker tho.A lot of your named mobs will be tough for awhile with the shammy mh/slowing.If you're not using charm one of the toughest combos for a stand up fight with a named is cleric/ beast /war tho.Especially early on I found it hard to beat.Course OOW stuff hits like weenies for the available gear now hehe.<br />
<br />
One day i'll have time... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a comment from sometime war/cleric 2boxer. I think it would be VERY hard to beat a cleric in any warrior combo. Having rez available is huge. You ARE going to jack things up, and being able to CR yourself is REAL nice. Positioning the bst to melee might suck, you could maybe go with a shaman and just load up on dots. Ranger or wizard is a great boxed DPS option, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I box war, cleric, chan, 3wiz.<br />
<br />
You need a cleric there is no doubt about it. Rez... CH... fast heals etc.<br />
<br />
If you going to do pbaoe/pagershaker groups you might want to consider a chanter but now days in high end play (rcod/wos higher) chanter is all but usless cept for that 68percent haste and VoQ etc.<br />
<br />
I would consdier a shaman as your 3rd. They can buff over the cap, and provide extra healing, and dps a bit. Or a bard as they can pull and split and add misc utilitly and some dps. Or a necro who can also split and provide some sick dps. <br />
<br />
If you go war/cler/chanter you have a &quot;core&quot; and just need some DPS to group with you, groups will be really easy to find. Your dps will be low but chanter gives you CC.<br />
<br />
I guess overall Id go with war/clr/bard ... twisting is easyer with melody although that is a very heavy control group.<br />
<br />
Chanter is just &quot;tash, slow and blind&quot; very easy control. But you can't split mobs that you can't pacify (i.e. all of mpg plus)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amadeuz</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, my wife and I are leveling up a few alts which we will both 2 box.  She is a 70 Cleric with a second box that she can play either a Rogue or a Necro (both 50ish atm).  I am a 70 Bard with a 50ish Enchanter, Druid and Ranger on the same account and a second account with a 50ish Warrior.  I will likely move the Druid, Enchanter and/or Ranger to the other account when I figure that out.<br />
<br />
So in essence we would have a Cleric, Rogue or Necro, Bard, Warrior combo for fun.  We would like to level them all to be able to group in WoS and later MPG.  I have been brainstorming as well on what sort of old world content we can take on for fun once they are all 65ish.   Any suggestions?  Was thinking dragons and such, Velkitor, Rumblecrush, Ssra minis etc.  Anyone boxing this content and have some other mob suggestions?<br />
<br />
ps the cleric and bard are about 11khp 2kac raid buffed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">War / cleric / bst will destroy war / sha / ranger in box mode, especially when you hit 70. Not exactly hard to hit autoattack / incite on your war and hit CH on the cleric every once a whle. Not much else to it, eq really doesn't take much brain power to function even when boxing 2+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input, everybody. =)  After the first couple days of only a couple very short responses, I thought this thread would be relegated to the dumpster pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
I picked up a 4th account yesterday, friend who got a freebie didn't like the game, so what I decided to do was start a 4 box group, which I will level to 60ish and then pick up with the warrior.<br />
<br />
Setup is Beastlord / Cleric / Druid / Enchanter.  The enchanter is on the same account as the warrior, and once I get him to 60, he'll be relegated to buff bitch.  Learning how to 4 box on 2 comps will prove tricky, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
I may decide to pick up the group when the warrior comes into grouping range, but trying to tank them through the mid 50s might not be the best idea with only 35% beastlord slow.  We'll see how it goes, whether or not the beastlord/pet can tank LDoNs through the 50s.  Trying to get a chanter from low 40s to 60 would most likely be a PITA anyways.<br />
<br />
Tutorial -&gt; Crushbone -&gt; PC -&gt; LDoN should prove to be a very manageable progression path.<br />
<br />
Much appreciated, my friends.  As expected, TSW comes through with some good advice supported by solid reasoning.  Again.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly recommend War/Bard/Cleric<br />
Bards are very powerful when you are working with limited numbers.<br />
War/Cler is the obvious choice for 2 toons (although Shamans with res are equally nice)<br />
But the bard should be your third. Bard can pull, track, do DS, do mana, drag corpses as well as a rog and add a good % of damage to your warrior with songs. Now that melody is out, its easy to 3 box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2-box war/cleric and strongly reccomend that you're #3 person be able to do some DPS.  With war/cleric you have great tanking ability and huge healing.  Slow is optional most places, or at least a ToD will get you by anywhere but the hardest zones.  BL is a strong choice for the third person though.   Enchanter is awesome for utility, but your DPS will be pretty weak.  BL can slow, buff haste and mana regen, and do very respectable DPS, and the pet can off-tank in a pinch.  Personally, if I was to add a third character to my combo, I think I would get a wizard, but that's just because they are the easiest DPS class to bot.  I find though, that with a warrior and cleric, the biggest thing slowing down my exp is a lack of DPS.  Snare is another big issue in a lot of places, but it seems like you usually have to pick between snare and slow if you're gonna 3-box with a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amadeuz</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the Bard/War/Cleric combo isn't a bad idea.   Bards have the highest Damage Shields in game which can be stacked with the cleric reverse damage shields.  My cleric wife and I put out 225DS between us.  This occurs all the while that resists are maxed and we are hasted to 130%.   Bards also bring slows, snares, mezz, charm, and superb mana and health regen, as well as ensuring single pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya pulling singles and makeing sure low on health mobs dont run and bring their buddies is critical to avoiding long cr's.... <br />
<br />
Bards just bring to much to the table;<br />
<br />
Puller<br />
CC<br />
Snare<br />
Regen<br />
Splitter<br />
DS<br />
Group Speed<br />
Group Invisible<br />
Some DPS<br />
Charm<br />
Slow<br />
<br />
What can you say....    warrior/cleric/bard<br />
<br />
Granted this is low dps for sure but it only takes one time for 2 mobs to come into camp and kill everyone to cost you 10-20 mintues of cr... where is your dps then?<br />
<br />
I got a ton of dps (3 wizards) but if I can't single pull what good is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edarila</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Melody sucks...sucks...sucks...sucks.  If you miss a note, which most bards lvl 70 with hundreds of AA's still do, it stops the melody in its place and you have to press the key again.  This is fine if you are only single boxing, the moment it stops, hit a key and it will start over from the beginning.  In a boxing situation the only way you will get any certainty that your songs will keep playing is to either only play one song or to get a 3rd party program that would play the songs for you.<br />
<br />
I played my bard to 65w/70+ aa's and while I do agree that the bard is one of the absolute funnest classes to play, I dont see them being a viable component for a single person multi-boxing unless they just want the regen or just want haste or just want DS, etc.  You get the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me the bard bring mostly the ability to split and insure a single pull. That can be done easy as during the pull you need only control the bard. Once back at camp you shake agro and then play mana regen, attack increase and snare song I guess (i never play a bard so I dont know what up), and maybe with melody you get 4 I dont know. And then just stand there while you control the warrior to keep agro. <br />
<br />
Ya I guess dps with the bard won't happen as controling 2 mellee is very hard unless you can trap the mob in corner or somehting.<br />
<br />
I box a lot different then other people, all my 6 computers go to a single keyboard. So I would make say the F1 key a socail for the warrior to taunt, kick, attack etc. and the F1 key for the cleric to target the warrior and cast CH. So then I spam the F1 key. I assume you can write a melody social also tie to a key, dont know though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard is a great addition to any group, but a little intense for multiboxing, although /melody would help a lot.</div></div><hr />
