I decided tonight that I prefer SotB/CHoS instead of CHoS/SotB, then level limit from the CHoS on high level PoP mobs really seems to kill the aggro, despite the reports saying it still causes aggro to mobs immune to the stun.<br />
<br />
I still have not gotten a chance to test out my GSoT against bost combinations of the SotB and CHoS in the same group, todays broke up to help with a (successful) Grummus pickup raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets face it here, a greatstaff of thunder that doesn't proc is an ugly ass windblade.  If you don't get a proc, you ain't locking aggro on shit.<br />
<br />
2 weapons however, both with high aggro procs give you a far better chance of getting a good foothold on aggro early on in the fight.  You can use whatever you want, i'm partial to dual wielding, and seeing as how the greatstaff of thunder looks so goddamned retarded, that pushed me even further that direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">See but that's the thing.  It does proc and it procs ALOT.  Even if it doesnt proc from the beginning the DPS alone will help you keep or get agro from slows.  I have used GSoT and CHoS/SoBs.  GSoT is more dependable.  Saying if it doesnt proc you arent getting agro is complete BS and you sir are on crack.  CHoS/SoBs are nice but GSoT is still win for agro.  As far as wich proc is better.  I can assist with CHoS/SoBs all day not taunting and procing like a fool and the mob will not turn around and wack me unless I &quot;streak&quot;.  When I try assisting with my GSoT I get wacked when it procs.  Not everytime but those mobs know Im there.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are dead on about the look though.  I keep my DW combo for pickin up the chicks ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">See but that's the thing. It does proc and it procs ALOT <br />
<br />
Well, as much as you'd like to believe that, I just can't.  I've had plenty of weapons in my day, and they're all streaky as hell.  3-4 procs one mob, then nothing for the next mob.  That's the way they all work, none of them are 100% reliable for our aggro issues, but unfortunately, they're the best we've got.<br />
<br />
I've seen my SoD blast off 5 procs in a row before....but i still face the same RNG death trap that everyone else does..and if it doesn't proc, I don't keep aggro very long.  If you can hold aggro thru DPS, then you're obviously not grouping with some very well equipped monks/rogues, because nothing you've got will ever hold a candle to what they can do thru DPS.  I group with a monk with 15/19 and 15/18 weapons and a rogue with 15/22 main and rage off...aggro thru DPS?  Hah. Not in this lifetime.<br />
<br />
DPS may work for you, but it's not gonna work for everyone. And that means that most of us are relying on procs.  And since we know the RNG is streaky as hell, I'd much rather rely on 2 procs than 1.  If the greatstaff of thunder works for you...hey, that's fuckin great.  It's a cheap weapon with a good ratio and a good proc.  The thing is that I used a windblade for far too long because it was the best DPS I could find...and I won't go back to a windblade that may or may not proc because it's not gonna help me out.  I need to dual wield because I need the offhand procs to keep me ahead of the DPS classes I group with regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Back to what I started with.  It does proc, it procs alot.  It procs every fight.  It doesnt not proc.  Sometimes when its busy proc'ing it gets really busy and streaks a bunch of procs.  Sometimes that happens multiple times a fight sometimes it does'nt.  But that is'nt something to depend on in between procs.  And when you compare it to CHoS/SoBs it wins.  Wich is what this thread is about anyway, heh. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And when you compare it to CHoS/SoBs it wins.  <br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
When YOU compare it, it wins.<br />
<br />
When I compare it, it loses. <br />
<br />
Use what you want.  I've got perfectly good logic behind my decision, and I've got my choice made as well.  That doesn't mean that either of us is wrong.  You're confident in the proc rate of your weapons.  I'm not.  I've been burned plenty of times by shit that doesn't proc, i'm not about to put all my eggs in one basket if I can help it.<br />
<br />
I could put it another way and say that for 3k or whatever it is in the bazaar, the greatstaff of thunder is more bang for the buck.  But in another way, you can get both weapons from droga in a matter of hours with maybe 1 or 2 other people, and get some damned fine XP while you do it.<br />
<br />
There isn't a right or wrong answer here, because there's plenty of people on both sides of this all with stories about how this combo outaggroed the other, or vice versa.  I think that makes it pretty clear that it's fairly equal and it all boils down to personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There absolutely is a right or wrong answer.  Im not taking anything into consideration in regards to obtaining these weapons or cost of these weapons I am only considering the WEAPONS.  It may be hard for you to do it but just try.  The agro on the GSoT is better than both the CHoS/SoBs.  It DOES proc ALOT.  When the GSoT procs bingo you have solid agro no ifs and or buts.  And it procs multiple times during fights.  When the CHoS/SoBs procs you may or may not have solid agro.  The DD may or may not land and the Stun may or may not be resisted or land entirely.  The GSoT is more dependable for agro.  Repeat after me.  The GSoT is more dependable for agro...</div></div><hr />

You use whatever the fuck you want, and when someone with a copper hammer/sword of the bloodsworn pulls aggro off you in a group, you just keep telling yourself that the greatstaff is better aggro, becuase it WILL happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">See Gear, here's the deal.<br />
<br />
Aggro is a very subjective thing.  There is no way to quanitify aggro except thru Enraging blow weapons.  None of the weapons here are EB weapons.<br />
<br />
I can say that the Frostbringer is really good aggro, and I could hand it to Furor and he could tell me that it doesn't hold aggro worth shit.  Is either of us wrong?  No.  It's good aggro for a level 50 in KC, but it won't be if you're dealing with super AA'd monks and rogues.<br />
<br />
I can give a windblade to a level 55 and it's probably going to be the best aggro weapon he's ever seen..because he'll be outdamaging his group with it.  That doesn't make the windblade an aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
The people you play with also have a large influence on what you can get by with for weapons.  If i'm the only 65 in the group and i'm helping out some level 50 friends, I don't exactly need a whole lot to be able to keep aggro off these people.  However when I group with decently equipped monks and rogues, DPS has just gone out the window as a reliable aggro producer.  You can tout just how often your GoT procs, but I know better.  I know that there will be fights where it won't proc until the end, and there will be fights when it procs twice right away.  In that scenario, I am far better off hoping to get a proc from either of 2 weapons rather than one.<br />
<br />
Want proof?  Go look thru some of the posts here and on the old boards.  You'll have people who praise the frostbringer and used it primary hand for a very long time.  You'll also have people who thought that it never really did a good job of pulling aggro for them.  There are people who think the Epic is awesome aggro, and there are people who think that it's a below average weapon.  There are people who are happy as clams with their Blades of Carnage, but there are also people who feel that it doesn't proc at all and don't use it.  Do you see here why there is no right answer, and that your OPINION of the aggro you generate is not an objective thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Haass, if the issue is so solidily set in stone in your mind, why do you waste your time on this thread?<br />
<br />
Your magelo shows you wielding a BoC and SoD, which I daresay is better than the weapons in question on this thread. Why does it even matter to you?<br />
<br />
We know you think CHoS/SotB is better than GSoT, you've said that, more than once. Judging by the poll, you are among the minority who thinks that. You posting incessantly doesn't change the fact that what you think is best does not coincide with what the majority of the people voting does.<br />
<br />
I have tried, using CHoS/SotB, to get aggro from GSoT wielders, I can - for a second, but it clearly shows that this combo is inferior to a GSoT.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I think my GSoT looks cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The issue is set solidly in your mind too.  You've been spouting &quot;Get a GSoT&quot; for months now.  Why did you need a new and seperate thread?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Oh, and BTW, don't mean to split hairs here or nothing, but if you look at your poll, you'll see that the majority of people prefer something else to your Greatstaff of Thunder.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The issue is set solidly in your mind too. You've been spouting &quot;Get a GSoT&quot; for months now. Why did you need a new and seperate thread?<br />
<br />
Riddle me that and you'll have your answer as to why I care.I didn't create this poll for myself, I did it for easy reference for others asking the same question that my poll does to get an answer.Oh, and BTW, don't mean to split hairs here or nothing, but if you look at your poll, you'll see that the majority of people prefer something else to your Greatstaff of Thunder. First off, it's not &quot;my&quot; Greatstaff of Thunder. Secondly, as of 10:48 PM CST, the Greatstaff of Thunder is not the majority's choice, it just has only 29 out of the 59 Votes. I am sorry, Haass, you are clearly right - the GSoT just doesn't have enough support, I mean, it can't even beat out 4 other combinations for the top spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">And like I said...the current president of the US had the same situation happen when he was elected.  That doesn't make him  the popular candidate, seeing as how over half of the people DIDN'T vote for him, kind of like over half of the people didn't vote for the greatstaff of thunder.  And seeing as how the other 4 combinations all include the same 2 weapons, i'm thinking that the difference is not as large as you'd like to think.<br />
<br />
Look at that poll to say  &quot;Greatstaff of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Some combination including one or more of the droga weapons&quot; and you'll see what i mean. <br />
<br />
But hey, you're right.  Just keep on with that bandwagon.  Nothing else will ever be as good as the greatstaff of thunder, nosiree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You guys can argue the semantics of the poll all you want.  But the fact is the GSoT is better for agro! =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Pusherman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Got all three and Ive used them alot.<br />
I like the duel wield of the CHOS+SOBS.<br />
<br />
But I was in Nadox at the weapon smith undead room 3 boxing(Cleric/warrior/wizard). Had a guild mate join me, 55 warrior. I was useing CHOS+SOBS, I loaned him my GSoT.<br />
I was taunting, begging, slaming, and disarming and anytime that staff would proc he would pull aggro off me.<br />
<br />
Even with that I still feel the duel wield is a more solid setup..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fail to see how this is &quot;clear&quot;. There are MANY factors involved that contribute to agro. AAs, buffs, stats, even luck all play a part. Maybe the person you couldn't hold the agro from was able to successfully taunt the mob back each time. Or maybe he/she knows how to manage agro better than you do in general.<br />
<br />
The issue of agro is subjective. I could hold agro with a Fine Steel Longsword when I was hunting in Crushbone. If the GSoT works well for you, that is great. Don't be insulted if it doesn't work for others. And, trying to push your opinions on others just so you can see your post count rise isn't going to change minds either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I don't have a BoC or a Sod.  I'm just a 65 war with 42 aa (all defensive and PB1).  The GSoT was the first weapon I got that would consistently hold aggro.  I intended to max PB and never use a dual wield combo.  I even posted before that GSoT was the best choice...it was...until I got a SotB and CHoS.  I mainly xp in BoT and the aggro on this dual wield combo is superior to the GSoT.  <br />
<br />
I lose about 10dps and 15ac using the SotB and CHoS but gain about 100hp and considerably more aggro.  <br />
<br />
It makes no difference to me that I use the same weps a 55 warrior does.  Hell, I will use a rusty mace and a broken bottle if it holds aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Huh<br />
<br />
When I run the numbers, those actually make sense in terms of riposte rate per swing, and it's consistent between dual wielding those weapons and the greatstaff, but it's still absolutely boggling that you get riposted THIRTY FOUR times per fight.  Are you plowing enrage or something? <br />
<br />
I'm not doubting your numbers, because if you do some math involving weapon delay and swings over time, the ratios stay the same between 1h and 2h, so it's quite obvious these aren't made up...but jesus christ, what the hell ripostes you 34 times that you're doing for XP?  Nothing should ever live that long in an XP group.  For tanking boss mobs, it's a definite consideration, but if something has time to riposte me 35 times, it can't seriously be that good for the ol' XP bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">if dps is marginal, im vain enough to go with the one that looks the best, not the one that has the biggest hits hehe. <br />
<br />
if you have a slower the dmg riposte just doesnt matter enough. ppl think im crazy but if you got a good cleric + a druid/mage, u really lose a ton of dps slowing. MoR + Legacy of spike is solid dmg on an unslowed mob.<br />
<br />
most ppl do steady slow, no brain xp though so it doesnt matter though.<br />
<br />
be interesting see a few more parses, since the riposte nerf i havent felt its all that bad in xp groups at least. xtra 3k riposte out of disc on any raid mob of course hurts but shouldnt be a prob for standard mobs.<br />
<br />
maybe hes got no haste and just a cleric and some other class with him doing BoT, giants do have some HP. its still 3% aa per kill in a full group, best aa u will see in teir 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>icsdave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hmmm would not let me edit my last post, at work so diff ip :(  Anyway after reading the post by Haass I went back and checked the parser this mourning (late to work) and found that the fight count I posted was wrong.  Yalp listed total risposte but only my kills, the difference is my kills were 17 group kills 57 on 1h and 15 on 2h.  This brings the numbers more in line with what I thought they were.<br />
<br />

569 * 280 / 57 = 2795<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Okay, so that's a little more reasonable...4 ripostes with a 2h, and 10 dual wielding per fight, but now I gotta ask this.<br />
<br />
569 ripostes...however, are those only times when the mob riposted an attack right?  I'm assuming he didn't actually hit you 569 times, correct?<br />
<br />
So what's the hit % of the mob, cut down the number of ripostes accordingly, and then multiply by the average damage and lets see what we get.  Right now an extra 1500 damage per fight isn't TOO bad when most 65 tanks are gonna buff out to 7 or 8khp.</div></div><hr />
