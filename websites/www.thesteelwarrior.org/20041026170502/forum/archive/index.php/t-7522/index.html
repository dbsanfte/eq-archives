<br />
I'm needing some advice on where to solo at lvl 28- I'm currently in Lake of Ill Omen shredding gobs. (I have all the expansions)<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />

Splitpaw spires for a level or two. Other than that, I can't say, as grouping is so much more efficient.</div></div><hr />

Try giants in Warslike woods. The evergeens should still be ok xp at your level and the giants there drop relative good loot including the occasional forest loop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whatever faction Osargen is on...Dismal Rage maybe?.....whatever they are they've hated me for years.  :D  I duo'd/solo'd him from 28 to 32 (miserably slow, but back then there weren't any places for midlevels to go - group lists for camps were a bitch).  I'd highly recommend you spend your time grouping sven; warriors are a grouping class, and you learn a lot of subtle nuances of grouping a warrior that you don't get solo.  Also, as has been previously mentioned, the higher you go the more difficult soloing becomes and the less payoff you get per investment of time.  Duo with a healer or do full groups.  Preferably in dungeons.</div></div><hr />
