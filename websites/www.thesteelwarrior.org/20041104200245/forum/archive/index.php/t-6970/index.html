<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been setting my warrior up for the day he hits 46...  ATM I have a full set of fierce heraldic, 2 valorium rings of the galliantry, 2 bloodmetal earrings of engagement, an amulet of mummy wrappings, and a architects bejewled breastplate, so I'm ok for gear for a bit... only problem I have atm is that I really don't have any weaps.  I have about  80k left and was hoping to buy two good onehanders with it that'll last me till I get to BoT and can start farming enough cash to work towards a BoW and other stuff rediculous priced weaps...  my question is this:<br />
<br />
In your opinion, what is a solid agro combo that I could get with around 80k  (if it's a bit more than 80 that's ok, as I can still farm with my shaman... but I'm trying to move away from having to play him, so not too much more than 80k)?  I've read alot of threads on good agro weaps, but most seem to be geared for the really rich folk, and I haven't seen too many discussions on weaps near my price range... any help you can give me on the best weapons around that range would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Unless he is on Firiona Vie server.<br />

Back to the first poster....you can buy a Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn really cheap and do really good with aggro and you can save a lot of that 80k for other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hinedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yup, the CHoS and SoTB are the best agro cheap weps to get. I got both on Tarew Marr for about 15k, and the prices have since come down with the proc on CHoS being nerfed to 50 and above. Cant do much better than that combo until you start hitting planes.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The CHoS and SoTB do rock I am a non raiding tank and group LDoN's and even PoV so far and I hold aggro from Necro's, Shaman's, Druid's, Chanter's all I hold fine. <br />
<br />
No they do not really hold back the shaman slows on pulls and he gets turned on but then the mob turns back on me. <br />
<br />
I am very happy with these two weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if youre looking at wanting to save money for a BoC or other very pricey items, get a GSoT at lv 55 and use that.  lvs 46-55 dont really require proccing weapons, so just pick up some decent 1handers with a good ratio till then.  in the end you will have saved yourself a shitload of cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Haass, we should have a public service announcement on the board that reads something like &quot;Attention warriors, you don't have to buy droga weapons, they are the  most easily campable aggro weapons in the game.&quot;  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is why you find the Droga king perma-camped by level 65 farmers on Stromm. Just try to get a group in there to acquire a drop legitimately. Personally, I'm hoping that all those jerks will be rushing off to play City of Heroes or trying to get into EQ2 Beta -- while they're Away From The Game, maybe I and my friends can actually play Everquest and get a drop from mobs that are still a challenge to us at our level.<br />

Wielding a bazaar-bought CHoS because I spent a weekend blocked from a camp,<br />
