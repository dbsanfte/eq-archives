<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fuck berserkers for taking over all axes. Now we're going to be stuck with sword models along with knights and pallies. We've been god damn asking for the flaming axe of our god since RZ was first spotted, and all we get is a stupid sword for our epic 2.0 graphic. That's all we wanted... a big flaming axe. Stupid fucking broken berserkers. No one wanted them made, and now that they are, they're broken anyhow. AND THEY HAVE OUR AXES. Bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id rather have a sword anyway. Axes are awkward and poorly balanced, let those savages have them  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One of the first things I saw in EQ was Kalorn Iceblade standing in freeport in his full crafted and his Executioner Axe.  He was the man before I knew what the man was.<br />
<br />
It stayed with me to this day, the big fuckin axe look never gets old on warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">RZ axe please.<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my friend Rusher had the same impression that haass had; he was one of the first dudes on Bertoxx to finish up all his crafted quests and had an exe axe...he was king of the EC tunnel :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play a dwarf warrior and it just doesn't feel right using a sword. I say an AXE is where it is at. But I regret to say that I agree... Berserkers will be the axe weilders from here on out. Hopefully, they will still make some high end axes that are warrior usable =) Oh, and give dwarfs larger scale weapons !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My first Impression of a warrior was something like Haas.<br />
<br />
Here I am, Sitting in Full Bronze(Was VERY pimp back then) with a Gorflah's Stoutbite(Did anyone else do this quest?)<br />
I see Ganelron(Can't remmber his last name~) He is standing in Full Crafted with an Exe Axe. This man was THE warrior for me. He Still plays, and amazingly enough, he is still better than me, but not by much. But, He was the Warrior. Give us an Axe that is Own. Doesn't have to be Rallos Axe, but give us something that makes us Unique Sirs!<br />
Although Rallos axe would be $$$$$$$$$ xa mil :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaknaafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got to agree here -- my impressions of a warrior were always riding into battle on horseback weilding a heavy axe -- that said I'd like to dual weild good aggro scimitars for my roleplaying needs to be met! How about racial specific aggro weapons here? A dwarf or barbarian should have the axe -- a DE should have scimitars! As if our most important aggro weapons weren't rare enough already :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">scimitars would be perfect for those of us of the drow persuasion  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Totally agree, we need more high end axes, also whips and claws  ;) <br />
Exe axe so the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think the really problem is just the lack of weapon variety while trying to be effective too. I'd be cool if there were viable alternatives to various weapon looks. Like an NPC that you could turn in a weapon to have him give another style back. For instance, you could turn a Blade of Carnage and be returned a &quot;Hammer of Carnage&quot;, same stats and procs, just different graphic. The naming would probably be hell and they would have to populate the item DB with alternative items for every weapon in the game to be complete.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd love to have a Big Ol' polearm, by big I mean huge, that I could swing around in battle. It'd need new attack animations before it'd really be cool. That would be soooo teh PIMP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd have gone for a larger sized Katana of Pain graphic. Katanas are so damn elegant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love the idea of a smith who could re-forge weapons for you (i.e., change their graphic while keeping the stats). Heck, I'd be willing to quest some junk somewhere to give to the smith to help him, too.<br />
<br />
Give me a sword and axe. Yeah baby!</div></div><hr />
