<br />
Epics are soon to be 4 expansions old, I'd think most every warrior has banked theirs by now.  And all low lvl wars have picked up the new 'uber' droga weapons that are so cheap and available now days...<br />
<br />
'Epic' as seen by the 'Vision' is newbie gear.  Otherwise they'd expand upon the Epics with each expansion or add ways to signifigantly increase their power (not with a few extra char, sta, stam, blah blah from augments.  You can't increase the ratio).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well maybe someone does care since alot of people asked if the epics will be augmentable(sp).  That is your opinion I know alot of people are still doing the quest.  It is not always about PHAT LOOT it is about content.  Maybe and just maybe with the ability to augment our epics they can be a little more useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually not true about not increasing the ratio of an item, there are augments in Beta right now that increase dmg of an item. 3 is the most I have seen a pic of. And the epic currently has one Type 1 augment slot on it. In fact, every item I owned was given one augment slot.<br />
<br />
Of course I would like to see a minus delay augment but I do not know if they exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after logging in Beta this morning, my epic no longer has an augment slot on it and all my other weapons now have Type 4 augment slots on them. I don't know if they are changing their minds, or if they are just chnaging the augment type and have not patched it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the quote may be taken out of context.  The &quot;problem&quot; with the magi and warrior epics vs everyone elses is that these two epics are summoned/destroyed/changed/combined and normal augments won't / haven't worked on them.<br />
<br />
As far as +3 dmg augment... well you really want these floating around?  Seriously, I love a good laugh, but allowing a rogue to add a +3 dmg augment to their epic alone would dramatically change their melee dmg potential far beyond anything we could want :/<br />
<br />
There is a lot of fine tuning they need to do for these augments, as it stands presently they seem to have done a mass &quot;all weapons get a slot1&quot;.... we'll we shall see what happens...</div></div><hr />
