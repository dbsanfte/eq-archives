Was loosing aggro to people with no aggro 2handers on poe bosses and normal mobs last night.  Have WA5, max combat aa's and boc/gbos with yak procs.  Never had any problem keeping or getting aggro at all before the patch.</div></div><hr />

As to any agro changes since patch I can't say I noticed any at all. My agro seems unchanged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell me about it. It really makes me wonder how taunt works in these instances. Now that we can see the success messages and all, it doesn't seem like the top of the list sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Its kinds nice because it has allowed me to really contribute to DPS instead of being slow and buff bitch</div></div><hr />

If you're talking about groups, I've never seen an enchanter get hit after a successful taunt &amp; mez/break unless he was sittng down or cast some otherwise high aggro spell (tash/slow/etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im confused by this statement.  If its a successful taunt then you are now on top of agro list, why should it matter what the enchanter had cast or is sitting.  It &quot;was&quot; a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
If something is wrong with taunt and it was successful but the mob still turns on the enchanter then this is confirming what the poster stated... and what I have been seeing in the past three weeks.<br />
<br />
I duel box an enchanter.  I pull ALLOT of mobs and the enchater locks them down because I know what I am pulling and can pre target.  If I do a successful taunt then incite there is a chance that the mob bee lines towards my enchanter.  This is happeing amd has been happening with regualrity over the past three weeks.<br />
<br />
I can not reproduce it unless I mez / taunt / mez /  taunt ... etc until it happens again, but it will happen again.  Enchanter is not casting after taunt and is not sitting but has cast tash / slow prior to the mez (mez has a 40% chance of mem blur)<br />
<br />
I have no problems with anything regarding the taunt button or incite except for performing the action on a mez break.<br />
<br />
The only thing that has changed for my enchanter is she now has mez mastery...  <br />
<br />
I believe that the taunt messages are either not showing as failed &quot;sometimes&quot; or debuffs (like slow and tash) are creating constant agro checks each tick that they are present on the mob.  Enchanter mezzes mob, tashes, slows, re mezzes... each tick the mob has tash and slow is creating agro, not just the initial cast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">orrillias</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really tired of this agro question, can we hold it, can't we hold it. Do we need more aa's?  Do we need more disci's?  When you get down to the nuts and bolt of things most classes have pretty specific duty's sure the can do others but they still have a primary duty.  A clerics is to heal, A chanters is to mez, A shamans is to buff ......  A warriors is to TANK thats pretty much it.  I am tired of hybrid classes complaining about not being able to tank as well (that whole pally defencive thing is just assenine)  If you wanna tank as well as a war make a war.  A wars job is to hold agro.  I have read that alot of you have no problem holding agro, and that is good.  But, you know what?  You should have no problem holding agroe, and no chain stunning pally should change that. When taunt hits it should hit sitting shouldn't change that.   I am refering to this whole &quot;balanced&quot; crap I keep hearing about none of the classes are balanced and they shouldn't be.  (If you think they are duel an equally lvled and aa'd necro some time)   Personally I could care less if back stab hit for a million points as long as agroe stayed where it is supposed too.  The issue to me isnt what a class CAN do but what they are supposed to do sorry a sk or pally isnt supposed to tank as well as a war.  (I'm not saying that the currently dont cause most agree they do in most situations)   I am also realistic enough to realize that soe isnt and have never really been very conserned with the melee classes ( with the exception of when the nerfed the monk a few years back) so quit wining about agro get the augs if ya have to and do yer best to hold it if ya dont hold it and group members complain about you not holding it tell them to quit taking it then and press on we can only do what we can with in the limits given to us.  If ya dont have a BoW get the best thing you can and do the best ya can<br />

<br />
Taunt/Incite = top of the hate list + 400<br />
Incite/Taunt = 400 hate, then either no addition with taunt, or a small amount of agro added over the old hate leader.<br />
<br />
<br />

I haven't noticed any problems.  Tanked everything normally since the patch(es).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro from sitting appears to be a constant value that is added to the hate list last.  A hate modifier.  The tuant function doesn't know of this value, and this value is not added to your hate when you successfully tuant.<br />
<br />
If the chanter had 1000 hate, and he sits, his hate has this modifier added to it.  I don't know what the modifier's value is for sure, but let's say it added 500 hate for example.  So standing, the chanter is 1000 hate, sitting he's 1500 hate.  When you tuant, it only gives you 1001 hate.  If the chanter is standing all is well.  If he sits, the mob bee-lines for him.  You get the enchanters raw hate plus one, and the &quot;is he sitting or not&quot; modifier is added after everything else is said and done to the hate list.<br />
<br />
After a short period of cleaving time, you've built up enough aggro to overcome the chanters hate even while he's sitting.<br />
<br />
You see it all the time I'm sure.  A wizard nukes, but doesn't draw aggro.  Then he sits and the mob beelines for him.  The wizard quickly stands and the mob runs back to you.  The wizard might test his sit aggro then at that point, and do a quick sit-down stand-up to see if the mob turns in his direction for that split second, before deciding it's completely safe to plop back down.  You've got more hate than the wizard does standing, but not when the sit modifier is added into the total.  After a few seconds of cleaving you'll overcome the two added values, and the wizard can sit (or the smarter option would have been for the wizard to have not nuked so early heh).</div></div><hr />

this is why i dont buy the hate + 1 line although i might agree that this happens sometimes and a fixed hate is added other times (random). its not the sitting down that im finding a problem with. it may well be that having max hate + 1 is less than having max hate plus sitting. its more the part about the high agro spells that makes me doubt the max hate + 1 theory.<br />
<br />
some observations:<br />
<br />
skeletons act like anyone nearby is &quot;sitting down&quot;. they go after them unless there is a large hate difference.<br />
<br />
it is almost impossible for me to taunt agro off a person who has built up a huge hate lead. this shouldnt be the case if the hate + 1 theory is correct.<br />
<br />
comments and corrections are welcome of course :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, I've seen this many times.  Only thing I can come up with is that with these particular type of mobs, the range aggro is handled completely differently.  Almost like how root is handled.  When something is rooted, it always attacks the nearest person.  Might be some of the same coding, only with a certian aggro threshold override to it.  Put in as a roleplayish realism if you ask me, as in how the undead are mostly mindless animated corpses that don't know any better.<br />

There was that test a while back with the shroom in Fungus Grove.  Where the cleric beat the mob silly, then stepped back and let a warrior take over way late in the mobs expected life.  4 successful tuants if I remember right, before it turned to the warrior.  I've never seen anything like that myself, nor can I explain how it happened.  But it definately poses the standard &quot;Hmmmm...&quot; of wonder to the theories most of us subscribe to.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all aggro problems I've ever seen I'd attribute to the person putting out just a hair more aggro per tick than me.  Taunt puts you only 1 point higher than them.  Their next cleave steals it right back so fast that the mob never appears to have turned to you and back again.  You eventually get lucky enough for a proc, or the other guy gets stunned enough, and you get a small enough of a lead on him for the mob to turn for a while.<br />
<br />
Something I noticed the other day that happens to me all the time.  Friends SK has initial aggro, I slam or kick and tuant at exactly the same time.  I should have aggro (and probably do), but the slam or kick stunned the mob so it's still facing the SK.  The SK easily outdoes my 1 point hate lead his next swing before my stun has worn off, and the mob has never turned to me.  I started trying to make an effort to hit bash/kick a second &quot;after&quot; tuant, and have seen a lot more heads turning.  The mob never turning to me on a successful tuant is a very rare occurance if I remember to do this.  The rare times they don't turn I'd attribute to the SKs cleave landing and taking aggro the split second after my tuant landed.  But since it was a successful tuant, I know that I'm now very very close to the top spot on the aggro list.  Incite has always turned the mob onto me for the rest of the fight at this point.<br />
<br />
A successful tuant is suppose to put you at the top of the list plus one, but this doesn't mean you're going to have aggro for any more than a split second if competing with someone else.  But you are at the very top of the list with whoever keeps taking the aggro.  And damn, I can't say enough about incite at this point in the battle.  I absolutely love it.</div></div><hr />
