<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quellor</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently got into a guild that raids mobs that I had never dreamed of fighting. I am usually one of the only warriors on and they want me to tank this stuff. So far I guess I have done alright but I would definitly love some imput from warriors with tons of experience doing this stuff.<br />
<br />
I am a 64 warrior with 3 aas if that helps. I would like to know how long should I hit something till I call assist. What disciplines should I use and when. Does it help to keep clicking incite every 30s. And any other information that you guys could give would be very helpful and apreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Gotta keep it in position so the rogues get their shots, and the rangers happy if you can.  Reverse tank when you can and when the situation calls for it.<br />
<br />
Aggro is entirely dependant on how well you gain aggro.  Time your first taunt when its in range and hope it lands, and when experience tells you youve got aggro, call it.  If youve got EB weaps with hate augments, that should only take a second.  If your weaps dont have aggro procs, give it a couple of ticks if you need it.  Their only impression the guild has of your tank skills is how well you keep aggro (and how much you die) alot of times, so give yourself the benefit of the doubt and dont call it till you have it, soon youll get the feel of what your aggro is always like.  Incite is your friend ;)<br />
<br />
I always start out with incite, then furious so the healers can get a second to adjust if your OOR or theyre not playing attention, then defensive if you think the mob will move, Stonewall if you know its NOT going to move, and if the mob flurries alot, use evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theres really quite a lot about raid tanking but heres a few tips..<br />
if you can be a bit mroe specific about what kind of mobs u intend to raid that my help.<br />
<br />
anyway, first off you have to know your mob. how much it hits for , is it an evasive/defensive mob. what kind of AE/procs does it have. this can then influence your set up/resists etc. for example if its a mob that procs any kind of slow effect etc or dots or debuffs, then u have to set up a hotkey to let raid know so healers can remove it. for mobs that fear for example, get a bark potion so your rooted in place. check illia bestiary or messageboards if u dont have any info.  <br />
<br />
<br />
corner tanking- for quite a few mobs, it helps to corner tank. if your a large race, or even medium size race, it helps to get max shrink<br />
<br />
always make sure clerics are set up in one position, then check your CH range from them so you know how far u can move before you go OOR.<br />
<br />
tag your mobs then use incite. for raid tanking, no harm in keeping incite all the way through, so the dot hate has most use.<br />
<br />
use a stopwatch or timer for your defensive and set up a hotkey so your clerics know when its gonna drop.<br />
<br />
as for discs, with the new disc system, you can use furious disc then either stonewall/defensive straight after. this buys you 12 seconds of time for your clerics to get their ass in gear. if your raid isnt disciplined though, i wouldnt use stonewall cos if mob runs off you'll have a hard time chasing after it.<br />
<br />
as to when to call a raid in, thats really down to experience. basically you want at least about 10-15 seconds lead time, but it really depends on the mob and ur weapon set up. if you get some early procs in, then call em in earlier. if not then wait a while longer.. but if you wait too long you run the risk of clerics oom etc.<br />
<br />
know your buffs and make sure you get the best ones. some people will go for the symbol pot9 and ward of gallantry for max hps, but just virtue (bss &amp; focus) works fine too. check if your clerics have bulwark of vie and divine intervention. if they have DI, make sure you get a CHA buff or put a bard in your group to sing CHA. for unslowable mobs like vindi, make sure you get as much damage shield on you as possible.<br />
<br />
if your gonna be raid tanking a lot, i suggest you get to lvl 65 and start getting those defensive AAs as soon as you can.<br />
<br />
on the topic of weapons, im not sure what you have. if you dont have anything great, pick up a GSoT from the bazaar do some EFP adventures and get at least an anger 2 on it.<br />
<br />
for mobs that arent corner tanked, you want to move em around slowly, but not too close to casters. i tend to move them around in a tight circle. use strafe and if you have to flip a mob set up a hotkey to warn your melees.<br />
<br />
thats all i can think off of the top of my head. have fun!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Corner tanking: put your back to a corner and pull the mob to you. All the other melees get behind and push it into the corner. Look up and/or switch to top-down view, if you're not a gnome or halfling, get a shrink or 2 or 3. This is done mostly on mobs that have a targetted AE to keep most people out of AE.<br />
<br />
Calling Assist: On non-rooted mobs, tag with arrow if possible then incite. I engage with disc furious and call assist when it is at 1bubble which is about 10 secs. On rooted mobs, let the debuffers go to town then AETaunt and call assist or call as soon as you get a successful taunt. (Mem blurring rooted mobs makes me cry.)<br />
<br />
Disciplines: Engage with furiuos. Go defensive or evasive when it expires. On perma-rooted mobs or mobs that proc a snare, you may as well use stonewall in place of defensive, since you won't be moving much anyway.<br />
<br />
Incite: Since you are going to use 2 discs; furious on engage and evasive, defensive or stonewall immediately thereafter, endurance becomes a factor on long fights. Incite refreshes in 30 sec, but lasts 60. Incite when the old one expires, not when it refreshes to get the most hate for your endurance. I try to save enough end for 1 incite in case a nuker gets trigger-happy or a dps melee gets a lucky streak of hits. If nothing else, I will incite on enrage so I can turn off attack and not lose aggro.</div></div><hr />
