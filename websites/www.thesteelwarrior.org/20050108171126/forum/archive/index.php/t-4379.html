<br />
Little Johnny was home from school today and he was pestering his mother so his mother said &quot;why don't you go next door and see what the guys are doing to the neighbor's house&quot;<br />
So little Johnny goes next door for a few hours and watches the guys there build an extension on the house they are working on.<br />
At lunchtime; little Johnny comes home and talks to his mom.<br />
mom:&quot;So Johnny, what did you learn today?&quot;<br />
johnny:&quot;I learned how to put in a door!&quot;<br />
mom:&quot;Great! So how do you put a door in?&quot;<br />
johnny:&quot;Well, first you call the fucking lumberyard for the fuckign thing, than the stupid fucking driver gets there 2 hours fucking late, so you take the cocksucker and slam the fucker in, than the fucking thing doesn't fit so you shave a cunthair off the sides and slam the fucker back in place&quot;<br />
mom:&quot;....WHAT?&quot;<br />
johnny:&quot;that's what I learned mom!&quot;<br />
mom:&quot;You go to your room Johnny and wait for your father to get home!&quot;<br />
A few hours later, Johnny's father comes home and his mother calls for little Johnny to come downstairs from his room&quot;<br />
mom:&quot;Okay Johnny tell your father what you learned today&quot;<br />
Little Johnny goes off and tells his dad the exact story he told his mom..<br />
dad:&quot;Johnny, you go up to your room and you don't come down until I see a switch!&quot;<br />
<br />
johnny:&quot;fuck you, that's the electrician's job!&quot;</div></div><hr />
