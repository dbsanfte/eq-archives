<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that current theory is that most weapons proc an average of twice a minute in main hand and once a minute in off-hand.<br />
<br />
I know that Bloodfrenzy procs twice as often as normal.<br />
<br />
What other weapons have modified proc rates?<br />
<br />
A beastlord friend of mine parses all the time and he says that compared to normal, the Copper Hammer of Striking (CHoS) procs 60% more.<br />
<br />
I use a Greatblade of Storms (GBoS) with my CHoS and find that they proc at about the same rate (just my impressions when I switch hands with them or use a different weapon along with them.  Both weapons are augmented with Anger III.<br />
<br />
How often do Anger and Ykesha aug procs go off?<br />
<br />
I have to agree with my beastlord friend that the CHoS (and, in my impression the GSoT) proc more since when I put one in off-hand while I Snare using my Anklesmasher, I most often get off-hand procs before I get a Snare from my main hand.<br />
<br />
Or is Anklesmasher a less-proccing weapon?<br />
<br />
Here's my Magelo:<br />

Thanks in advance for your responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">(and, in my impression the GSoT) Oops!  Wrong acronym!  I meant to say GBoS and not GSoT.  As far as I can tell the GSoT has a normal proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zarcharius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i got a weapon i call &quot;my chopper&quot; during the bertox ring. its called Darwhol's Cleaver. its a 2 hander like 43/38 or something.<br />
anyhow, the proc on it is a 125 unresistable harm touch dd. this thing procs like mad. i have seen it proc 3 times per round (i do flurry and PB etc). This is the highest proc rate i have ever encountered by far. and its common to get an average of 2 procs per tick over the course of an xp type fight. (41% worn haste, 305 dex, chanter haste, raging flurry3 and punishing blade3)<br />
<br />
some weapons just proc more than others. like a bloodfrenzy procs more than a BoC (like twice as much it seems)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think it's twice as much... more like three times per minute as opposed to two times per minute.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, proc rates are very easy to test while you're afk.  Go to katta, beat on the banker's back while you sleep, parse it out in the morning.  You don't have to do this if you don't want to, but it is completely impossible to determine proc rate without parsing.  Even an hour of parsing isn't very accurate, so your impression from watching the chat box is not even close to relevent.</div></div><hr />

Like Brutul says, fuckin parse it.  If you're too lazy to do that, then don't come here and question the people who did about our information.</div></div><hr />

There aren't any &quot;low proc rate&quot; weapons to avoid. There are as far as I know VERY few &quot;improved proc rate&quot; weapons out there however. I only know of three personally, and that's Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, Bloodfrenzy, and the cleric DPS hammers.</div></div><hr />

I rarely go to katta, and frankly never bothered to stop at bank let  alone try to find it.  Who, and where (loc?) is this banker you say to parse on? Are there programs to sort out your logs to calculate procs per minute?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to parse a few weapons' proc rates but never knew where or how to go about it. Any info would be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's a crappy weapon for anyone level I'd say 45 or higher, but when I was a young warrior I used a Whip of Strangulation (6/24 procs choke) in my mainhand.  It was something like 20dd, a small dot, and also debuffed str and agi, lasted for 30 seconds.  I would always, without fail, proc it again before I got the &quot;Your choke spell has ended&quot; message.  So I can say that that weapon procs more than twice a minute, just not sure of the modifier.  Not to mention it's worthless (due to ratio) from about 45 on up, possibly lower with all the twink gear on the market now.  Was a  good agro weapon too, I remember with that and whatever dps weapon I had in secondary I had at the time that I could easily outagro any other warrior who was using two SSoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would always, without fail, proc it again before I got the &quot;Your choke spell has ended&quot; message. So I can say that that weapon procs more than twice a minute <br />
<br />
Lies, parse it.  You will find times in your log where your choke spell wears off.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of fucking telling this to people PARSE IT OR DON'T MAKE THE CLAIM.  You're fucking wrong, and all you're doing is making yourself look like a dumbass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, so it was slightly exaggerated.  To be perfectly honest, it wore off approximately one out of every 10 times.  Whoopti-ti-do!  Of course, EVERY weapon out there has it's time where it doesn't proc for a bit.  <br />
<br />
Seriously, you don't have to act like such a fucking asshole responding, we're talking about a low to possibly mid level weapon here for Christ's sake!  Jesus!  It's not like I'm talking about something that's going to impact the game at all, nothing like saying a BoC or a SoD procs more often the other.  I'm talking about a 6/24 weapon!!!!!  Why would I make shit up about a 6/24 weapon?  <br />
<br />
Do YOU have any experience using the weapon?  No?  Then you can't call me a liar for something you don't know about!<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for the fact that it was dropped in the OLD Droga, and difficult to track down at this point, I'd buy it right now, head on over to Katta, parse it while I go to work, and post the logs when I get home tonight.  Maybe someone on another server (I'm on Torv) who can find one in the bazaar (should be cheap, maybe 50pp) can do the parsing if I can't find one?<br />
<br />
Oh, and Haass, for the sake of argument here, and let's say I'm wrong: I'd rather look like a dumbass, be proven wrong, and learn something from it, than to be proven right, look like an asshole, and learn nothing from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Haas just likes to be an ass more often than not. Just ignore it when he is.<br />
<br />
I would have a hard time believing your claim though. There's usually a big difference between reality/the way things really are as opposed to how you feel something is in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You apparantly don't get it, so i'll explain it to you.<br />
<br />
This is a board of INFORMATION.  We pride ourselves on that fact.  Misinformation breeds stupidity and ignorance.  That's not what anyone here is about.  We try to figure out how the game works and inform people of that fact so that they can make intelligent choices in the game that relate to their characters.  Things like --<br />
<br />
I would always, without fail, proc it again before I got the &quot;Your choke spell has ended&quot; message. So I can say that that weapon procs more than twice a minute <br />
<br />
--are misinformation.  I don't care what weapon it is, it's wrong. We have several threads dedicated to some work that a lot of people did in confirming the fact that 99.9% of all weapons have the same fucking proc rate.  Every week or so, someone else comes in to claim they have found the magical oasis of proc in some random weapon, and it's getting very old.<br />
<br />
You are not coming up with anything revolutionary here.  You are not telling us anything new.  What you're telling us is that thru your &quot;Gut feeling,&quot; your weapon procs more than ours, and you're telling us that our parsing is bullshit.  I take offense to that.  You think I'm an asshole?  Some random one post wonder walks in here EVERY WEEK and tells me what I helped prove for this board is bullshit, because their weapon procs more.  They &quot;know&quot; it does.  It's crap, and I call them on it.<br />
<br />

Why would I make shit up about a 6/24 weapon?  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying you're making shit up.  I'm saying that you can't tell what the proc rate of a weapon is by looking at your screen.  I don't care who the fuck you are, you can't.  By claiming you can, you are again, lying.<br />
<br />
Do YOU have any experience using the weapon? No? Then you can't call me a liar for something you don't know about! <br />
<br />
I have one right now in Kael, I'm slamming the recruiter with it.  There will be a parse up in an hour.  Might wanna get ready for a harsh dose of reality pal.  If you wanna talk shit, better get ready to accept the answers when you get proven wrong.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Haass, for the sake of argument here, and let's say I'm wrong: I'd rather look like a dumbass, be proven wrong, and learn something from it, than to be proven right, look like an asshole, and learn nothing from it. <br />
<br />
Don't worry, it's gonna happen.  Parse is already 12 minutes long and counting.</div></div><hr />

I'm not uber enough to prove it, and I usually tend to ignore data from weapons I can't obtain anyway.  Somebody around here has one tho and I'm sure either remembers where it is or will run it for ya.<br />

I sure can! Here are the contents of another post I made in a SoD/BoC proc parse thread. It was with 197 Dexterity, but I'm pretty sure with 305, I'd have been around 3 procs per minute:<br />

I did a 386 minute (about 6 and a half hours) parse with EQ Companion and these are my results. There is an increase in proc rate compared to my previous parse of 45 minutes. This is with 36 percent haste, 197 Dex, Blasphemous Blade mainhand, Blade of Carnage offhand:<br />
<br />
Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled - 1047 procs = 2.71 procs per minute<br />
Blade of Carnage - 323 procs = 0.84 procs per minute<br />
Icicle Strike (aug on mainhand) - 626 procs = 1.62 procs per minute<br />
Heated Blade (aug on offhand) - 310 procs = 0.80 procs per minute<br />
<br />
DPS including DD procs was 78.30. DD procs accounted for 6.82 DPS.</div></div><hr />

Bella halsin (I believe, spelling could be off here) in katta castellum, a green con banker, has super regen and won't attack back if you attack her.  She calls for her guards, but nobody comes to help, so you're safe to go afk for days.  I wish I could give you her loc or directions, but I just kinda wandered until I found her the first time I went, and it's sorta by feel for me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">From memory, here are some directions to the bank:<br />
Assuming you just zoned into Katta from Tenebrous Mountains, go past the zone in area and as you come into the main part of town there will be a fence-like stone structure on your left, follow that a little ways and once you have the option to turn left, do so. Follow this path until you take the first right. You will now be walking down a narrow path along a wall way way above the ground. Be careful. If you fall from the upper parts of this path, you will shortly be back at your bind point with your corpse right behind the bank in Katta. (I've tried jumping from the upper part of the path to the roof of the bank. It didn't work the first time, and I don't feel like trying a second time.) When you get to the end of this path, you will be at a lower level, with a tavern ahead of you and to the left, and the bank ahead of you and to the right. You can parse on both of these bankers. From the front they occasionally will hit you for a very minimal amount (assuming level 65) and from the rear they just stand there shouting, &quot;guards! guards!&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
If these directions aren't sufficient, refer to this map (http://eqatlas.com/luclin/kattacastellummap.html) from eqatlas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">OK, let's see if I have this right now:<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy in main 3ppm<br />
BBotE in off 1.5ppm<br />
Any LDoN proc on Bloodfrenzy in main 2ppm<br />
Any LDoN proc on BBotE in off 1ppm<br />
Any ranger proc buff while dual-ielding 3ppm (2ppm for 2h)<br />
<br />
Total maximum average 10.5 procs per minute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Yeah, that sounds about right.  Basically most procs are 2ppm mainhand, 1ppm offhand, with Bloodfrenzy/BBoTE being 3/1.5.  Any augs should fall under the former category of being a normal proc, so 2/1.  Whatever a weapon procs mainhand, expect it to proc 1/2 that number offhand.</div></div><hr />
