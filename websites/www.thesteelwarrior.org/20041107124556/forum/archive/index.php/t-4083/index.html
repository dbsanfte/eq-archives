<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nytewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, all. I recently found your board after coming back to EQ  after an extended abscence (bout 1.5 years).<br />
<br />
I have read alot of the posts but there are so many I prolly missed a number, so...if I ask a question thats been covered countless times just direct me to a link.<br />
<br />
Background on me I was the second warrior on Bristlebane to level 50 and a Founding member of ring of Valor as well as its guild leader for 4 months when our GL did one of his many disappearing acts. Now when I left EQ Warriors were gods and revered. I came back a week ago and find Im being short changed by paladins and sk's. What the hell happened to my class while I was gone?<br />
<br />
I spend hours looking for a group in bot while paladins with lower HP and AC get grabbed up instantly. Last I checked our class was good at one thing only, eating damage while letting the real damage dealers kill the mob. I was considered one of the best tanks on the server at one time, I come back and im a chump?<br />
<br />
Someone tell me what the hell is going on here<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just read the forum, we are obsolete. <br />
You know what would benefit warriors the most in my opinion? Not reading this forum. The fastest way for a warrior to get banned from a group is to piss and moan the whole time they are in it about how their job is so hard and nobody wants them anymore and SOE has screwed them and so on. It is amazing what a warrior can do when they aren't too busy typing out group chat about how they are getting shafted. <br />
<br />
I have 5 warriors on my friends list that I routinely ask to group with because they took the time to adapt to a changing game. They realize that people working together is the point of a group. The two tank scenario works just fine in exp groups kids. I spent a wonderful Saturday in PoV in a group with a ranger pulling, me stunning on the incoming so that the shammy could land his slow and then the warrior taking over on aggro and tanking while the nukers blew the crap out of the mobs. Exp flew and now we have an arrangement to get together on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
The unfortunate flip side is that I have 2 warriors on ignore that I wouldn't run with if it was a matter of life and death because they intentionally screwed groups trying to prove that they should be able to do everything and bitching about other people doing their jobs. It is funny that this board kept coming up in their rants. <br />
<br />
I used to enjoy this board when I ran my warrior because the other sections of it contained good information that was helpful and the tavern had some great LOL stories. I come back here looking for the same thing and most everywhere seems to be permeated with this nobody likes us crap and yet I read the LFG thread and I see people saying that they get groups NP in less than 10 minutes of looking.<br />
<br />
I am sure that this will upset some people and the posts of how I am a clueless idiot can start whenever, but those are my random thoughts and the reality I see when I log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would imagine it depressing for a warrior to read these threads as most imply how warriors are useless and what not which isnt true.  Go play the game and learn on your own, or stay out of the threads that start with a &quot;warriors suck&quot; or so topic.<br />
<br />
    I thought it was only me that noticed that warriors were content on  getting grouped with no problems, yet complain about not getting in groups at the same time.  Fortunately like Carwenst i have lots of warrior on friends I group with, yet also have a couple that purposely screw the group up while whining the whole time</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Contrary to popular opinion warriors do not suck. Of course, it just takes us a couple hundred thousand plat or some fairly high end raiding type gear to do the same thing a paladin can do in velious quest armor, wielding a rusty weapon and chancasting a spell they bought in shadowhaven when they were level 15.  And don't let anyone fool you about the lfg thing, I personally went 3 weeks during which there weren't any folks from my guild on for me to group with at the times I was on, and I got 0 pickup groups.  LDoN has changed that somewhat, so now it's hit and miss. Some times I log in and get snatched up immediately, others I sit LFG with the other 30 or so pure melees my level for hours and get nada.  And the two tank scenario does work great, but it is far from necessary, and all too often the when you have a warrior and a knight in the same group, the knight will purposely do everything in their power to prove how flawless their aggro is, regardless of whether they're supposed to be the primary tank or not.  I've seen it happen quite a bit recently.  Do warriors bitch about the whole balance thing alot? Yes we do.  That's because this problem has been around for far too long, and the only thing we're getting from SOE is empty promises of &quot;we're working on it&quot;.   We're pissed about it and we have a right to be.  A lot of my friends have quit the game because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And they should rightly so be scared at this point, considering one of their own just tanked the boss mob of the game. I hope SOE is watching this and finally realize how much their &quot;balancing&quot; act with knights specifically, and casters in general, has screwed over warriors specifically, and pure melee in general. What incentive do I have now to continue to level and gear my warrior when, by the time I get to the point to tank Quarm, I'm going to be told by my guild, &quot;Sorry, but you can't tank Quarm. We have this Knight here who can do it better than you because he can hold aggro. You can't hold aggro if you life depended on it, and this knight can take the damage Quarm can deal out and survive. We don;t even need more clerics on the CH Rot because we also have a BoV Rot that keeps him runed.&quot;<br />
<br />
You know, the more I think about this, the more appealing that giant bat picture that surfaced in one of these threads becomes. Course, I would just rather use it on BoV and get rid of that threat right there.<br />
<br />
All this because Knights have a better way to keep mobs glued to them. This, to put it succinctly, sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No warriors dont suck... but a paladin with gear a little better will be able to 99,99% what this warrior can do.<br />
As long as your guild equip MT first, warriors will always tank better than paladins because they have the gear first.<br />
There is nothing &quot;warrior specific&quot; right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">have a fairly good grasp of the issues of both classes <br />
<br />
Being that both your Pali and warrior are same level and have about 100 hitpoints and 30 odd ac difference I am unable to grasp how you can not understand the issue.<br />
<br />
My warrior has had no change in four expansions, besides a few equipment slot upgrades and some AA; my caster melee brothers and sisters at arms have changed drastically in these same expansions gathering both the same loot , more loot specific to their class, AND more ability with new spells.<br />
<br />
I do not grasp how anyone can see that the despairity differences between pure melee and caster melee has not increased 10 fold.  monk vs bst, warrior vs knight, rogue vs bard.   <br />
<br />
The pure melee class has been shunted and out shined for too long.  We need drastic help now !!!<br />

you know dang well we are paladins BB.  You also know better than putting words in our mouth, neither of us said nothing is wrong with warriors.  All we said was this is not the first place a returning warrior should be in.  Glad most of you dont think warriors suck, i sure as hell dont wanna be tanking some of these mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Carswent,<br />
<br />
You constantly bring this &quot;I have a Pally and Warrior and I don't see the problem&quot; thing up.  I imagine you probably play your Pally a bit more nowadays by your attitude.  Also, level up to 65 as a warrior with your crap agro gear and try to keep agro in a tier 3 zone.  Then come back and tell us about how we are not broke.<br />
<br />
Your gear would get an enchanter slower in a group killed over and over and over.  (and much better gear will still get the enchanter killed, just not as much) Then level up your pally to 65 and try that.    Tell me which one is more frustrating to play.<br />
<br />
Then listen to the others when they replace you, and say things like &quot;lets get a Pally as MT&quot;.  Listen to the slowers who have a Pally and War in group and insist the Pally MT (despite the war being quite well equipped and having at least one title in AA above the Pally).<br />
<br />
You have no clue what you are talking about.  The reason warriors have a bad rep is not because they are complaining on this board.  When I get into an xp group, I don't start spouting class balance stuff.  I'm just happy to be in a group.  The reason we are getting a bad rep (go to the shaman boards) is because other classes see how they die less when a Pally is the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">a quote from an enchanter I almost grouped with the other night:<br />
<br />
You have a warrior tanking? Hmmmm... think Im gonna pass.  My last group had a warrior tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You are absolutely right BAFT. If I don't get into tier 3 zones and make 65 I have no clue and no right to speak correct? Guess what, there are still a bunch of people who are not 65 and there are many people, my self included, that have no desire to go to tier 3 anytime soon. Some of us still play simply to unwind from work/school/whatever and would prefer to have a fun night hanging out with friends than worry about how far we can get and how fast and if we are squeezing every possible bit of exp/loot/AP out of a situation.<br />
<br />
Your gear would get an enchanter slower in a group killed over and over and over.  <br />
<br />
The standard group I ran Carwenst in was me, ranger, druid, monk, cleric, and chanter. Guess what, it worked just fine and more often than not, if anyone died it was the ranger.<br />
<br />
I don't play Car anymore and, since you are such an avid reader of my posts, I would assume that you knew that. I deleted him, my first paladin, my necro, and my chanter when I was leaving EQ because I was tired of adults acting like pre-pubescent teenagers. I took a very short break and then decided to play EQ on my terms and to just shut the machine off when I didn't enjoy it anymore. So when I hit the character select I made my paladin since that is what I have run in every RPG (paper and computer) that I have ever played. You want to make that into something else, go right ahead but you will be deluding yourself.<br />
<br />
When I get into an xp group, I don't start spouting class balance stuff. <br />
<br />
Good for you. Like I put in my post, there were 2 that did and I won't run with them and judging by how long they sit in the LFG que while other tanks (Pali, SK, and yes warriors) are snatched up, I would assume that others don't like the attitude either.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that people who think that warriors are broke and useless and that no one wants them around find something else to do because it seems obvious that these types of threads have even managed to alienate EQ CS.<br />
<br />
Faederya, sorry it took me a bit to get back to you, but I wanted to run some numbers real fast.<br />
<br />
First of all, the pali's gear is superior to the warrior's in several slots and therefore it makes sense that the stats are close. The next point is that I screwed my warrior out of 25 stamina when I started because of the 25 start points I got, I spent 7 on STR, 8 on AGI, and 10 on Dex. As you can tell, the warrior’s stamina is not maxxed and so that one of the problems with his HPs. With those two things in mind, if you put the beginning stat distribution where I should have and then put the gear from the paladin onto the warrior that is an upgrade (overlooking upgrades that the warrior cannot use) you get a difference of 435 HPs and 25 AC. Now, the warrior has ND1 and the paladin does not, so if you give the paladin ND1 to match, the HP difference then becomes 374.<br />
<br />
So we have an 11% difference in HPs and a 2% difference in AC. Now, the warrior class is also designed to be a master of weapons correct? I do not have parses of the DPS difference between my paladin and my warrior because I can't take this game that seriously. However, I am willing to bet that the warrior out damages my paladin by at least 10% when the warrior is dual wielding, if not more.<br />
<br />
Next is the most important point and that is mitigation. I know that my warrior was more effective in taking hits than my paladin and thus was the better tank in a meatshield role. I have no idea what the differences are, but I can visibly see the difference and since my wife is my normal cleric, I know that the healer can see the difference.<br />
<br />
What does this all mean? It means that paladins are behind in HPs, AC, mitigation, and DPS. Like I said before, I know the advantages of both classes and I know the drawbacks to both classes better than a lot of people. However, like BAFT likes to point out, I have never been 65 and so I don't know what it is like for those people. Also, like I have stated before, I would love to see warrior agro increased, but changing knights to compensate for some oversights on the warrior doesn’t fix anything other than make melee fall further behind and none of the warrior issues make them obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually, warriors and paladins share the same mitigation table, so you can scrap that &quot;warriors have better mitigation&quot; argument.  Warriors have SLIGHTLY better avoidance, so we take about 3% less damage than paladins iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;there were 2 that did and I won't run with them and judging by how long they sit in the LFG que while other tanks (Pali, SK, and yes warriors) are snatched up, I would assume that others don't like the attitude either.&quot;<br />
<br />
See now Carswent, you are basically implying that warriors aren;t getting groups and having trouble because we bitch on the TSW outhouse board.  We aren't getting groups because other classes would rather not randomly die due to lost agro.  We aren't getting groups because slowers like to slow on incoming and nukers like to chain nuke and they can do that with a Pally (or SK).  Like I said, read other class message boards (not PON), and see what they have to say before spouting your shit.  They aren't complaining about warriors &quot;attitude&quot;.  They are complaining about our performance.  Here's a good one:<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16622 <br />
<br />
<br />
You say in other posts you personally don't see the problem with warrior agro.<br />
<br />
Now you post that you don't even play your warrior anymore?  *boogle*  Well then how do you know about the issues with agro that we face?<br />
<br />
You don't know the advantages of both classes.  You aren't fighting the same mobs who hit as hard, who riposte, who flatten a chanter before the second taunt can be used.  You don't have the 60+ Pally spells yet.  How can you come here and present this &quot;I have played both classes and can say that they are balanced&quot;.<br />
<br />
Come here as a Pally (which you are) and post that crap instead of hiding behind the &quot;I've played both classes&quot; shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">First of all, spell my name right. It is CARWENST. Secondly, I haven't hidden behind anything. I have been fairly clear here and on PoN where I first had the displeasure of reading your whiny Shamans don't like me crap, that I deleted my warrior less than 3 months ago. Since most people equate the demise of the warrior to the advent of PoP, I would say I have a clue especially considering that I bought EQ less than 2 weeks before PoP came out (another fact that I have stated here and on PoN that you, my devoted reader, seem to overlook at your convenience). <br />
<br />
Additionally, when you questioned whether or not I tanked in PoP on the PoN board, I responded to that with an affirmative for tiers one and two with both my warrior and my paladin. It is nice to know that you have at least read my response since you now only question my abilities to tank in tier 3. <br />
<br />
you are basically implying that warriors aren;t getting groups and having trouble because we bitch on the TSW outhouse board.  <br />
<br />
Um, nope. I said that these two I wouldn't group with because they bitch non-stop and apparantly others didn't like it either since they were repeatedly passed over for not only Paladins and SKs, but also other warriors. I also said in my initial post that I think that for people playing warriors it would be beneficially not to read this part of TSW because the attitudes that permeate the posts here seem to translate to some people in game and they tell people what they have read here in group chat instead of focusing on their job. No where have I said people come to TSW to locate people to put on ignore lists.<br />
<br />
We aren't getting groups because other classes would rather not randomly die due to lost agro. <br />
<br />
Really? I wonder how in the hell I got groups with my warrior then since you were &quot;broken&quot; by the time I started playing. Oh wait, it wasn't in tier 3 so it doesn't count.<br />
<br />
You aren't fighting the same mobs who hit as hard, who riposte, who flatten a chanter before the second taunt can be used. <br />
<br />
Here's a news flash for you, I have not tanked anything with my paladin that I have not tanked with my warrior excepting LDoN mobs. If by this statement you mean that I am not tanking in tier 3 and above, duh. Also, since when did EQ begin and end with level 65 and tier 3 and above? I have not said anything about higher PoP tanking because I have never done it. I haven't said anything about raid tanking as a paladin because I have only done that as a warrior.<br />
<br />
You don't have the 60+ Pally spells yet. <br />
<br />
Thank's Captain Obvious, I thought that SOE was going to let me get them early because I am a paladin and all.<br />
<br />
How can you come here and present this &quot;I have played both classes and can say that they are balanced&quot;. <br />
<br />
When did I say that again? I have said that I think it would be great if warriors had additional agro, is that what you mean? Also, I have played both classes stupid. I have played both classes post PoP's release to 58 and those experiences are what I am commenting on, why is that so hard for you to accept?<br />
<br />
Since you seem so high on that thread about how shamans don't like warriors, how about this one that was posted here on TSW about clerics (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=16525) prefering warriors?<br />
<br />
Beornegar, thanks I was mistaken. I am not sure on that percentage though because I know it is a noticible difference in damage taken since my wife and I have both commented on it, but I think the basic idea is the same whether it is avoidance or mitigation - the warrior takes less damage during a fight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In all honesty, half the problem is you guys.  The other half is.. there are legitimate balance issues that come into play.  I'm not going to try to deny that.  However, you people are also a major obstacle to your own enjoyment.  Not because you moan so much, but because you do so in a public place that other classes frequent.  As thick and unintelligent you may think most paladins are, the average everquest player is more so.  They believe almost anything you tell them.  <br />
<br />
If you want to look at a parallel... look at mages.  A year ago (longer even) they did absolutely nothing but complain, for the most part.  Nearly every single post at the Mage's tower was a long whine, VERY reminscent of these boards now.  What happened because of it?  People refused to group with them.  Both because they were underpowered AND because they read the incredibly overstated uselessness the mages themselves shouted on their own board.  You do the same.  This doesn't mean you do not have problems, but half the time they are not AS drastic as you make it seem.  Yet, the average person believes every word of your hype...to your own detriment.  What does this mean in the long run?  That even when you are fixed..your problem will linger for months.  There are people who STILL do not count mages as damage dealers because of what happened long ago.  It has taken them awhile to earn the recognition they now have.  It didn't happen overnight.  <br />
<br />
Do not overestimate the power of all this negativity.  Warriors who come here recieve it.  And whether it is justified or not, the way it is presented makes it even more demoralizing and then it becomes a point they *constantly* dwell on...and this pisses people off.  Not to mention, the fringe extremists of any class never reallyc are about balance.  While many do understand that balance means you cannot have a class that is all around perfect, the loud fringe idiots do not.  Then, when you complain about legitimate balance problems.. we hear about these ridiculous &quot;fixes&quot; for the sake of some wierd &quot;balance&quot;.  This alienates you further from the rest of the classes (druids asking for both ch and manaburn anyone?).  <br />
<br />
Legitimate, even tempered, discussion of problems is a good thing.  Overly dramatic whining is not.  I remember reading a funny comment earlier by a warrior.. something about &quot;the reason warriors get nothing and casters get everything is because the Dev's play casters!&quot; Heh.  I find it so funny because that exact same comment was used by casters awhile ago. The fringe people always cling to the same idiocy.  <br />
<br />
Parses and hard info to prove specific points is good.  Couple that with a legitimate effort to offer a way to balance your class in relation to others is very good.  You have to understand that balance is give and take though.  All classes need to be viable, not one.  Mages failed to understand that for a long time and it caused problems for them within their own ranks and with the general population..and I wouldn't doubt with SoE aswell.  I really would not suggest following their example.</div></div><hr />

Kick a dog when he's down enough times and all he'll know how to do is attack any foot that comes near him.<br />

This doesn't come easy for anyone being as cranky as we are; but after years of negligence ( by SoE )this is about all that's left for the lot of us minus a few clearer heads. Adressing this idea about melee balance-if done a year or go ago-methinks would have been at least applicable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SOE has shown us that they are going to do nothing for us. Even today, Absor was on this board and do you know what the extent of his stay was? He checked out the FFXI thread in the Tavern. That's right. Nothing but checking our opinion of their competition.<br />

It really didn't. Warriors are not naturally a bunch of whiners looking for class balance problems. I think what's showing up now is the pent up frustration of experiencing for more than a year, every single day, what it feels like to be third rate at your only role. That needs to be taken seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
Planes of Power. That's what did it.<br />
<br />
The game changed so drastically between Luclin's high HP mobs, long ass fights, and PoP's steroid based encounters.<br />
<br />
Think about it.<br />
<br />
Damage taken was ramped up.<br />
<br />
Damage output was ramped up.<br />
<br />
Spells were raised. Levels were raised. Stats went through the roof. Guild memberships had to totally shift to deal with the content restrictions.<br />
<br />
Top to bottom, Planes of Power just totally shifted the playerbase. Especially the raid level playerbase.<br />
<br />
This board was, and still IS an amazing community. Far more tight-knit than a different community I have far too many posts with.<br />
<br />
But there's been a ton of turnover, especially among the melee classes who are burned out or just plain frustrated beyond belief ... and the current state of the game is pretty bleak.<br />
<br />
Hence the rampant negativity.<br />
<br />
And assholes like me don't help either.<br />
<br />
:-(<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Corrected tight-knight to read tight-KNIT. God what a freudian slip!</div></div><hr />

Oh I'M sorry, was I supposed to not mention anything about how annoying I find getting aggro to be or how I feel when knights with lower hp/ac get chosen for offtanking/xp groups over me consistently?<br />
<br />
Would you like a cup of coffee with your loaf of bullshit?</div></div><hr />

In all honesty, half the problem is you guys.  The other half is.. there are legitimate balance issues that come into play.  I'm not going to try to deny that.  However, you people are also a major obstacle to your own enjoyment.  Not because you moan so much, but because you do so in a public place that other classes frequent.  As thick and unintelligent you may think most paladins are, the average everquest player is more so.  They believe almost anything you tell them.  <br />
<br />
If you want to look at a parallel... look at mages.  A year ago (longer even) they did absolutely nothing but complain, for the most part.  Nearly every single post at the Mage's tower was a long whine, VERY reminscent of these boards now.  What happened because of it?  People refused to group with them.  Both because they were underpowered AND because they read the incredibly overstated uselessness the mages themselves shouted on their own board.  You do the same.  This doesn't mean you do not have problems, but half the time they are not AS drastic as you make it seem.  Yet, the average person believes every word of your hype...to your own detriment.  What does this mean in the long run?  That even when you are fixed..your problem will linger for months.  There are people who STILL do not count mages as damage dealers because of what happened long ago.  It has taken them awhile to earn the recognition they now have.  It didn't happen overnight.  <br />
<br />
Do not overestimate the power of all this negativity.  Warriors who come here recieve it.  And whether it is justified or not, the way it is presented makes it even more demoralizing and then it becomes a point they *constantly* dwell on...and this pisses people off.  Not to mention, the fringe extremists of any class never reallyc are about balance.  While many do understand that balance means you cannot have a class that is all around perfect, the loud fringe idiots do not.  Then, when you complain about legitimate balance problems.. we hear about these ridiculous &quot;fixes&quot; for the sake of some wierd &quot;balance&quot;.  This alienates you further from the rest of the classes (druids asking for both ch and manaburn anyone?).  <br />
<br />
Legitimate, even tempered, discussion of problems is a good thing.  Overly dramatic whining is not.  I remember reading a funny comment earlier by a warrior.. something about &quot;the reason warriors get nothing and casters get everything is because the Dev's play casters!&quot; Heh.  I find it so funny because that exact same comment was used by casters awhile ago. The fringe people always cling to the same idiocy.  <br />
<br />
Parses and hard info to prove specific points is good.  Couple that with a legitimate effort to offer a way to balance your class in relation to others is very good.  You have to understand that balance is give and take though.  All classes need to be viable, not one.  Mages failed to understand that for a long time and it caused problems for them within their own ranks and with the general population..and I wouldn't doubt with SoE aswell.  I really would not suggest following their example.  <br />
<br />
And through the parses and collected information, I have found that the best way to remedy this problem is to nerf Knights and nerf them hard.<br />
<br />
It's the most simple and efficient fix. Warriors aren't as broken as Knights are overpowered - that's a fact.</div></div><hr />

1 Forum of this board is dedicated to this.  The rest of site is clean.<br />
<br />
Classic tactic on your part: someone has a legit complaint and you attack the victim.  Completely minimizes the complaint.<br />
<br />
I don't see warriors raising this in game; I don't see warriors raising this in other parts of TSW; I see warriors raising it in the appropriate locations of this board.<br />
