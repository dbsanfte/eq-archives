i mean its said that CA makes u have 10% melee avoidance.  Does that make it to where u get hit 90% as much as you used to (i have read no)  or does does it give u  a 10% bigger chance get missed more ? <br />

<br />
<br />
•Combat Agility will cause you to be hit less often.<br />
<br />
•Combat Stability will cause you to be hit for less on average.<br />
<br />
Both have been parsed to reduce overall damage taken by the same amount.  This is for plate tanks, other classes will benefit from Agility more because they don't get hit enough times to benefit from added mitigation as much as someone who is constantly tanking.<br />
<br />
The percentages have been parsed and debated extensively, but it's simple.  <br />
»These are the most important AA's you could buy.  If you dont want to take my word for it, I'm sure my post will be followed by plenty that agree with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well the simplest way to look at them is :<br />
1. they both have the same power on average.<br />
2. they both bring very little help : you won't see any diference but you will 'fell' it.<br />
3. with both maxed you will actually be a lesser mana-sponge than without.<br />
4. there respective influences are so small that you can max both of them the way you want (ex:CA3 then CS3 or vice versa, or CS&amp;CA1 to CS&amp;CA3, ...).<br />
5. if you want more detail, they have been already explained and parsed and argued on other threads so read them again and again untill you understand them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />

EDIT : CA and CS both make your AC more efficient, but in two different maners.</div></div><hr />

While you won't see a dramatic change between any one level of CS or CA, the overall difference from having none to having CS3 and CA3 is huge. You'll go from probably needing multiple CHs per BoT mob and needing a disc for kriger's to a single CH per mob and tanking kriger's more or less like you do trash mobs now. Also, the nameds will become doable for you to tank.</div></div><hr />

well this was covered by the third point &quot;with CS3 and CA3 you will be a lesser mana sponge&quot; ie you will need much less heal than before.</div></div><hr />

They're of equal value to a warrior over the long haul, but I think I'm right in saying that CS will help 'smooth out' dps spikes more than CA will, so plausibly might be a better buy for an MA type who gets a lot of healing and only dies when dps spikes up high.  For we bards, we like CA more - less stuns if you're missed completely rather than just taking less damage per blow.<br />
Just my personal understanding! I try to keep up with this stuff but in general Yoda tells it like it is - both are useful, both help you take less damage, therefore tanks want both. There's no major distinction making one a better choice for tanks.</div></div><hr />

True, but the way you said it made it sound like you were downplaying the effectiveness of the AAs, and I was being sure to note that they are indeed extremely wise and useful abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side note ... though they both decrease the raw damage taken over time from melee by the same percent, Combat agility/LR etc have a hefty advantage in the newer expansions.<br />
<br />
Mobs cannot proc on a miss ... therefore the more you are missed the less chance there is that you will take the extra 100-3000 damage from that one proc.  Since EP+ PoP, GoD, and OoW like to have regular xp mobs (as well as raid mobs) that have a variety of different combat effects, the avoidance line of aa's might prove to be slightly more beneficial than the raw mitigation.  They are both subject to the random number generator and lady luck, though, and you can STILL take full rounds of damage even with everything capped.   With everything maxxed (including the OoW ones) tanks on average should take about 40% less damage.<br />
<br />
Max em both.  They are crucial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
For this reason, I'm working on LR5 first, then CS3/ID5.<br />

<br />
My reasoning is simple.  LR5 for 15 points has a much more dramatic impact (you really start to notice the difference with LR3) then CS3 for 12.  I'll work on CS3/ID5 next.  In the meantime, I'm going for the biggest bang for the buck because it just gets easier and easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
For GoD and Omens, LR5 will have a larger impact on spike damage as well if it kicks in.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's not to say CA3/LR5 is better then CS3/ID5.  But it's more noticeable at first, and it'll make getting the other much easier.  The higher your AC, the more you'll notice ID5 as they compliment each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best way to describe CA is simply that you dodge blows more often.  Once you max out with LR5 you'll notice a lot more dodge spam then before.<br />
<br />
CS you will notice mobs hitting you for their minimum much more often.  By the time you get ID5, you'll notice this a lot more frequently in lower tiered zones and places where mobs have low innate ATK.</div></div><hr />

This reasoning is wrong.  The most efficient order, for damage taken, FOR ALL CLASSES, is CA3, CS3, LR5, ID5.<br />
<br />
10% for the Arch abilities, 5% for the PoP abilites.  12 points for Arch, 15 points for PoP.  It's not fucking rocket science here.<br />

LIGHTNING REFLEXES 5 IS NOT AN AUTO MISS ABILITY, NOR IS IT BETTER THAN COMBAT STABILITY <br />

As far as I can tell mobs do no work a set number of procs over time ... and as such using evasive vs defensive on mobs like Reparm presents a significant advantage over raw melee mitigation.<br />
<br />
As far as melee damage taken over time LR 5 and ID5 are exactly the same.  To say that LR5 is never better than CS5 is not entirely true though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mitigation isn't something you can see by just eyeballing damage taken so people think avoidance is better.  You can train mitigation but you won't be able to see its effect just looking at the red on your screen, but you can definitely tell you're being missed more.  Actually, you can't, but people believe what they want to see.  I still hear like 'after getting avoidance mobs miss me 10 times in a row', never mind that probably would've still happened without.<br />
<br />
Procs are such a minor part of tanking it's hardly irrelevant.  Also a lot of OoW mobs seem to just have 0 second cast long refresh abilities instead of procs which means avoidance has no effect on them.<br />
<br />
The only argument for avoidance would be Chaos Claws, a really strong proc on some really common enemies, but even then, the difference isn't significant.  If you have to rely on getting missed so you didn't get proced to survive you shouldn't be tanking the mobs in the first place.  And in raid situations the best way to deal with procs is resists/spellshield/Alendar line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LR5 capped (assuming you have PE) equates to about 17% less hits taken.  Add in the OoW stuff and you're up to on average 22% less hits taken.<br />
<br />
22% less hits taken = 22% less procs averaged out.  IF (big emphasis on the if) you fight in places where mobs have innate procs ... 22% less damage taken from procs adds up to a whole lot less damage taken.<br />
<br />
On boss mobs who proc for 3k and can do so twice in a single round (Reparm) it increases your survivability far more than 22% mitigation ever would.  22% less procs + 22% less hits on average.<br />
<br />
These mobs are small islands in the vast ocean of Everquest, though.  For all practical purposes there is no real difference in the tankabilitiy gained from the avoidance vs mitigation line.</div></div><hr />

I won't even go into raid encounters except to say mitigation is going to net the bigger payoff, not avoidance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll try and find a link to a thread ... basically this:<br />
<br />
Mobs have innate procs.  You have weapon procs.  Weapon procs can process on a miss.  Innate procs on the mobs cannot proc on a miss.  If a mob is wielding a weapon that itself has a proc, then that mob can indeed proc on a miss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess this is right, you can't count the times LR5 saved you because you can't prove it did.<br />
<br />
My reasoning is simple. LR5 for 15 points has a much more dramatic impact (you really start to notice the difference with LR3) then CS3 for 12. <br />
<br />
This is wrong.  There is a 1% difference between LR2 and LR3.  You do not notice a difference.<br />
<br />
There is also a 5% difference between LR0 and LR5.  There is a 10% difference between CS0 and CS3.  LR5 for 15 points is a MUCH LESS dramatic impact than CS3 for 12.<br />
<br />
For GoD and Omens, LR5 will have a larger impact on spike damage as well if it kicks in. <br />
<br />
This is incorrect as well.  Mitigation has the same impact on spike damage as avoidance has.  They both reduce the amount of damage taken by the corresponding level of AA's you have.<br />
<br />
That's not to say CA3/LR5 is better then CS3/ID5. But it's more noticeable at first, and it'll make getting the other much easier. The higher your AC, the more you'll notice ID5 as they compliment each other. <br />
<br />
Once again, totally wrong.  You don't notice CA3/LR5 any more than you notice CS3/ID5.  You WANT to notice it more, but it's basically impossible for you to tell just by looking at your hit box.  We've proven this over and over and over again.  The only way to tell is to parse the data, and you can't do that with your eye.  <br />
<br />
The best way to describe CA is simply that you dodge blows more often. Once you max out with LR5 you'll notice a lot more dodge spam then before. <br />
<br />
Hey, what do you know..something else that is wrong.  You don't dodge any more with CA0 than you do with LR5.  LR5 impacts how much you get missed...but it has absolutely no correlation at all to how many times you dodge.  Only your dodge skill affects that.<br />
<br />
CS you will notice mobs hitting you for their minimum much more often. By the time you get ID5, you'll notice this a lot more frequently in lower tiered zones and places where mobs have low innate ATK.<br />
<br />
Partially true, but not the whole story.  Extra mitigation shifts the distribution of hits on a graph to the left.  You will get hit for minimum more often, but the total result is that you get hit for every damage that is more than minimum less often.  So it's not really that you get hit for minimum more, it's that you get hit for DB + 20(Di), DB + 19(DI), DB + 18(DI), etc, less<br />
<br />
So uhh. I read your entire post this time, just like I did last time.  You're not any more correct in anything you said.  You either don't have a grasp of what the skills do, or you do understand and you're not very good at conveying that information to others.  In either case, I corrected it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we're in GoD where everything procs Chaos Claws there's a case for avoidance.  But in OoW, most stuff don't actually proc anything.  They just cast 0 second casting spells instead.<br />
<br />
And if you can ever get an AA and have a noticeable difference, then you're looking at the wrong thing.  No AA is meant to be powerful enough for you to notice its effect by just eyeballing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last i checked Reparms theoretical max round without any shielding is over 18k.  So I guess to a degree anybody who fights him while evasive or after defensive falls is already dead?  Resists only go so far, and the last time i saw him at lv 65 with 500FR i didnt even partially resist it once.<br />
<br />
People relied on avoidance to survive mobs with 3k procs in the past, and i bet they'll continue to do so in the future.  Like i said though, these are very isolated</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have less than 12k hps he can one round you while defensive.  I know this because i used it the first time i fought him with 10k hps a while ago and decided defensive was safer.  Tap-tap double proc + 4k in melee damage (66% of his potential while defensive) and i was dead.<br />
<br />
If you have over 12k defensive might be better ... but i'd rather take my chances with 50% less hits taken and therefore 50% less procs taken.  Spike no matter what disc you use and he can eat a tank.<br />

Second time i used evasive and was lucky enough to get zero double proc rounds.  He ate me as soon as evasive fell though  :D  .</div></div><hr />

He has 1-rounded me twice and both times it was a double proc.  Both times I had evasive up.  I have tanked him start to finish more than once using both evasive and defensive so /shrug.</div></div><hr />

(That beeing said, you die less often with disc) but i repeat :<br />
If rapem WANTS you dead, you ARE dead.<br />
<br />
As for CA/LR/RM &amp; PE = -15% Total Damage Taken (overall estimation)<br />
As for CS/ID/DI &amp; PE = -15% Total Damage Taken (overall estimation)<br />
<br />
Some are more efficient than others (in AA spend vs DMG reduction)<br />
Some are more efficient depending on mob type (Min/Max/ATK/Procs)<br />
<br />
You need both.<br />
<br />
Someone full AA , should take around 25% less dmg than someone with zero AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : The numbers are not very precise, but are the overall values that have come up with time &amp; parses.<br />
<br />
The most efficient way would be : Max CS/CA , Max PE, Max LR/ID, Max RM/DI.<br />
<br />
In the end, you need all of them :)</div></div><hr />
