<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm seeing many many posts here about problems with Warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors definately have a problem (which closely resembels that of the rogue), the thing is, people try to solve it in the wrong places.<br />
<br />
Warriors having a key role in raids, it is very very dangerous in upgrading them. And that's why we've been getting nothing. If not simple hp upgrades to get along with the damage upgrades of mobs.<br />
<br />
Wanting better aggro and better defense abilities, is the sort of wishes that won't be realised, because all of the current expansion's design was made in regard to this.<br />
As much as it is an honor for a warrior of being one of the pillars of the game, it's also a curse.<br />
<br />
What warriors should ask for however are other upgrades that do not touch the domain of actual tanking.<br />
<br />
What could be given to warriors that would give more utility in groups, other utilities in raids other then just Tank or wait to Tank...???<br />
Great ideas in these domains DO have a chance in getting in... that is if SOE even listen to playerbase anymore.<br />
<br />
What about a simple Knockback skill? That refreshes every 10min or so. It could generate a little aggro as well, to close that Knight/Warrior aggro gap a bit more.<br />
Would add usefullness and fun to the warrior, without unbalancing it.<br />
<br />
AoE stun with a large reuse time?<br />
<br />
It would be nice to come up with a few skills or disciplines that would not heighten the warrior's aggro/tankage, but still upgrade them.<br />
And there's many many potential great ideas out there!<br />
And a few of these skills could have a bit of aggro addition... just a tiny bit. To allow to get a headstart after a taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another solution would be putting in actual warrior equipments.<br />
Giving warriors a wide range of armors to choose from.<br />
Making their armory the equivalent to a Wizard's spellbook!<br />
<br />
Currently, in my opinion, the Warrior's greatest flaw is being... Simple...<br />
You get most hp possible, and you tank.. period..<br />
<br />
Give us something new! And we'll see what we can do with it!<br />
Defensive is not enough to make One seperate class.<br />
Warriors need something to call their own, skills, disciplines, stances whatever! but Something!<br />
<br />
Well there, let out a bit of my steam :p.<br />
Please criticise or give any warrior improvement ideas if you see fit.<br />
Ones that don't affect our current Tanking status that is ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did /shield solve any problems?<br />
<br />
Nope. Not at all.<br />
<br />
More toys won't help. Melee won't ever have the utility of hybrids. It's not what they're about. And giving them useless or marginal skills to mimic hybrid utility isn't really going to help the class XP group balance issue.<br />
<br />
The options to correct the current problem are simple:<br />
<br />
1) Fix warrior aggro abilities, allowing them to be competitive with knight aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
2) Fix knight aggro abilities, bringing them down to warrior aggro levels.<br />
<br />
3) FIX the game. Fix the XP group nonsense that's been festering in PoP for this long.<br />
<br />
Guess which option SOE is taking?<br />
<br />
If you guessed 3, then that means you've been reading the recent updates about what's on test.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things I would do to Warriors if i was a Dev:<br />
1) Seperate Offensive, Defensive, and Resistant Discs and put them on their own independant timers. only 1 of the 3 types can be going at once, but the main thing it would do is let the classes that have discs to use some of their other utility, so they dont have to save all their discs just so they can pop evasive/defensive.<br />
2) Add more Utility to the Pure Melee Classes!  I wouldnt mind using something besides Kick/Slam/Bash.. and I do use the Shield feature, and I do find it useful, but its usefulness is very limited. I wish there was more strat to playing the Warrior class like there is to some of the other classes. <br />
3) I like the way taunt is now, almost, if they could just add a higher % to taunting blue mobs that would help dramatically with exp groups. Like 10% more or something. <br />
4) More Un-AAed Utility.. things like /shield were a step in the right direction<br />
<br />
I like the way the warrior class is, but with a couple tweaks it could be so much better. <br />
rehash #5550113 over.. go #5550114! :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think that they should do #1 of what RB said. make them different timers. only screw resistance and fearless i mean seriously? you shouldn't be able to use either at once. They should be on 15 min timers. But you can't do another disc right after the next you have to wait 3 min. so like this<br />
<br />
uber_tank_001 goes defensive <br />
uber_tank_001 looses blah blah<br />
uber_taNK_001 waits 3 minutes<br />
uber_tank_001 goes mighty strike<br />
uber_tank_001 looses blah blah<br />
uber_tank_001 waits for the defensive disciplines to pop<br />
uber_tank_001 goes defensive<br />
uber_tank_001 looses blah blah<br />
<br />
etc etc<br />
this can be taken into much further consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm actually happy with shield, I use it a few times and it helps in groups if your Taunt fails,<br />
especially since they seem to have made DS give aggro to the holder.<br />
<br />
But /shield was a too small upgrade when the warrior was in need of a Real upgrade.<br />
<br />
And the way Taunt is atm is fine imo (although I still think Warriors should be the ONLY class with that skill)<br />
<br />
For now the Knight vs Warrior situation is perfect when it comes to Aggro situations.<br />
Warriors tank great with a bit of trouble in aggro,<br />
Knights aggro great with a bit of trouble in tanking.<br />
<br />
Warriors are broken, yes. <br />
But people immediately blame the paladin's ability to aggro well as the cause of the warrior's demise.<br />
It's not the paladin's aggro!<br />
<br />
All that the paladin's aggro do, is prove how too damn dependent warriors are on that ONE SINGLE usefull skill, Taunt.<br />
<br />
If pallies JUST had aggro spells.... then they would be at the same level as Warriors.<br />
again:<br />
Warrior tanks, but badly aggros - Paladin aggros, but badly tank.<br />
<br />
Thing is, paladins don't have JUST aggro spells, they got a vast array of spells.<br />
And THATS where it gets unbalanced.<br />
Why choose a warrior? when a paladin gets oh so much more!<br />
<br />
Currently, the only reason to choose a warrior, is to have Defensive and be able to live against those PoP bosses....<br />
<br />
Give us Skills, Discs, AAs, Loots, that only go for warrior and give warriors, what paladins get from their spells!<br />
The aggro gap will still be there, but we wouldn't care, because we'll have other reason to be chosen instead of Paladins.<br />
<br />
And personally, I really hope that the next Warrior upgrade WON'T be a simple HP/Aggro upgrade....<br />
5 YEARS!! and all warriors ever got was HP/Aggro....<br />
about time for a real upgrade (same goes for monks and rogues)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I for one dont really want all those fancy and  flashy skills.  I mean if I wanted to do a whole assortment of things (jack of all trades) I would be a bard.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think the thing a lot of folks want is not just solid aggro.  Its the initial snap aggro that we care for and wouldnt change the game much.<br />
<br />
Hey, warriors and clerics are the base classes.  The dev teams use us as a base when they consider upgrades and such.  Cleric's job is to heal, our job is to tank.<br />
<br />
Reason I choose a warrior is to throw away all those other fancy skills and be able to take the most damage.  If I wanted to do . . . . .  then I wouldve played a . . . . .<br />
<br />
Damage  . . . .  Rogue<br />
Feign Death  - - - -  Monk<br />
Buff/Slow , , , , , Shammy<br />
etc etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Lorre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im a warrior. I tank things. Thanks move along</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins don't tank badly.<br />
<br />
They have 10% less hitpoints than the warrior.<br />
<br />
They have access to the same armour as warriors.<br />
<br />
They have the same Defense skill.<br />
<br />
ONLY parry, riposte, and dodge are capped approximately 10% lower than a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
This allows them to tank quite nearly as well as a warrior.<br />
<br />
I've said it before and I'll say it again, warriors need to be given innate aggro generation capabilities (read: abilities that are not utterly dependant on weapons), and then remove EB from the game. These aggro generation capabilities must be inferior to knights, but if they tank nearly as well as us, we MUST be able to generate aggro nearly as well as them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hps gap is closer to 20% for most people, but other than that I agree with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFL sorry i found this friggen hilarious!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also have to remember the fact they're permanently buffed with buffs like BSS or BMB, and AotC, while warriors are not. Keeps it down to 10% or less.</div></div><hr />
