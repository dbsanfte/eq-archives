<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I won a Cord Hilted Spike Driver (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16391)  from a pickup raid and was playing around with agro.<br />
<br />
For some reason I can not seem to get better agro with that hammer then I could with GSoT or even sometimes with War Marshalls.  I use Hooked So'Shar (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21674)  as my offhander but agro just doesnt seem to be better then say if I used my GSoT, especially during the first few moments of battle.  If Im using my GSoT, and hydra shaman malo/slows as soon as mob gets to camp, one taunt usually takes agro right back to me, but with the duel wield, it would sometimes take a few taunts to bring it back on me.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have a better experience with these weapons?  Perhaps I need to upgrade my offhander?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it is an issue of how many taunts it takes to get aggro back, then it's jsut a matter of perception and luck. A successful taunt will give you aggro, a failed taunt will do nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Let me rephrase the question<br />
<br />
Anyone have CHSD and GSoT and which have you found to be the better agro?  <br />
<br />
Just looking for some opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kergin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was xp'ing with some friends a little while back in BoT and a GSoT dropped.  My setup at the time was CHSD in primary and Split-Blade in my off-hand.  One of my groupmates was a 65 SK, I asked him to test how hard it was to pull aggro from me.  He tried (succeeded) when I had the GSoT up and when I was dual-wielding.  We tried on probably 5 grind mobs with each setup and he said it was harder to pull/hold aggro when I had the CHSD and Split-blade up.<br />
<br />
Not exactly your setup for weps, but similar.  And not exactly scientific research done by me either so take it for what it's worth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use the CHSD (main) and red epic (off hand) and I have zero issues with aggro in any exp group, pickup or friends. The only time I lose aggro is when we have a BST slowing and he gets a bunch of resists. <br />
<br />
I have not used a GSoT so I can't tell you what that is like. I do have a WMBS and can tell you that it is no where near the dual weild set up as far as aggro in concerned.</div></div><hr />
