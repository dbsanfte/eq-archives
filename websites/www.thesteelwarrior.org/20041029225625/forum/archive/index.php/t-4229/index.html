<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyallag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just won a GBoS on raid. I currently swing double SoD's. I know that the GBoS is gonna be higher DPS than a SoD. But how does it stack up for aggro? Links to parses are a good thing.<br />
<br />
I can either keep using 2 x SoD this works really well. Or I can toss the GBoS into main or off hand. <br />
<br />
I guess it boils down too: Does a GBoS proc as much as a SoD.<br />
<br />
I keep getting shit from peeps about SoD's being 'toys' and out of date and all that. Well to me they are still good aggro but if GBoS is good and I can sell a sod for some pp's all the better.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Thanks again my fellow warriors and Stay strong our day will come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aryl Paingiver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you put an augmentation on the GBoS like anger 3 or maybe the 125dd/stun yak proc I/m pretty sure you will get as much if not more agro with it in your main then SoD. Sell SoD for some nice pp and you got a win/win situation</div></div><hr />
