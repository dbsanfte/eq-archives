Poison wind censor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=551). I don't wanna put out 200k for an earthshaker right now, maybe later but not yet.  And this costs nothing so i picked it up. Is it any good for AEing? I mean...sure, it's not as good as earthshaker, but it's still something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly it is only good if you want to detonate yourself trying to AE. It is a standard AE spell, not Point Blank ( safe ). So it hits 4 targets within range, basically 3 mobs plus yourself. AE with that and you will be splat before anything else =/<br />
<br />
I was going to buy one as well till I heard that little bit. Same for Sword of Skyfire or whatever it was called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh...Guess it's not very good then. Oh well, i just spent 150k on an earthshaker anyway. Wonder if it was a good deal heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It Procs a Shaman poison rain that will hit you as well as your targets. It's somehitng that if you're fighting a giant sized mob and you're at max melee range you might miss, but the spell gets resisted so often anyway that a lot of Shaman don't even bother casting it</div></div><hr />

I took earthshaker for a test run without rampage in KC, didn't proc much...I've heard it procs often due to the really high delay, i guess not. But i still had fun beating up 50 mobs with furious. Of course ya can't proc on a riposte so that doesn't count.</div></div><hr />

I got one, but I didnt pay anything for it.. and I would never pay for one! But good luck on that rampage thing, dunno if its fun! :)</div></div><hr />
