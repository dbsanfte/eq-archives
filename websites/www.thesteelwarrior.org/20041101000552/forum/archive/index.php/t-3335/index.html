<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All I can say about it is that it has gotten very little press on these boards, tale that to mean what you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's an enraging blow weapon that nobody ever gets, with a 30 delay (the sweet spot for dmg bonus it seems).<br />
<br />
You get EB, good dps, and uniqueness. What's not to like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it has received little to no &quot;press&quot; as it was called because Inny doesnt dropit very often and not that many guilds raid Hate like they used to.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After 7 Innys he finally coughed one up like a month ago, Warrior in guild who uses it loves it, and procrate seems to be superb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got mine about 3 weeks ago and I LOVE IT. Used it to tank RZtW tonight (we won) and only time I lost aggro was when he turned to off someone on low hp aggro due to them not knowing wth MAX MELEE is.<br />
<br />
Was just awesome, I dunno about rarity we are only guild to kill inny on our server so far and only have done it once. Now I hope for BoW to compare but that will be awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is it a good weapon? Hell yes, good ratio, and a 2h EB weapon...very very valuable for tanking those Super hard hitters in PoP. Is it worth farming? I seriously doubt it...if you can kill Inny, you should be able to kill RZ, or should be *very* close to being able to, and the BoW has much better stats/ratio. <br />
<br />
If you see one drop...then it's a personal decision based on your guild, your DKP/merit points or whatever as to whether or not you think you'll have a shot at a BoW in the near future. If the answer is no, I'd grab the Anathema. If the the answer is yes, I'd say let a less fortunate warrior get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would be very interested to see someone parse the proc rate with anathema, to see what &quot;superb&quot; means.  *smile*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Most importantly: what does it look like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">umm zaraxthil forged blade looks the same look it up ion bazaar not sure on spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh, it looks very cool. . .flamberge or something from LoY expansion.  I mean, any newb can get one for 10p, but you've never seen any higher level character wielding that model.  It's kindof like a twisted rapier or saber with spikes on the pommel.  I wish it had a particle effect though!  Hey, why doesn't BoW have a partlcle effect?  *sniff*</div></div><hr />
