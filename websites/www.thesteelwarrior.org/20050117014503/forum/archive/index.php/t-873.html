I use a two handed Greatstaff of Thunder.  Wanted to know how many people out there use two handers for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use 2 1-handers, both low delay, both with aggro-generating procs.  I'm level 53 now and can hold aggro most of the time in planes groups with those.<br />
<br />
If I switch to my Windblade, it certainly doesn't hold aggro as well, at least at my level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great DPS based aggro, nice proc rate that I don't need to rely on(yeah its only a 75PT DD but it goes a lot) and fewer ripostes = the Win</div></div><hr />

However, I found that just starting out with a GSoT worked better than swapping it in after my 1 handers proc'd so I use 2h exclusivley now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont know about others but i have found a difference in my weapon usage recently. In tier 1, i was using my 2hander almost exclusively (a narandi's) and was having no problems with aggro control.<br />
<br />
since getting to tier 2, its been a different kettle of fish for a couple of reasons. first off,and this may seem logical - but in the higher tiers you will find yourself grouping with levels 62-65 and they tend to have better quality weapons etc. Since moving to tier 2 i have also started finding in my pick up groups those people from the really high end guilds who have pretty decent weapons whom you just dont see in tier 1. <br />
<br />
also, as everyone knows, mobs do hit a lot harder in tier 2. so anyway, after a bit  of experimenting, i found myself having to go back to my old combo of wavecrasher/frosty (still working on epic atm and should get em soon) to help me with aggro control in the first portion of the fight. once slow landed, i was then doing what i normally did and swopping out to the 2 hander for dps. <br />
<br />
However, i started finding that i was still losing aggro just on pure dps output from other melees. luckily i got that 14/20 piercer that drops in UP from tawro, so now i swop that out with the wavecrasher to give me a bit of the edge in the dps war and it seems to work ok. i still keep the frosty in offhand cos its dps is not so bad as the wavecrasher and the occasional proc during the fight helps too imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Atm, 1handers when tanking. Fights except on boss mobs dont last long enough to make riposte an issue even in Tier 3 PoP exp groups like tactics.<br />
For dual boxing i only use 2handers except to trigger avatar proc.<br />
More AC (50 raw AC on Gaudralek is nice) and (although slightly - i am not a number cruncher though) higher dps with less riposte on 3 to 4 minute fights are nice.</div></div><hr />

No so intelligent groups - Norge`Tal<br />
PoP Casters or where I piss off the rogue with my knockback - Greatstaff of Thunder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it really depends on the weps a person has as to whether they will use dual 1handers or a 2hander. I use a 2hander almost exclusively now (BoW), but then again, my 1handers suck in comparison when i want to hold a mobs attention, So if i want aggro, I stick with the BoW. If i had dual proc'ing EB weps, my choice may be a little more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the main point of this wasn't advice, but was just to see how many people use what.<br />
<br />
As for me, I use 2handed exclusively.  Main weapon is a Greatstaff of the Four Winds (2hb), also have ancient prismatic 2hb.  Almost everything I have now is 2handed, to the point that the only 1handers I have anymore is a tash stick and my piercer thats primarily in range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get the feeling they did something to it.. but I might also be dreaming.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree that the Greatstaff of Thunder holds aggro less well then it used to.  <br />
<br />
I used to not have to Taunt ever in BoT.  I was a Warrior Pally.  Good thing they nerfed it cause I was having fun for a day or so.  I have seen noticeably less procs.  <br />
<br />
God forbid Warriors have an accessible aggro weap :)<br />
<br />
GoT is still good tho...</div></div><hr />
