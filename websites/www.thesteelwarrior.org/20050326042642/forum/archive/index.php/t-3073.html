I've done the assassination and rescue missions with 20 or so minutes left but on the 2 collection missions we've ran out of time around 10 items short.  This is with non stop fighting and good dps (wiz and necro) as well as war, cleric, shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenelan</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This mission type is seriously dependant on luck...I've done three of these.<br />
One win which only took about half the time we had, a win that took maybe an hour and one loss where even after 90 mins + the 30 mins extra we still were way short *shrugs* seems like you just need luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viladdar</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree, it seems like you just need luck. It was the contrary for me : I've had almost only success on collect type missions, but failed all the rescue type ones, and even with high DPS groups, when our collect mission groups had nothing special. It could depend on the number of 65 in your group too, the more you get of them and the tougher the mobs are ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really am growing to hate collection missions.  It seems much more dependant on luck over skill than any of the other mission types.  Slaughter missions, on the other hand, seem consitantly easier than any other type.  I imagine they will be doing some tuning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">UH... no offense guys, but I did 9 in a row of collection in miragual's and never lost one, the collection are the next easiest compared to kill x number of mobs. <br />
<br />
The thing with collection is you need to have a solid kill rate and you can't slow down ever. In these 9 groups I was tagging along with some of my friends from the top guild on my server so we absolutely domniated even when the droprate was poor because we generally had 60% of the dungeon cleared at around 55-60 minutes  still on the clock.<br />
<br />
My only fails were on 2 assassinations and a collection where our rogue when LD and our cleric walked into mobs and died twice. We just couldn't recover at the loss of dps and heals even though the cleric ran back both times. I had another fail at Miragul's on a collection when our shammy felt that he knew how to pull better than I am and ran up and attacked a lulled mob and brought 5 when the cleric was low mana. We ended up losing that one at 22/23 and the mob we finished killing as the timer expired dropped the last one.<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice is that when I did another collection (on the same exact map that I failed on with 22/23) with the uber guild that we finished in almost exactly the same place as my gimp group had been fighting the final mob, only difference was that with the uber guild we still had 40 minutes on the clock then, hah. Infact most of the rounds of collection with the uber guild were like tha, finishing with mucho time on the clock.<br />
<br />
After seeing the dungeons severely crushed by the uber guild and my gimpling self, I decided to switch my Aa path from an offensive back to a more offensive one and I'll be going back to defensive when I finish out tacticall mastery and ferocity. I choose to do this because I may not be grouped with all ubers but I can try to make sure I do a reasonable ammount of dps so thta I can help slightly less powerful groups make it through in the time limits.<br />
<br />
Another thing that might be of note is that with an average well balanced group generally we had 50% of a collection done at about 45-55 minutes left on the clock.<br />
<br />
Then again, I don't really know much about anything really... we could have just been extremely lucky and yours were extremely unlucky. But most of the time if you have the right group setup, you're looking at about 4 minutes per item drop until you get to about 5 left, then somtime it fluctuates between about 7-12 depending on how hardcore your group is.<br />
<br />
Hope some of my rambling has proved useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been in groups that complete some of the other mission types in 22-40mins regularly, but if we get unlucky on the collect missions, we might end up clearing up almost the entire dungeon and spend 50-60 mins on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Predominantly Time equipped groups, only thing I've EVER come close to failing was a collection event. Burnt mana and discs at the end and finally got the last one to drop with 2 mins left on the clock. Same group had done a collection in under half an hour earlier in the day. It's pure luck. Sometimes it's a high drop rate, but once in a while you'll be screwed over and it'll be like looking for Obsidianwood Sap drops.<br />
<br />
In short, if a collection quest comes up, I decline and wait 2 minutes for a different quest rather than risking the slim chance of wasting the next 90 mins on a bad droprate collection.</div></div><hr />

Chatja, 2 good pallies would OWN your big phat ubah ogre arse in Mistmoore. Plain and simple.:p <br />
<br />
And yes, it seems like the collect type missions depend much on luck. I mean, if your group is powerful enough to completely clear the dungeon in the allowed time, you are almost certain to win, whatever happens. For example, my first mission was a collection one in MM. We were 65 bard 65 druid 61 necro 61 sk and myself (61 warrior). Not much of a DPS group heh ? and not even full. But we still made it with 30 minutes left. Then, we did an another try in Nro with a bit different group setup (65 bard 65 druid 65 shaman 65 BADASS wiz and myself), and we almost failed. We cleared the entire dungeon but still were one item short. How to call that other than bad luck heh ? Don't think it is suckyness. We finally got the last item from a trapped Hollow Tree that spawned two little mobs, we had nothing else to do than activate all the interactive objects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're time equipted and coming within 2 minutes of failing the quests I sure hope you're doing it on hard difficulty because that's ridiculous. <br />
<br />
No offense intended but the group I was with had 3 time equipted members and 2 elemental equipted and myself (still wearing some old world, velious and lower PoP gear) and we had entire dungeons cleared at like 20minutes left. Hell we even all went afk for whatever reasons just because we knew we wouldn't fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a collection with a lower level group, ranging from 32-37<br />
 my 34 druid<br />
32 pally<br />
37 monk<br />
2- 37 rangers<br />
34 bard<br />
<br />
And we needed two items (teeth) more when the timer went out. We got enough in the &quot;bonus&quot; time but only one group member got a point, no one else did.<br />
<br />
Agro management was a problem as it was a pickup group. Most of the group members had Temperance and all the L34 druid buffs that applied (regen, stone str, SoW, Endure Magic, with DS on the pally)<br />
<br />
I couldn't keep mana over 50 long, we were pulling at a pretty rapid rate. Heal agro was nuts, so I just stood there and got beat on in those times. <br />
<br />
The kicker was that only one group member got a point. I thought that sucked. We got 3 augment stones, each for 3 points.. a dex, a sta, and something else. <br />
<br />
I did get half a level in exp though. And I didn't get exp on every mob that fell, so it was pretty good.<br />
<br />
We could have used another healer. Some mobs wouldn't mez. And we could have used better teamwork, but that only comes with time. <br />
Without Temp and if the group had all had normal equipment for their level, it would have been impossible to complete.</div></div><hr />

You know, it's posts like this that really tick off the non-uber crowd (like me.)  If you don't have uber gear or you don't min/max group composition, lots of these missions can be very difficult.  Just because someone doesn't get a success doesn't mean they (or their group) sucks.<br />

2 collection - failed<br />
1 Collection - passed<br />
2 Kill X named mob - passed<br />
<br />
My 2 failed were pick up groups, the other 3 were guild groups. My thoughts are that pick up groups are like playing craps and I suck at craps :)<br />
<br />
I could be Mr. just dont suck has alot of buddies he totes around with and he never does pick up grps OR they dont suck which does in no way means that he doesnt suck, seeing I have yet to see 1 person complete any missions. It is a team effort and BAH fug it, it isnt like he will get it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in no way in any uber gear at all but the dungeons are based on player level, not gear so if I went in naked at 65 I'd still be fighting the same monsters a 9k unbuffed hp warrior would. <br />
<br />
Now when people are saying that most of their group was time geared (IE meaning their gear makes mine look like utter crap) and they were complaining about how -hard- the collections were... then there is obviously something they are doing wrong, maybe they suck, maybe they don't. I'm not making that call, but if they are having trouble passing with that impressive gear it shows something isn't being done right somewhere along the lines.<br />
<br />
In reguards to the person who said they cleared the entire dungeon and came up short, I highly doubt that unless you have a 100% flawless map of the entire dungeon because usually when I group stays in the dungeon after the time limit we pick up about 10-12 more of the quest item (except on collect 23 where it's more like 5-8). <br />
<br />
Also, I didn't know it was possible for trap monsters to drop anything let alone the quest items, because it's a trap, it's not supposed to be a reward. So can anybody else confirm that trap mobs can or cannot drop the quest items?</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure it's all random as to which mobs have the drops you need.  I did one collection mission where we failed but finished in extra time...the very last mob in the dungeon dropped it  :rolleyes: .  We had a ranger tracking just to make sure we didn't miss any mobs...<br />

ITS LUCK.<br />
<br />
You can be in the most kick-ass gear imaginable.  But if you are asked to collect 31 ass hairs from assholes in Miraguls and it just so happens that the drops are all at the ass end of an asstastic dungeon, you are screwed.  More, in my experience if you are only asked to collect 20 ass hairs, it is NOT in fact an easier collection mission.  The drop rate for the lower-collect missions is much crappier than for the higher-collect missions.  If I had my druthers, I'd always go for the mid-20's collections because I think they have the best drop rate for the buck. <br />
<br />
I know this and also know better than to ding on people for bad luck when I've done around 10 collect missions and not failed a single one.  But I can tell you that on many of them my group has finished with about 40 minutes remaining and on a couple we've had literally 1 minute remaining.  Same exact group, same exact dungeon even.  <br />
<br />
I'm with Demo.  Just say NO to collection missions!</div></div><hr />

So instead of making fun of you, we bow down to your uberness. I can't stand not being able to click the magelos any more... what type of gear are you in Vigdis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Collection missions suck, plain and simple. We did a collect 29 mission in 31 minutes, then turned around and did a collect 22 mission that took over an hour. With the same exact group in the same dungeon theme with 5/6 time geared people. There is no way in hell a non-elem group could have kept up the kill rate we had in either dungeon and I would imagine most groups would have failed the collect 22 adventure. Sometimes you get leucky with the drop rate, other times you don't.<br />
<br />
FYI - there is no need to wait 2 minutes to get another adventure. If you get a collection, decline it and switch group leaders. You get 6 shots to get a slaughter or assassinate mission before you have to wait out the timer.</div></div><hr />

They seem to be the fastest.  Finding and killing the boss seems to require a tracker to go the fastest (unless you just pacify everything which is lame).  Plus you can end up having to kill more mobs on others than collection.<br />
<br />
We generally finish collection quests with 40 minutes or so to spare. Very easy.</div></div><hr />

Its on the link to the left and my sig.  I'm in very normal gear.  Almost all of it is Fierce Heraldic, with a couple Tier2 peices, and my coveted item from Tunare. <br />
<br />
I'm far from uber.  I just happened to be working with a group of guildie friends with whom I am very familiar through about 2 years of grouping together.  All of us are in similar level gear.  Cleric, SK, Shaman, Ranger, Monk, me. <br />
<br />
And more importantly - just let me reiterate - I probably got lucky with the missions.  Because I firmly believe that collection is about luck.  Yes, every group needs a certain degree of skill but above and beyond that its pure luck.</div></div><hr />

And even if you were lucky and they (the time geared groups) were extremely unlucky... It's STILL pathetic :/ I mean I was IN a group in elemental/time gear aside from myself... they don't NEED skill, they just need to press auto attack and their 120-140dps ripped mobs apart. They had skill however and that only increased their massive ownage. Perhaps it's not an issue of skill, maybe they just had a poor group setup or smething. But honestly collection is one of the easiest ways to get free points.</div></div><hr />

All it takes is one idiot and a little bad luck to screw up the entire adventure. After back to back fails with pick up groups, I quickly learned to stick with people I know to be competent, otherwise any adventure can be failed regardless of how good your gear is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please note, these people complaining about the difficulty had stated it was people from their guild aind about 5/6 members was fully time/elemental geared. Sorry maybe they bought their chars on ebay if they couldn't figure out how to kill a few yardtrash monsters and loot their corpses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Points seem to go to the other hit or melee window (I only use one so not sure which).  The first time we got partial points, none of the melee saw they got them till one finally found it in another chat box and then they all did.  It is in a dull color and mixes with your melee spam so really easy to miss.<br />
<br />
That said, if partial was only 1 point, it is very possible that the lower members didn't get it.  The points awarded vary by dungeon level and by level of the group  members.  For a 65 dungeon, level 65s get 51 points, 64s get 49 and 63s get 49.  A partial win is 1/4 that.  I'm hoping though that even at the really low levels a win is worth more than 4 points. :/</div></div><hr />

We destroyed the entire zone. There was not a single mob left standing but box's etc. and we failed. Took us 70 minutes to clear every MoB. Anther 20 running the heck around the entire zone to simply find not anther creature stirng.<br />
<br />
To me, not having X amount of drops in zone when its created so we fail no matter what we do is bullshit. <br />
I will never do anther collection mission again ever. <br />
<br />
Absor why make a mission in LDoN when its impossible to finish? That isnt skill or luck or anything its simple craptastic BS. <br />

Assassination and kill X many mobs here I come, at least there I know there hasnt been any problems.<br />

 We've tried that. Didn't work.<br />
<br />
 As for collection ones, I hafta say that so far they've been second easiest after slaughter ones(cept the slaughter 60 on hard when I had to cleric, man I suck as a healer). But that's just luck, have gone 15 straight mobs with no progress drops before, if that happens a couple times I imagine you'd be forked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We killed at least twice as many mobs as a slaughter would have required and probably three times as many as would have been required to spawn a boss.<br />
<br />
Also, for those who think boss kills are hard try EQtoolbox maps. The bosses are often mislabeled and maps don't always work perfectly but usually it's in one of the two places noted as 'boss' or 'hostage.'</div></div><hr />

I think Assassinate is my favorite so far, and I don't like slaughter or collection as much.  Killing a boss or saving somebody is just more fun than just wandering around the dungeon killing indiscriminately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Haha, that's great! But slaughter is what we do best, just walk in and kill everything with not a care in the world.<br />
<br />
I did another collection that I came close to failing on, we had 3 left and I was pulling a named, our chanter didn't pacify on of the mobs, so we got an add. And then neither the shamn or the druid thought of healing me. Finally to top it all off, the chanter didn't think to mezz the goblin add until after I was dead, hah.<br />
<br />
But after spawning back at my bind in everfrost, I ran my little woodelf legs as fast as I could and I reached our dungeon ready to get a CotH from out mage. Only to find that our chanter let the mezz wear off after they killed named with mets and nukes. Oh and somewhere along the way our chanter went down the wrong path and died. We all had a small chuckle, until we remembered the time limit.<br />
<br />
So I was like thinking to myself &quot;%&amp;^$%^%^*** chanter!&quot; But of course I said. &quot;Okay everything is fine. just because we haven't had a drop in 20 minutes doesn't mean we're not kicking ass still... we just need to turn the hardcore  dial up a bit&quot;.<br />
<br />
After my rousing speach while I was running through Miragul's my group was inspired to bring themselves together (well except for the mage, I had to go back and lead him from ent durring the countdown, haha) and wipe the rest of the mobs out in the room (with the named) and we won with 2 minutes on the clock!<br />
<br />
I love collect missions and slaughter missions because to can directly see how far along in your mission you are as opposed to assassination/rescue. Also, with assassination/rescue, if you don't know where these things are, you spend a lot fo time going down the wrong paths trying to find them.</div></div><hr />

Finished it with plenty of time - like 25 minutes left on the clock. The interesting thing is that there where only about a dozen mobs left in the dungeon when we finished. We had an extremely high DPS group - time equiped SK, time equiped wiz, 2x 17damage piercer rogue, chanter+charmed pet, cleric nuking and meleeing proc hammer, and SU3 Time equipped pally. A group with less DPS would have had a hard time killing at a fast enough pace to clear enough mobs to succeed. Depending on how many drops the remaining 12 or so mobs had, path choice through the dungeon might have caused a failure for a group not capable of killing at an equal pace.<br />

I still think that there is a little too much luck involved in collection missions.</div></div><hr />

First rescue missions I did had a Time equipped Pally/Bard in my group and it took us 90 minutes to get to the NPC and that was with invising past about 20 mobs. I don't mind the collect missions I've only did two and won both they don't seem to be that hard as long as you have decent dps I don't think there is luck involved in it just gotta kill fast :).</div></div><hr />

The higher the number they request, the higher % chance drop rate for the adventure.  You will find much greater success if you stick with collect 26-30 missions and avoid 20-25 at all costs, 20 being most certainly the worst.  I've failed one in 130+ adventures now, and that being a collect 20.  The 20th fang looted within 30 seconds of the you have failed message popping up. There were 4 mobs left in the zone.<br />
<br />
Its luck, and as noted by previous posters, the drop rate has no fail check to be assured that even the amount requested are present in the zone.  Accepting collection is accepting a chance at getting unavoidably screwed, but if you must do it, stick with 26 or more.  The folks that say &quot;I did a collect 20 in 15 minutes&quot; got one hell of a lucky spawn layout, so trust in the masses not the egotists.</div></div><hr />

The 20th item did not drop until the 114th mob! And no, we did not finish it in 90 mins. Ended up taking us near the entire 2 hours to get the measley consolation points.<br />
<br />
Expecting a group to kill 114 mobs in 90 mins is a joke compared to the mass slaughter missions that need only 55 or so kills in the same time for the same points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am 8-4 on them, with some wins being done with tons of time to spare, but I have also had losses where we didn't get the 20th item in time for the Booby Prize.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with Brutul...Assasinate missions are the funnest I've done by far, but after a couple of losses, I'll go for a slaughter to get back in the win column. Haven't been able to talk anyone into a rescue mission yet :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So much hate for collections quests.  I think they are easy of course time consuming.  Still haven't did an Assassination mission yet but I did a slaughter one finally and love those they are cake.  I'm 4-0 on Collect missions I don't know if I just have good luck or what closest I've ever come to running out of time I had about 10 minutes left they are easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well ive only done one collection mission and cant say ill be keen to sign up for more in future. I took advice from the group and picked a 26 item collection as i heard the drop rate was better.<br />
we had a good dps group, me, mage, necro, ranger sham and a cleric.<br />
<br />
however, there was no way we could have got all the drops in the allotted time. The timer ran out and we got the last drop with about 2 mins to spare on the 30 min timer. Although we did have one mini wipe which cost us about 10-15 mins, i still do not believe we would have finished it if we had not wiped. <br />
<br />
the funny thing is, 2 weeks or so into ldon, everyone seems to have similar preferences for missions. the most popular seem to be slaughter then collection/assasinate/rescue.<br />
<br />
i definitely hope that SoE does some tweaking, because it seems to me that you should have an equal chance of succeding in all types of mission.</div></div><hr />

IMO, obviously depends of group.  If all have worked together before and/or know how to play their role, then success =)  The opposite being obvious if people do not trust eachother in group etc...<br />
  If you have a decent tracker, or a map of the dungeon, then the assasinate/rescue ones become much easier, can avoid some mobs and head straight to destination.  If no tracker, then becomes more difficult.<br />
  My 3 failures (different toons/levels) were all due to people not having a freekin clue as to how to play their role in group, or we more concerned with loot or not getting damaged vice killing the mobs at hand.<br />
