<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently my guild has started doing the 3 perma rooted WToV dragons, Lend, Gozz, and Telk.  In case of the MT going down we have been using a little tactic where the MT at the beginning of the fight fires 20 arrows to build aggro while the ST fires 10.  Twice the MT has gone down during the fights and aggro both times has immediately gone to the ST.  It's always been my understanding that arrows generated next to nothing aggro, but in the time that the MT lived to tank there was more than enough time for other melee to build up more aggro than the ST using his DPS weapon, but none the less the ST gets the aggro when the MT goes down.<br />
So are arrows really that much aggro and if so how can rangers fire away all day long without drawing aggro ever?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like luck and/or a twitch taunt :)<br />
<br />
Arrows are next to 0 aggro still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This suggestion was given from someone in one of the server's uber guilds that uses this as a regular tactic.  Maybe aggro on perma rooted mobs is handled differently /shrug, but so far it's worked perfectly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Look at this in relation to Brutul's &quot;Rethinking Taunt&quot; thread in the arena.   <br />
<br />
There seems to be some aggro &quot;bonus&quot; for being the first to engage a mob.    Well, if you're 2nd and the #1 dies... then it's theoretically possible that you have assumed his &quot;bonus&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rooted&quot; mobs don't have the same proximity type of aggro as mobs who are actually bound to the ground by the spell &quot;root&quot;.   LTK, Telk, yadda yadda have a run speed of 0, they're not &quot;rooted&quot;, and they follow the same aggro principles as any unrooted mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seems like it would make more sense for a ranger or pally stand out of melee range, and build up a bunch of aggro with non-damaging spells, then sent in the tank who can then taunt several times, or just use AE taunt to piggy back on the aggro already generated. Kind of like using a WS ranger to build aggro, minus the WS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am pretty sure archery agro is handled differently somehow.<br />
Who hasnt seen the scenario in outdoor zones, ranger pulls with bow, mob comes in with 97 percent health, you fire one or 2 arrows and mob comes straight at you even when you missed or hit for minimal damage.<br />
Especially noticable when the ranger doesnt run for you but for the healer P.</div></div><hr />
