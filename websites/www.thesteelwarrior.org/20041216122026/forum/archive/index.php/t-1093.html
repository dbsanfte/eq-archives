Just show up and ask to tag, most groups dont have a problem with that.  big hits are Vindi and AoW raids.  That or join whatever group thats in there.  Bank and Plate Cycle folks are good hits also.<br />
<br />
Also you can hunt in GD at the giant fort.  This raises Coldain and CoV faction and the direwolves (which are lvl 33-36) are fast kills.  Just kill as many of them as you can.  Collect the Frost Giant Toes as well.<br />
<br />
If you're rich, run to the bazaar and buy Giant Warrior Helms and Frost Giant Toes.  Hand them into Lt Melvin in SS near the WL side for faction.  You'll need a ton of them now though.</div></div><hr />

GD is a waste of time, the hits in GD for CoV are ridiculously small...you'll be there 10 times longer than you have to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are few safe spots to camp out in arena, at the top the ramps, behind the glass wall, and triangles of the cleric house. just log in and see if ppl are killing there if you must, thurg gate potion out when you need.<br />
<br />
otherwise buy all the toes/helms you can and kill the mobs around the bank in kael for more toes/helm and minor faction. should check vendors in thurg and such as ppl will often just sell to vendor. can duo bank mobs with a cleric, just set up over near the noble house, opposite from the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would only buy toes if yo uare going to do that. When I turned in Giant Warrior Helmets in Skyshrine, the NPC opened up a new discussion, and basically he was saying to return giant toes was a greater feat than the helmets.. and thus the giant toes are better faction than the helmets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey lillyann we have half the same sig only i forgot zone good idea mind if i use that. but yes do ringwars and big kael mobs. screw buying toes and helms unless your rich on my server people sell them 50pp for one thats 1k a stack which is way overpriced.</div></div><hr />

I also added my guild link, just to help with the recruiting and all, we play on TT and europe time (GMT based)</div></div><hr />

That is correct, they nerfed Vindi's Faction hit some time ago, about as big as hitting A Temple Guardian.  Supposedly back when the top guilds were farming North, they would come out Max KoS, Hit Kael next day kill arena mobs vindi and be almost back to ally.  Thus Vindi being nerfed.  Statue &amp; AoW are big hits though, idol = no faction/loot.  Overall I think Tormax Ramp is your best bet for gaining CoV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just recently repaired my CoV faction. Getting out of scowling is by far the toughest part. You will do Tormax ramp or Arena raids quite a few times, zone out, and con a CoV mob hoping this is the time you at least won't be at scowl.<br />
<br />
I think that Tormax ramp (as another poster said) is the best area for faction. I was at scowl and had my parser on... the number of CoV hits I got that evening was about 55 (not sure on exact number but it was 50-something). <br />
<br />
Anyways this time I walked out to check faction and I was at dubious. I think that's pretty good, even if I was one hit from threatening and one hit above it when I finished (which is pretty unlikely). <br />
<br />
The only downside to Tormax area is you definetly need a good FD puller. Arena is very easy to pull, OTOH. Ring wars and boss hits are most likely extremely good faction, but you have to wait for those. Helms and toes still seem to be nice faction as well, but not quite as much as they used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I also forgot to add that Tormax area isn't that hard to do (with a good puller). A few of the times I did it with only two other actual people (seven chars though, but my two were the only 65s... others were 61+)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When did they nerf the vindi hit?  A few months ago my guild was hitting him pretty often after doing some faction losing fights, and he was giving good hits then.  He's definately less than Statue / AoW though.  AoW is an amazing hit.  Another area is in the temple back behind where vindi spawns (drop down to where the armors are, one of the walls is fake, and leads out to the actual arena), all mobs are yellow to 65 and some good fights.  Need a few groups as it can get rough.  Like someone else said, Tmax ramp is also great.  We would do the temple, then move to Tmax area a bit, and switch back and forth, since temple respawn is 2 hours.</div></div><hr />
