<br />
I have never been to Sky and need to obtain my epic piece from the Spiroc Lord. I need any advice anyone can give on the mob, number of people needed etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have lead a few raids up there over the last year... the last of which was with in the last 2-3 months...<br />
To make it simple<br />
island 1 - 1 group<br />
island 2 - 1 group with a chanter for CC<br />
island 3 - 1 group<br />
island 4 - 2 groups Bring DPS for the boss mob as he DT's every 30 sec. (this is the necro epic mob and the same island that the ranger epic drop drops at)<br />
Island 5 - 2 groups 2 CC's bring CC when you pull one you move than likely bring 1/2 the island, (chain argo) If you get the guardian make sure you kill him first so he resets then kill the rest in camp and make your camp opposite side of the island from the guardian and you can farm the lord. <br />
<br />
If he has the wingblade you will see it in his hands, If he does not have it in hand then set up a farming. Scout his while invised and see if he has it upon porting up.<br />
<br />
good luck.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
just looked at the link above..<br />
the island 1 is called noble island and not needed. You can do the faries on island zero then the imps on island 2. The dijinns are not needed unless your doing the monk epic. so with my notes above make the island 1 not exist and place the island 0 as island one.<br />
1=farries<br />
2=imps<br />
3=madussas and eyes and air elementals<br />
4=horses and griffs<br />
5=sprokets<br />
6=bees</div></div><hr />
