<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nysstyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided to quit my lvl 50 barb tank and reroll with a dark elf one.  I got tired of looking like every other dime a dozen tank and also disliked the size issue as well.  I was wondering if Crusty would be a idea to wear since my STR and STA will be somewhat low and what lv should I decide to switch it out.  Also I wanted to work on my bash skill so can anyone give me a brief explanation of how to ghetto bash.  Thx for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In regards to ghetto bashing, Kailyn has posted Ruatha's excellent guide at http://kailyn.topcities.com/Ruathabash.htm</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really should do something with the site :p.<br />
<br />
The only 2 things you have to worry about with stats at lower levels is 1) do you have stm =&gt;100, 2) do I have enough str to carry a reasonable amount of loot?<br />
<br />
Replace the crusty as you get better peices. +Stm does not really start to pay off until 40+ (I would say). Really its wasted on the earlies levels of warrioring. <br />
<br />
Mudflation has more or less cured all low level warrior problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good job on your decision.  Being a Tier'dal Warrior is indeed unique.  You will indeed have stat problems.  With Raid buffage I am still shy of max stamina (and probably always will be).  However in exp groups I can get Infusion of Spirit and max.  At the end of the day, I am sexier, and that just works for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">stats will be a problem, work on sta most of all. Rest I cap out with raidbuffs and avatar, so they don't bother me. Never regretted making a dark elf warrior.<br />

I make this look good.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Dark Elve warriors are awesome.  Nothing against Barbarian warriors, but they are the most common.</div></div><hr />

If you truly want to be uber-sexy, then re-roll as a Vah Shir now!!!  It's all about the tail, baby!<br />
<br />
And you won't have crappy stamina, either :)</div></div><hr />

I put none in sta and was hit with the low hp for some time.  I never put any AA in sta either.   I am now maxed out 305 in sta without buffs.   Depending on your guild or a guild you will be heading too, you will be able to get gear that will max out your stats.  Don't get your panties in a bunch if you think you put points where you shouldn't have.</div></div><hr />

The Stats do come shy sometimes, but even on raids, I can normally get the Buffers to Buff me for Max STA if I am MA'ing</div></div><hr />

Actually that doesn't surprise me in the least.  By not choosing an &quot;ideal&quot; race for the class they have to work at it harder.  A lot give up but those that stick it out know the class inside and out, better than most ogre or barb warriors ever will.  If you know your weakness it becomes less of a weakness....if that makes sense. O_o<br />
<br />
And I&quot;m gonna have to agree with my feline brothers and sisters.  Nothing can hold a candle to a plate cat. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually Jagd, you're probably right about that, but there's one other way to learn your class inside and out that applies to us big oafish barbarians too.  Play your character from pre-Kunark, in the days before mudflation, and make do with gear that people wouldnt wear on a CR these days.  Really gives you a good grasp of how to play your class.  It always makes me laugh when I see those &quot;Is my gear good enough&quot; posts from newbie warriors in gear that I didnt have till I was in my 40's. :)  Of course, my stats arent ideal because I had no idea where to put the points back then, so that may be part of it too. <br />
<br />
And on a final note:<br />
Are all Barbarians sexier than Half Elves/Dark Elves/Iksar/Gnomes/Humans/Halflings/Vah Shir etc.?<br />
<br />
Nope. Just me baby. Just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Janthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I agree Beornegar....I started on March 27th 1999 on Bristlebane and I think I was still in mostly crafted till 50 cause I was 50 pre-kunark and there wasn't a whole lot to upgrade to....hehe sucked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, don't get me wrong now, not trying to badmouth barbarians or ogres or anything. :D  In fact, I agree completely with you.<br />
<br />
I got a little bit of a head start on gear and in my 20s I did better than most in all the &quot;cool&quot; places like PC and HK.  Then I went to The Hole with some friends when I was mid-40s and learned quickly that even ripostes from rock golems eat through an Enameled Black Chestplate and Ry'Gorr Chain Leggings like moths through a sweater. :eek: But I learned....and I'm certain people still make funny faces when I go stand with the rogue when I'm not tanking.<br />
<br />
Like I said, even with bad gear or low hp, if you learn from your experience, weakness isn't a weakness.  Everybody wants nice gear.  Certainly I do.  I'd love to be able to tank more efficiently so that my guild can do some nice things and I think wanting to improve like that is a good thing.  But to those with the &quot;bad armor&quot; or &quot;crappy stats&quot; I would say this:  while you're holding out on that nice gear, be sure that you're learning the best way to play without it.  It can only help you later. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I remember going to The Overthere and getting a group in /ooc, showing up and having them say, &quot;Oh, you're a half elf. We thought you were an ogre. We'll just wait for an ogre. Thanks anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Small and Medium races used to have to fight community bias a lot to get groups, or at least I did.<br />
<br />
I still remember my full suit of Bronze armor: being too encumbered by the armor itself to loot, looking like an orange robocop... :D</div></div><hr />

I love DE warrior. back in old days all the warriors I saw were barbs, trolls, and orges so I created my woodelf warrior. I love elf either dark or wood! they look awesome!

My first Warrior was a Barbarian. Liked the stats but hated the nightvision. Next warrior I made was a Dwarf when I came back to the game. Got him to 52 whan LoY went live and started new asa Froglok.. They are cool :/</div></div><hr />
