Can check my magelo so far I have raex bracer and the puresteel shoulders trying to decide where to drop the mass dkp =).<br />
<br />
Can also be anything of ele level in GoD/OoW.</div></div><hr />

Helm is probably the rarest piece (besides legs) so expect to pay a bit more for it.  Prepare to hate silk drops passionately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally what I did was to figure out how much I valued AC and HP's relatively speaking.  Then I looked at the Raex's armor slot by slot and figured out which gave me the highest value over my current gear.  When I used 1AC=5HP's I multiplied the added AC by 5 and the added HP's by 1 and came up with a score.  I found the arms to be my biggest upgrade available so I waited for a pair.<br />
<br />
In your personal case I would advise for the plate arms, Bracer of Earthen Energy (nice bracer and 41% haste) or a Blade of War.  The arms are a huge upgrade, the bracer would be an upgrade as well and free up your cloak slot for one with better stats like the Loyalist shield.  Your weapons should take you into Time but I have always read what a great weapon the BoW is but no one in my guild has one so I cannot recommend from personal experience.  If you are working on your epic 1.5, I would probably not go after the BoW though as the 1.5 is a very fine weapon and easy to get for an elemental guild.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Air mask (fine hammered face guard I think it is?) from one of the avatars is a good pick. I would also suggest going for the arms first and foremost (armguards of repentance while nice otherwise are really lacking in the ac department) If you do not want to go to loyalist shield for whatever the reason, leaf scale cloak (dust ring in earth) or drape of the agile (rarish drop from charm birds) is a good pick. I'd wait on getting a hat until you get the arms + boots, and either an elemental bracer or the earthen energy one since its a minimal upgrade to HoRZ (though I still want one, damn I hate the graphic on HoRZ :()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kk cool yeah figured for most part all Raex with arms/ bracer being the most important. was more or less wondering about the non visible slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want to look ahead...<br />
<br />
Dont get the Legs unless you get them dirt cheap.  Legs drop in P3 like Candy.<br />
<br />
I would get at least one bracer, and go for the Earthen Energy or the Tipt one in other slot.  Bracers with decent AC are far and few between in Time.<br />
But, like someone else said, every piece of Raex is worth going for.  <br />

I can't think of a decent EP non-visible slot that isn't from a god.   Raex will allow you to get the earring and ring from Ikkiniz, you can get maze runners from MPG, MPG mask is ok till you can get frenzy.  Then you've got the ranged from Destruction in MPG...  Cloak get Loyalist Shield till you get in time.  As Brutul said the shoulders are really the only non-visible thats WORTH getting in EP... seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking at your goal profile, and there are some things on there that I'd change.<br />
<br />
-First off, with the introduction of haste augs, despite being several hundred thousand platinum depending on your server economy, go balls to the wall and get one.  You'll never have to worry about replacing your haste item ever again.  All you'll have to do is move the aug.<br />
<br />
-If you're doing VT, are you still killing Emp?  VT+Emp is a source of good offslots that just aren't in abundance in the elemental planes.  Azallil's Ring of Analogies ring a bell?  That haste ring that's on your goal profile is an incredibly rare ring, and when it drops, there's going to be some enormous competition for it.<br />
<br />
-Don't be a jackass and send a tell on the Earring of Embedded Coral, lol.  (I mean this in a friendly way)<br />
<br />
-Get into Ikkinz!  You can request Ikkinz expeditions once you get KT access.  Now that you're gearing up in the elemental planes, your guild should be able to readily do this.  Every trial can drop the Glyphed Prayer Ring... You want a Glyphed Prayer Ring... Yes you do... ;)<br />
<br />
-I doubt your guild will be &quot;farming&quot; Xegony for that backslot.  She really wouldn't be all that bad, but she's a real bitch to get to, even by way of summoning everyone's corpse.  It just takes forever.  So, chances are, you probably won't be seeing very many of those feather mantles.  The birds in fire drop a Drape of the Agile.  No, it's not as good, but it's 120382091830x more abundant.  Also, since you're doing VT, try and snatch some of the decent backslots out of there.  <br />
<br />
-Aten mask.  That is all.  =)<br />
<br />
-You might make a few clerics REALLY pissed off if you got that neck.  It's not to say it's a poor melee neck.  In fact, it's probably the best neck besides ToVK for Warriors outside of Time atm.  Gah, beginning to hate All/All loot, huh?  Thing is, that's the best preservation focus for clerics until PoTime.  Alternative?  Do what I did and quest the neck out of Halls of Testing.  It's 35ac 100hp +8 all svs.  I used that for ages, and I mean AGES, due to the insanely high AC on it.  <br />
<br />
And always remember that questing is your friend.  If you can quest and alternative piece of gear inside of spending dkp/whatever for it, do so.  Since most people DON'T quest, officers tend to really enjoy giving loot to people who do.  It shows that you're willing to make a solid effort for your character, and in return, officers see that as rewarding people who are solid investments in the guild.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your in a hardcore raiding guild, u will be into time in a matter of months.... in phase 1 of time u can pick up a neck/earring/ring fast, so i wouldnt waste points on those in elementals.....<br />
<br />
Get a solid group and learn how to farm the ikkinz trials, u can pick up a 160hp ring, 150ish hp earring, 135 hp range, and 160 hp 46% haste bracer, bracer is kinda low on ac, and u can get all these upgrades in a matter of a week or so after u know how to farm them... and they cost you nothing.<br />
<br />
It was said above, if your in a dkp bidding type guild, dont waste points on elemental legs, they will go for ALOT while your in elemental planes, and will rott withing a month of getting to time... so save your points. Can always go to Vxed and within a hour or so get a pair of 110hp legs with decent ac to hold you over.<br />
<br />
Other then that, just get a set of elemental armor and then wait for drops with good hp AND ac, ac is the win.  Alot of people ignore ac, but it will make a huge differnce in time/god/oow, so start stocking up now, and get to farming ac augs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was bored today at Uni so I had a good look at your gear and AA's. Hope you don't mind and i'm not trying to put down your AA choice or gear at all, just giving ideas.<br />
<br />
For starters get that Level 70, best thing you can do atm, followed by getting the right AA. No need for double riposte when you have things like ID to do. I'd definatly go for LR5, PP5, CS3, ID5, then look to WA5 OOW defensive stuff and Flurry for the agro.<br />
<br />
Gear wise made a fast Magelo:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1152037<br />
<br />
Yeah it;s fully augged and doesn't take into account you progressing and earning better stuff, apart from the Raex it is nearly all 1-2 group stuff. Also the AA is a good example of what you'll need eventually, though 400 aa's is alot so don't worry too much about them cept the defensive ones.<br />
<br />
Running it down:<br />
-Raex in your Visable slots, except for legs (Cos they'll be insane DKP and rare in E planes, wait for time) and BP.<br />
-Tipt bracer and Earth Haste bracer in your wrist slots, taking care of haste and both are decent bracers.<br />
-VT belt, great belt , great AC, better than anything in the E planes until Saryrn belt from time, go for it, failing that a HP belt from earth will do.<br />
- KT and Ikkinz! You'll need the tipt bracer, get access to KT and subsiquently Ikkinz. KT has 2 great Augs and good exp, and it has Ikkinz, the place for the Glyphed Prayer ring, get one and be happy.(Plus you'll be coming to KT with your guild eventually)<br />
-MPG and Riftseekers, forms the bulk of your gear, hell I think you could nearly skip EP if Time wasn't past it, these place are where you should be when your not in Ikkinz, KT or Raiding. Great Exp for the AA and gear and aug's to boot.<br />
- Mask and Ring from trash in MPG, pick them up. Also make the magnetised legs (May be no drop, i'm on FV so not sure if they are)<br />
- Get a good group of friends and head to the MPG trials, read up and work hard and get the Earring, Cloak and range item, they are all unmatched till time if not beyond.<br />
- When you get some AA and some more exp head to Riftseekers and farm everything there, aug's and importantly, the BP, amazing Bp and 1 groupable, nearly as good as GSP and doesn't take 6 hours to clear.<br />
- If Rss is too hard for your group get 2 groups and split augs, have it as a mini raid exploration, you'll all benefit from the drops there.<br />
<br />
Aug's:<br />
Riftseekers, live there and get the augs, bear in mind it will take a fair while tog et this many augs, but they are with you till, well a new expansion I guess.<br />
4 X Gemstones of Fiery might, for the rings/Earrings<br />
4 X Flameshield Stones<br />
4 X Ore's of Stone strength<br />
<br />
Head to KT and pickup the 2 X 20 ac augs there, and camp BH in MPG for Eyes and for general exp.<br />
<br />
Basically it's a good idea as to what you can get and aim for, obviously there will be better things from raiding that you can pickup (mainly time) and do go for them, but until then you can see that E planes ain't that good anymore for tanks and 1 group can pretty much gear a war to a hell of a tank. Goodluck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok thats great info thanks. As vt goes for most practical purposes we will not be raiding there unless every ele mini is down. I have three hydras and they are praticaly KT flagged so that won't be a big problem as guild will be killing SR soon. <br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to make the magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaknaafein</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flurry for the agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been considering this for a while -- I went ahead and got slippery attacks to tank in the EP's with my bloodfrenzy/BoC combo because my guild seemed to lose interest in RZtW lately. Just wondering though, wouldn't flurry increase the damage taken from riposte? Now that I'm writing it down, I remember that Furious doesn't do much against mobs that flurry alot, because I never riposte their flurry's -- does it work the same with PC's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any AA that adds swings (Flurry, Punishing Blade, etc.) adds an additional chance to be riposted.  Seriously though, it's not significant.  If you figure how many times a minute flurry goes off, and then the chances of any one swing being riposted, and you may end up with an extra riposte every few minutes, but it's not going to be noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fjalarr</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can riposte on any swing you take against the front side of a mob. You won't get riposted from the sides and back. Flurry is just a third attack added to a successful double attack already made. If you succeed at double strike you might flurry for one extra attack. This applies to all flurry aa abilities. Flurry only applies to the Primary wielded weapon. You could in effect flurry for 3 three hits and double riposte for 2 hits for a total of five hits in consecutive order. You can add a kick or bash/slam for a sixth attack and procs have their own timer. <br />
<br />
I don't know how procs affect the flurry double riposte sequence since each proc type will have its own effects to your combat. The aa description for flurry is a bit misleading but it means that a third attack can happen if you land a double attack for total of 3 attacks. Yes, your third attack could be riposted but not until you successfully landed a double attack first. A riposte on the second attack from a double attack will end the sequence and lose the chance for flurry(third swing). You still get the chance to riposte though and possibly double riposte on the mobs attack after you swing if its swing comes after you swing(slowed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
BF/boc augged blows bowar augged out of the water.  even boc/bbcleaver augged outaggro bowar, and  I wouldnt worry about the added ripostes too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well got 70 been grinding through aa now. Spending time in MPG for the Mask/ring atm or in PoFire with my necro kiting for me. Was wondering what would suggest for next say 100 aa. <br />
<br />
Was thinking finish ID5 finish sturdiness 5 then WA 5 then go to OoW Defensive. Gonna get my epic 1.5 on wednesday will be using boc also until I can get something better. Just figured mention that so would not worry so much about 2h aa for more agro on BoW. Well unless it will be better agro i suppose.</div></div><hr />
