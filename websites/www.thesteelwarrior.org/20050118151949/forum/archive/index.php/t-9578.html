<br />
I went over to somethingawful and looked at some of their forum logs, my god... I felt the veins in my brain contract when I read some of it.<br />
<br />
some of it was as stupid as &quot;we made out, can I be pregnant? no touching or anything&quot; what are schools teaching these days? jesus!<br />
<br />
other things as retarded as suicide agst poems and talking about what anime character is best...<br />
<br />
I have no faith in the next batch of brats coming up behind me.... scares me to know they will be taking care of me in the old folks home in the far off future.<br />
<br />
I need a beer.</div></div><hr />

The need for, and reason homeschooling is still legal is becoming obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt know what 69 was until i was almost 17 (most people knew by 13-14), and i didnt even see a naked picture of a woman until i was almost 16.  Of course that's what you get growing up in the Bible belt in a small rural farming community in southern Alabama ... in a very &quot;sheltered&quot; church environment. (bring on the hick jokes  :p  )<br />
<br />
At 14 i'm pretty sure i would have known that you can't get pregnant from making out, heh, but it goes to show more how sheltered some of these kids are rather than stupid/incompetent.  Sexual ignorance is not an altogether  a bad thing.  The world would be a better place if more 14-year-olds were naive to this extent pertaining to sexuality.<br />
<br />
Anywho i'm sure you read other stuff to contribute to the headache ... sorry for picking at just one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it was about the same for me, my dad is a pastor.  i dont really care if other kids knew what a 69 was or watched porn all the time at 14, im an academic type person and i HATE IGNORANT PEOPLE.  Not really stupid people.  Stupid people are people who cant help it that theyre a little bit slower than some people, its all in the genes.  IGNORANT people are the ones who have the capacity to be able to do something or learn things, but theyre such miserable little fuckups that they spread their ignorance.  God i hate that ignorance has become the norm in our culture (for the most part).  Look at most people's favorite TV show: The Simpsons.  It is an incredibly inane show filled with low brow humor, but it is one of the most watched shows because people LIKE simple crap like that.<br />

must end rant now before blood pressure gets too high</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, the most mind numbing thing is how they go on about suicide and how little things mean the end of the world, or saying that this or that character A is better than character B, and getting into enraged fights.<br />
<br />
I think it is a combo of the way we are cutting out some history, facts and the nasty bits of history, to avoid offending people... that and the battery of drugs and injections that are showing links to dropping IQs and increased depression rates.<br />
<br />
People can not even have have a shirt with a pumpkin on it, I remember when I was a kid and our teacher would dress up as a witch, or something funny, now they would loose their job over it :(<br />
<br />
I bet you older folks think the same thing about me or spock :D<br />
<br />
by 12 I knew the birds and the bees like a doctor  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha i love encarta...i learned stuff just to know about it...not to jerk off at 13<br />
<br />
I read the most out of any person i know, except for my homegroup teacher probably.  NO ONE else i know at school reads at all.  My brothers dont read at all.  I had to do an annotated reading list (bibliography thingy) for my senior ROPE portfolio, and it ended up being 5 full pages long single spaced.  and that was just the books i own, i didnt go to the library to get a list of the books ive borrowed over the last 4 years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to be serious where my future is concerned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heheh, just bitching to bitch isk.<br />
<br />
Reading is good, I do a fair bit of that myself but I like wordy fantasy books with a bit of nuances, becoming stronger and discovering limits of strength/power, that and science... never had much of a taste for history books but I watch the history channle constantly, used to watch TLC but it is more about building things than learning nowdays.<br />
<br />
I think reading would make our kids smarter, but a fair amount of them hate to pick up a book.. I think the reason for that is they are spoon fed bullshit and they know it.. so they come to think of books as an insult to their intelligence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ugh i wish i had better cable...we have a glorified antenna, i LOVE watching Discovery and the History Channel.  I own the Ken Burns The Civil War on DVD.<br />
<br />
I mostly read fantasy/sci-fi, but i like some classics too.  I LOVE LotR and  i have tons of Star Trek novels.  I also like the Wrinkle in Time set, the Chronicles of Narnia, and some non-fiction books (like Stephen Hawking books or books on Chernobyl.  Im sorta obsessed with Chernobyl, i probably know too much about it for my own good...but then i also know a lot about nuclear power and physics then too.)  The Universe in a Nutshell is a great book.<br />
<br />
PS its  name that stanza time again :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
THANK YOU!<br />
<br />
I've been trying to remember the name of that set (wrinkle in time) for years!  I read it when I was little and loved it.  I also loved the Narnia books.  I bought the set for my nephew.  I read alot, too.  I think my favorite book has to be the Hitchhikers Guide, though.  Not the most educational series, but funny as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah yes hitchhikers guide is awesome!<br />
<br />
heres all the books in l'engle's series:<br />
A Wrinkle in Time<br />
A Wind in the Door<br />
A Swiftly Tilting Planet<br />
Many Waters (my favorite of this series)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes I wished I never spent my school days either outside fishing or (once in high school ) drinking beers.<br />
<br />
Seriously.<br />
<br />
Luckily I paid about 99% of my dues and if I only knew now what I thought I knew than life would have been a lil' easier. Or I would have been hit by a truck. Who knows.<br />
<br />
The thing that has really got me pondering my past and future is when I hold my son and just look at him. Will he makes the same mistakes that I did? Will he be the next Einstein? Who knows. All I can wonder is what he's thinking when he sits there staring at me. I honestly have no idea. I just hope when the time comes for him to learn he's not afraid to ask nor will be afraid to go against the grain about something he might believe in.<br />
<br />
I just hope I can raise him to be who he wants to be. No matter if he wants to dig ditches or design spacecrafts or whatever the future has; I just want him to believe in himself and learn everything he wants to and can to develop himself. And most importantly; to have fun.<br />
<br />
I want him to smile. A lot. Something I wish I could have learned earlier in life.<br />
<br />
oh jeez I sound sappy. :D</div></div><hr />
