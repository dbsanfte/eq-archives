<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Fellow Warriors<br />
<br />
I am back to check on another Possible Upgrade<br />
<br />
First I have about 40k saves up.<br />
<br />
Here my is Magelo Profile My Gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131975) <br />
<br />
Right now my Unbuffed HP and AC without Stat Foods is<br />
<br />
3697 HP and 1213 AC<br />
<br />
I was thinking a Couple of choices<br />
<br />
Another Mosquiot Leg Earring (Would give me another 16 HP and 5 AC)<br />
<br />
Looking at Upgrading to a Back Haste Item and Heavy Rubicite Belt.<br />
<br />
With a Sibilsian Beserker Cloak (SP!) and Heavy Rubicite Belt (Would get another 75 HP and 28 more AC with 5% more Haste)<br />
<br />
That last one is actaully if I get more Money though that comes to like 65k<br />
<br />
Another Update to this, I am also working on Trying to Loot a Haste Item, so might be able to save money in that area, guild is planning some raids, that I might be able to get something from.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any Suggestion for upgrades with about 40k would be greatly Apprectiated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no idea on the prices on your server, but on The Rathe mosquito legs are selling for 18k (I know, I'm trying to sell one) so if you do have 40, that would be a good investment (cause it leaves you room for other upgrades.)  The Bloodstone Earring of Engagment has dropped the prices of everything else.<br />
<br />
Another thought, if you have the faction, is look into MQs of SS armor, specifically gaunts (that would be a 50hp upgrade right there.)<br />
<br />
Also, I just picked up some Forged Shoulderpads (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17119) in the bazaar for 12.5k, I dunno if that's a standard price because it's the only time I'd seen those on sale.<br />
<br />
If you don't decide to go with back haste combo RBBs sell for like 30k over here, and although it's not raw hps, it is 10sta which would help you out a good bit.  <br />
<br />
Overall, you have a nice setup right now, Almost identical to what I was wearing at level 60 (except for the cloak and all the DE cultural, since I'm a woodelf, that was wearing his cultural)  What I did was think about bang for my buck, I slowly upgraded piece by piece alot of times it was just 30-40hps here and there.  Most of the time it was upgrades I went out and got here and there.<br />
<br />
If you have a good group of friends (preferably a chanter a little higher than you) then a Arachnid Antennae (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16410) is pretty damn easy to get.  Just remember to keep that guy in his room.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guess I really Need to fix my Faction<br />
<br />
I am warmly to CoV right now<br />
<br />
I have the SS Boots sitting in bank with Gems, just waiting on faction, but hate faction hunting so bad, lol<br />
<br />
And thanks for the Info, I will look at the other stuff, the Mosquito Ear goes for between 18-22K on My Server also, Paid 19k for my 1, and saw one for 18 this morning.  Just wants sure if with it only giving like 15 hp and 5 ac, whether it was worth 18k and not being able to seel what I am upgrading from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1)Draconic Pauldrons/Chokdai Hide Pauldrons<br />
2) 65hp Mask<br />
3) SS Gaunts<br />
4) Better Haste<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say yes, a mosquito leg earring is deffinitely worth the PP you pay for it. I still wear one, paired with a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement.<br />
<br />
I can't do HTML and sig's and magelo links for the life of me, but to give you a rough idea of my gear level, I have 8750ish HP raid buffed, and 1600+ ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My suggestions-<br />
1) Get off your butt and get that faction fixed, SS boots eat your current ones for lunch.<br />
2) You could buy another skeeter leg now, if you wanted, but it is not that big of a hp boost.  I'd focus on other things, like haste, first.  I'd look for RBG or RBB or that new 31% haste belt from Veksar.  (exp group camp-able)  If you are dead set on back haste, you could look for a Cloak of Flames or its cheaper cousin, the Cloak of Crystalline Waters.  <br />
3) Replace your cultural shoulders with Draconic Pauldrons.<br />
4) Try to snag some SS guants and arm plates once the faction is fixed.</div></div><hr />
