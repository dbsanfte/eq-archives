<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my guilds recently gotten our first two aow kills in the past 2 weeks and i was MA for both but i couldnt seem to get the big red/gold jerk cornered. im a male barbarian and between killing statue - idol - aow each twice all in different corners and with all sizes (regular size, shrunk once, shrunk twice) i couldnt get him cornered anywhere.  we didnt have any project illusion chanters there so i couldnt try gnome, but anyone know anything else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pain for having to live in LGuk for a week is well worth it. Wood-elf + 1 shrink and I can corner mobs in places that ain't even corners :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK, melee newbie here, but why is it easier to corner mobs when you're SMALLER?  I would think being bigger would be better.  Someone splain it to the druid =)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It has to do with the geometry of stackin the mob on top of you in the corner. You take up space, the mob doesn't. The smaller/narrower you are, the less likely the game is to decide that the mob isn't on top of you, but behind you instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So how small do I need to be? I cornered a Froglok Wizard in OS last night (well, cornered = my guilds leet push tactics) Should I be able to expect similar success at my size or do I need to get a cobalt bracer :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Barb here also. Best thing you can do is get wood elf illusion crown and cobalt bracer. S'what i did.  I was wood elf every time i tank AoW and worked just fine. Heck, i tend to go wood elf for alot of fights where i gotta corner, unless i know it won't get pushed over the barb. The crown is well worth it. Oh, just be sure to refresh wood elf illusion before the fight, you don't want it to suddenly turn into a giant barb in the middle of the fight :P<br />
Oh, funny thing happened to me once...i was tanking something with a crapload of hp and we didn't have alot of people at the time. I think it was in VT, i forget...anyway, woodelf illusion poofs, but the mob stays cornered! A huge barb, non shrunk, cornering a mob...was kinda funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am Vah Shir, and don't even get me started on this...it irritates me to no end.<br />
<br />
I can corner Vindi and KT no problem, but not Statue, Idol, Grieg...and, as I just learned yesterday, AoW.<br />
<br />
Gnome illusion, halfling, DE x 1 shrink, WE x 1 shrink are ones I know work. Glad to see Barb has problems before I tried it. Got a HIE left, wonder if it works shrunk.<br />
<br />
Edit: I got a ton of potions from the failed casino :) Anyway, only gonna buy Gnome until I can complete the WE crown quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'll have to corner it next friday... i'm a tad anxious as it will be or first (prepared) try ^^ (the first one being : &quot;oh look, idol is up, let's rush it !&quot; followoed by &quot;huhu aow poped !!! let's rush it&quot;)<br />
<br />
so, has anyone tried to corner it being a HALF ELF ? does skell illu work (necropotence is l33t :p) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">skel illusion as well as wood elf crown along with cobalt bracer are must haves if you want to tank nasty stuff for your guild.<br />
Unless you like always needing the guild to stick a project illusion chanter in your group, then hope they wont die when cleric healing you with the adds inc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Half-elf warrior here and I corner tanked him just fine while shrunk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I borrowed an Amulet of Necropotence just for this.  I shrunk myself 3x (only 2 seemed to do anything) and tried and FAILED to corner Grummus as a 3x shrunk Skeliton.<br />
<br />
So, the next day I started on froglok faction.  Fug it, I could get into VT quicker.  What a snoozefest!<br />
<br />
Lots of Gnome potions for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Using my AoN and double shrink, I have had no problems cornering anything.  <br />
<br />
I am sure there are some corners where it won't work... but in the places that my guild uses corners, I have never been unable to use a &quot;known good&quot; corner due to my size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">what turkish bull said</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was on a twinks Naggy raid the other day with my DragonSlayer twink War Sslarr....who is an Iksar.  In case you don't know, there has been a change to Naggy recently whereas he can come OUT of his lair, and often does on botched Rokyl pulls.  Our puller was a newb to the changes, and of course got Naggy when he was pulling the lair.  Me, being MA, thought fast and got on Naggy....and I cornered him in the buff corner.   Definitely a new one on me, corner tanking Naggy in the buff corner.   Can't say as I ever seen that before. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
So, maybe try Iksar illusion when trying to corner AoW...tho the corners in the arena aren't nearly as nice for that as the buff corner in Sol B is. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Can confirm that you should NOT ^<br />
<br />
try cornering AoW as an iksar.<br />
<br />
Trust me on this one :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OK, we fight AOW on the east side of the arena, in the SE corner where the ramp comes down from the upper level.  When you get aggro, be standing against the south wall.  Have the raid push him against the wall, and then towards you.  You stay against the south wall, and back up as he moves towards you.<br />
<br />
A lot of the &quot;corners&quot; in the arena have small posts in them, and are really 2 small corners.  If you are on the east side of the arena in the SE corner, looking at the corner, you can corner him in the right small corner, but it doesn't work well in the left corner.  So make sure to keep him against the south wall, and push him into the right of the two corners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>EQLiquidslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm a dwarf warrior in a VT enabled guild. I've tanked AoW a bunch of times and we always corner... I've used Wood Elf Illusion plus shrink from Cobalt Bracer every time, because I know it works..... but any dwarves out there who can tell me if we can corner him as dwarf, or shrunken dwarf? or are we too wide?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Half-elf warrior here and I corner tanked him just fine while shrunk <br />
<br />
Same.  I used 2x shrink though... no problems.</div></div><hr />
