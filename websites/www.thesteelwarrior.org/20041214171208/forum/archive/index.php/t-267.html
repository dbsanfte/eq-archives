I recently made 51 and am curious if i should concentrate on lvling or AA. Of course run 3 and regen 3 are desirable. Just wanted to know what you all did. Thank you for any info.<br />
<br />
Poya :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I AA'd at 51. With both my toons.<br />
<br />
With my monk I NEEDED Run 3. I was and still am main puller for my guild and Run 3 is essential.<br />
<br />
With my warrior, I just didn't want to push myself through the 50s again, so I took some time to AA, quest and have fun.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, it's the most fun I've had in EQ in ages.<br />
<br />
Your mileage will vary.<br />
<br />
Just ask yourself what it is YOU want out of the experience?<br />
<br />
And remember, AAing at 51 is slower than it is at later levels.<br />
<br />
The flipside is, it's also easier as you have WAY more zones open to you than someone level 60 or above level 60.<br />
<br />
The ability to AA anywhere from Lower Guk to the Plane of Disease is useful.<br />
<br />
It's just MUCH slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest to level. You will find yourself a LOT more powerful each level, with skill increase and discipline. You may start AAs at 54, or 55 if you want defensive, and only for run3 (and another 3 for baron title :) ), then run to 60 full xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run 3 will most likely pay itself off if you get it at level 51.  Just the time you save from running alone is probably worth it (unless you're a class with movement abilities).  The other AAs will not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id get run 1 or 2 to at least give you a chance getting away from mobs. Then level all the way to 60/61 before aaxping, although along the way you may want to pick up the odd aaxp so that by the time you get to 60/61 you should have made baron and be ready to start dumping them in ND/CA/CS.<br />
<br />
also, don't kid yourself about splitting the percentage, go 100 either way is best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Three things to consider.  AA's are easier after you get about 55-56.  Sadly, you get a /disc at 55 that is still somewhat class defining for us at this level of the game.   Do what works best for you and your guild.  If none of them are 60ish and you're not doing that kind of content much if at all, you might want to take a break from leveling and AAxp for a while.  If they're all high 50's low 60's and you're trying to play catch-up, just level like mad and get the AA's later.  Run speed is probably worth investing in now, but that's for you to decide. I have jboots so I decided it could wait a while.<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cartolis</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm about to hit 59 and I am wondering the same thing. I play with friends that are a bit lower (55-56) and we have been getting good xp in the hole. <br />
<br />
My question is once i hit 59 should i crank over to aa till they catch up or get 60 so I can help them level faster?<br />
<br />
will the lack of aa hurt once we make the transition to the tier 1 planes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I levelled to 55 then did Run2 (which helped pulling in PoP) and continued to 60(almost:D ). At 60 I'll just start the AA grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cartolis, Tier 1's fine without AAs. Your group could do trash in PoD, PoN or PoI right now, I would think, but if you want to stay in the Hole, that's fine too - It's a good zone, nice big fat ZEM.<br />
<br />
I'd get 60 though, since you're so close. The difference between 59 and 60 is pretty big in terms if tanking and mitigation ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say either one. I like Run3 personaly but it only really matters if you like spending time in places where sow isn't an option. All of the Tier1 PoP zones are open air so you will more than likely have jboots or sow to use....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perpull</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO Regen 3 is crap.  I would go with stamina for 3 points purely to move up to the second tier.  For warriors AC is king, HP are important.  As a warrior your job is gonna be to stay alive while you are getting healed.  The amount of regen you have at upper levels doesn't really matter &quot;tooo much&quot;.  Everything helps but if I were you I would go for hit points.(IE Stamina)  Of course if your gear friggin rules and you have 255 stamina all the time anyway then work on another stat that needs help.  I think in the later game you will kick yourself for doing the regen route.  (I wish i put more points into stamina when I created my character) If you look at what all the MT warriors are doing in game, they are all doing ND3 CS3 ect ect.  All of these are made to help you to absorb damage better.  They dont give a crap about putting out damage unless they are tanks who have no hope of every being MT.  Might as well start now with building yourself up.<br />
<br />
Another note:  Everything is this game is percentage based (pretty much). Meaning if you have more hit points to start off with unbuffed when you get buffed you'll have lots more.  I have roughly 3500 HP unbuffed.  With mediocre buffs they can push me to close to 5k.  But I have friends with close to 4k Hitpoints and with buffs they get upwards of 6k hp's. It's a difference of 500hp just because of percentages.<br />
<br />
As another note:  I have never seen my strength less than 255 in a raid.  So I wouldn't worry much in that department.<br />
<br />
Finally to get back to the subject:<br />
AA at 51 sucks ass because it's just like leveling.<br />
AA at 56 sucks ass because you're not high enough level to get the lions share of exp in a group.<br />
AA at 60 rules.  My friend was getting 4% per kill when grouped with me (56 warrior) and my shaman (52).  Was friggin nice.  So if you pull a lot wait till around 55 or 56 throw some time into rs3 and then just wait till 60.<br />
<br />
Thats my 2 bits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People say sta3, but I still think it's mostly worthless.<br />
<br />
Spend 3 aa points and get 20 hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Spend 3 aa points and get more than 20 hitpoints over the course of 1 exp fight.<br />
<br />
Once your 20 hp from sta3 is gone, that's it, they're gone.  My regen is a gift that just keeps on giving, and I can guarantee I regen more than your 20 back by the end of the fight. (when your 20 is still gone)<br />
<br />
My money's still on the regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">personally, i didnt aaxp at 60. i got out of 60 really quick because the exp death penalty was a pita - 1 yellow bub as opposed to 1 blue in 61. I find the aaxp at 61 just as good in pop as when i was 60 as well. plus 61 pushes you past all those benchmark lvl 60 named mobs who now become dblue which in turn helps with aggro control and resists.<br />
<br />
As for whether to put in regen or sta, ill go regen, personally im an ogre so with buffs i can max out sta pretty much whereas regen 3, even though its not much HPs, will always keep ticking over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fabianz</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">General AA...Run 3 and Metabolism 3 beat all.  :)...But seriously, what else are you want to get?  Regen 3?  Stam 3?  Bind wound 3?  Nah, they all lose their usefulness after a certain point.  With stats food Metabolism 3 is even more useful as with it I just don't bother to force myself to eat after awhile.  Beside,  I always forget to do that when I am busy fighting stuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took run3 and regen 3.  I took the regen for when I run from place to place and take falling damage.  I just know that I will heal that damage back with the regen.  Anyway, 3 points is nothing and you will make 3 points before you know it.  Any skill is fine really...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't put AA points in STA.  Stats will go up with gear very easily.  Use AAs to gain abilities that you don't have, like regen, run speed, First Aid (if you use bind wound), or Metabolism to make those Halas pies last longer.<br />
<br />
As for AA at 51, doing AA before 60 will seriously slow down your characters progression in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Spend 3 aa points and get 20 hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Or<br />

<br />
It's about the same with Complete Heal in the equation. Those extra 20 hit points are always there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once your 20 hp from sta3 is gone, that's it, they're gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Until the CH lands and they're back.<br />
<br />
&quot;My regen is a gift that just keeps on giving, and I can guarantee I regen more than your 20 back by the end of the fight. (when your 20 is still gone)&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a moot point, really. They're both useful in a fight, for different reasons. The added hard hit points from increased Stamina makes the CH a wee bit more efficient. The added regen from general AAs makes you a tad more efficient in a solo fight or a fight with a bad healer.<br />
<br />
There is no RIGHT answer here. Get whichever one YOU LIKE. You'll be fine either way.<br />
<br />
In regards to stamina being capped with gear ... consider three things ...<br />
<br />
1) The STA cap is much higher post PoP.<br />
<br />
2) The more innate STA you have, the more flexibility you have to choose an item with less actual stamina and more actual raw hit points on it. (This is more of a monk issue than a warrior issue as warrior gear tends to have oodles of stamina and hit points regardless).<br />
<br />
3) Not all races started off with MACK TRUCK like stamina of Ogres and Trolls. Heh. So the AAs to raise a single stat like that can help offset character creation deficiencies. So many times I see monks say &quot;I wish I had gone all STA at character creation instead of AGI and DEX.&quot; Well ... with AAs now you can.<br />
<br />
In any event, really, in GENERAL AAs there's no WRONG answer on what to take.<br />
<br />
Run 3 is about the most useful AA you can get. Then you've got 3 AAs to play with. Get something you want to get. HAVE FUN. It's 3 levels of your life and time there, do with it what you WANT to do with it, be that Metabolism, Stamina, Regen or INCREASED NATURAL CHARISMA!<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Putting points in stats is silly with the availability of gear these days.  I didn't touch my warriors base stamina at creation (105 for barbs?  Something like that) and I can top 210 unbuffed if i need to...and bear in mind I've DROPPED stamina gear for pure HP gear.<br />
<br />
The increase in stat caps is largely irrelevant.  3 hard drive reformats ago I had a screenshot of me having the EXACT same HP with 259 stamina nd 260 stamina...just a change from Iksar Hide cape (+75hp) to Hiero cloak (+4 sta +75hp).  Anything over 255 gives minimal returns compared to stats below 255.<br />
<br />
Also, 6 stamina that you'd get from putting 3 general points in Improved Stamina is 36 hp at 60.  3 hp of regen is 1/5 of a fungi tunic.  What's a fungi tunic run for on your server?  40-50k?  What's a 35hp earring run you?  200pp?  It's definitely true that every HP counts, but regen is SO helpful in so many situations.  Cleric in group or not, grouped or not, or even if it just helps counteract a DOT on you from a boss mob, regen is more useful, and harder to get. Spend your points how you want, but based on these 3 points, I just see no reason to waste good AA points on stats until you've got 300+ points and everything but Warcry is maxed out.<br />
<br />
Now, should you AAXP at 51?  Probably not.  Get run 3, it's badass, but after that, there's no real reason to waste time working on AA skills when levels will net you much more of a benefit, especially in your 50's.  Higher skill caps, higher taunt caps, more AC, more discs...you're not gonna get those kind of improvements out of AA.<br />
<br />
After that, decide if you wanna do AA's at 60 or push to 65.  See other threads, i'm not gonna get into it.  If you do decide to stay at 60, I HIGHLY recommend staying at 60, and not dinging 61, except maybe for raids, and to buy 61+ points.  One of my friends plays a barb warrior too, and he gained a boatload more XP when he was 60 and I was 61..it was just ridiculous.  I dropped down to 60 to XP grind and went back to 61 when we did ToV.  It was well worth the hassle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I totally agree.<br />
<br />
It's just the same thing can be said for regen AAs as well.<br />
<br />
Past 60, when the monsters start hitting for these insane amounts, those 3 to 6 extra points of regen (cause you KNOW, you can get 3 more points of regen in archetype! WOOO HOOOO) ... anyways, there comes a point in the game where the few extra points of regen are going to have very minimal returns as well.<br />
<br />
Which is why Metabolism is probably best.<br />
<br />
Or First Aid 3 so you can get those leet Warrior Only improved bandaging AAs later on!<br />
<br />
Or increased natrual resistances, so you can kick mucho ass in ToV.<br />
<br />
Or ... or ... well ... really Run 3 is the only thing that's an absolute must have.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah :( <br />
<br />
Game changed too much with the addition of PoP.  Regen for me was extremely useful at level 60, because with CA/CS/PE,  1300ac and 40+ regen per tick, you can almost completely take care of normal XP mob damage.  I even have the first level of regen in Arch, because it was just that useful.  Take stuff in chardok for example (ain't been there in months, so rough estimates).  Stuff hits for 160 or so max, minimum hit isn't much at all..maybe 60 or so.  When the mob is missing more than half the time, and 1/3 or so of the hits he does land are for minimum, you can easily see where Regen takes on a whole new perspective.  The more I regen, the less I need to be healed, the more damage my healers can do with their mana.<br />
<br />
At 60, regen is still very critical in my opinion.  After 60, you are 100% correct, it's been negated just like everything else in EQ, including actual skill.<br />
<br />
Altho lets not go talking trash about First Aid 3 there...I've had the luxury of playing a warrior with it, and it's damned smooth when you've got a couple seconds here and there to patch people up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh.<br />
<br />
True. As a monk I did First Aid 3 over Regen 3. It was a HARD decision, too.<br />
<br />
It's just my soloing utility had been pretty much gimped at the time, and I didn't forsee me soloing at ALL in PoP, so I went with the bandages, figuring being able to bind to full would be more useful during the downtime I (and my friends) had between fights than the regen.<br />
<br />
Which sucks, because all through my 50s, I had my heart SET on added regen.<br />
<br />
It's still REALLY HARD for me not to buy a Darkwater Pearl Ring in the bazaar when I'm just milling about window shopping, because the thought of a droppable ring WITH REGEN on it (even just one lousy point of regen) seems like sooooooo freakin awesome.<br />
<br />
/mourn the heady days of Velks Spiders and soloing</div></div><hr />
