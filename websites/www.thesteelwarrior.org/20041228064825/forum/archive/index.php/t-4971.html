<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe since I seemed to have some luck in asking how to use taunt...I figured I would try again with our new agro abilities.<br />
<br />
I have to say, the way I use incite, it is in no way shape or form an agro lock, but, while I do loose agro, I find that I get it back MUCH faster than before.<br />
<br />
THe 3 most common uses of Incite:<br />
<br />
1) Pulling. Yes I have returned to my Estate of Unrest roots and use Incite to pull in LDoN often. It has a very small splash and seems to chain no where near as far as other options we have to pull.<br />
<br />
(If you are not old school enough to have leveled in unrest, we warriors got a fair number of the pulling jobs because of our 25% MR resistiance which was effective against ghoul root. Nothing like having your puller rooted and dieing inside.)<br />
<br />
This way, incite is fairly darned strong, with most mobs staying on me though slow (but that is one of the big advantages of pulling, I usually have 2-3 seconds of love before anyone does anything to the mob). 2-3 wings, a slam and a taunt after slow gives very good agro.<br />
<br />
The other way I use incite is to pull the mob off the puller (bard normally), most of the time waiting for a hard agro  (Ie doing real damage to the mob, or at least beating on its rune) and then going with incite, though sometimes I will pull off the puller with incite. Both seem to lead to some bouncing of the mob between me and the slower (and the occasional mage, truth be told, particularly if they dont have spell casting subtilty yet),  though it is rare to have the mob stay on the slower for more than a swing or two before they are back on me.<br />
<br />
The &quot;My god, did you pee in his wheaties&quot; agro onto some caster seems far less common now than pre-incite. <br />
<br />
I have to admit I still have not used incite outside of LDoN, so, once I get done with my haste aug in BB, I will be eager to try it out in BoT.<br />
<br />
So how do you use it and what kind of success do you seem to meet with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there is a consistently efficient way to use it. I hear people saying good things about it but in my experience it doesn't even last thru a slow. Therefore I've been thinking, what's the point of using incite before the slow if I have to press taunt after the slow. So I wait til after the slow, hit taunt, then incite. But you see, even then it doesn't work right because taunt is total crap and fails and I'm left worse off then I was when using incite before the slow. If you don't have a problem holding aggro thru the slow then this doesn't matter of course.<br />
<br />
It's a good try at taking the randomness out of warrior taunt but the right way of using it still relies on taunt passing it's check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly. I find it most reliable and useful as a way of tagging mobs since I dont have to use a stupid bow and can put in a better range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">arf arf<br />
<br />
I've been tagging off puller with a bow, taunting, and then inciting.  That works great, and I very rarely lose aggro to a slow lately.  I only Incite when I am nose to nose with a MOB, and I try to have at least tagged it with a bow first.  But I haven't been doing anything on the Planes lately, mostly LDoN for whatever XP I can scratch out of it.<br />
<br />
I've also been using a trick on mezzed mobs which I read here ... while facing the mob I've engaged, I position myself with my back to the mez.  I toggle my target to it when taunt is up, and taunt until I see no failure message.  Then I Incite.  In the event of more than one mez, I reposition and repeat.  The crux is having your back to the mez, so that you don't wake it :p.<br />
<br />
I find the taunt failure message combined with Incite to be a very potent combo; not one single mez broke away from me through two dungeons tonight when I woke it.  That was nice :).<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a &quot;right way&quot; to use it; there is some flexibility in how and when it can be done ... a lot depends on your group (as ever before) - how well you know them, how good the teamwork is, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same. Incite has replaced my arrows. I dont have to swap my range item for my bow.<br />
<br />
 Its not enough to hold aggro during a slow/debuff.   It wont give you aggro during a mezz break if your taunt is not succesful<br />
<br />
Even if your taunt was succesful during mezz break and you used incite for filler hate, you will loose aggro to slow/debuff if you dont get some procs in. <br />
<br />
That has been my experience with it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your ninja fast you can toggle attack, target a new mob and taunt, and toggle back to one your on and re-attack ninja fast. Kinda a skill you develop when mezzing as a bard. Once your good at it you can do it without losing any attacks and you dont have to worry about having your back to the mez'd mob! Doing that and taunting a mez'd mob then inciting while your fighting the main mob and its almost dead can be pretty nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semidil</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am still playing with this, but last night in BoT I had a SK pulling and I would hit attack and then intice and then taunt.  I have noticed that my taunt fails a lot less that way.  It is not a aggro lock,  but I can see the mob turning between me and the SK everytime my taunt took and after the second or third time it happened, I was able to keep aggro for the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
Try it, you might like it :)</div></div><hr />

Freaked the heck outta the chanter tonight when I spun and attacked the first mez without the old 24 seconds of &quot;Taunt during boggle time&quot; :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, but one disadvantage is one slip up, and you will break mez.  All you have to do is somehow get the other mob targeted while attack is on just once and you could be in a world of hurt if you are facing the mezed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">arf arf<br />
<br />
I play about 99% of the time in the 3rd person chase cam, overhead and looking down (I am loathe to try it in the 1st person view), and I avoid using the trick on MOBs that aren't seperated by a few paces for exactly that reason.  As you suggest Mystaviant, it's not a trick to be toyed with idly.  But I find it simple enough when  paying a little bit of attention. <br />
<br />
But this be a thread about Incite specifically, and I mean not to derail, but merely to augment it ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play in first person in general but im constantly changing through my preset camera's for seeing whats around and adds and such. If you practice changing targets alot like this it becomes second nature, but I suppose thats where my bard experience comes in handy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">incite makes tanking multiple mobs much easier.  Incite one, attack the second few swings, go to third, inite anyone but number1 when incite recycles... etc.  Dont forget incite has a hate-over-time component. <br />
<br />
In ldon i just swap archery / incite or charge mobs. Depends on if i have a good shot with the bow at him or how close he is and how my end is atm. <br />
<br />
Oh and yes, pulling / taunting and breaking the next mezz when last mob is at 10-30% is TEH SEKRITZ. This way your DDlers always have a target and while they kill the last one you build agro on the last one and have a little agro advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually use Incite like an arrow. assist puller, incite, taunt, etc.<br />
<br />
The oddest thing happened last night in a hard LDoN.  Monk pulled 2.  Chanter mezzed one.  We killed the first.  Ont he mezzed mob, I used Incite twice, Area Taunt, taunted like mad, and swatted the mob with a GSoT.  Even thought the chanter had a rune up, I was unable ot gain aggro, and the chanter died.  Annoying.<br />
<br />
Also, my % of failed taunts was insane.  Casters were also complaining of tons of resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite works well for me. I dont loose aggro much at all , even with slow and resists. We did plane of Fire last night, a single exp group in the second field and even on slow resists the enchanter got aggro maybe twice in 4 hours.<br />
<br />
I generally use Incite when the mob first arrives and it generally keeps aggro on me.<br />
<br />
Its a good tool that allows a warrior to manage aggro very nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First question, a couple of you mentioned turning your back to the mez when using incite to keep from breaking mez. Is that possible? I have not experienced this yet.<br />
<br />
Also, I never use incite unless my original agro methods fail. This leaves incite available for when a slower gets a resist or two. Incite has ALWAYS turned it back in those cases since the initial incite is a burst of hate.<br />
<br />
When I break mez, I hit taunt, if it works, I auto attack, and only use incite if it runs for the chanter. If taunt fails, in the interest of time, I will then incite then break mez. Only thing is, then you are relying on old school taunt if you lose agro.<br />
<br />
This method seems to work well, and even in hard LDoN.</div></div><hr />

I found that if i hit provoke the moment i saw the graphic effect of slow land then i didnt lose agro to the slower once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How I've been using it:<br />
<br />
1. Tag on inc...arrows have longer range so I'll arrow and then incite as comes into range<br />
<br />
2. When I see a slow message I incite now instead of taunt (I don't trust taunt now that I see 9/10 attempts fail)<br />
<br />
3. Before breaking mez: incite/taunt/kick/attack.<br />
<br />
4. On boss MT: incite, def/evasive.  Now can hold AE taunt unless I really really need it.<br />
<br />
Its a great skill...love the heck out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use toggletargetting when I have to tank 2 mobs, and do it pretty often.<br />
<br />
I noticed that Incite works better if Im already on the agro list, than pulling with it before attacking the mob. So I tag the mob with an arrow and use Incite, then meele. Most of the time the shammy can slow and the chanter tash without the mob going for any of them ( I tried this with a 65 shammy and 61 chanter, they tashed and slowed at the same time after I tagged and incited a mob to camp ). In some other zones, I noticed that the mob would sometimes go to the shammy (mostly on slow resists since they seem to generate more agro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I try to save Incite for when I really need it. If I am pulling I use arrows to puill, if I am not, I will tag with arrows. If the puller has any sense at all, they are pulling with very low agro methods and 1 or 2 arrows are enough to get the mob coming to me. I usually hit Taunt as soon as slow lands, if the mob heads for the slower I will pop Incite on them at that point, 99% of the time the mob stops in its tracks and turns back to me.<br />
<br />
I also LOVE incite to break mez. I use the same type technique Doggabone described. I have my toggle target function mapped to the Tab key so every time taunt is up, I will Tab+taunt+Tab. With a little practice you won't even miss any attacks on the mob you are engaging. If I managed to keep agro without Incite I will also drop an Incite on the mezzed mob as early as possible. This makes breaking mezz very safe for the chanter.<br />
<br />
Basically, I see Incite as a new trick for agro you can use for back up when all else fails.</div></div><hr />

this way he doesnt have to switch atk off, just switch taunt incite.Exactly that ... I can juggle two targets fairly simply, but I find having my back to the mez keeps me from accidentally waking the critter.  I have this itch, now, that it was one of wandor's posts wherein I first heard of the trick.<br />
<br />
I have also diverted an incoming MOB with Incite off the puller when I can't get an arrow off in time (to close to the door, or someone stepping in front ...), and used it to pull.  At which point, I'm pretty much at the old game, finger over the taunt button, etc.  Except that I have the aggro from tagging the thing with a REALLY big arrow :D.  And I've used it to pull, esp. when I can't get an arrow into it as it's flattened on the wall - it sure beats kicking it in the kneecaps and then running back to camp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do a majority of the pulling my groups. I just pull with a bow, run back to camp, and then incite the mob AFTER I hit it. This pretty much lets me tash 99 percent of the time right off the bat (when the mob is at 97-99 percent health) without getting summoned/attacked on my enchanter. I then proceed to slow with no problems (unless it's resisted, then I just reslow but never lose agro).</div></div><hr />

If you are not old school enough to have leveled in unrest, we warriors got a fair number of the pulling jobs because of our 25% MR resistiance which was effective against ghoul root.<br />
<br />
I'm old school enough to remember before we got that boost to MR :)  Of course, I was a barb back then, because there were no sexah kitty warriors :)</div></div><hr />

Maybe it is just me though I haven't done a statistical analysis on this or anything...<br />

When someone pulls a mob I will still use arrows, then taunt then do incite...<br />

<br />
Usually Incite will not turn the mob back on you from spell aggro on its own. Using Incite first is pretty much wasting it for nothing. <br />
<br />
Mob will turn on you when you get a succesful taunt, then Incite to get a bigger lead in hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, although there are a few select situations in which it can be useful.<br />
<br />
For example, wizards always like to go the extra mile and sometimes get summoned.  If you hit Incite when that occurs, the mob will almost always turn to you, although you have a point in that you could usually just have hit taunt before and have the same result.<br />
<br />
I've also used it in the situation talked about where you have another mob parked and you switch fast and use it and switch back.  Again though, the situation dicates that it probably will be meaningless, for example, the enchanter might remes, shaman might reslow depending on the fight, and then you're going to use taunt which in most cases has a good chance of working.<br />
<br />
And on my 62 warrior, I use it to pull simply because I'm too lazy to buy arrows or get him the summoning pouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In case it's not clear. The reason you taunt *before* Incite is because taunt doesn't add any appreciable direct agro by itself. If taunt works you jump to 1st on hate list, *then* incite gives you a nice big head start over other people. If taunt fails, well Incite is still there helping. Taunting after Incite just wastes some of the direct incite agro if it succeeds.</div></div><hr />

This seems to be different from what you guys are doing.<br />
<br />
Why would you hit taunt on a mob that you already have aggro on?<br />
<br />
Did something change?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I rarely use it to pull if at all, I like my bow and enjoy range pulling.  <br />
<br />
For XP groups, I find myself rarely needing incite, but for the situations that I do, It does come in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tag with incite and only taunt &quot;if&quot; I lose aggro. <br />
<br />
The reason why you want to taunt (successfully) before using Incite is that basically doing it the other way around your not maximizing the amount of aggro you can generate.  Example:<br />
<br />
Mob inc...<br />
<br />
1. Shaman casts Malo/slow for 600 &quot;Hate&quot;...<br />
<br />
2. Warrior sees mob beeline to Shaman and Incites for 400... <br />
<br />
3. Shaman STILL has 200 &quot;Hate&quot; over you and is presently getting the everliving crap beat out of him/her... So you taunt (successfully) and it turns... <br />
<br />
4.  Now you have 601 Hate... and have to hope that no one does anything that will cause it to turn away because a) Incite is gone and b) Taunt is gone (and unreliable)<br />
<br />
Now lets do it the other way...<br />
<br />
1.  Shaman casts Malo/slow for 600 &quot;Hate&quot;...<br />
<br />
2. Warrior sees mob beeline to Shaman and taunts (successfully) <br />
<br />
3. Warrior now has 601 &quot;Hate&quot; and the Shaman is sitting on his mount munching on roots or something and debating on whether to DoT or not...<br />
<br />
4. Warrior uses Incite to &quot;pad&quot; his Hate... You now have 1001 &quot;Hate&quot; and your basically sitting pretty saying things like, &quot;JESUS LOCK~&quot; and &quot;Got nukes?&quot; to your group mates...<br />
<br />
Basic jist of it.  This is of course not counting Anger line weapons and effects...  Speaking of which... If taunt DOES fail than I find it very handy to Incite AFTER an Anger3-type proc.<br />
<br />
Anywho... thats why :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree though that taunt then incite is better but if you are the puller with a bow (or bum rush) you are already highest on the agro list. I waste a taunt but controlling 6 toons putting stuff on the same key helps me a lot.<br />
<br />
I wait for the mob to get to me because there might be some lost effect if you incite for 100 feet away. <br />
<br />
Then I slow the mob (almost instantly no delay). I keep agro 95 percent of the time doing this. Between Incite, Taunt and my offhand EB and mainhand ACreducerHPreducer proc I have no problems in LDoN!</div></div><hr />

Normally lead off with AE Taunt, then Furious, then Stonewall.  By that time my endurance is basically gone.<br />
<br />
For raid offtanking I Incite every mob I offtank 1 time and never use any discs.  <br />
<br />
For XP groups I Incite every single mob we fight 1 time at the beginning of the fight whether taunt succeeded or not.  The improved aggro is worth more than the trivial DPS boost that Fellstrike gives and I don't need any defensive discs in XP groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For pulling and tanking. <br />
It pretty much doesn't matter when I use Incite the mob stays fine on me. As long it is enough agro to keep attention of the mob I am fine.<br />
The old taunt button is not used as much now. It is still usefull, but it is mostly used when I need agro fast or might be far behind on agro list.<br />
AE taunt covers the most urgent agro and when there are several mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not convinced that a succesful taunt will overlay an Incite. I refer you to a test I believe Furor (??) did when he would pull a mob with his cleric, and do nothing but stun it (no damage) for a while, then begin taunting. It would take upwards of 3 successful taunts before the mob would turn. If taunt is top of list +1, why would it take 3? This is where he hypothosized about &quot;bonus agroo&quot; (forget actually term). Things like sitting, low hps, etc have a bonus amount of hate associated with them, and taunt can't override those types first time.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point of this rambling is that if the hate generated by Incite is applied to this mysterious &quot;bonus agro&quot; list, then taunt would have no affect on its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Besides, there are situations in which you have to taunt after incite. For example, On inc, I taunt successfully, and mob is on me. Shaman casts slow and is resisted, casts slow again, is success, but gets agro. So, I hit taunt first, and it fails, so I then hit incite and it fails to get mobs attention. I then hit taunt because it is still beating on the shaman. It succeeds, and it turns to me. From then on, I am pretty much locked unless a nuker gets outa hand.<br />
<br />
I normally always save my incite until I lose agro. In my mind. a burst of 400 hate would go a lot further to regain agro, than a 50 hate/tick would, and have to rely on good ol' taunt for agro.<br />
<br />
Incite adds a complex dimension to the tanking world that we never really had before. Personally, at this point, I see no right or wrong way to use it. But, it has only been a few weeks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harthina</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I use Incite as an aggro-builder, and Taunt as an aggro-regainer.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way - Incite is a set amount of aggro.  Taunt is highest aggro+1.  BUT, Incite doesn't fail (at least, I don't think there is a check for it, correct me if I'm wrong) and Taunt can.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that Incite alone does not have greater aggro than a slow.  But, if I've managed to get Incite off twice before the mobs is slowed, the mob doesn't even look at the shammy. (Not likely to happen though unless you're pulling, and doing a fairly long pull.  I was able to do this the other night in Plane of Valor, pulling from OC).   I also have little or no aggro loss to the slower if I've used Incite and my Taunting Blow proc has gone off. <br />
<br />
So most of the time I use Incite once or twice on the mob (more often in a longer battle if I'm worried about those impatient casters and their huge nukes), and try to save Taunt for emergencies.  I can almost always get aggro back before the mob takes a bite out of the caster.<br />
<br />
<br />
===In an LDoN group recently, the cleric yelled at the wizard for overnuking....the wizard replied &quot;It ain't overnuking if my HP doesn't move&quot;  Meanwhile, I'm pressing buttons like a bard trying to hold aggro.....but at least I held it =)</div></div><hr />

I pull, or tag, fight it wait for malo, slow, immediatetly taunt, then incite.  Believe it or not the mob never gets to the slower.  Only thing is if taunt fails now the slower cannot sit for a bit, if it does not fail the taunt + incite is enough to where the slower can sit.</div></div><hr />

that gives me 470 min hate (400 initial 70 hate in 6 secs) plus<br />
pull agro.<br />
<br />
Odly enough the ONLY thing that will pull agro off me instacast in incoming is snare in any form or CH on inc if im 20 pct health.  <br />
<br />
Seems odd to me that snare overides tash and slow.<br />
<br />
If I'm not the puller i pluck with an arrow 2 x I see the mob turn to me on inc, once hes in camp attack incite then taunt.<br />
99 % failproof even with idiot casters.<br />

I get ohh's and ahh's every group I go into concerning my taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i pull constantly with incite, sometimes i will also hit with an arrow and then attack when mob gets back to camp. If I get more than 1, I hit the incited mob for a 2 count then switch targets to a second target, most every time I can keep both mobs locked on me easilly.<br />
<br />
While, Incite is no where near as idiot-proof and utilitarian as 2-3 stun spells. It almost completely trivializes the LDON dungeon game.<br />
<br />
I do also find that constant pulls with incite, If I use any disc at all, by the end of mission, or in 30 minutes or so I will be periously close to OOE. And have to incite only every other mob, this is when pulling a mob  every 30 sec or so, just as incite refreshes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That taunt test was brutul's...<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I've found that incite will hold through a slow depending on what the slower's doing beforehand and how much alone time I've had with the mob (never more of a difference than a second or two).  It seems to hold almost 100% of the time through tash/malo, but then losing out to slow about 50-70% of the time after that.  Whether that's noticable to the group depends on how many procs I've gotten and whether my taunt right after slow is successful.  However, I've noticed that incite seems to hold through immediate slows 60-70% of the time.  Those are eyeballed numbers, of course, so take em with a grain of salt, but that's what it seems like to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My apologies to Brutul. I couldn't think of which thread I read it in, and keywords to search for it weren't coming to me either.<br />
<br />
One thing that occured to me (something that, for some odd reason, I just never made the association) Incite is nothing more than an Anger2 proc on demand. It is quite helpful at times, especially when BoC or CotMR/Anger3 refuses to proc, but I still find myself saving it for occasions when I lose agro, instead of loading up whenever it pops.<br />
<br />
Also, pulling with Incite just doesn't sit well with me. I really don't like the idea of a &quot;long distant&quot; proc, not to mention that, as it appears to me, is for some reason not as effective as it is when they are in melee range. Not to mention, that it is most likely not available when slow hits and I lose agro. But, sometimes I run outa arrows...wadda ya gonna do :)</div></div><hr />

In my limited usage I found it best to taunt before incite whenever possible. It's just a bigger overall agro boost if taunt works.  <br />
<br />
This is what I do as well.  I use incite for pulling, but other than that I generally use it after a successful taunt.  I  also do the trick dog is talking about on mezzed mobs while fighting.  I just turn off attack while taunting.  Turning off your attack for a few seconds to taunt a mezzed mob is less lost dps than making your whole group stand there doing nothing for 18 seconds while you taunt a mezzed mob.<br />
<br />
Also, if the enchanter tashed, mezzed, and slowed a mob, then you taunt successfully and follow up with incite, there's no way you're gonna lose aggro on that sucker when mez breaks.<br />
<br />
I also use taunt + incite whenever I can on mezzed mobs during raids where I am not MT.  I get a kick out of the mob coming after me instead of the enchanter when mez breaks.</div></div><hr />
