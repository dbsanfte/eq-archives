<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw these 2 quotes recently in another thread:<br />
<br />
two augment slots for Ykesha augs (screw Anger 3, it's a terrible proc) <br />
<br />
how much pure +Hate blows ass<br />
<br />
<br />
I am a fairly frequent reader of these boards, so hth could I have missed any discussion where Anger 3 got trashed?<br />
<br />
I don't understand why Anger 3 sucks ... what am I missing?  Why is Ykesha better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless you are a Hardcore raider Anger3 will probably be &quot;unnecessary agro&quot;.<br />
While there is no such thing as &quot;too much agro&quot; in a warriors mind, sometimes<br />
producing that much hate is not needed.<br />
<br />
Imagine a warrior having like Darkblade/Bloodfrenzy + Augments + Weapon Affinity + Combat effects.<br />
He is gonna proc like 10 or 12 times per minute as an average (once per tick or 6 seconds).<br />
Will he really need 2 extra procs ? Very probably no.<br />
<br />
Anger3 is 1800 Hate per minute &amp; Zero DPS<br />
Ykesha 125 is 1200 hate per minute &amp; 7 DPS<br />
<br />
If you have 2 weapon with Stuns and WA5 those extra 600 hate points per minute<br />
might not be necessary. Thus gaining 7 DPS are a much better deal.<br />
<br />
Ykesha is not better than Anger3.<br />
However it is more balanced (Agro &amp; DPS) while Anger is pure Hate.<br />
<br />
Thats why for some people with Dual Stun combo (Droga/Nurga/BoT sword/SoD).<br />
Getting 2 Ykesha is a better deal than Dual Anger.<br />
They will produce enough hate to get the Tanking done.<br />
And gain 10 DPS from procs, which is a really decent gain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Brael has been doing parses on non-direct hate procs and is pretty convinced it scales vs. mob hp. Anger III is  a set 600, vs against raid type mobs it appears as if ykesha is in the 1000-1500 range where it caps. The only discussion on this board I'm aware of was in the &quot;spirit of rage&quot; thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's the thread about Yeksha &amp; Anger. Attend to Brael's comments. I don't think he's convinced most warriors yet, but his general comments are weighty enough and well enough backed up with testing that no body's actually laughing him off the stage, either.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8854</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aramelus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't consider it my job to do DPS, there are other people are suited to do it far better than I am.<br />
<br />
1800 hate vs 1200 hate is a 50% increase, which means the necros and wizards and other hardcore dps classes can open up the throttle just that much more.<br />
<br />
I use a DBoTW and JoS, both augged with anger 3 currently.  It is incredible, incredible amounts of aggro (was using Blade of War before, which was no slouch).<br />
<br />
Some people prefer to feel like they're doing DPS, but IMO, the extra 7 dps you're doing from ykesha procs is peanuts compared to the extra dot that a necro can throw on the mob without pulling aggro, or the rogue not having to hit evade an extra time, etc.<br />
<br />
It's a matter of preference.  Saying either setup &quot;sucks&quot; or &quot;blows&quot; is misleading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The discussion has nothing to do with DPS. There is some contention that the 450/proc value for ykesha is correct at all.  Read the thread brabble linked.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Bear also in mind that DBoTW, EoE, JoS, Fleshbiter, BBoB aka all the weapons &quot;ubers&quot; are using nowadays have native indirect hate procs (stun component, stun,  ac debuff, stun, and stun component)  so it's kinda hard to judge the value that a3 adds to them. With time+ weapons, clicky procs and EoA, I gotta figure aggro is a non issue most of the time, with or without augs.<br />
<br />
The real way to test is to compare an a3 boc to a yakked gbos or chos. If some SK on drinal wants to come play aggro games with me, I'm happy to give it a shot (i have both those combos on me atm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah agree but look at it another way :<br />
Do you feel that loosing the JoS proc would really lower your agro ?<br />
If the answer is &quot;No&quot; then Demerix would prove to be a better tanking offhander.<br />
<br />
I still believe that at some point, you dont need extra agro. <br />
Notice i talked about non HC raiders (and didnt take into consideration Brael's theory).<br />
<br />
My extra 10 DPS probably wont make or break a raid.<br />
<br />
But for the average LDoN warrior, 10 DPS is nothing to laught at.<br />
Specially if you can still get the job done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still i am very puzzled by Brael's discoveries.<br />
Even if it turns out  Anger3 &gt; Ykesha the DPS difference is still a factor.<br />
However if Brael found something, then it is a no brainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I understand Brael, he's suggesting that spells that are not pure hate scale with the level of the mob. He's saying that because of this scaling, at a certain point against tough mobs, yeksha is actually *more* hate than even Anger III, which of course is difficult to test definatively (hmmm. An 8-hour parce on a mob that might one-round you, anyone?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've often felt that there was more to stun that a simple pure hate value.  It always seems to generate a &quot;frenzy&quot; aggro akin to sit aggro or low health.  Just a gut feeling, nothing to back it up other than my own experience and observations.<br />
<br />
Personally I like a mix of stun and hate.  If the weap already has stun then pure hate is what I'll add.  But not so much for more or less hate, for less push as most stuns have a pushback of 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anger III does not suck.  There are those that feel Ykesha is more aggro on high level mobs, but regardless of whether that is true or not, A3 is a very good proc that will help your aggro a ton.  The &quot;A3 Sucks&quot; talk is just airheads jumping on the bandwagon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">After reading that linked post, it seems to be saying that ykesha &gt; a3 only in high-end GoD zones.

Brutul, that quote there came from Frodlin.  I don't quite consider him an airhead and certainly not a bandwagon follower.<br />
<br />
Granted, I don't own any yak or anger proces yet as i don't have the points, but if he's convinced that A3 has issues then theres gotta be something out there that made him start thinking that way.</div></div><hr />

It's not that anger 3 has issues, it's still good, just stun aggro is overpowered heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fact is, both augs work pretty darn well. If you don't have any, ykesha is cheap, so buy it. If you don't like seeing resist messages, or you really like to hear that little &quot;ding&quot; sound, or you're all kinds of anal about pushback, buy anger III.<br />
<br />
If you have a3, it's highly unlikely to be worth the hassle / loss of points / pp  to sell it back for yaks. Neither sucks OR blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I ain't jumping on the bandwagon, (and one of those quotes up there is mine).  I've been saying that pure hate sucks for awhile now.  <br />
<br />
Aside from my own personal reasons, I also have some l33t inside infoz, but they haven't been disclosed to the public yet, so I can't share.<br />
<br />
But really, use whatever you want, I don't care.  Just don't start crying later cuz you've wasted your life with anger 3 and never bothered to look at anything else :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know exactly why Frodlin says it sucks.  He told me.  It doesn't suck though, it doesn't suck at all.  Stun may be better, but that doesn't mean it's not a very useful proc to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyhow, augs are removable, and refundable. Just try it out if you're having doubts. No need to 'have to' trust peoples words if you don't want to.</div></div><hr />

Im not a hard core raider and dont plan on doing high end content anytime soon...<br />
<br />
But it doesnt scale to content, it scales to level.<br />
Hell!<br />
Everything I tank is somewhere in the 68-70ish levels now.<br />
<br />
I am happy with my current hate setup for most situations, but they dont build beastlords like they used to. *Splat!*<br />
<br />
Seriously considering tinkering with it, but to be honest, it will be very very difficult to tell which is better.<br />
Both procs are damned good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anger 3 does not suck.  It's very good aggro.  Ykesha produces comparable and possibly superior aggro on higher level mobs in addition to actually adding some DPS.  So in some situations Ykesha is superior.  It's also cheaper.  I have anger 3 on my DB and ykesha on my EoE just to test it out and I have absolutely no complaints so far.  Even if we assume that stun aggro is set at 450 or whatever, DB + EoE + A3 x2 + call of fire or some other stun imbue proc + WA5 + CE = bigtime overkill when it comes to aggro.  I probably won't remove my existing A3 proc and replace it with a 2nd ykesha but I see no reason to get a 2nd anger proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">An interesting question came up earlier, but got passed over.<br />
<br />
Brael suggested that, for a level 65 warrior, ykesha &gt; a3 for mobs of level 65+.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that, for a level 70 warrior, ykesha &gt; a3 for mobs of level 70+? or 65+??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think I'll wait until some hard facts are posted. Rumors abound and people just hop on the bandwagon, believing that stun ranks with level because someone well known says it is so... no offense, but just because someone has a million post count doesn't mean they know the Devs. Has anyone *really* tested this? Are there parses? Not to mention parsing useful unbiased data in this situation would be extremely difficult.<br />
<br />
I have read the A3 vs Ykesha thread and it leaves WAY too much open to guesswork.... how do we know what modifiers a moss snake has when it is aggroed? or any other mob for that matter? the fact is, without knowing the exact functions used when something is &quot;aggroed&quot;, we can't do much more than assume, if we don't do lengthly parses. Which I have not seen. It seems to be mostly guesswork and theory, and that theory can be challenged by the fact that every warrior I talk to who has used both augs will tell me that A3 is superior for aggro. And not by a slight margin either.<br />
<br />
I personally will stick with pure aggro, it has never failed me in the past and I don't see why it would start now. Stun procs have never seemed amazing to me. If the anger augs cost more, theres a reason for it. <br />
<br />
I dunno about you but I've never pulled aggro off a BoW with a GBoS...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If Ykesha is more aggro than Anger 3 then it is better in every possible way.  It is not situational because Ykesha is cheaper and it does more damage.<br />
<br />
But so far I've yet to see any compelling reason to believe that stun works in some really weird way that makes it more effective on mobs with more HPs.  I have pestilence shock which does 75 damage + stun and I have never noticed it behaving any different whether I'm figthing a LDoN normal mob or an uber whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best of both worlds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If the anger augs cost more, theres a reason for it.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, and the splitblade of destruction costs more, and drops off a higher level, harder mob than the Copper Hammer of Striking, so alas, your logic kinda falls apart quickly.</div></div><hr />

Not sure i buy into this at all.  Sorry.  I've Got 3 weapons atm.<br />
<br />
GBoS + 125 yak (dps aggro)<br />
BoC + anger3<br />
OSoW + anger3<br />
<br />
I've tanked all over PoP (minus time) ... done GoD trials up into ikkinz ... and been in most open zones (the higher lv ones) in OoW.  I can tell a very very noticable decrease in aggro when swapping to duel stun vs EB/Anger3.  When you group with high aggro generating classes it really is as different as nice and day.  We're not talking just xp groups ... but also raid targets going all the way up to 75+ in level.<br />
<br />
I will agree, though, that for 75% or more of the warriors out there quad stun + WA5 is &quot;enough&quot;.  For me, though, it isnt.  When you're grouping with rogs/wizards who average 350dps in xp groups and necros who are dotting for 1.5-2.5k a tick ... stun procs just plain dont hold up.<br />
<br />
When i see &quot;Target's face contorts with rage&quot; I know my aggro is locked.  When i see &quot;Target is struck w/ force of ykesha&quot; i know there is still a chance that i'll be losing my aggro to high dps classes and an overly quick slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I just wanted to add in my own theory which I think people may have missed:<br />
<br />
Even the GOD of War can't pick a favorite, why should we?:<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek (Plane of Time)<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord has:<br />
Effect: Anger<br />
1: Stun(0.00 sec/68)<br />
2: Decrease Hitpoints by 100<br />
3: Increase Hate by 650<br />
Type: Combat <br />
<br />
Rallos Zek the Warlord (Plane of Tactics)<br />
Blade of War has:<br />
Effect: Enraging Blow<br />
1: Increase Hate by 700<br />
Type: Combat <br />
<br />
Seriously though, it seems to me that the warrior weapons that drop in the end of Pop and GoD expansions all get a stun/DD component as well as a hate component in some instances.  <br />
<br />
The hate level a warrior needs really depends on their situation.  I raid a lot these days, so my Blade of Carnage and Greatblade of Storms both have anger3 augs.  When play my group I find this to be probably a little overkill, however I can say that every now and again it still isn't enough.<br />
<br />
Before my augments, I had trouble keeping aggro off my necro who would double dot (900dmg/tick range) towards the end of the fight, sometimes sooner.  My druid could pull aggro off me from a couple of chain nukes.  I added in an anger3 aug and now my necro almost always landed those two dots and stayed aggro free.  Working in another anger3 aug and moving up to WA5 I now unload on the necro (1300dmg/tick plus), snare at 97% mob health with the druid then chain nuke all while the enchanter slowed and started chain nuking as well.  Yup, every once in a while the druid draws aggro or the necro may as well, but once every few hours of chain pulling isn't much.<br />
<br />
I used to strive to do some DPS while maintaining aggro, but being able to maintain aggro while the other classes open up is much more important.  I can see a significant leap in their DPS, which makes for drastic improvements for the whole group.<br />
<br />
Personally, I say as a warrior get as much aggro generation as you can.  With the ability to remove augs without destroying them as well as being able to sell them back, feel free to experiment.  Then sit back, relax (kinda) and enjoy your mob slaughters as you see the 3k+ spell crits fly by from your groupmates all while the mob stays glued to you.  But, don't be suprised when the day comes that someone pulls that mob right off you and you frantically try to get it back, causing you to begin the hunt again for aggro upgrades....   I know I am always humbled by some wizzie on the raid who peels the mob off me come the 10% health mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">When i see &quot;Target's face contorts with rage&quot; I know my aggro is locked.

<br />
The reason that Brael's tests are important is because for every one of these anecdotes, there is a counter one, like mine, where I felt that EB wasn't any more solid than what I was using prior to it (Anarchy).<br />
<br />
You can't judge this stuff off feel.  You can make your own decisions on what you want to used based upon feel, but you can't state facts off it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Then i wont state it as fact but i know this much:  in groups where i am having trouble holding aggro i bag my stun-gun and load up my blade of carnage.  When i do this, my aggro problems go out the window.  This isnt a one time occurence.<br />
<br />
Why is this?  14/18 mainhand produces more dps and dps aggro than a 15/20.  The answer then, is in the procs themselves:  duel stun vs duel raw hate.  I always start out my groups with GBoS and OSoW for greater dps and group efficiency.  If my group is putting out some hardcore aggro then i bag the stungun for my BoC.  It afterall, in the groups best interest for me to have the strongest possible aggro in said circumstances so that they dont have to hold back.<br />
<br />
Can i say beyond any mathematical reasonable doubt that anger3 &gt; ykesha in all circumstances? No.  But every single experience i have had in the last 6 months of playing with it points to anger3 being significantly higher aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well Brael's tests convinced me that if nothing else, ykesha is close enough in aggro to anger 3 that it's worth trying.  I have anger 3 on DB and I put ykesha on EoE.  Maybe a 2nd anger 3 would be slightly more aggro, maybe not.  What I do know is the aggro is so good that I don't care really.  Personally, his reasoning makes sense to me.  A debuff or a stun has the potential to prevent a lot more damage and/or spell effects on a higher level mob than it does on a lower level mob.<br />
<br />
Another thing worth mentioning is that when anger procs initially went in A2 was 200 hate and A3 was 300 hate.  Everyone used Ykesha because it was obvious that Ykesha was more aggro.  It was glaringly obvious.  At 600 hate now for A3 it is close enough that it would require parsing to tell the difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm. Nice try, but the only reason Splitblade &quot;costs&quot; more is because it looks cool and its price is driven by the EQ community. Anger aug price is set by the game. As far as the EQ economy is concerned Splitblade could be worth 4copper.<br />

<br />
A debuff, sure. A stun? If you are fighting anything remotely high level its not gonna land anyway. As far as hoping that the stun component will actually stun a mob... I've seen my DBOW actually &quot;stun&quot; exp mobs maybe 10 times since I got the damn thing =P</div></div><hr />

What level mobs and which zones are you talking about, apolyon?  Are there certain mobs/zones where you don't have a problem, which could support the idea that ykesha scales with mob hp?</div></div><hr />

Anger 3 doesnt suck ive used it on the same weapon as ykesha and heres no comparison.  The fact is that brael is an idiot and trying to prove something based on his own assumptions which are in fact not true.  Ykesha hate is about 350 per proc compared to 600 for anger 3.  If you dont need aggro by all means go with ykesha, but there isnt a high end warrior in the game who couldnt use more aggro.</div></div><hr />

Anger3 looks to be 600 hate, no matter how you twist it.  Stun's agro may depend on various factors, and sometimes you may end up doing better progress with a stun proc, whereas the hate proc is a set value that is better most of the time.<br />

There's a reason that in Luclin and early PoP that I was able to tank all those mobs dual wielding Gnoll Hide Lariats.  There's a reason that with Bazu bellow, you cannot pull a mob off of a Paladin who casts cease on it, that you must use a combinatin of Bellow, melee and procs.

I'm sorry buddy, but thats simply not true. If that were true I would have no problems ever tanking with any of my stun weapons, of which there are several. And I do have huge problems any time I switch out for these.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, you might contribute alot to these forums, but you are dead wrong here. I don't care where your info is coming from, I've been playing this game a long time and I used stun proc weapons for almost a year on 60+ mobs... I think I would have noticed something.<br />
<br />
The entire argument you are posing here has a massive flaw... its complete speculation on Braels part as to what the real function for aggro generation is... he may have much of it correct, but there are also several flaws in his theory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DO NOT TRUST BLINDLY LUCY !<br />
<br />
Anger = 650Haste + Stun + DD = So in theory = 650 + 450 (old rule) + 50 = 1100+ Hate<br />
And any person with a Darkblade can tell you its proc is NOT 2 Times that of an Anger3/EB<br />
<br />
So now as for stun = 1300 dunno, will test it, got a Halberd of Endless Pain with Stun + Ykesha.<br />

Uhh..<br />
<br />
I use GBoS in primary BoC secondary when aggro isnt a problem, and reverse my blades to BoC primary and GBoS secondary when I begin to have issues.<br />
<br />
This works for LDoN, Plane of Fire, GoD, and OoW.<br />
<br />
Force shock does not beat out Enraging blow.<br />
In anyway shape or form.<br />
It is not close, switching BoC to primary fixes aggro problems over GBoS which has a superior ratio.<br />

Yes, clearly high level paladin spells are the best way to test out and prove the effectiveness of warrior augments and procs, which are not those paladin spells.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, I don't think I'm catching you here.   At issue is something quite simple.   If a spell has a stun component, then the only variables are &quot;does it also do direct damage&quot;, &quot;does it contain a knockback&quot; and &quot;How long is the stun for?&quot;.   <br />
<br />
It's been shown pretty solidly that an &quot;attempt to stun&quot; gives a fixed amount of hate regardless of duration of the stun.   The next variable is &quot;how much hate knockback has?&quot;, and finally, &quot;how much hate does a direct damage spell contain?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ykesha is a 0.0 second stun with a 100 or 125 point DD that works up to level 55.<br />
<br />
Those are the only components of stuns, which is why I said to use cease.   It's the shortest duration stun component in the Paladin arsenal, it has no knockback, and it does no direct damage, and it has a maximum level of 55 on who the stun works on.   <br />
<br />
Now, I hope you're following me here... that means that is has less components of hate than Ykesha, because with Ykesha, you have the *same* stun as Cease (identical, there is NO difference whatsoever) but you add 100 or 125 DD to the formula.   The reason to use cease is really simple, because you can cast it... avoiding any unreliable waiting for proc and melee noise to interfere with your signal, you cannot &quot;cast&quot; ykesha.  You can &quot;cast&quot; 600 hate (essentially identical on the first tick as Anger 3).   I suppose you could go one step further and have a warrior perform the same thing with a Forlorn Totem of Rolfron Zek (Holy Might, very similar to Ykesha with a Stun + DD component), but it's just as easy to use cease.   <br />
<br />
Anyhow, the obfuscation is amusing because &quot;you know better&quot;.  One thing that's been the greatest truth in EQ is that people &quot;feel&quot; things completely wrong, and when analyzed their 'feel' is shown to be completely incorrect.  In other words, you hardly use your BoC and GBoS in a controlled environment.   Your little exp group has so many different factors going on that it's not possible to state that because the coincedence of your experience groups ceasing their retarded behaviour when you equip your BoC in the main hand that it's a causal relationship.   <br />
<br />
RULE NUMBER ONE:   Correllation does not equal causation.    <br />
<br />
RULE NUMBER TWO:  Anecdotal evidence under completely uncontrolled circumstances is not sufficient to &quot;prove&quot; anything.<br />
<br />
RULE NUMBER THREE:  Setting up impossible to meet criteria (Casting Ykesha) is not a valid method of discounting the fact that a lesser hate spell (cease) has more hate than a 3rd spell (Anger, or Bazu bellow).</div></div><hr />

Actually technically that statement is incorrect.  Only 2 variables with a certain degree of correlation can be said to have a causation (R squared in statistical terms if memory serves).  So a subset of that statement is in fact true (depending on your tolerance set for correlation).  Not trying to be a wiseass but that was kinda a blanket statement.<br />
<br />
Also, subjectivity DOES have some value as a source of inspiration/investigation, you correct in asserting it not the basis of fact (a point missed on this board at least 4-5 times a day).</div></div><hr />

100 to 150 (or 125 to 187.5)  plus another 20 for the push back hate on top of what ever the value of stun is is negligable?  Thats somewhere from 120 to 207.5 + a value already accepted to be &gt; 400 hate. <br />
<br />
if stun is...<br />
400 hate then its 520 to 607.5 hate (a lil better than A3 for the GOOD yak proc on.. if its the right mob).<br />
500 hate then its 620 to 707.5 hate (getting into EB land)<br />
600 hate then its 720 to 807.5 hate (mmmm mmm gewd)<br />

We already know stun aggro scales to the mob.  How it scales remains unknown to us mear mortals.  Some say level, some say hitpoints... not even sure I care how (although it'd be nice to know).  <br />

FWIW last night I was with a super-high dps group (high-end GoD geared mag, wiz, ranger, necro) tanking with my GBoS+Yak and BoC+A3. Obviously I was severely outclassed and doing everything I could to hold aggro. I played around swapping the two back and forth. In the end I settled on the GBoS in mainhand. Provided I got a decent string of procs early in the fight, I didn't run much risk of losing aggro. With the BoC in main hand, even a couple of &quot;rage&quot; messages was no guarantee the JoS wielding ranger wouldn't have aggro back within 5 seconds. I realize this is all anecdotal and worthless, but at least it's from the other side of the fence :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Go against a stun with Bazu Bellow and tell me what happens. Make sure you do something like shoot an arrow or take a swing first to be sure you're on the list. Either way it won't matter, you'll never take the aggro. There hasnt' been a single person who's fessed up and said it. All there has been is excuses and anecdotes &quot;I feel&quot; and &quot;why would they&quot; and all sorts of other nonsense.<br />
Now there's something worth playing with.  While I'll never discount a warrior I respect's &quot;feel&quot; for something (theres a reason they &quot;feel&quot; and dismissing it is a mistake) the 600 hate spell we warriors get not pulling aggro off of 1 single paladin stun is pretty easy to test.  I trust Frod's findings.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to try the 3rd party pulling, pally casting 1 cease, warrior hitting incite then waiting to see how many ticks pass before the mob gets mad at the warrior.  That would give you an idea of how much hate it really takes.<br />
<br />
Now there is something else that is never discussed in these conversations about aggro on this board (that I've seen): how aggro decays over time, if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Lochr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I'm very skeptical of the stun &gt;= 600 hate argument also. I'll bring up a different argument though: the Ethereal Strike/Ethereal Stun proc lines.<br />
<br />
From Lucy, for Ethereal Strike:<br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 75 <br />
2:  Stun(0.00 sec/65) <br />
3:  Decrease Hate by 200 <br />
<br />
Ethereal Stun's the same, without the DD component.<br />
<br />
If stun was &gt;= 600 hate, then the characters with valorous quarterstaffs would, in effect be wielding Taunting Blow weapons. In practice, these often go to beastlords and rangers, since have good stats, and don't draw aggro. Featherwood bows are relatively popular choices for rangers, and I don't see evidence that they are mad hating machines with these versus ones with stonewood bows.<br />
<br />
For those interested, Onyx Gavels have ethereal stun and are commonly available in the bazaar, or could be easily pharmed yourself by doing the PoJ trial where it drops. <br />
<br />
Incite (I don't have bazu bellow or the GoD version) demonstrably decreases in effectiveness when used outside of melee range. Incite seemed to be a great pulling tool when it first came out, since at the time I had an idol or something in the range slot and hated swapping items just to pull. It just didn't have the same level of hate as shooting at it and then incite. Didn't even need to do damage. I went back to using a bow to pull, and have never regretted it. That may explain your 120 hate cap theory on initial pull, Frodlin.<br />
<br />
As to pulling, I find it much easier to hold aggro if I'm the one who deals the initial damage. Brutal had a long set of parses with his cleric in FP showing that there's a marked bonus to being the one to do the first damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Incite (I don't have bazu bellow or the GoD version) demonstrably decreases in effectiveness when used outside of melee range.<br />
I've always noticed that life sucks when the first thing I do to a mob is Incite.  Even when someone else pulls, if I dont try to damage the mob first my Incite seems to be worthless and I chase mobs all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Frod.  I do not trust the incite line as a valid use for numerical testing as it has ALWAYS been moderately bugged in how it works.  Like i said the difference btw EB + anger3 and FS/yak is as clear as night and day to both myself and every xp group and raid i've ever been on.<br />
<br />
Running some straight up anger3 vs yak (like the one i mentioned) would be much more valid to me than saying:<br />
<br />
baze bellow = 600aggro<br />
anger3 = 600aggro<br />
baze bellow cannot pull aggro off a stun<br />
therefore stun &gt; anger3<br />
<br />
The problems are that baze bellow and anger3 have never been conclusively proven to be equivalent and that you are NOT using a yak/FS proc but rather a paladin stun.  For all you know warrior yak/FS proc stun may be capped at 400 while paladin stun aggro works for 1k.  OR that bellow is still indeed bugged and not giving the full amt of aggro.<br />
<br />
If you're going to compare yak/FS proc aggro to EP/A3 proc aggro then compare the 2 of them.  Don't use roughly assumed &quot;similar&quot; examples and assume that the rules carry over.  To me the gap btw EB and stun is noticably large.  At one point i assume you noticed it too, but somewhere along the way you got sidetracked.</div></div><hr />

Did an 8 hour 15 aa grind in fire with some folks from our servers top guild and i did not have the aggro problems i sometimes had with the dual anger3 setup (i cant count the times i have said &quot;I got wa5, 305 dex and 4 hate procs,46 percent haste and all the extra swings i can get-im doing all i can and yer still taking aggro&quot;) Shory still took aggro a couple times but i think he is the 2nd best geared monk on the server, what can ya do. aggro while trash tanking on raids seems the same if not better and  i seem to have little problems pulling aggro and keeping it off the tanks using anger3 setups (from sews+a3 to BF/SEM+2 a3) where before it was harder to keep agro from bouncing back and forth after i taunted off them. i also talked to a RL pally friend about stuns and he agrees that the aggro of the stun does scale, we arent positive on what factors are involved but he still uses low level stuns on mobs to help lock aggro on mezzed mobs and stuff like that. if the aggro was a constant number then either low level stuns would be ineffective for aggro at higher levels or they would be so much aggro at lower levels that a pally couldnt possibly lose aggro to teh lower dps of lower level classes. rob tells me that his experiences indicate the former is true rather than the latter so it seems that stun aggro does scale, altho im not convinced as to the factors involved (ie lvl or the stunner, lvl of the stunee etc) and it does at least for me seem to be a good alternative to anger3</div></div><hr />

No I'm saying that a subset of all casual relationships have a correlation factor (I think its covariance...derived via statistical process) that based on your tolerance (3-6 sigmas or standard deviations) level is determined to be  either significant (correlated) or not significant (uncorrelated).  This is pure math...and not a subjective observation on my part.  Your statement was blanket: it implied that just because two variables appear to have a casual relationship they arent correlated...I'm saying that:<br />
<br />
1. That whether they are or arent is based on the tolerance conditions you set (and as you said based on real data being processed)<br />
2. That there is a possibility of them being correlated (aka a subset exists)..actually almost all variables are correlated statistically.  Its the DEGREE of correlation against tolerance that matters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Hmmm, this is a good thread.  Like most warriors, I want the best agro set up possible.  I am a firm believer  that you cannot have too much agro and though I am loaded for agro (Bloodfrezny, Obsidian Scimatar of War, 2x Anger III, and WA 3), I would swap out my anger III augs in a heartbeat if it gets shown there is better agro to be had.  <br />
<br />
I would like to see a little more definition in regards to what poeple mean by good agro.  Are you talking about holding it 100% of time against 100% mobs (I do not think so can't imagine this being possible due to random nature of processes).  Also, there is a big difference with agro at begining of fight and at the end of a fight.   Warriors tend to build agro over time.  I believe that it will be shown that the issue of Anger vs stun will turn out to be quite complex, as many factors and circumstances are coming into play.  <br />
<br />
My antcedotal experience shows that I hold agro very well, and  if I am SA to a pally, I have to put my 1 hs weapons away because I too often draw agro of of them before the mob dies.  If we do enough mobs, the pally goes OOM struggling to keep agro.  The only class that I have any agro issues with are slowers, especially and chanters sometimes, especially if they have resists.  <br />
<br />
However, this observation probably has very little value since I am not teaming up with many high end pallys.  <br />

*edit my tests are in no way intended to infer that yak/stun is useless and will not let you hold aggro.  I'm having my necro friend do some of his worst (same combo every single time at the same time) to hopefully show that there is definitely merit in EB and anger3.  This isn't my average group setting.  Running at very high aggro atm, but the necro isnt chain snaring and using every trick.  Simply running his hardcore high aggro dps without FD'ing.  EB/anger3 won't make your aggro invincible, but it will level the playing field in extreme circumstances where a simple stun proc won't cut it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">the proof, as they say, is in the pudding.<br />
<br />
Umm, wait a minute here.  I'm generally a fairly skeptical person by nature, but I find Brael's and now Frod's data to be more than simply &quot;coincidental.&quot;  When the time comes, I'll certainly be trying out both, but I certainly agree with the data that supports aggression levels scaling with the mobs levels (hit points?  No idea, that'd be a hard one to test, but generally, greater level = greater hit points so it's somewhat moot).  As mentioned previously (or in another thread, I don't remember which), hybrids have been using lower tier spells for god knows how long to achieve agro far superior to that of their upper end spells.  The higher spells generally have a superior duration, damage, or level range component, yet the lower end ones still remain the best source of aggression (Disease Cloud anyone?).  Obviously, this leans towards the position that debuff (including stuns, which are a form of debuff in the eyes of a mob, who could be losing damage output while stunned) components of a spell increase in power based on the victim's level.<br />
<br />
That's not to say the current calculations for agro based on spell levels, effects, mob levels, etc. isn't broken, or at least illogical, because I have always been of the mindset that a higher level spell or ability should have more aggression tied to it than a lower level one.  For example, if a Paladin cast their highest level Stun, the additional manacost penalty should be balanced with a greater benefit (higher agro, longer stun, more damage if applicable, etc.)  Unfortunately, this proves to not be the case, but that certainly seems to be the most logical route to program things.<br />
<br />
That said, to lay claim that Apo's test is in anyway proof is ridiculous.  You cannot have your cake and eat it too, especially in a data-centric medium such as agro discussions on The Steel Warrior.  There are WAY too many variables in his test to prove anything.  <br />
<br />
1) His primary weapons were not identical, and while you may claim the difference is negligible, the fact is any variance in a test that is this subject to scrutiny is not acceptable - after all, his method for testing &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; is whether he lost agro AT ALL, and a minor difference between weapons, even that of a few delay or damage, is significant enough in it's own right.<br />
<br />
2) There is no data regarding the number of procs for each fight, nor at what intervals they happened.  <br />
<br />
3) Unless the necro was a robot, the possibility for delays in casting (or rushed casting) any given number of times is significant.  Again, with the variance in the testing method (losing agro or not), this minor thing will mean the difference between &quot;agro&quot; or &quot;no agro.&quot;  Having an earlier or later cast would affect time spent building agro on the Warrior, chance for procs, etc.<br />
<br />
4) As Brael mentioned, there is no data for swing totals per fight, nor damage (since your damage versus the Necro's damage gives and idea of generated hate over time; not so much your damage, but the Necro's).<br />
<br />
5) As already stated and all but proven by Brael and others, with Stun scaling with level, it may very well have less effect on these mobs (2+ levels under you) than it would on mobs even or higher than you. <br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
All that said, Anger effects may in fact produce more hate for the mobs at PoFire Tables, but you can't simply discount all the previous numerical data that has been posted prior by saying, &quot;I lost agro less fighting 200 mobs, therefore Anger is better.&quot;<br />
<br />
I realize that Apo never made claim that Stun procs sucked or anything, but I don't think you can expect to run a &quot;test&quot; this influential and expect it to be taken as anything close to factual.  I'm always open for more data on any EQ-related subjects, the more the better in my opinion, but you need a stable base and methodology or all your results are null and void.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of testing something more substantially and numerically similar; such as Frod mentioned, stuns and Incite-line abilities; or identically wielding/AAed/Level Warriors doing process testing (much more difficult test, granted.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">I suppose I had that novel there coming.  Hehe oh well.<br />
<br />
I'm still of the opinion that sterilzed test situations are not the same as the real world with all its messy uncontrollable varibles.  I honestly dont care which is truely numerically better.  They are close enough for the difference to be nominal. You can throw as much logic and math as you want at what we observe/parse as players, until we've seen the source code that computes all these numbers we dont know exactly how it works.  Speculate all you want, unless you look at the actual formula expressed in the code you can never be 100% sure.<br />
<br />
I really really really do care what works in game, with other humans playing, messing up, laughing, and generally having a good time.  So far, no one has said anything to prove one is that much better than the other.  They both work great!!<br />
<br />
EDIT: IF Yak owned A3/EB so much like some boast, it would be so obvious that this convo would never happen.  Now that level 70 is the cap and there even higher level mobs we can even begin to dectect any real difference.  This of course assumes that stun is ramping up so high that its putting A3/EB to shame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't agree more :)  I think some (many... most?) people have a tendency to want a single solution for all their problems.  In the case of Warrior agro generation, they want to know that their setup is the best, hands down.  I think this new information, if nothing else, shows there's a little more to it than the &quot;optimal&quot; setup.  I for one, can see many situations already where one would be better than the other, such (as mentioned) pushing requirements, melee mitigation (where proc damage would be more useful), etc.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's very good to know.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, I don't think I'm catching you here.   At issue is something quite simple.   If a spell has a stun component, then the only variables are &quot;does it also do direct damage&quot;, &quot;does it contain a knockback&quot; and &quot;How long is the stun for?&quot;.   <br />
<br />
It's been shown pretty solidly that an &quot;attempt to stun&quot; gives a fixed amount of hate regardless of duration of the stun.   The next variable is &quot;how much hate knockback has?&quot;, and finally, &quot;how much hate does a direct damage spell contain?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ykesha is a 0.0 second stun with a 100 or 125 point DD that works up to level 55.<br />
<br />
Those are the only components of stuns, which is why I said to use cease.   It's the shortest duration stun component in the Paladin arsenal, it has no knockback, and it does no direct damage, and it has a maximum level of 55 on who the stun works on.   <br />
<br />
Now, I hope you're following me here... that means that is has less components of hate than Ykesha, because with Ykesha, you have the *same* stun as Cease (identical, there is NO difference whatsoever) but you add 100 or 125 DD to the formula.   The reason to use cease is really simple, because you can cast it... avoiding any unreliable waiting for proc and melee noise to interfere with your signal, you cannot &quot;cast&quot; ykesha.  You can &quot;cast&quot; 600 hate (essentially identical on the first tick as Anger 3).   I suppose you could go one step further and have a warrior perform the same thing with a Forlorn Totem of Rolfron Zek (Holy Might, very similar to Ykesha with a Stun + DD component), but it's just as easy to use cease.   <br />
<br />
Anyhow, the obfuscation is amusing because &quot;you know better&quot;.  One thing that's been the greatest truth in EQ is that people &quot;feel&quot; things completely wrong, and when analyzed their 'feel' is shown to be completely incorrect.  In other words, you hardly use your BoC and GBoS in a controlled environment.   Your little exp group has so many different factors going on that it's not possible to state that because the coincedence of your experience groups ceasing their retarded behaviour when you equip your BoC in the main hand that it's a causal relationship.   <br />

And I have a few things to ask of you.<br />
<br />
If stun is 1300 hate. Why is it when my rogue buddy in fire procs twice in a row off his Ykesha augged dagger, I take aggro back with one proc from BoW and a regular incite? Technically he should have around 2600 hate, and incite + BoW are barely half of that. These mobs are in castle 2, and conned red to me...<br />
<br />
And no, he didnt use any anti-aggro skills, as he wasn't even being played at the time.. his owner was playing 4 toons.<br />
<br />
And for my last question. If what you say is true, the aggro a proc from a DBOW would generate over 2000 hate itself. Why then can two procs from a BoW or BoC usually take aggro back from the DB user?<br />
<br />
Seems to me that even though I'm not &quot;parsing&quot; the data, these scenarios are still quite valid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">That's not to say the current calculations for agro based on spell levels, effects, mob levels, etc. isn't broken, or at least illogical, because I have always been of the mindset that a higher level spell or ability should have more aggression tied to it than a lower level one. For example, if a Paladin cast their highest level Stun, the additional manacost penalty should be balanced with a greater benefit (higher agro, longer stun, more damage if applicable, etc.) Unfortunately, this proves to not be the case, but that certainly seems to be the most logical route to program things.<br />
You're thinking about it the wrong way.  For 10 classes, spell aggro is a penalty, not a benefit.  It's been scaled down at lower levels deliberately to be fair to those classes.  From that point of view, the way spell aggro works IS logical.  The 3 classes that value spell aggro are anomalies.<br />
<br />
Think about it this way:  if 400-1000 hate was generated whenever a level 1 cleric cast Stun on an orc centurion, or whenever a level 16 wizard cast Force Strike on an aviak darter, then we would have known about this amazing aggro generation 5 years ago.  Those spells would have been death sentences for those classes at those levels in any non-trivial group encounter.  In terms of level 16 aggro generation capabilities, 1000 hate would feel like infinite hate.<br />
<br />
In reality, those stun spells do not produce unmanageable hate at those levels at all.  In reality, the level 14 Healing spell (100 hp heal) outaggros Force Strike at level 16.  So clearly stun aggro is scaled way down at low levels, perhaps to less than 1/10th of the aggro that it gives Apolyon in PoFire (using the same Force Strike spell).  And I'm sure young wizards and clerics throughout Norrath appreciate this scaling very much. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple answer?  Because you don't each start from the same level of aggression.<br />
<br />
Using your example from Fire...<br />
<br />
Prior to the procs:<br />
Your total hate = 3000<br />
Rogue's total hate = 1400<br />
<br />
After first rogue proc, mob still on you:<br />
Your total hate = 3000<br />
Rogue's total hate = 2700 [1400 (start) + 1300 (proc)]<br />
<br />
After second rogue proc, mob on rogue:<br />
Your total hate = 3000<br />
Rogue's total hate = 4000 [1400 (start) + 1300 (proc) + 1300 (proc)]<br />
<br />
After your Incite, mob on rogue:<br />
Your total hate = 3470 [3000 (start) + 470 (incite)]<br />
Rogues total hate = 4000 [1400 (start) + 1300 (proc) + 1300 (proc)]<br />
<br />
After your EB, mob on you:<br />
Your total hate = 4170 [3000 (start) + 470 (incite) + 700 (EB)]<br />
Rogues total hate = 4000 [1400 (start) + 1300 (proc) + 1300 (proc)]<br />
<br />
Seems pretty logical to me.<br />
<br />
The same rule applies to your DBotW / BoC example too, just different numbers.  You also answered your own question in there when you said &quot;usually.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't want to get into a flaming war or anything, just stating the obvious and what you might've forgotten to consider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what you're saying is each proc of force strike is worth more than 2 anger3s?  or worth just under 2 EBs?  Fucking ridiculous is all i can say.  Fucking ridiculous.<br />
<br />
1300 aggro on yak compared to 600 on anger3?  Seriously this is getting more and more retarded by the minute.<br />

By some people's leet conclusions the GBoS ... or better yet the copperhammer of striking is bettr aggro than a bloodfrenzy or a BoWar in the highend game.  I'd love to hear someone explain THAT to me.  Stun is a viable tanking augment/proc, but you generally have to trade off a bit of aggro for a + to dps.

Like I said before, your theory has massive flaws. You assume that a paladin spell is exactly the same as a proc with a similar effect. Where is the evidence that this is true in the least? <br />
<br />
I've said not once, but twice that the Paladin stun &quot;cease&quot; was lesser than Ykesha, not the same.   These things are incredibly easy to parse.   All you need to do is get a weapon to proc once.   Then have a another person melee until they've taken aggro from you, then subtract the melee that you've done from the melee that they've done, and left over is *voila* the hate of the proc or spell.   <br />
<br />
It's been done... again and again and again.   I've done it, Brael's done it.   No one's shown anything even remotely close to the completeness of the tests performed who's arguing the &quot;OMG NO WAY&quot; side.   Basically, the BEST tests have been a totally uncontrolled series of tests in an exp group scenario HOPING that a necro, cleric, and shaman cause the same events to occur at the same time without dot crits or focus effects changing the hate in the spells (incidentally, necros are about the worst class in EQ to &quot;test hate&quot; against, particularly those with critical and burning affliction based foci since DoT aggro is completely messed up and there's such variance on a per tick basis with how much damage is being done).   Not only that, the warrior wasnt' using the same weapons, nor is there ANY indication of when this occurred within each fight, and a lot of other variables.<br />
<br />
Hi, I don't know how good you are at testing things, but repeatability is a really good goal to have.    One proc, then the subtraction of melee damage to gain aggro and subtracting the differences is a solid and repeatable method of determining aggro.  It turns out that the data is very similar every single time (within a 10ish percent range).    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Explain to me why you know better. You have nothing to back up half of the theories you are leaning on for your proposal here.

<br />
Maybe if you took the time to test every one of your assumptions, I would believe you. For now...<br />
<br />
Not only has this been extensively tested, but it's been explained on multiple occasions how it's done and linked to this very thread.   The fact that you're too lazy to click a hyperlink and read a thread in no way changes the fact that the test has been performed.   <br />
<br />
<br />
...I think I will trust what I have found to be true, by a large margin, for several years.<br />

Technically he should have around 2600 hate, and incite + BoW are barely half of that. These mobs are in castle 2, and conned red to me...<br />
<br />
There's a bazillion reasons why this could occur, not the least of which being that you already had a hate lead over him (note the part where you said that you &quot;take aggro back&quot;, indicating that the 2 Ykesha procs + the melee damage that he did in that round took it from you in the first place), and he surpassed it, not by the full amount of both procs but by anywhere from 4 hate (the minimum required above the top person on the aggro list to make a mob turn to you) to whatever.   You took it back beacue you had an existing lead on hate, which is why you lost it in the first place.<br />
<br />
And for my last question. If what you say is true, the aggro a proc from a DBOW would generate over 2000 hate itself. Why then can two procs from a BoW or BoC usually take aggro back from the DB user?<br />
<br />
Seems to me that even though I'm not &quot;parsing&quot; the data, these scenarios are still quite valid.<br />

They can't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While you're at it i suppose you'll be telling me not to upgrade to a BoW because my GBoS is tehleetzorz.  I have one.  I KNOW what it's aggro capabilies are, and i know that it cant do the things you say it can.<br />

With my weaps, and with my goals, I'm very happy with what I got.  One of these days I'll get Anger III on my off hand.  Hopefully I'll get better weapons before that happens hehe.  This whole thread started out re: a boast that yak &gt; anger3.  Looks like it is in some situations (higher end mobs ramping up stun aggro).  Perhaps on lvl 80 mobs stun pwns all, but i'm a ways off from that.  We're just now getting to meet these mobs.  But at best it appears to be situational... a situation a good lot of us dont see very often.<br />
<br />
Fortunatly, I can recycle my augs and change as I please (weapon augs are the only thing i like out of LDoN).  For me, having 1 unresistable hate spell + 1 stun spell in each hand is the best balance of aggro, push, dps, whatever your goal might be.<br />
<br />
I'd love to know the exact level (if thats what stun aggro ramps up with) stun by itself == A3's 600 hate.  That would be handy to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Yes Cele and i'm sorry.  To you too, Frod, i apologize for losing my cool.  I still don't agree with stun being over 1000 hate, though.  It is arguably &quot;close&quot; to anger3, but they are still in the same ballpark.  If yak were indeed 1100-1300 per proc like you say they are then 3x EB from Bloodfrenzy would not be as good as 2x stun from GBoS.  I guess my point is that somewhere in your tests there is a serious mistake which is accounting for this oddity.<br />
<br />
BF= EB x 3 for 1 minute = 2100 raw hate before any WA<br />
GBoS = Stun x 2 for 1 minute = ?<br />
<br />
If stun were = to 1100-1300 we're looking at a sum total of 2200-2600 hate per minute from procs.  It's a given that BF = best weapon for raw aggro pre-time.  By your calculations the best weapon would actually be BBoTE which is 3 x stun per minute with no WA.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, i'm curious enough about this to try my warrior + slow and no hase w/ aug'd weighted axe vs another warrior with the opposite aug.  I'll run this test tomorrow a dozen or more times and front the plat to the other warrior to move his augs.<br />
<br />
I'll yak aug a weighted axe and have a friend with the same offensives aug an axe with anger3.  Slow both warriors and remove haste to guarantee a proc on swing 1 and have a 3rd party pull a mob.  both warriors hit attack at same time ... who has aggro?  I'll turn on misses etc to make sure both warriors are getting the same amt of swing aggro.<br />
<br />
My money is on the anger3.  If frod is correct, then it should end up on the warrior with yak every single time.<br />
<br />
*edit- i'll run this test in lower PoP, upper PoP, and try to even get a group running to MPG for some action against lv 70 or beyond mobs as well to factor in the scaling of aggro by level.</div></div><hr />

Eventually Sony (or was it still Verant back then?) fixed it, but as I remember it they didn't fix any aggro bug in the zone, they changed the aggro to follow &quot;Kunark aggro&quot; rules.  This was after Velious and Luclin were out and I've seen evidence to suggest (although it's admittedly the &quot;feeling&quot; type of evidence) that most or all expansions change the rules a little bit.<br />
<br />
If Yak is ever better than A3, it is at best situational, possibly limited to certain expansions, with A3 leading in most situations.  While Apolyon's data certainly has too many variables to prove anything specific, I think it's at least safe to say that stun procs don't create twice the aggro of A3.  Maybe Pally stuns do, but Pally stuns may not be the same as proc stuns.  Wasn't there a time when people thought that Anarchy aggro was significantly reduced?  I'm betting that proc stun aggro was reduced.</div></div><hr />

I don't care if you think Cease is the same, worse, or better. The fact is you don't know the number of hate it causes. And by your theory, it would be nearly impossible to ever find out right? Because the level and hp of the mob affect it.<br />
<br />
Ever heard of hate decaying? Hey, what if actual damage dealt to a mob ramps with level? Who the hell knows? Just because you meleed for 600 damage and the proc stopped holding aggro doesn't mean the proc was exactly 600 aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's been done... again and again and again.   I've done it, Brael's done it.   No one's shown anything even remotely close to the completeness of the tests performed who's arguing the &quot;OMG NO WAY&quot; side.   Basically, the BEST tests have been a totally uncontrolled series of tests in an exp group scenario HOPING that a necro, cleric, and shaman cause the same events to occur at the same time without dot crits or focus effects changing the hate in the spells (incidentally, necros are about the worst class in EQ to &quot;test hate&quot; against, particularly those with critical and burning affliction based foci since DoT aggro is completely messed up and there's such variance on a per tick basis with how much damage is being done).   Not only that, the warrior wasnt' using the same weapons, nor is there ANY indication of when this occurred within each fight, and a lot of other variables.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think 200 fights show some evidence. Your own testing related to this topic were not nearly as thorough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi, I don't know how good you are at testing things, but repeatability is a really good goal to have.    One proc, then the subtraction of melee damage to gain aggro and subtracting the differences is a solid and repeatable method of determining aggro.  It turns out that the data is very similar every single time (within a 10ish percent range).<br />
<br />
Not only has this been extensively tested, but it's been explained on multiple occasions how it's done and linked to this very thread.   The fact that you're too lazy to click a hyperlink and read a thread in no way changes the fact that the test has been performed.   <br />
<br />
<br />
I read the thread, I wasn't really impressed. Again, if what you say is true, your testing involving stuns is all invalid anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a bazillion reasons why this could occur, not the least of which being that you already had a hate lead over him (note the part where you said that you &quot;take aggro back&quot;, indicating that the 2 Ykesha procs + the melee damage that he did in that round took it from you in the first place), and he surpassed it, not by the full amount of both procs but by anywhere from 4 hate (the minimum required above the top person on the aggro list to make a mob turn to you) to whatever.   You took it back beacue you had an existing lead on hate, which is why you lost it in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
This occured pretty much on inc, and neither of us had initial aggro from pulling. I got in maybe 2 swings before he procced.<br />
<br />
<br />
They can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go try it, ive done it several times today.<br />
<br />
What you are suggesting is just fucking silly, give it a rest. There is no way in hell 1 Ykesha proc will out aggro 2 A3 procs.</div></div><hr />

According to you (Frodlin), the procs on the GBoS is basically better than his BoC by about 2 Enraging Blows (primary and aug proc better by 1 EB each).  So, what you're saying is that I should expect to see a parse where I remove my 2 Anger 3s, and then start getting aggro noticeably better?  Because that's what you're saying here with stun = 2 EB, and actually removing 2 Anger 3s is being generous compare to the assumption you made.

Finished my epic... added an Anger3 aug(which I already had on my CBS) and bought a Yak aug.  I dunno if I'm just imagining it... but I seem to be pulling aggro MUCH more now then I was before.  I'm not 100% sure which is better... thinking of trading the 2 anger3 augs I have left in and getting Yak augs and seeing how it goes.... not like I have any aggro problems now but /shrug... if it works just as good may as well get the extra DPS ;p</div></div><hr />

There is a lot of behind the scene manipulation that deals with aggro.  A good example would be the well-known proximity aggro.  I can easily conclude kick is worth more than 10000 aggro if I use a mob like say Vallon Zek (Time) to 'test' my aggro theories.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of the unscientificness of apolyons test, it's actually a real wold scenario. He was with a group, he got xp, he showed quite clearly he had &quot;better&quot; aggro with a EB setup in a reasonably consistent environment.  If nothing else, it makes it really hard to believe that stuns are any better than EB/A3 in an ep environment.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, thats the only thing that counts. It's great that a moss snake or a qinimi noc turns after 13 swings + 1 yak after 3 terrors or whatever, but its just not a group situation. Not knowing the code the possibility of additional interactions between group members is extremely high, tainting the real world experience. In addition, all those parses are 100% dependant on Braels swing aggro theory, which seems to hold up, but is difficult to verify in and of itself. <br />

Has anyone tried getting a wizard to come out and compare force shock to terrors, thereby eliminating the swing aggro component and adding a proc vs cast uncertainty?</div></div><hr />

Reading comprehension is a good thing  :D  .  Not once ... not twice ... but three times now i've stated that my group was camped outside C2 in Field2 pulling lv 66-67 mobs from field 2 and lv 68 mobs from within castle 2 ... oh yes and occasional lv 70 named from field 2 (gratz rot loot).<br />
<br />
My tests were far from scientific.  I've stated that several times as well.  I did, however keep the variables pretty much exactly the same for about 4 straight hours with the only difference being stun/stun vs EB/anger3.  If stun were stronger i'd have seen much different results.  If stun were comparable i'd have seen much different results.<br />
<br />
Can we blame my results on the RNG?  Could my fights be wrong and still not indicate anything?  Possibly ... but with 200 base fights over 4  hours all pointing to one possible conclusion it is highly unlikely.  Do with my info what you want (believe/not-believe).<br />

I'll run a more &quot;scientific&quot; test today (reference my previous post) and will test it on 60-70+ mobs throughout PoP, GoD, and OoW.</div></div><hr />

What do you say to real world experience refuting your controlled testing?  <br />
<br />
I know you dont give much credit to the way Apo tested.  I would agree it is not as exact as your methodology for determining an exact number or range of numbers; however, it does reflect the experience of a good lot of warriors playing this game.  It would not be the first time where something that performed one way in a controlled environment ceases (no pun intended) to perform the same way with all the unknown variables of live fire.  With all the possible unknowns that we must deal with in exp groups and raids, the controlled circumstance that rarely occurs in pratice doesnt really seem like an appropriate environment to make a final determination on aggro performance.  While 100 mobs aint as scientific as you might like, its enough for an experienced warrior to get a &quot;feel&quot; for what works for them in their particular quagmire of uncontrolledness.<br />

<br />
This is the only reason i can think of that would explain both apos and frods results.<br />
<br />
I'm not even sure that EoA effects even much came into play here as very little actually testing btw procs themselves has been done ... only things assumed &quot;similar&quot; to the procs in question.<br />
<br />
The stuns frod is talking about refer to paladin stuns unless i'm mistaken.  IE baze bellow (supposedly 600 raw hate) cannot pull aggro off a paladin who cast cease therefore all stuns &gt; Anger3.  Another test is that sk casts pure hate &quot;x&quot; number of times ... 11 swings + yak pulls aggro ... swings = this much aggro therefore yak must = this much aggro ... which opens a whole 'nother can of worms ... ie ... how he hell do we know if SK aggro spells work as intended (a lot of my friends say they suck and are busted) ... and how do we therefore know if the aggro per swing equations are even remotely on base?<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any conclusive parses that test yak vs anger3 or yak vs EB.  So far it's been well these 2 are similar and those 2 are similar therefore it stands to reason that what works for the 1 pair must work for the other.  I see problems with this.<br />
<br />
Lets assume that baze bellow and anger procs are in one ... and cease and yak/FD are in the other category.<br />
<br />
... Incomming metaphorical analogy:<br />
<br />
-All Cheetahs are large cats <br />
-All Lions are large cats<br />
-Greyhounds are the fastest dogs<br />
-All cheetahs are faster than greyhounds<br />
Conclusion- Therefore it stands to reason that all large cats are faster than dogs?<br />
This is an invalid assumption as greyhounds are faster than lions.<br />
The premises actually lead to the conclusion that some large cats are faster than all dogs, but not necessarily all.<br />
<br />
This is kinda what i am seeing with some of the tests being issued, and these are the problems one encounters when species of -insert whatever- are assumed to be equivalent.  With the cease/baze-bellow argument you are using similar aggroish effects and assuming that the rules which apply to one set must apply to all across the board.  Maybe some stuns have more inherent aggro than others.  Maybe paladin spell stun has more inherent aggro than proc stun.  Maybe baze bellow works in an entirely different method than assumed.<br />
<br />
Basically if you are going to test yak vs anger3 then test yak vs anger3.  Cease vs baze bellow wont cut it because cease is not a yak proc and baze bellow is not anger3.  If there were some logical way to prove that anger3 = baze bellow and yak = cease then we'll work from there, but so far nobody has posted any such thing.  Until this can be proven, i'll go with my gut and past experiences.<br />
<br />
I can, however, state with utter confidence that nothing i have encountered in this game has placed my yak procs at greater than 1000 points of aggro, and all my experiences also lean towards the fact that EB/A3 is significantly higher aggro than yak.</div></div><hr />

Interesting so by putting 2 and 2 together it's possible that perhaps a paladin/cleric casting a stun might in fact be more aggro than a stun proc itself.  I could have sworn my willsapper proc was less aggro than an actual shaman slow, but never bothered to test it.</div></div><hr />

When all this hate/swing stuff was originally tested, Terror spells were the first things looked at to ensure they work.  From that testing it was discovered that they were limited to 110 initial aggro (with the exception of Terror of Discord and Dreadgaze which don't suffer this limitation).  Aside from that limitation Terror spells work exactly as indicated and give the amount of hate they say.  The tests themselves are listed on the first page of this (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=18154) thread.<br />
<br />
Also, Apolyon... your testing is flawed.  You left out data which actually means quite a bit in addition to the fact that you used random amounts of hate each time so your tests on it are completly wrong.  In addition to the fact that the necro was obviously dotting from outside the mobs melee range (this is obvious from your results as you aren't generating 15k hate/min with your weapon setup), so the spells you're using to test are already being affected by aggro mods.  As I said, use an SK with Terror of Discord, that will get you the best results.  Also use a weapon without any proc, augment it with Ykesha and use it, then augment it with Anger 3 and use it.  This eliminates a large portion of the variables you left in your testing.</div></div><hr />

And if you believe in the former, I'd suggest trying that yourself and see just how often it happens.  That is the alleged difference between the two setups, actually it's supposed to be more if using stun = 1300 hate.<br />

And to this day, I have yet to see mobs behave very differently in the XP range from one another in terms of aggro (minus some bosses that obviously mem blur).

Very easy to illustrate that CASTED (edited for Apo ; ) stun aggro increases with mob level (or hitpoints according to Brael).  Also easy to illustrate how much being in melee range makes a big big difference.<br />
<br />
The appearence is that the stun aggro ramps up following a logarithmic curve and that would back up the boasts we're seeing here in this thread.  What I havent seen tested very well is where the cap is.  Nor have I seen much talk of how much hate repeated stuns are compared to the first one (i got a hunch its not as effective after a while, but thats just a hunch).<br />
<br />
Talking out my tail here, but I'll bet a wooden nickle that there wasnt much of a difference until GoD/OoW came out because the mobs levels we're never high enough until then to make a difference.  All in all pretty facinating stuff.  Gonna play around this weekend some more with it and hopefully have some logs to post too.

<br />
You can spew stuff all day long about well the RNG could have fucked you over on the 100 GBoS runs but not the 100 BoC runs and sheer bad luck is your reason!  If stun were as powerful as frod and brael would have you believe i dont care if Jesus christ in the form of uber-necro descended from the clouds and was dotting for 3000 a tick ... i'd still have aggro like a maniac.  I'd be fucking invincible ... sadly, though, stun does not work like this ... and my anger3's seemed to work abou 30-40% better consistently .. over 4 straight hours ... against level 66-68 mobs.<br />
<br />
Yes there is a fuckton of variance in the little xp group shindig i ran ... it's why i pulled a total of over 250 mobs (threw 50 out due to lost aggro in first 30 seconds due to 0 procs ... bout half of each combo).<br />
<br />
If nothing else i showed that stun does not = 1100+ aggro, and my data leans towards the notion that warriors have been correct in assuming that anger3/EB &gt; yak.<br />
<br />
Maybe somewhere in GoD or OoW there are mobs that really hate stun ... but i have yet to see any.  I always mainhand my GBoS in xp groups till problems arise then it's bagged and my problems go away.<br />
<br />
Kilz said: &quot;Testing aggro with a necro is like the worst class you could have picked. DoT aggro is so f00ked and streaky right now it's crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
That may be so, but they are the only classes that can consistently give me a run for my money in xp group situations by doing the same exact thing over and over again.  Dot aggro may be streaky but it adds minor increments constantly over time rather than zergfests you might find with a raw nuker.  Instead of 10 ... pause ... 15 ... pause ... 8  ... pause 10 ... i get  5, 5, 5 ,5 7(crit), 5, 5 ,5, 7, 5, 5.</div></div><hr />

Great so you've conclusively proven the same exact thing that frod has already posted.

I do believe someone mentioned the orb of tishani earlier in this thread.<br />
I just wanted proof for myself that stun aggro really does ramp up with level hitpoints and that was the simplest way for me to do it in a short amoutn of time.  No doubt about it, stun hate ramps up when casted.  <br />
<br />
I'd love to see evidence for or against stun proc's being the same hate as spell casts.   Mention a way that my slacker ass can test this with out needing a PhD or a major chunk of my playtime and I'll give it a whirl.   My guess, and its just a guess, is that SoE's code aint that cool and stun hate is the same proc'd or cast.  But hey, if there is a class modifier on the amount of hate generated by swings, why not spell casting?  I do agree with you Apo that it has to be dertimend yes or no that proc stun hate is the same as cast stun hate in order for Frod's arguments to mean much of anything.<br />
<br />
The other thing I'm want to know is the effect successive debuffs have on agro generation.  I had an anklesmasher for a bit that did great at first for pissing the mob off, but quickly became ineffective once the mob was snared.  Not scientific, just observation that I'd like to see explored futher (or at least read some parsing on).  <br />
<br />
I really dont care how 1 stun stacks up to 1 hate proc cause in live fire I'm up against stuff like bugged necro hate and what not.  I rarely get aggro back on 1 proc by itself (stun or hate).  It's usually a string that gets it back.  Of course, live fire has so many unknown varibles that its &quot;uncontrolled&quot; and the scientists around here wont even touch it because its not repeatable (even though the real groups are what we care about cause thats where we need the aggro).<br />

not at all =)  The difference between casted stun aggro vs proc'd stun aggro is critical for all this jawing to mean anything.  And until its proven one way or another we cannot accept the comparison between casted stuns and proc'd stuns.</div></div><hr />

Then i finally finally got a BoC woot! bagged the CHoS and GboS was offhand.. woot i held aggro so much better now (still lost it occasionaly). After a few LDoN runs added an Anger 3 on BoC and Anger 2 on GBoS there is no way i lose aggro anymore.. it made so much difference and i actually felt the difference when i got a BoC...<br />
<br />
SO basically all those parses Brael did, i dont give a shit. If you think Yak&gt;Anger/EB you are seriously retarded, you dont need bloody parses to tell you which is better..the aggro is substantially higher with pure hate procs, to me the parses are like a martial artist who studied the theory long and hard, but never actually fought a battle ;)  <br />
Brael, go and do a parse just like Apolyon if you like parsing and tell us which does better.. obviously after all this hard work n theory you're not gonna tell us if you're parse seems to show anger &gt; yak<br />

Keep in mind that I am kinda sure every formula used in this game has a random number at the end that can effect the results like plus or minues 80percent and swamp what the forumula actually does. Thats why there is so much vaiation even in very long parses.<br />

Lol one minute to get/lock agro? I wait about 15-20 seconds then tash then 8 seconds later cast slow. Then chain AT with wizards (no concussion or other tricks) and chain root with the chanter. Rarely does my warrior lose agro. OSoW mainhand A3, WA5, BoC A3 offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">There is nothing random about aggro if it's done over a reasonable period of time.  If each hit/proc has some unknown modifier due to randomness it is not anything that matters.  Or, to put it this way, if someone can overaggro you doing some combo of things (i.e. tash and slow on incoming) it will work every time barring a very unlikely streak of procs or taunt.  Similarly, if someone doesn't get aggro it is also pretty much always reproduceable.  If a shaman doesn't get aggro on slow while you're doing whatever you consider to be normal that doesn't depend on the success of a taunt (since obviously that can fail if your taunt fails), chances are more than likely he won't ever get aggro repeating the same thing.  Yes there are exceptions, but it's not the norm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granite mentioned his interest was how it affected raiding.So I gave what I can... a seat of the pants observation that has been exemplified for me over and over since I started raiding.Depending on the target I sometimes call assist very fast.I see aggro move off me, or, whoever I put in at times.Most often all things being equal ;delay of assist,proximity,etc it's the eb/anger procing war that will catch aggro among the melee.Almost never in comparison does a yak proccer see HOTT except thru early engagement supported by the ring.Even in p3 clearing where people are engaging multiple,fairly high mobs almost simaltaneously aggro is bounced between eb/anger wars , chainstunning knights and when it's bad ...casters.<br />
<br />
I used to tank beside a warrior with a GBOS when I had a CHSD.I didn't have any offensive aa ,but, our aggro was much closer than the yak/stun proponents suggest.In fact I bagged my SOTB and offhanded my CHOS in favor of the CHSD after playing with them a lot.The differance wasn't very large ,but, the CHSD was a little better Imo.There may be something to it.I don't see it yet though.I'm staying with anger awhile longer.<br />
<br />
I'm no eq expert and consider myself a casual player that raids.I have been MT for my guild full time since we hit POP and had to take over has Guild/Raid leader since we hit time.My experience and understanding of eq analysis are not the equal of many people in this thread I'm sure.However,atm the evidence of my play time clearly doesn't support their conclusions /shrug.The massive aggro differances suggested by some are ridiculous in my estimation.Imo there is something missing from the picture.</div></div><hr />

When I did use a GBoS and BoC setup at the beginning of PoP I used GBoS in mainhand over BoC though, and that would be a much more valid comparison instead of a GBoS compared to a darkblade. <br />
<br />
That would be a pretty good test actually, 1 warrior use a GBoS and another use a BoC, both with shields in offhand and attack say... a nexus scion would work well, would resist the stun and even the DD component of the GBoS, and theyre immune to melee. Attack for 10minutes no taunts and see who has agro, at that point the warrior with agro can turn off attack and see how long (and how many procs) it takes before the scion switches to the other warrior.<br />
<br />
edit: actually an even better test would be for two warriors with the exact same weapon minus the aug to run the same test and see the outcome, I'll see if I can set this up since I've piqued my curiosity now<br />

edit2! actually a scion wouldnt work, I just remembered they resist anger also, if anyone can think of a mob with enough hp's to last 5-10min or so that wouldnt rape me with just 1 cleric healing I will try and set it up though.</div></div><hr />

The amount of hate per stun cast didnt change (which is what I was wanting to know).  I pulled it with proxy aggro then cast a provoke, turned around so the mob hit my back, and let the provoke run out.  Then I walked up with my cleric and started stunning.  I forgot to take a poke at mob with the cleric first, so it took 10 stuns to get the mob to turn on my cleric the first time around.<br />
<br />
Once the cleric had aggro, I recast provoke (mob turned immediatly back to me) and let it run out, then started casting.  Went through 6 iterations of this using provoke.  Each time it took 7 or 8 stuns to turn the mob on the cleric. It switched between 7 and 8 so my assumption is that what was left over from the 8th stun got picked up on the next round where it only took 7 casts.<br />
<br />
I got bored after 6 rounds of that, so I switched up to the next level in our incite line, berate (700 hate).  Did the same thing, let berate get the full 700 hate on the mob then casted stuns to turn it.  took 10 stuns each time with berate.<br />
<br />
After about 60stuns or so I accepted that stun hate stays constant over time.  Note the mob was at full health the whole time so no change in HP level.  I also made sure that both my warrior and cleric where within melee range of the mob when casting stun.</div></div><hr />

(His AETaunt was either down, or failed due to Z-axis issue with AETaunt). It was so bad that I turned off attack and backed up way out of range to allow him to get aggro, and Innoruk would rather chase ME than attack the EB warrior. I finally ended up having to take his spot on the MTO when it became apparent that there was no real choice in the matter.<br />
<br />
That tends to support the assertion that stun aggro &gt; EB/Anger aggro when th mob is of higher level. (In this case, level 75 or higher).<br />
<br />
I would have to say that Auging an Anger or EB weapon with FoY would allow the best possible aggro for both XP groups and high level named fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had a finesteel long sword aug'd with anger 3, and a guildy had a finesteel long sword aug'd with the cheapest ykesha aug, both have flurry maxed pre oow, wa5 and both have ingenuity maxed (even though that shouldnt matter) both of us used shields in the offhand and did not bash, kick, taunt, incite or anything else besides turn attack on. I removed earring so we would both have 0 combat effects, we both have 45% zun cloak as haste. no buffs at all whatsoever.<br />
<br />
1st test, kromzek recruiter in Kael, verified level 1:<br />
Both attacked for 10min I had agro the entire time with anger3, I stopped attacking when the 10min was up while he continued attacking 9 more minutes until he got agro.<br />
<br />
2nd test Arborean tree in PoE:<br />
Both attacked 9min had agro flopping back and forth from the 4min mark all the way till the 9min mark when we died from someones train (yay snare)<br />
<br />
3rd test Crocodile in PoE:<br />
Both attacked 10min I had agro the entire time with the anger 3 aug, turned attack off at the 10min mark and it took him 7min and 19procs to get agro with ykesha.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: my weapons both have anger3 augs again  ;) youre free to draw your own conclusions.<br />
<br />
Were going to keep the aug'd finesteel weapons awhile and do some tests on non stun immune mobs (both tree and croc were both immune) Ill post those when we get around to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure if you're using a high end dualwield combo either augs will work fine.I still don't see a CHOS putting out that kind of hate though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">Also I dont doubt that stun has more agro than anger3 exactly as Brael and Frodlin said it did, theres no other explanation for the 2 tests in PoE varying so much, my guess is people are wrong about stun having the same agro whether its a hit, a resist or an immune message like pallys have been trying to tell us for awhile now.<br />
<br />
Thats why we wanted to do more tests on mobs that arent immune to stun, since the resist check is done before the immune check he likely just got more resists than immunities on the tree (or vice-versa even possibly) which made us stay neck and neck.<br />
<br />
But I fight tons of mobs that are immune to the stun portion of weapons therefore anger3 is the way to go for myself imo. I dont want to have super agro some mobs and low agro other mobs leaving my hate value up to a resist check before the immunity check. And no matter what the case is for the tests to differentiate that much its not something I want to happen when it matters.<br />

<br />
Only recommendation I would have is to use a 'control' (Sorry, it's a costly thing to have to aug 2x fine steel weapons) but to have a standard by which one can go &quot;Mob behaviour with the same setup is consistently X&quot;.<br />
<br />
After that, then run the test.   This way the conclusion is somewhat valid.  In other words, the analysis of the results needs to be predicated upon the fact that if both warriors were using the same setup, the mob behaviour were expected to be X, and when both are using different augs, the mob behaviour is Y, or X + N.    <br />
<br />
With no control, you're validating a hypothesis based not on a standard, but on another hypothesis.</div></div><hr />

You're right, so lets all go switch out our Anger3 augs for FoY augs because that's all we tank all day right?  No, for the most part in Exp groups all you fight are DB's, Whites, and the occasional yellow.

To me the answer is obvious because I mostly exp and grind away AA's for the bulk part of the week.  And if I do tank a boss mob, I really don't see the problem is having marginally &quot;less&quot; (if it is actually less, I'm not convinced) aggro as long as I'm taking all the hits.

I spend 100% of my time online fighting level 68 or higher mobs (usually yellows/reds in Riftseekers), thus to me it DOES matter greatly.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I think that without a control, and with such dramatic variance in two tests in PoEA (one has a back and forth situation for 9 mins, the other has a dramatic difference) it's pretty far from conclusive.</div></div><hr />

/shrug I'm not in a hardcore raiding guild and we're not elemental yet.  I spent most of my time pre-OoW in BoT grinding away so obviously I don't see too many Yellows/Reds there.... now that I'm 68 I play mostly in WoS with guildies or pickup groups.  I believe most mobs there are sub-68 so almost all are DB now.  I don't seem to have too much of a problem.  But I suppose to those higher end GoD players it would matter....... I just wonder now that a lot of warriors are getting close to/at level 70 if all this will change?</div></div><hr />

I cant think of any red-con mobs offhand that are easy to get to that only require 1 cleric healing for up to 20min without running oom, and theres no way I'm going to try and drag more than 1 cleric to help me with some test I really have no interest in anymore even heh.<br />
<br />
As for the test not being valid since it didnt include red mobs.. I'm not trying to prove either aug is superior to the entire warrior community, to be honest I couldnt care less what aug's you all choose  :) The tests were for our personal benefit only. I've already got what I wanted to out of the tests and switched my augs back to anger3, no matter what happened in PoE to make him need 7min and 19procs to get the croc off me its not something I want to deal with on a daily basis. The only reason I want to do another test on stunnable mobs is to get more info on resists vs immunities.</div></div><hr />

Then the whole yak pwns a3 argument belongs in The Overlords Sanctuary.  Outside of the high end game (locked content) a3 is &quot;better&quot; from an aggro point of view.</div></div><hr />

It does depend on where you are at in the game.  When I face mobs that con red to level 70 more often than not then yak's worth it.  I'm a long ways off from that day and I aint in a real big hurry.  Plus I dont buy that yak is that good until you really are facing end game mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">I think ultimately, Ssra or VT would be a better place to test this theory.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have two basic problems here.  XP mobs don't have squat for hitpoints, even in Riftseekers.  Braelin's whole argument is based off mob HP.  Everyone knows A3 &gt; Yak for XP mobs.  I've seen it as a rogue over and over and over.  If I use stun poison, I'll much more easily pull aggro off a yak aug, then A3 (DBoW/EoE setup that is, anything less and I don't even need poison)<br />
<br />
And the second, how do procs relate to actual spells.  SOME procs are in fact identicle to spells (Sarnak Warhammer?  Felhammer?  Copper Hammer of Striking?  Sceptre of Destruction?) but most are not.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be at all surprised if SoE ninja boosted stun spells somewhat to help Paladins with aggro either in the GoD beta, or after release, or simply modified the mobs to account for a little added aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
It could also be an anomoly that SoE didn't plan on that they may simply fix (chanters, clerics and wizards for sure wouldn't be too happy about it.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm quite curious to see what the end results will be, but outside of the high end raid environment it's a choice between more aggro so the group's DPS can dish out more at a faster pace, or an added 6% personal DPS at the expense of 10 times that.  It seems more like personal preference for most people at this point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">I'm weighing in as still on the fence on this one.  I saw Frodlin's HoH GBoS vs. BoC test.  I also used a BoC and GBoS as my aggro weapons for quite a few months.  I wanted to mainhand the GBoS...it had a better ratio and a dps proc.  Time after time I wound up moving the BoC back to mainhand for aggro reasons.  I own a BBotE, which should be the best aggro weapon short of a DBotW.  I even got the &quot;secret&quot; leaked aggro measurments PM'd do me by a namless source, but I'm still not convinced.  The first time I hard the &quot;stun is 1400 aggro&quot; rumor, I went home and loaded up my BBotE and GBoS in Vxed.  3 fights, a dead rogue, and an OOM cleric later, my group members were asking me what was wrong.  I played a level 65 paladin not long ago and my perception then was that chain-casting Force of Akilae and Ancient Force of Chaos sure felt like less aggro than I am used to dual wielding on my warrior.  <br />
<br />
I think this merits more testing.  I like Apolyon's idea with the weighted axe test.  I hope he does it.  I plan to Ykesha aug my BBotE and experiment with it along with my A3 bloodfrenzy, but damn it's hard to get LDoN groups atm hehe.  I may try to set up a test with BBotE with Ykesha vs. an A3 bloodfrenzy.  <br />
<br />
If the 13-1400 hate thing is true, the BBotE should blow the BF away aggro-wise. Based on my exp with both I really don't think it does, but I don't have any reliable data to back this up.</div></div><hr />

I also have a bbote and I agree, if what we are talking about here is true, it should be the end all, be all weapon for aggro, but as many have testified, and I will agree, its not.  But lets look at one thing regarding the actual procs we are talking about.<br />
<br />
Strike of Ykesha<br />
 <br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Decrease Hitpoints by 100<br />
2: 	Stun(0.00 sec)<br />
<br />
<br />
Sanity Warp<br />
 <br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Decrease Hitpoints by 88 (L16) to 95 (L23)<br />
2: 	Stun(0.00 sec)<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe, the scaling of the stun aggro, lies in the level of the stun itself, not just whether its a stun period.  Since ykesha is not a level based stun like sanity warp maybe it has the ability to scale higher or provide more aggro.<br />
<br />
This theory of mine (sorry if its been mentioned before, I tried to read all the threads on these discussions across all the class boards) would also lend some credibility to the complaints of the lower level knight stuns not having the same effect on higher level encounters.<br />
<br />
Anyways, its just a theory at this point.</div></div><hr />

I do almost all of my xping in KT, Yxxta, or MPG and once more people I know are 69 or 70 I plan on moving to Riftseekers so yes some of us do fight almost exclusively level 65+ mobs...  If my aggro is a little worse on the lower level mobs, not a big deal.  For now, I use the 125 ykesha in my offhand and I have no complaints.  Haven't decided if I'm going to swap my primary hand aug out for ykesha.
