<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so we've decided against selling the boards. They will not change owners. I've read all of the emails, pm's, and tells ingame i've gotten and it won't happen. That was my biggest problem with what Yantis was offering, and we've decided against it. However, another offer which would benefit us quite a bit has been made, with far less cost to us as a whole.<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts on getting a single ad on the main pages and a single ad on the MAIN forum page which would cover any hosting and upgrade fee's we could ever incur? The site would never have to take donations again and be able to accomodate some things we currently cannot.<br />
<br />
That in exchange for a single ad (check the top of eqinterface.com). Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So, honestly, I'm sure there's goign to be a bit of resentment at first, plus the immediate knee-jerk reaction to the board's possible addition of a sponsor, but in all seriousness look at the big picture here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok if we are talking about AD banner on top of the page there are other companies that do this. It doesn't have to be Yantis or IGE<br />
<br />
Companies do advertise on meesage broads I frequently visit www.pcmech.com forums and they have banner on top from respectabul companies that deal with the message boards. We have alot of traffic so they might be interested.  <br />
<br />
This is a forum about a video game and we all need computers to play it.  The following companies might be interested in sponsoring or just helping us with the costs of hosting by placing non-intrusive ads on the messageboard.  Companies like<br />
<br />
www.dell.com<br />
www.newegg.com<br />
www.ebgames.com<br />
www.alienware.com<br />
<br />
Or other PC related Companies might be interested.  This can be alternative to Yantis and IGE solution.  I am going to research this more and post emails here so you can contact them more about this.  I will send emails I will do the work. Just think about this as an alternative than  allowing these criminals and more profits.</div></div><hr />

If you are gonna do it, make sure they use only images and not any fancy flash/java/whatever.<br />

And yes, there have been cases of virus infected adds recently on some pages.<br />
That's just sad.<br />

I don't mind adds so much, as long as they do not compromise security or obscure whatever page I'm going to.<br />

As long as we have 100% control over the boards outside of the little ad I don't have a problem with it.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

IGE and Yantis and blantantly breaking the EULA. Also they are selling property that they do not belong to them.  This is a crime in all 50 states.  You guys see this as no problem at all.  You accept their money you are just as bad as they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Changes that would occur:<br />
<br />
The Forums would not change. Moderators remain the same, No censorship that isn't currently censored. <br />
<br />
1 Advertisement at the top of each static page (Armor, Weaponry, Trainin', Questin', Links).<br />
<br />
We would be on a new server - without the need to pay hosting fees.<br />
<br />
Yantis would not be involved with the forums at all.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I do not want yantis here, but that doesn't mean people should post incorrect info.  The ads would not be on all the pages, only on the main page, armor, weaponry, trainin, questin, links.</div></div><hr />

Instead he's letting us decide.  Calm your ass down already, from the looks of it I doubt it will happen due to how many hate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Selling out?<br />
<br />
I guess if you consider turning down 10's of thousands of dollars I was offered earlier today but declined because I wanted to keep the site under our control selling out - then yeah I'm a sell out.<br />
<br />
I want this site to remain under our control. I dont want someone coming in and changing the way everything is run. They will not do that. We are looking at possibly adding TWO small banners (like the one at eqinterface, except not on every page) and that would cover any expansion we need, any hosting fees we could ever rack up, as well as allow us to refund those donations already provided to the site.<br />
<br />
Yantis wanted to own TSW. He wanted everything to be &quot;his&quot; with us working for him. IGE just wants some advertising space. Two ads in the thousands of pages of this site is not a lot to bear for what we can do with the funding we recieve from them.</div></div><hr />

What's the difference between having Yantis pay and IGE pay?  <br />
<br />
nothing they are both criminals.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And raaj one banner os even to much.  You are still getting something from them. You didn't even consider my other options I posted earlier.  Why isn't it a viable option to seek other respectable companies, why is your mind set on IGE.  There is a reason Raaj I know it and you know it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sHORTY</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnomers, there simply isn't money in advertising from those other companies.<br />
<br />
Not for the amount of traffic that we have atleast.<br />
<br />
I've worked with web advertising for the last five years. Companies like that will not pay unless you are a fortune 500 company.<br />
<br />
We are not selling our souls as you are making it out to be. If you'd like to ignore the ads, you are more than welcome to - but some will use them and they will enjoy the services provided, however lucrative they are.<br />
<br />
The money gathered from this will allow TSW to expand and do many other things which we have wanted to do for a while now - it will allow all of the staff to focus more on this as a job, instead of a glorified hobby.<br />
<br />
This sponsorship will do nothing but increase the services which we are able to offer. It's as simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hell with yantis, I'd want nothing to do with him whatsoever. ige is the lesser of two evils, if some fools want to pay to put a few banners up, thats ok with me and if Raaj says its only going to be two banners, then I believe him. Before a deal is struck though, I urge the admins to check out ad agencies, hell even if they want pop ups on the site, there are cheap and/or free pop up blockers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So to expand we need to have IGE come in and place ads on our message boards.  We need a company that sells property of SOE illegalie to come here and place ads.  We need a company that a founder is a pedaphile.  Just for a little but of an expansion. IF you accept their money you wont be any better then them.  Shorty we all appreciate what you and the admins/mods have done to this forum to give us a place to chat without no censorship.  But what you want to do is just plain wrong<br />
<br />
<br />
I never donated because I do not like Paypal I find it insecure way to transfer money. But I am willing to donate 50 bucks a month  that is alone 600 bucks a year to keep this site free from people who  are criminals.</div></div><hr />

You register for this site this month as soon as we heard IGE or Yantis wants to purchase or advertise on this site.  And now you are trying to make it seem they are not crinimals and that they hurt no one.

As for the actual issue.  I am completely against it.  Though I haven't been able to donate as of yet due to financial issues.</div></div><hr />

IE the donations aren't paying for it. IF it is necessary to place advertising on the site because donations aren't covering costs, so as to pay for it and keep it operational, then fine, but there's better options than IGE and Yantis. They're sleazy at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would really prefer that there is nothing from Yantis or IGE on these boards.  I can deal with 2 ads, I won't be happy about it, but I wouldn't abandon TSW over that.  Outright ownership, yeah, I'd be outta here, which is why I donated to help prevent that.  Sheeprapers like Yantis and IGE prey on stupid people and honestly, nothing is really going to prevent stupid people from finding them and coughing up real dollars to cheat.  I just don't like the idea of TSW in any way being a vehicle for these horse sucking bastards to rip off those stupid people.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my final answer is - I can deal with 2 banners, especially if ownership is retained by the current folks, I just won't be happy about it.  I'd much rather have TSW in no way affiliated with scum like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You make more of a fuss for EULA 'breakers' vs child exploiters.<br />
<br />
Attaboy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You see Liquid  the lawsset forth of our country do not pertain to others.  As it is illegal to have children work in the United States it is not in China or other countries. Does it make it right, HELL No.  <br />
But unfortuanately it is legal for these companies because US laws do not extend all over the world.  I do not like it anymore than you.<br />
<br />
<br />
By calling them only EULA breakers that just not going to cut it.  In the EULA it states that all property belongs to SOE such as characters, platinuim and items.  These companies are bascially selling stolen property and I am sure you agree that is a crime in all 50 states and most civil countries.  So the correct term for Yantis and IGE are criminals nothing else.  Also they hack the EQ files so they can warp, to make profits on tradeskill bugs.  They use known bugs to sell powerleveling services also.  Even Yantis admited to that on the last part in announcement on why he took down 1-65 in 24 hours ads.   Those alone are the reason to keep these types of people of our messageboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But one thing I do not get is why Sony doesnt take legal action against them is beyond me.  It is illegal it breaks the EULA, it breaks laws and yet they are still making money.  FOr those whose do purchase their wares are also breaking the laws for receiving stolen property.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think it's a bad idea IMHO; I'd also worry about them &quot;farming&quot; the board registration data, etc.  Hosting on someone else's server = they OWN you.  Don't like it?  Too bad- it's their hardware and bandwidth.  I'm actually quite happy w/ the existing setup, and while I haven't kicked in for this site yet, I did back when it was at the warzone.  I do keep an eye on the $$$ needed tally on the forum page.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if the board does end up getting pimped out, I'd at least expect the personal registration data to be deleted BEFORE it happens, and re-registration (if necessary) via some means that doesn't require a valid (and therefore farmable and sellable) email address, or other marketing-useful but pseudo-confidential  information.<br />
<br />
Why do I feel like this?  Basic paranoia, plus some very bad experiences back in the early 1990's, when I &quot;hosted&quot; a MUD/MUSE.  It was all my hardware, but co-located about as far from where I was as you can get on this planet (me = in japan, server = in pennsulvania).  It was hell, and being totally at the mercy of the whims of a psycho sysop was actually one of the SMALLER problems...<br />
<br />
Why the concern, particularly about email addresses?  The still-functional but now useless email address that was posted at that site now gets an average of 200++ spams *a day*...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the only thing that I have to say here is that a whole bunch of people stepped up to the plate and just solved your hosting costs, as well of being very aware that you could potentially dump the site at any time.  We're covering your costs, and if you dump the board now, you're gonna have a lot of people who forked over real money pretty pissed off that their money is now useless.<br />

If you do decide to take either offer, you should at least consider that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted the following in a previous thread before I noticed this one.<br />
<br />
I don't post much on message boards...I like to read.  I've been reading TSW since I started playing EQ.  I've read all variations of TSW.  I've seen the &quot;mysupersales&quot; web-sites.  I am 100% disgusted with Yantis and others that do business the way he does.  As a poster quite a few pages before me mentioned, &quot;he was proud of his gear that he earned&quot; and whatnot, and this is how I feel about TSW.  WE as a community have earned our spot in the EverQuest message board community.  WE have earned the respect of 100's of warriors that play Everquest.  WE have earned the respect and gratitude and sometimes even a little bit of grief from Sony itself.  Now some low-life scum-bag (I'm being nice atm) wants to just straight up buy our site and reap the benefits of having 100's of hits a day and people glancing at his link with the hopes that someone will click it and he will make a sale.  No...no, not no...nah...HELL NO on this.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, I've been reading all variations of TSW since I started playing EQ.  I've learned a great deal from this community along with many other class message boards.  I've also read up on Yantis and dislike, even loathe him.  To be honest with you, I have not yet donated to this site, BUT if you DO NOT SELL OUT to him you can gurantee there will be a larger influx of donations due to the fact that having &quot;his&quot; banner on our site disgusts 99% of us.<br />
<br />
I for one would no longer be visiting this site if it was owned or affiliated in anyway by Yantis.  I also understand that he would not be doing anything different to the forums, but the thought of being affiliated with him makes me ill.<br />
<br />
If IGE is making the offer, just ignore every time I used the word &quot;Yantis&quot; in my post and replace it with &quot;IGE&quot;</div></div><hr />

I don't think SOE would be one bit happy about it.<br />
<br />
Regarding SOE - Would they be interested in adds on TSW ?<br />
Have you asked them ?<br />
<br />
As have been mentioned, there ought to be better sponsors than Yantis / IGE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF the donations are not keeping up with the costs, then I could see looking for outside funding.  However, as has been stated elsewhere, can we look at other options if that day comes?  I personally do not care for Yantis or IGE, if the best thing you can say about IGE is that they are not Yantis, there is a problem.  Most of the Community appears to be against Character, Plat, Item buying/selling.  Would you accept advertising from Porn or Warez sites?  Porn is a technically legal business, and Warez is just breaking an EULA...<br />
<br />
As I stated in a previous thread, I have removed all Yantis sponsored sites from my Guilds website, that goes for IGE as well.  Honestly until this issue was brought up, not alone here, but on other boards that I read, I was not aware of what IGE did, if I had been I would have removed them earlier.<br />

I guess the lure is more then the effort to do them again. Yantis or IGE, doesn't matter as they're both the same thing in the end.</div></div><hr />

Well, the only thing that I have to say here is that a whole bunch of people stepped up to the plate and just solved your hosting costs, as well of being very aware that you could potentially dump the site at any time.  We're covering your costs, and if you dump the board now, you're gonna have a lot of people who forked over real money pretty pissed off that their money is now useless.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to take either offer, you should at least consider that.  <br />
<br />
Raaj mentioned this to me last night and he's gonna take care of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kragrock</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I know I dont post here very often so I'm not sure how much people will listen to this.  The first thing I want to ask though Raaj is that you would do something for me please.  Before you make a decision one way or the other I would like you to send an E-Mail to SOE giving details of BOTH offers you have been made, ie the one for total ownership and the one for the 2 straight ads.  Also ask how this will affect SOE's interaction with The Steel Warrior site.<br />
<br />
Then post their reply here please.  I want a clear unequivical commitment from SOE that they will continue to comminicate with the Warriors of Norrath if either of the offers were accepted.<br />
<br />
Also you do realise the second you put that ad up, your bookmark will certainly be removed from the Mith Marr server boards and I suspect a lot of others.  I know I for one will remove the link from my hard drive and I will be e-mailing a request to have any and all data regarding my account stripped from the database.  I'm sorry, I am not saying I dont trust you but to be honest I dont know you and I dont know whether part of this deal will be access to the current members E-Mail addresses etc.<br />
<br />
Whilst I know you have put a LOT of hard work into this forum with no real compensation EXCEPT the thanks of virtually every Warrior in Norrath.  You need to decide whats more important to you.  You also need to consider what has happened at the boards that have been sold already.  Mass migration of the posters to another board.  I am pretty sure that will happen with the warriors to and all it will serve is to split us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I'd rather have a porn banner.  I'd get way more use and entertainment out of that than something from IGE or Yantis.  Porn is more respectable too.<br />
<br />
-edit- When you say &quot;take care of it&quot;, does that mean that the banner is going up and you'll be refunding the donations that you have received?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I'm gonna try to make this sound as nice as possible, but I'm sure it's gonna sound bad anyway.  Please understand that i'm not angry about what i'm saying here, i'm saying it to make you question this Raaj.<br />
<br />
First of all, what really do you own here?  You're being offered &quot;tens of thousands of dollars&quot; for what?  All you really did is set up the board so that TSW wouldn't be lost.  As far as I know, Jaikar still owns things like the original concept, domain, logo, etc.  Furthermore, by looking at the donations list, it seems that everything has been covered, correct?  Therefore there hasn't been any out of pocket costs from you that haven't been reimbursed by the community.  So quite honestly, what are you really getting money here for?  We dump the board to Yantis, you get like 30k, you buy a new Audi and what really have you done for it?  Taking money for the sale of something that you technically don't own is morally and legally shady at best.  While it may in fact be a tempting offer, you don't make the community.  The community makes TSW.  If we all stopped coming here tomorrow, this board wouldn't be shit, but the same can't be said for the owner of the board.  It doesn't matter if you own it or Jaikar, or Yantis or whatever.  While you may own the domain and the webspace it sits on, the rest of us all contribute to the essence of this board, and that's what's important.<br />
<br />
Please, correct me if any of the above is wrong, I'm not saying it as an accusations, i'm asking if I understand things clearly here.  It seems to me that the only thing you have invested in the board is time, and I'm under the impression that you'd volunteer the time anyway because like the rest of us, you love the game.  So basically if everything I've said is correct, you'd be taking a big lump of cash and selling the community out for your own personal gain.  Everyone has a price I guess, but I don't know if I could take that much cash for doing nothing really.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, I know this probably sounds bad and sounds like an attack, but really it's just an inquiry, I don't mean it in a hostile manner, please don't take it that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have to say, Raaj is taking the high road to the extreme here.  How many of you have had somebody offer you $12k in cold hard cash and a monthly paycheck for something you have already been doing?  <br />
<br />
Raaj isn't a rich guy, he's a college student, and he has already made a huge sacrifice for the good of this board.  More than anybody posting here will ever come close to.  Haas you are probably right, any claim of 'ownership' of this board is tenuous at best, but Raaj could have very easily said screw you guys, taken the check and bought himself a new car.  Most of the class board admins did just that, and for less money.  <br />
<br />
That is the reality, and I think anyone would agree that isn't an easy decision to make.  Anything Raaj does now is because he thinks it's best for the community.  Feel free to disagree with his plans, but don't even think about questioning his integrity or dedication to this site, because by saying no to Yantis last night, he gave up 20 times as much as the rest of us have put together.  Not in some intangible emotional contribution, but in cold hard cash, which is really where the rubber meets the road, and my hat is off to him for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read through all the posts;  here's my thoughts: <br />
<br />
1.  The whole idea of ever being able to completely disassociate from 'bad' is illusory.  It's the Pontius Pilate solution and it's self-deception. <br />
<br />
2.  This is pixel ethics, not real world ethics.  No animals were harmed in the making of this game.  And it is contraposed with the RL time and RL money of those who make this board work. <br />
<br />
3.  The one real issue that I see is whether the Sony Developers would continue to post here if those ads were present.  I suspect that is being checked. <br />
<br />
The bottom line for me is this:  I have 'known' Raaj in a message board sense for a while - mostly on another board, not this one.  I feel pretty safe in trusting his judgement on this.   Do what you think is best, Raaj, and don't short-change yourself.  I think most of us will accept your reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest I have been coming here for a long time and I am not against ads to cover cost or even make this site profitable in a large capacity. I am however against the particular ads that are being suggested. I agree that I would like to see SOE respond to this type of ad and whether it would effect their responsiveness to our community. Not to mention I want to change all of my data on this site before something like this goes live because no way in hell do I want mysupersales or Yantis having access to my information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I think that the requests to ask SoE to respond directly will provoke negative attention, not positive (if any attention at all, really). They still post at MB, they still check other boards that are sponsored. I hate to say it but Wu made a good point - they're checking melee boards now because it's their job to do so. I don't think that issue specifically will be an problem if you guys don't make it one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgotha</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main concern is- Will Sony still listen to our concerns and post on the board if it is sponsored by a EULA breaking company?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate your guys responses on this. I haven't made a decision yet, but I'll tell you what I'm thinking.<br />
<br />
The donations since this came up do indeed &quot;cover&quot; the costs...right now. However with the move to the new server our hosting fees were very likely to increase. Also, theres a few ways in which we want to expand the site (IRC server, UI section, some limited hosting) which we couldn't do without a hardcore donation drive every month. <br />
<br />
I don't think it's fair to you guys - nor to myself to beg for donations. I hate it, honestly. Asking you guys for donations makes it feel 'wrong' at best. I do what I do with this site because I like the game and I like the class, and I like the communication with everyone. It's fun for me. Begging for donations....well is not.<br />
<br />
The reality of the situation is..I'm a 20 year old college student. The offers i've been receiving for a straight buyout were VERY VERY tempting the last few days. I'll be totally honest - they would most likely have covered my next 2-3 years of tuition and housing. That's not insignificant. That's huge. But I turned them down to keep the site the way it is now.<br />
<br />
First of all, what really do you own here? <br />
<br />
You're right Haass. I borrowed the banners and the likeness when we moved to here to keep it 'seamless'. I suppose I could change it but I like the name. I didn't create it though. And thats why I was really REALLY stressing the idea of being &quot;bought&quot;. Ask shikarii...I think i bugged him more ingame the last 3 days than I ever have.<br />
<br />
 While you may own the domain and the webspace it sits on, the rest of us all contribute to the essence of this board, and that's what's important.<br />
<br />
Also true. That's why I've been keeping you guys up to date on these things. I do think it's important that you know what's going on.<br />
<br />
I read the beastlord communities reaction - and well...heh no. I wouldn't do that to you guys. I would NOT sell out and tell you guys that &quot;Thats the way it is.&quot; I wanted you to know that these guys were speaking with us, and there was a possibility the site could be sold. Now though, I've decided based on the feedback that the site will not be sold. <br />
<br />
I got an offer yesterday that yeah...I could have taken and run with the cash and left you guys here wondering what the hell happened. I wouldn't do that though. I've decided I don't want this community owned by someone like that. However - I can see letting them foot the bill if they think their ads are going to be worth it (and they arent singing and dancing and popping up at us).<br />
<br />
What we're looking at very seriously now is an offer from IGE. This would entitle them to only 2 advertisement spots on the web site. One of those would be on the &quot;main&quot; page at www.thesteelwarrior.org. The other would be at the top of the MAIN forum page only at www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/. For these two ads you guys will never, ever have to donate to this site again. We'll also be able to expand it in good ways.<br />
<br />
SoE presence - I don't feel this will be an issue. They post on EQinterface (which has an ad deal like we may soon with IGE) and also Monkly Business (which is owned by Mysupersales).<br />
<br />
Like I said, I really appreciate you guys's responses and I am reading them and considering them. Ultimately,  I will do what I feel is best for the site. It would be very nice to keep the site ad free - of course then it makes no money and i'm forced to beg you guys for donations...something that could be more trouble than it's worth. If the time comes that we do get something set up...Your donations will be refunded. I've already said that - it's something that I really want to do.<br />
<br />
Anyway...that should explain some things for you guys.<br />
<br />
Oh, and so you can see the banner i'm talking about here....Imagine one of these in that black space up top - on the 2 pages I mentioned only. Dont worry about clicking these, they're not active banners or anything.<br />
<br />
Heres the MSS banner.<br />
<br />
http://www.mysupersales.com/images/newbanner1.gif<br />
<br />
And the IGE banner</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgotha</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monkly Business was specifically told that no one would visit them because of who owned the boards, and it was only recently changed. Also, it's a moral issue- these guys contribute to the detriment of EQ. I for one despise any plat/item/account seller, especially a 'professional' one, and doubt I would come to a site that supports them, it'd be just another stike on the &quot;Shelve the Warrior Permently&quot; side of my mind. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guys, you gotta stop posting this and you have to read the thread.  It was Absor who said he would never visit said boards, not SoE, and Absor was shit for PR anyway.  SoE devs are posting on all melee boards, regardless of the ownership.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Raaj...<br />
<br />
I got an offer yesterday that yeah...I could have taken and run with the cash and left you guys here wondering what the hell happened. I wouldn't do that though.

<br />
Great, your parents did a good job, you're a man with integrity, unlike some of the people running boards about this game.  I'll now go along with anything you decide to do, you've convinced me you're not a fuckwad here and you know what will hurt the community and what won't.</div></div><hr />

hmmmm<br />
<br />
drop me an email or a PM, i do beleive i could host that on my hardware.<br />
<br />
as for adding some limited hosting, make that a pay service, ie: $5-10 a month to cover costs, that will help cut down on the &quot;donation drive&quot;<br />
<br />
i guess this is one way that i look at it... if the community does not want to support itself, it is not much of a community.<br />

I understand it's extremely tempting to take large amounts of cash to fund your personal life, but you've done the right thing. Now keep doing so.<br />
<br />
 IGE is, at best, a despicable company run by even more despicable people. They make a living by ruining Everquest for all of the hard-working, honest players like us. Not to mention that they're known real-life child molesters who are being actively tracked down by the United States Government. Do you really want to sell your soul to the devil, and make IGE more wealthy?<br />
<br />
 Whoever suggested sending an email to SOE about their future, or lack thereof, on this boards, is spot-on. Do that ASAP. We need to know about what'll happen in the future with our currently good relations with SOE. <br />
<br />
 Even if they remain in contact with us (which appears unlikely), I'd be hard-pressed to EVER visit this site again if you host someone like IGE or Yantis. And I'm hardly alone in these convictions.<br />
<br />
 Why not choose a respectable company? Say, a computer company, as has been mentioned? Those guys would surely want to advertise on a site that has thousands of devoted computer users.<br />
<br />
 Whoever recommended porn is out of their mind. I'd sooner visit an IGE board than a porn-infested board, any day. At least IGE is being prosecuted for their immoral practices, while porn is not.<br />
<br />
 And Warez is probably the worst idea of all. At least with Yantis and IGE, only a virtual economy is being affected - but with Warez sites, the REAL-LIFE computer game economy is being HEAVILY attacked. Do you know why such excellent, award-winning games like &quot;Arcanum&quot; didn't sell 1 million copies? Because the Warez guys seized the games several months before they were commercially released.<br />
<br />
 If worst comes to worst and you're bankrupting yourself over hosting this board, then make us pay, say, $2.00 a month for it. It's not fun, but it's the least of many evils.<br />
<br />
 And, as it stands, you're getting more than enough money as far as donations go. I'm sure many warriors would gladly cough up the green and donate, to keep this site as it is.<br />
<br />
 Bottom Line: You make the wrong choice, and this community is devastated. Half of it will pack their bags and leave, mark my words.</div></div><hr />

I asked about this first off. It is not true - it was a rumor created about DEN (Read the articles) because they were about to go public. The rumor was to blackmail millions of dollars from them. Thats business.<br />

<br />
Why not choose a respectable company? Say, a computer company, as has been mentioned? Those guys would surely want to advertise on a site that has thousands of devoted computer users.<br />
<br />
With a dell banner, we'd be hard pressed to even meet our hosting fees every month, let alone any room for expansion. You have to remember we'd be getting an amount for that space - not per click. I honestly could care less if you never click an ad in your entire life - it makes no difference to me.<br />
<br />
If worst comes to worst and you're bankrupting yourself over hosting this board, then make us pay, say, $2.00 a month for it. It's not fun, but it's the least of many evils.<br />
<br />
It's not fun to ask for donations either. Nor would it be fun to make people pay. I guess I just don't see how them paying for your enjoyment is detrimental to you. You wouldn't have to even SEE the ad if it offended you that much.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know some people may leave if it goes through - i really do. But, the moderators seem to be behind it. Lots of the 'old time' posters seem to not mind the idea much. What do they see that some of you don't? I'd like you guys to all stick around if we do something like this. Don't abandon it on a whim - I think the community is worth more than that.</div></div><hr />

I trust your decision and even though i don't post alot, i would still come here and chat.<br />

You are a good man Raaj. Thanks for not taking the money and running. I'm sure alot of us can't say they would do the same thing if faced with that decision.:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say, don't do it. Once I'm back in a decent paying job I'll start donating more heavily to keep the site going. It's important enough to me.<br />

Having said all this, should you decide that the banners is the way you want to go, consider this my final post of disagreement on the subject :) It won't be brought up again, by me at any rate.<br />

Edit- forgot to add, despite his abrasive posting style on this thread, gnomer has some very good points that yall should think about. I hope yall can see the fact that he's seriously concerned about the future of the boards, perhaps making him more blunt then he needs to be.</div></div><hr />

Just chiming in on the issue to thank ye Raaj, for the way you're dealing with the whole thing ... that wad of cash *phew*.  All I know is that with layoff chatter where the missus works and my own career in doubt - my guts would be in a knot about it, were I in your shoes.  I have doubts that I would have handled it as well as you have.  I dislike the plat/account sellers emotionally and wouldn't want to see any of them make any further incursions into the game space.   I do have misgivings about giving them *that first inch* - but I trust your judgement on this, and will not abandon the board hastily, if at all.  And while I'm about it, /applaud the lot of ye for a job well done, I think it almost every time I stop by but have never posted it.<br />
<br />
I hope the other class board administrators take note of your example before it is too late.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll mimic what alot of folks are saying in the fact that I don't care for Yantis or IGE, but it's my choice not to click on their ads.  However, it's your choice to decide what is best for the TSW community, and after your recent display of amazing judgement I have no doubt you will do what you feel is appropriate.</div></div><hr />

6 days after the new beastlord boards were created we were approached again by Yantis to sell the new one as well.  I figure, if he's forking over 3-12k per class website he purchases, and new domain registration costs i dunno, 30 bucks, and the community is wherever the posters are, we could eventually bankrupt Yantis, or make him understand that he can't buy a community.<br />
<br />
you handled the situation with so much more integrity than Oaga (eqbeast owner) did, i'll still visit TSW because of that alone, regardless if there are IGE ads.</div></div><hr />

But there are alternatives.<br />
<br />
 Just through reading through this thread, I can tell that many warriors would be happy to completely finance this board as a collective effort. With people donating, everyone is happy - you aren't killing your finances, and we don't have to support people who ruin Everquest for a living.<br />
<br />
 Gnomers IS making some very valid points, here. You guys need to actually see what he's saying and look past his hard edge.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
                              Bottom Line:<br />
<br />
Real warriors don't take the easy way out, man. Real warriors fight to the death if need be. You've got a good community of willing clerics here who'll keep your finance &quot;HP&quot; near full, if not completely full, at all times. <br />
<br />
The fact is that you should feel much more guilty about wanting to support IGE than wanting to have donations. Option A is not respectable, Option B is.</div></div><hr />

Put the ad's up, get the money, do what you want with the site...<br />

and add a link to an ad blocker thingymajig like (I think) the Google search bar so those who don't want to see that ads can download it and block them.<br />

You take the money for the ad space to keep the site running.  Then, for those of you that do not wish to even see the Yantis/IGE banner, you go here (http://download.com.com/3000-2356-10253481.html?tag=lst-0-1) and download a program called MYIE. It's a web browser built off the IE core and one of the features it includes is content filtering.  Which basically means, if you don't want to see ads on a webpage, then you don't, works very very well.  Problem solved.  TSW stays open under Raaj rule without need of donations from us and you never see those ever so offensive ads.<br />
<br />
P.S. - MYIE is freeware for you cheap skates that can't even donate to keep TSW open even though you threaten to leave if they &quot;sell out&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I don't care about IRC. IF I wanna chat, I'll go to EQ and join steelwarrior. or, I'll use EQIM. Look at back when there was a chat interface on the site... there were hours between postings.<br />
I also don't care about UI's. that's what eqinterface is for.<br />
<br />
Have you stopped to think that this expansion of the site isn't something that the community really wants or needs? I'm perfectly happy with the site myself and don't see anything needing to be added. I'm not saying for sure that it's not wanted or needed, but I haven't heard anything about any users wanting anything more... and I'm a regular visitor.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, the users are paying for the site as it is now. You say the hosting costs are going to go up as a reason more revenue will be needed... I say there's no reason at this time to really fear a shortage unless the hosting costs make a BIG jump.<br />
<br />
Look at how the users have walked the walk and not just talked the talk already. Donations exceed costs by HOW much right now? TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS? I think the users have spoken with their wallets. There will be a couple bucks from my broke ass comin the board's way as well.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong... I support advertising by legitimate people if it's needed... but I just don't see the revenue being needed right now. Donations are exceeding costs. Now if it was to go the OTHER way, then it needs to be looked at, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haas I aint donating until Raaj says we are not getting sponsored by criminals</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically if you wanna talk the talk, walk the walk.  I must say I'm skeptical at best about anyone donating 600 bucks a year to this site, and the fact that you haven't donated shit yet doesn't help your cause.  Why the fuck would Raaj make a decision based upon that?  I'm sure you can see why that's not exactly a reliable piece of information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The donations are exceeding the costs right now Daemonwynd - but i'd rather not sit and waiting to see if we're gonna make the &quot;rent&quot; next month. Or the month after that. Or after that.<br />
<br />
IRC and UI's are just examples. Theres lots of things that can be done to increase the sites usability. Hell with our traffic sa we have now - we dont even have the content pages close to finished. It's all forum and our costs have been cutting it close.<br />
<br />
Whatever we decide to do - i just ask that you guys trust us. I've never asked you to buy my fiance a wedding ring, and I didnt just decide that this site  should become some cash cow and sell it off from under your feet. Please, trust us to do whats best, whatever that turns out to be.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, your word means little on the internet without some backup.  Now there can be a little note under your name that says you donated 47 bucks and some change or you can be an unreliable source.  It's nothing personal man, but it is true.  I can say that i'm gonna donate 300 bucks a day, but it doesn't mean shit if I'm not doing it.</div></div><hr />

-where will the host and DB be located?  Is it moving?<br />

<br />
i.e. where's the hook?  If the banners aren't that conspicuous, then why are they paying so well for them?  Is it a foot-in-the-door thing, or are they after some marketable demographic and personal data?<br />

Those are just practical concerns, over and above the moral issues inherent to pimping out a site to that type of folks.  Totally understand the carrot in this situation, wondering what the stick is...<br />

<br />

<br />
Thats open. They've offered to host it, but I think we'd keep it right where it is for now. That way we maintain ultimate control no matter what.<br />
<br />
what, if any, access will said advertiser have to other data related to/on the site? <br />
<br />
Zero. They give us the banner, we put it up. That would be the end of their involvement in the site. That also means they have no way of getting your emails, no way of getting your passwords, no way of touching the content or censoring anything. Everything is in our control.<br />
<br />
will the banners allow user tracking (web bug style), spam for cookies, or otherwise act obnoxiously?<br />
<br />
Theres no spyware, and they shouldn't be obnoxious. They offered to even create banners that match our color scheme heh. As far as user tracking, I do believe that if you CLICK the banner, their affiliate program tracks anytime you use their site for 30days. That's so they can keep track of where their traffic is coming from though.<br />
<br />
The &quot;stick&quot; as you put it is somtehing i've wondered about as well. What it is though I think is a marketting strategy. Yantis is buying up every EQ site he can - hes got the money to burn I suppose. Since these guys are in the same business, i'd assume they want to slow him down some.<br />
<br />
I'll definately double check on the spyware/tracking thing - if you guys have any other questions that I havent answered let me know. I've literally bombarded them with questions for the last few days so if theres something you want to know don't hesitate to ask.</div></div><hr />

I've been a member of TSW community for a long time. I don't post a ton, but I read almost every day. I donated to the cause at EZBoard.. I've donated to the cause here.. and to see all that time and money go to create an environment that will serve as an advertisment for those IGE fookers saddens me.<br />
<br />
I know I'm only one person but I cant say that once I see an ad banner for them on this site (no matter how obtrusive it is) that I will return the following day.. or ever. If half the people that have voiced opposition to this actually got off thier asses and donated a few dollars each month this would probably never have been an issue.<br />
<br />
I will say to sShorty that I am impressed with your dedication to the community to turn down that large offer from Yantis, I know it was a hard decision, and anyone who says that they wouldnt have entertained the idea is lying. Kudos to you and the rest of TSW staff for your candidness and honesty during this whole thing.<br />

What the hell does Yantis actually get out of this?  The guy is at the end of the day a businessman, he is here to make money and he can read the responses himself.  A frontpage ad is almost never going to be seen and the other one practically ignored.  So why is he throwing all this money around exactly.  He has already seen mass migrations on his other sites and that MUST hurt after he has made various commitments.<br />
<br />
Here is what I would suggest, ask Yantis to hold off for 3-6 months.  Let us see what happens both here and on the other boards.  Find out whats going to happen. TSW is certainly not in any sort of financial trouble atm so we dont really need him or his money atm.<br />

Do you allow players to post saying they want to sell a PoTime enabled Cleric on the Grubben server? Since you don't, is it because such ads are inappropriate? Merely because a &quot;company&quot; pays you to place such an ad it becomes OK?<br />
<br />
Can I buy your employers customer lists, schematics, names of suppliers? Can you build me a backdoor, provide source code, sales figures? Was this tested and does this comply with the contract terms?<br />

Nah I stay away from dem slippery slopes. I refused to sell that game console schematic, didn't cover-up dat engineering error on the commercial airliner, disclosed my conflict of interest to my employer before the sales presentation, won't buy or sell in-game items for RL money nor endorse that practice by running ads for those that do.<br />
<br />
I sympathise with the desire to raise a lump sum and even to get a paltry return (the per hour worked return would be dismal I'm sure) on effort made. Still, if it were me I'd refuse to do banner ads for Yantis or the other ingame item seller. I suppose if pressed and I needed the money I'd sell outright to the highest bidder and if they didn't meet my standards - /shrug.<br />

<br />
I can totally understand Raaj's point of view on this.  Look at that donation thing...yes, we've got this month covered, but what about next month? and the month after that?  and how much longer before he's taking cash out of his own pocket to keep it running long enough to figure out a solution?<br />
<br />
Don't sell the board, that would be silly, and shady at best since you don't technically 'own' the TSW concept or idea.  But a banner or 2 (not a goddamned onslaught of ads, btw) that pays for everything the board will ever need is a good thing here.  Since the majority of people on this board don't mind bitching about things but can't seem to pony up the dough to keep it here, I don't think there's another solution.  The same 20 or 30 of us shouldn't be paying for everyone elses board.  If you don't wanna contribute, then I think a banner is the right choice.<br />
<br />
It'd be cool if we could maybe get a different company to sponsor the banner tho...we can always change it to something more reputable should the oppurtunity arise.</div></div><hr />

I've been a professional engineer for 30 years. I don't fudge at all with ethics regardless of the benefit to myself or my employer, the risk level to the buyer or the public at large, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not equating the faulty avionics component with a banner ad. The ethics principle is the same however (to me). If violating the EULA is wrong I couldn't endorse it with banner ads from companies that did.<br />
<br />
If it's not clear-cut to you, that's fine. It's clear-cut to me and I let you know.<br />
<br />
I have nothing at all against banner ads in general.<br />

Well if IGE is willing to offer a flat rate for a banner then hell..fuckin take it.  It's their loss, everyone can download MYIE and never have to look at it and we can run to the bank with it.<br />

I have no intention of making this personal; I'm highlighting your quote as an example only. <br />
<br />
This is ivory tower ethics.  It will get you an A in your college course but it doesn't play out well in the real world (to me). <br />
<br />
Spend some time in a war-ravaged third world country and then come home and talk about how the 'principle' is the same.  Visit your child in prison, bandage a gun shot wound,  watch someone starving to death and then deliver the ethics lecture. <br />
<br />
There are problems.  There are serious problems, not-so-serious problems, problems of inconvenience and then there are completely trivial issues. <br />
<br />
This is a COMPLETELY TRIVIAL issue.  This is a GAME.  Yantis may be a complete jerk (most likely), but he might well be someone who has actually lived some real life and realizes that what he is doing is harming no one.   Let me say that again:  he is harming no one.  If you can seriously disagree with that I just don't know what to say. <br />
<br />
What if he were using the profits to smuggle refugees out of Rwanda?  I firmly believe that some of the people here would still say that he was wrong on 'principle'.  <br />
<br />
Some of the above may seem ludicrous in the extreme, but that is intentional;  I find some of the criticisms here equally ludicrous.  Talk about it all you want - ask questions - make points - say whether you would or would not return if x happened, fine.  <br />
<br />
But cut the ethical judgements on Raaj.  Raaj is not, in fact, in any position to do anything ethically wrong, because THIS DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.  IT'S A GAME.  <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

He posted asking feedback and he got mine - placing banner ads for companies that sell ingame items for RL money is of questionable ethics and the actions performed by these companies is not good for the game.<br />
<br />
The pp sellers and macro tradeskillers wrecked the player economy on my server and several others.<br />
<br />
If what these &quot;companies&quot; are doing is not wrong, let them publicly announce the identity of their officers and owners, people who work for them and their account names.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just a game&quot; does not exempt it from ethical conciderations.  A quarter of a million people play this game. SoE and the player community have an interest in not seeing the game ruined by item sellers.<br />

<br />
i had a VERY long conversation with Raaj over the pro's and cons of both IGE and Yantis the other night. <br />
<br />
the biggest con i told him was<br />
<br />
exactly what is going on, YOUR reaction and what to expect.<br />
<br />
he got that even when he brought the subject UP.<br />
<br />
the solution that he has proposed is very good, a solution similar to eqinterface's. btw i am the one that told him to talk to kudane over at eqinterface about what sort of deal he got.<br />
<br />
<br />
if i had had the option to choose which route to take i would most likely choose the one that is being proposed here. a small banner ad.<br />
<br />
As to the soe contact, Absor was the one that would not post on MB... scott hartsman (exeqlive main programmer - on eq2 team now) rich waters(jahaar) both posted on mb - rarely - and absor visited the messageboard without posting several times a week.<br />
<br />
since Absor's &quot;promotion&quot; to game developer. soe has fairly regularly posted on the messageboard- which is a good thing.<br />
the more contact SoE has with the players, the better. it makes them seem more human, caring.</div></div><hr />

As for raaj, I was fine if you sold it before, America is all about making money, that one good shot at the American Dream.  12k is alot of cash, it would of put you through school and made things easier on you.  But I think by you holding out due to the guilt trip you got here will benefit you triple fold when SOE does legitimize this, which they are.  Furor is 100% right, they are tapping in a market that will make them millions more year and almost all of the other MM's are doing it already.
