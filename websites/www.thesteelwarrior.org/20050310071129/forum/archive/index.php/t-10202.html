Re-envisioning Classes in EverQuest <br />
<br />
The EverQuest development team continues the process of evaluating class roles, class definitions, and class desirability to ensure that each class provides value in group and raid situations. Moreover, we have found that the term &quot;class balance&quot; is a term that means many different things to different people and we believe that it's more accurate to define our goal in another way. <br />
<br />
We believe at its core, each class should be fun and have a desirable role in raid and group situations and it is to this standard that we will hold our evaluations as EQ continues to grow and evolve. <br />
<br />
We have begun the process by looking into group roles. We plan to take a look at raid roles after we have finished with groups. We are looking at what each class has to offer in a group setting, how useful and viable that role is and finally, how well they perform these duties. The team is currently reviewing extensive data from live servers to make sure that the conclusions we make are as accurate as possible. Once we have data that we can share, we will ask for your input and insight on our conclusions. <br />
<br />
Our goal is to identify the underlying reasons behind any problems we uncover and we may find it necessary to make fundamental changes to the game to address them. As we move forward with this process, we will keep the community apprised of our findings and gather their input on the changes we feel need to be made to make players of all classes in EverQuest feel useful as they fulfill roles that are interesting and fun to play. We would like you to be part of these discussions and help us to determine the shape of classes in EverQuest's future. <br />
<br />
Thank you for you time and for being a part of this wonderful world that is Norrath. As an initial step in this process, while we are gathering data, we're going to host a live chat between players and the developers to begin this discussion. We will announce the time and date for the chat in the next few days. <br />

BTW, I hope SoE will keep the line &quot;Warriors should and will always tank better than knights&quot;. I hope that Wiz will get their DPS back to compete with rogue; I hope that monks will get back thier first puller back; and that zerker will get some effectiveness.</div></div><hr />

Most likely what will happen is 6 months of saying that things are being developed, then some stupid change, like giving druids some lower level stat buffs like beastlords, then nothing. A month will pass by, then they will roll out the new carrot for people to try desperately to hold onto hope over.</div></div><hr />

If rogues get their DPS nerfed(/other classes get upgraded) you can bet that either warrior tanking is going to be nerfed down to knight level, or knights will be upgraded.<br />
<br />
Of course, the other explaination (that this is a smokescreen to try and stop people quitting for WoW/EQ2/CoH/GW/etc. until the next expansion is due) is about an order of magnitude more likely, IMO.</div></div><hr />
