<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had recently started to re-level my warrior. He originally was 65th and had 90 AAs. Anyway as I hit 51st, 55th and 59th I got the feeling that some of my abilities were not working. I have CF 3 but I did not notice an increase in my crits at 55th. I have flurry 2 and after 30 mins of straight fighting I haven't seen a single flurry. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a problem or been through this? Will petitioning help? Is there anythig I can do? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drizault</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well first off, the only Alternate Abilities you lose from deleveling are the ones you have to activate, IE the ones that require buttons. You are not noticing any more flurries or crits than before, because you always had the same level of those aa's working, regardless of your level. Any GM will tell you this if you petition and ask them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you saying you leveled to 65, gained 90 AA and then deleveled to 51 to then start leveling back up to 65?<br />
<br />
If so, yes you may find passive AA not working since the patch almost 3 months ago to install checks into the game.  There were so many &quot;level 65 with 100 + AA in passive abilities&quot; killing nag/vox solo that I guess they needed to prevent this by adding checks to disable passive AA abilities that require levels that the character no longer has.  What this means is that if you have LR5/ID5, but are currently level 52, then you don't have access to LR5/ID5/CA3/CS3/PE or any other purchased level 55, 60, or 65 abilities passive or activated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khur sed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The fix wasn't to prevent people from farming nag/vox, it was mostly to prevent people on pvp server to delevel, and DESTROY people of the same level, but with no aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Flurry does NOT work at lvl 59 on a berserker at least. I bought 2 ranks of it and never saw a single flurry untill 60, then it was the norm. I'd guess the same true for warriors.</div></div><hr />
