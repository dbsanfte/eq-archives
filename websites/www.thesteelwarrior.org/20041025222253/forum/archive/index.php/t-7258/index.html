<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angry_Tank01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering what kindda numbers you all had for your first Quarm kill, and what your lowest numbers were for a kill?<br />
<br />
We're currently wiping on him at 30% with about 55 =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think our lowest is low 60s but hes definately doable with 55.  After you get him below 25% aes are basically not even an issue.  Look at your tactics a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looked at our DKP history and our lowest number of mains was 40 people, but we probably had a few multicomped for the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Around 40 people for lowest # kill. =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">http://www.buchionline.jp/~asura/<br />
<br />
21 players, rest were boxed on their first kill (21/45)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">71 on First Kill ....<br />
108 on 2nd Kill .... (Every retired member just poped back)<br />
<br />
55 i think Lowest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">70'ish for first kill, around 40 for lowest numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am sure our first kill was 72, lowest was 44 toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">108 on 2nd Kill<br />
<br />
I'm confused. 108?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">seems all about having a cleric to group heal. havent tried it yet, but i would think a few druids could heal the MT and let all your clerics group heal.<br />
<br />
you can joust the dot aes which are pretty mean. easy to get unlucky with multiple 3k ae though, especially if a head explodes right after a 3k ae. some ppl are able to avoid them but there doesnt look like any way u can guarantee it for everyone.<br />
<br />
had 1 person find a sweet spot so he could hit quarm and never get a single ae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well lets see ...<br />
<br />
The Average 70..<br />
The 15 Very Casuals that all showed up on the same evening<br />
The 15 Retired that all decided to come back for one night<br />
And  some Bots <br />
<br />
Yup 108 :)<br />
<br />
Now we did have a shitload of people sitting in PoTA waiting.<br />
But thats another story</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How did you get more than 72 into potb?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">72 ish (prob less tho cause i'm sure someone was afk or something!)at kill with some two boxxed buffers outside first few kills<br />
<br />
Least? 50-55 &quot;toons&quot; Including people two boxxed, i dont know how many actual people tho prob was 45ish? doesnt raelly matter tho some types of chars are retardly easy to bot so it doesnt prove much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>uniad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">High 40's very low 50's.<br />
<br />
UNIAD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We generally run in the 60's now sometimes higher depending on the day. Lowest we have killed Quarm was with 51 and if I remember it was late and went very smooth.<br />
<br />
Time still is our number one resource for points so people generally like to make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm confused. 108?<br />
<br />
Canadian math.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">60ish for first kill<br />
<br />
36 for lowest kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grongl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">72 plus too many in timea for first kill.<br />
<br />
48 was lowest I think.<br />
<br />
Usually 55-60 these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">think 54 was lowest. we actually had less deaths than with full raids for some odd reason, think we were more on the ball with that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">our first kill of quarm was with 64 people? i think , dropped the 3 most common items too &gt;=(</div></div><hr />
