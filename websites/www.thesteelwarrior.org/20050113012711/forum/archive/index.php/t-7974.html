<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=832823&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=832823&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />
<br />
I have a decent group capable of downing BoT Tlords and equivalent, most are partly Time geared, and half are KT flagged. Bascially I am looking for ways to use this warrior more and find his greatest weakness is his ability to hold aggro. Also what are considered to be the best aggro augs for War -  marble sphere of ire?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your guild is Time/KT flagged, you could easily get 2/3 groups together and kill AoW for a BoC.<br />
<br />
One group can easily take out the dragon in PoI for the Cord Hilted Spike Driver.<br />
<br />
One group can easily take out the water tower boss (as you know..) for the sword there, forget what it is called.<br />
<br />
One and half to 2 groups can easily kill cursed for a Bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
One group can kill Seru for a BBB (quality 2hander).<br />
<br />
Another 2hander drops in Sol Ro tower that is -decent- and would probably hold aggro -decently- when augmented.<br />
<br />
-Edit-  Oh yeah, forgot.  Weapon Affinity helps alot with aggro, providing you have a weapon that procs enough hate..</div></div><hr />

<br />
BoC- Buy it or kill AoWarr<br />
<br />
CHSD- from xanamech is decent<br />
<br />
Or you could just buy the droga combo as they will be better for aggro than what you presently have.</div></div><hr />

You really need to get some perspective. I dont' think I know 6 people I could throw together to 1 group Xana--if you can find 6 who can no doubt you will soon be getting much better gear anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I raid some but my guild is pre-elem and we don't do ssra (little interest in doing keys and good named die fast there).  Anyway, I use the already mentioned Great Blade of Storms with an anger aug as my primary.  I also racked up LDoN points to buy a club of the mad researcher (EF, 1150 pts, 15/20 1hb) with a +2 dmg aug (takish, 1150 pts) and a 600 hate aug (EF, 1150 pts).  So for 3450 points you end up with a 17/20 1hb with 600 hate proc.  <br />
<br />
I have little trouble holding aggro.</div></div><hr />

Difficulty is approximately equal.</div></div><hr />
