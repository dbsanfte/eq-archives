<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the space thread has gotten me into a &quot;sciency&quot; mood.<br />
<br />
So for those interested in this topic I will go over it a bit here as best I understand it and then I will put a link down below to the site where I got a lot of my info.<br />
<br />
Antimatter is basically a different form of matter.  In Einstien's famous formula E=MC^2, or in lamens terms the desk your computer is sitting on is actually pure energy stored in a material form.  Antimatter is the key that when touching matter unlocks its hidden superenergetic properties.  Just to give you an idea of the shear amount of power 1 gram is enough make some of the world's largest nuclear bombs look like a hicup. <br />
<br />
1 kilogram is aprox 2.2lbs<br />
1 kilogram is 1000 grams<br />
1 gram = 0.00220462262 lbs<br />
<br />
get the picture?<br />
<br />
your desk probably has enough pent up energy to blow this world clean out its own arse and then some.<br />
<br />
now i am sure your thinking wow what a great energy source (and yes its very clean energy). but the problem is that we have no known pockets of antimatter for us to use.  we have to produce it.  the process of producing it is essentially expending a similar amount of energy to make it.  <br />
<br />
aka, antimatter doesn't break the golden ratio. which is to say it cost more energy then it produces. but then no energy source known to man has broken that ratio.  the simple fact is that oil, wood, etc are all energy productions that give off less useful energy then we used producing the energy in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now you may be asking why the hell do we do it then?<br />
<br />
the answer is we move energy around in conveniant forms, lighter, smaller, and more powerfull is better. So as you can see antimatter is potentially a great energy source.  The only problem is that at the moment it takes quite a bit of upkeep cost containing the antimatter and preventing in from going poof BOOM.  Luckily we have only been working with antimatter on a particle level thus far producing anti-protons and anti-electrons etc...<br />
<br />
thats in depth enough for me you can check here (http://livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/) for the rest...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlike matter which conforms to other laws of physics that can be demonstrated; antimatter is the lack of demonsrating the non-existance of matter if it could exist<br />
<br />
with math; anything is possible. practice beyond the caculator is where the problems exist.<br />
off-topic a bit; i've been doing a bunch of reading on the differences of schwartzchild and kerr black holes and how their singularities can be interpreted. in theory; it's right as rain. sadly; the only way they come into play is through speculation into 'holes' in the universe where light seems to not escape from. we really have no idea what it is at this time beyond x-ray and gamma ray readings that somehow show a dense object that seems to engulf everything around it ( example of this is Cygnus X-1, a binary system which is probabally one of the most famous of these types of areas )<br />
<br />
I forget where the link was as well; but didn't some lab in europe create a 'black hole' within a lab enviroment that lasted a nanosecond or something?<br />
i guess along where the antimatter idea comes into play; the closest we can come to create these anomalys are nanosecond existing and defy the whole idea of capturing their force for any type of realistic use.<br />

too much tea this morning :D sorry for the typing and extra use of semicolons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Antimatter exists as a synthesizable material - There's multiple laboratories that are capable of producing both positrons - anti electrons, and anti-protons. These can and have been stored for the short and mid-terms in magnetic containment units. Production in quantity is an entirely different matter, however. So is production and storage of anti-atoms: While a positron and an anti-proton can come together to make anti-hydrogen, this is an electrically neutral, and thus uncontainable, structure. <br />
<br />
Currently, like many other objects of pure science, it's a matter of sheer expense that prevents development of anti-matter technology from the science.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to most symmetric theories, such as superstring, all particles have both real and anti counterparts. Its sorta like taking every particles mathematic representation and multiplying by -1. So there is an electron and a anti-electron (positron). I believe that both have been observed along with many other anti particles in the big smashers as well as a few attempts to contain anti particles in a EM field that have proved successful.<br />
<br />
This is all off the top of my head, so some of it may be wrong as I haven't read anything lately about modern physics in a few months. And to be quite frank, without a complete mathematic understanding of these theories, I have hard time keeping my science fiction from my science fact.</div></div><hr />

If they were I'm sure you wouldn't know about it~</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Isn't the airforce working on developing anti matter weapons?<br />
<br />
The world yearly production of antimatter is roughly 10^-8 grams. This is enough to light your desk lamp for maybe an hour or two. And, when the production ramps up? Well, these kind of weapons have a name : Photon Torpedos~</div></div><hr />

Haven't taken any advanced physics, a little was slightly over my head. Luckliy it's not an art director job requirement.</div></div><hr />

Good read oh my!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-12-2005, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most of the interesting stuff in sciences and such aren't teached in college. I got both my engineering and my applied mathematics diplomas two years ago, and they gave little to me (especially the math one, I really don't care now to be able to prove the uniqueness and the existence of the solution of the 2D incompresible navier stokes equation). All that is interesting comes from side options that help for graduation or personnal reading in some field of interest (like you Shik).</div></div><hr />
