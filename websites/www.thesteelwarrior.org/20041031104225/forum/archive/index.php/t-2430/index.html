<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi , i just received one of these last night , and i am wondering how the aggro on the proc is.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its a tad bit of aggro, procs often tho from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not great agro, but decent enough. Will be behind the +agro and dd/stun weapons. Ahead of Frostbringer etc stuff though. Resident runt guildmate(though he's 65 now, maybe can't call him that anymore) uses Scimmy + Whip of Unending Pain(Torment, basically Tunare whipe +1 dmg) and when grouped with me on my rogue he has absolutely zero agro problems. When I box shaman for slows/dots he generally doesn't have much trouble either. With your mainhand it should work perfectly until you get an EB weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i used one for a while cause i was MIA during our Cursed and AoW farming, and i absolutely hated it. couldn't aggro for crap in PoP exp groups, much less on bosses... but i was using a glyphed whip before that so i had to get something.<br />
<br />
got kinda old having to ask fellow guildies on the raids &quot;hey can i borrow your BoC for the next 4 hours?&quot;<br />
<br />
and i had a bonechiller (non aggro weapon) in offhand, which didn't help much.<br />
<br />
100hp 15/19 is a good offhander tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lelara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey warriors,<br />
<br />
I was wondering how's the DPS for the OSoW?<br />
Honestly speaking, I would like to someday get it for a good offhand weapon, if it's good in the first place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you want dps go 2h. Great Staff of 4 Winds would do more damage easily then vz scimmy and pretty much anything else you can obtain at that level to pair with it. Pretty easy to get as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Scimitar is ugly. /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not good enough for main hand - having said that I pulled aggro off a 65 warrior (i was 63)whilst mainhanding it in a DPS set up. He had an EB proc, within 5 seconds or so I got a double proc and the mob flipped to me, there have been a couple of occasions where I flipped a mob off an MA with this scimitar.<br />
<br />
Underrated imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">underrated? no. I can safely say that after several months using it and a bonechiller in VT/PoP.<br />
<br />
I had better aggro tanking bosses in VT with a TSBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm offhanding it with a BBotE mainhanded. The proc is plenty enough to get and keep aggro if you're pingponging with a monk or something, but unless it procs a few times it's nothing special. Even offhand, though, it procs quite a bit. It's not EB, but it's a step up from midrange aggro weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i see it pull agro all the time, just a matter of whether it or i proc first though.<br />
<br />
dunno why you dont like the looks, think it has one of the best graphics in game, would gladly take it over the warped looking bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;I was wondering how's the DPS for the OSoW?&quot;<br />
Err.... i misread this :) Thought you asked for how the aggro is.</div></div><hr />
