It pains me to say it but we went from the best class, community wise, as in it was rare to see a complaint, to where the warrior board literally has 2 entire forums dedicated to complaining and all the other forums are filled with it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know why people are whiny?  Because we're pissed off to have been brushed off by SoE for as long as we have.  Do you think SoE refused all class balance questions at the Fan Faire because everything is sweetness and nice in the EQ world?  There have always been class balance issues of one kind or another, yet has SoE ever before refused to discuss class balance at all?  Why might that be? Could it be because they've screwed the pooch and don't have any answers on how to solve it nor have they even been looking until recently because they were too focused on the next batch of Hybrid and Caster upgrades to come out in LDoN?<br />
<br />
I don't know Coray.  I don't recall him ever posting on this board with his version of the situation.  While he may play a Warrior, I have a hard time respecting the opinion of someone who would rather judge from a distance than come into the room and talk the matter over.  And even if he thinks we're too whiny, his opinion is not the end all to the world.  Frankly, given the amount of attention SoE has actually given the problem to date, I could make the arguement we haven't been whiny enough.<br />
<br />
SoE won't make changes if we just STFU and keep our issues to ourselves.  We've done that for four years and look where it has gotten us.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's it Varaho.  It has nothing to do with the fact that we have valid complaints that have gone undressed for a year while people stand back and call us whiny.  It has everything to do with my being pwnd by people calling me whiner IR.  <br />

Apparently there's a patch October 9th.  Basically they're removing the ability to put the 20 hp/mana, 40mana and 40hp (I think) items on LDoN equipment.  Apparently you can put multiple items resulting in much better equipment than normal.  They're going to be re-adding similar items for all non-LDoN equipment, so if you had these items on non-LDoN equipment, you'll have to do some trading out (adventure points are being refunded, but you have to turn the items in) but you should still be able to get the augments.  All pre-LDoN items are gaining a slot 7 instead of a slot 1.<br />
<br />
Also according to an older announcement, they'll be adding the ability to put augments on deity-restricted armor.</div></div><hr />

&quot;other than to say that Warriors are really making me sad lately at how whiny they've become.&quot;<br />
<br />
You know it's bad when warriors are called whiny.<br />
<br />
I mean obviously that statement should read &quot;other than to say that MONKS are really making me sad lately at how whiny they've become&quot;<br />
<br />
or &quot;other than to say that NECROS are really making me sad lately at how whiny they've become&quot;<br />
<br />
or &quot;other than to say that CHANTERS are really making me sad lately at how whiny they've become&quot;<br />
<br />
or &quot;other than to say that MAGES are really making me sad lately at how whiny they've become&quot;<br />
<br />
or &quot;other than to say that DRUIDS are really making me sad lately at how whiny they've become&quot;<br />
<br />
The funny part about all this is that people come troll a class message board looking for heat ... get flamed and suddenly everyone thinks that class messageboard is filled with whiners.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if it's any consolation, you all have a long, LONG way to go before you unseat the monks as EQ's most notorious whiners. Everyone visits MB to say &quot;OMG monk stop whining! Everyone thinks you're all whiners! And I come here to your message board and you won't stop whining! So everyone is gonna think you're all whiners!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">no thanks, I'd rather not repeat the same arguments again =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, 95% of all warriors are complaining and asking for class balance for the first time ever in EQ history. But this guy, Coray, and some others like him, disagree and call the other 95% majority 'whiners'. Most of these people's toons have 7.5k unbuffed hp, a BoW and whatnot. They don't need improvements as badly as the rest 95% do. These people probably never go LFG and deal with pickup groups like the rest do. IMO these people are really selfish, stupid and traitors to the community. <br />
<br />
Furor says the Warrior class is broken and that knights are seriously overpowered, almost all Warriors are asking for SOE's help. Yet you see prodigal crap like this. It would be nice of such people if they just STFU instead on this matter for the time being. We know YOU are uber and don't need help like the rest do, there are other ways to express that. Don't hurt the effort of the majority. Complaining a lot is the only way SOE listens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I basically agree with Coray.  Yes the warrior class could use some loving, but honestly things arent really that far out of balance.  The warrior class is still a fun one to play and I still enjoy EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Warriors aren't &quot;just&quot; whiny....but there's no doubt that they are whiny.<br />
<br />
I agree with his statement except for the part about &quot;the other forums are full of it&quot;.  I take great pride in my ninja-moving whining to the war room and I take offense to that statement at least :cool:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It is pretty sad that complaining ALOT is the only way things change with SOE.  How many times have you seen them use the defense &quot;we haven't heard that many complain about it&quot; to say that something doesn't need to be fixed.<br />
<br />
For myself, I don't personally feel all that underbalanced. . .however, if I were someone that was in the position where I had to scrounge for pickup groups all day, I'm sure I would have switched to a paladin long ago.  I mean, paladins are far superior to a warrior in an exp group and have been for awhile.  There isn't really a reason to be a warrior in an exp group unless you're playing with a group of friends (as you should!) in which case any tank will do absoultely fine.  <br />
<br />
Frankly, I still think it's fun to be on the bottom, doing ok, with perhaps something to look forward to.  I realize my experience is different than alot of other warriors, but from my perspective, that's how I see it.<br />
<br />
I like being on the bottom!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly the best way to cut down whining posts to quit slinging whiner around like it is the new n-word.<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently people are using the word whiner in a derogatory way  as an attempt to silence people, much like children in grade school. The effect it has however, is exactly the opposite on most people because it is an inflammatory statement. As you all know inflammatory statements generate more statements.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in short: Saying &quot;Stfu whiner!!1!&quot; will not silence people, it will only cause them to get louder and lash out in more directions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">someday soon we will get sick of being called inflammatory remarks and lash out the likes of which have never been seen by god himself.<br />
<br />
There are 2 ways to do things ... 1:  Anger introvert.  You store up all the anger you have inherant within yourself, ready to unleash on the world when you finally reach your breaking point.  2:  Anger Extrovert.  Someone does soemthing you dont like, you take action, or yell, scream and whine till its made right, or corrected in a way you find satisfactory.<br />
<br />
Which would you rather us be.  The kind of people that beg, whine and plead for a change before its too late.<br />
<br />
Or the type that waits till its too late, then goes apeshit on a bell tower in downtown Washington randomly shooting people in the street till either the entire city is dead or an F-16 drops a cluster bomb on him for the greater good of the population.<br />
<br />
Im gonna vote for option 2: anger extrovert, and scenario 1, whining about something till its fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>thaumasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">dammit, i wanna wear a ribbon that reads &quot;im a whiner and im proud!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure I enjoy playing my war, else id be playing something else.  I played a pally to 60 and a monk to 64 so I can see both sides of this.  BUT war's need something to change, has nothing to do with whining, just a true, valid represenation of the current class balance.  Warriors just need a little &quot;oomph&quot; to make them the BEST tanks in the game as if you believed the class descriptions they were meant to be.<br />
<br />
Still, this close to EQ2 I don't really believe that we will ever see a major change to this situation..... prove me wrong please SOE?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a gross exaggeration.<br />
<br />
The Outhouse was created as an outlet for frustration...that is its purpose..I'd hope that some &quot;whining&quot; takes place.<br />
<br />
The Class Balance forum is dedicated to that...class balance.  Probably folks should be a bit more constructive but we've seen a nice flood of the &quot;1-10 post pallie troll wonders&quot; in this forum; that tends to schew responses towards the negative.<br />
<br />
The other forums are hardly &quot;filled with it&quot;.  There is still lucid and focused discussion of subjects in those forums.<br />
<br />
Just because this fellow claims something to be true doesn't mean it is.  What amazes me is that he would make a statement like this and we just readily fall into refuting it....gotta call a spade a spade...this kind of statement has an agenda behind it.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we get some well thought out solutions to the actual problems, which are the 'stackability' of warriors, and the utility of monks. For warriors a major issue is simply that it doesn't make sense to have more than x number, the rest are virtual dead weight for example on raids. After 2 warriors or whatever, you'd be a lot better off having more rogues. <br />
<br />
He doesn't even mention &quot;agro/taunt&quot; as an issue.  Apparantly he reads this board *real* well.</div></div><hr />

While you may be the center of your own universe, you're certainly not the center of everyone else's.  And just because reading it makes you unhappy is no reason for anyone else to change.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No it's actually a fact. There has been a 700% increase in whining over the past year or so. There was a study done by the American Red Cross.<br />
<br />
And actually I know it's a fact because there is a hell of a lot more whining than there was 2 years ago. Two years ago it was the paladins and SKs whining so much. I used to play a Paladin as my main and switched to a warrior, not because I whined but because I wanted to be a better tank! There was no need for an &quot;Outhouse&quot; forum. There just really wasn't nearly as much bitching.<br />
<br />
Don't ever take the game too seriously. It is just a game afterall. Play the game and don't let it play you. That's one thing I learned after taking a two month break.</div></div><hr />

This is my opinion.  Anyone that wants to debate the definition of whining or exactly whether they are personally a whiner, please keep it to yourself.  If you quote every line of this post and make a rebuttal to each one, I will be forced to unleash a FLURRY of something or other on you.<br />

He needs a slow..BOOM he slows. he Needs Aggro..He controls his group's aggro. He needs DPs..BOOM he got burst dps.<br />
<br />
Yeah, he's a hydra but from one standpoint he's in a perfect world where all of his group's actions can be controlled by himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Yeah, he's a hydra but from one standpoint he's in a perfect world where all of his group's actions can be controlled by himself.<br />
<br />
I agree, which is why I would say his evaluation isn't very worthwhile, because he can time it all down to a science.  I can't see how a normal group would ever be able to duplicate that, even when they played together regularly.  They might get close, but they couldn't match it, I would think.<br />
<br />
After all, our problem isn't that people can't compensate when we tank.  It's that they don't want to have to.  And they often pay a penalty when they do.  Sam can far more easily compensate because it isn't difficult to predict what he's going to do next (unless of course he has some kind of multiple personality thing going on :D ).<br />

For example, I'll double box my Warrior and my Cleric when I don't feel like going LFG.  And I know exactly when my Warrior has sufficient aggro on a mob that my Cleric can land a CH and not get aggro.  Would another third party have as much ability to be able to predict this?  I would think most of the time they wouldn't.  So basing the game around what I can successfully accomplish, with all the variables under my control, doesn't seem a very reasonable approach to me.</div></div><hr />
