<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Soo....im working my way towards getting the Tak armor legs since ornate seems so hard to come by.  I would like some advice on what augments i should throw on em.  I already plan on putting the +40hp augment from Tak in the type 2 slot, just not sure what to put in the other 2 slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Isn't that a type 7 augment? The 40 hit point one?<br />
<br />
How you gonna fit that on the legs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Glowing Spere of Courage: 40hp, type2, 1150 Ruj<br />
Pristine Limestone of Haterd: Veng IV, type3, 1150 Guk<br />
<br />
For type 1 you can raise any one stat or resist by 10, or raise 2 stats or resists by 8 or raise fr, mr, cr by 5. Whatever you are lacking. Or go with the dropped 12hp or 15hp augs. With Royal Attendent (Can we come up with an acronym here?) not having any dex in any slot, 10dex may be the way to go if you are getting the whole set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kavariel Baenre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One recommendation:<br />
<br />
type 3 = Vengence IV<br />
type 2 = 40hp<br />
type 1 = leave open until you win a 15hp aug (all/all) on an EC/Guk hard adventure</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 3 different types of +40 HP augments :<br />
<br />
Radiant Coal of Prowess (Mir 1150)<br />
Aug8 HP:40<br />
All races - Head, Arm, Chest, Leg, Feet <br />
<br />
Solid Coal of Prowess (Ruj 1150)<br />
Aug7 HP:40 <br />
All races - Head, Arm, Leg, Chest, Feet <br />
<br />
Glowing Saphire of Courage (Tak 1150)<br />
Aug2 HP:40<br />
All races - Head, Arm, Wrist, Hand, Chest, Leg, Feet<br />
<br />
(info taken from the LDON Merchant Sorting Script) (http://www.squidbox.com/skp/eq/ldon/list.cgi))<br />
They all cost the same amount of AP though, so pick and choose as you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Side note, but pretty sure 15hp and 15mana augs drop in any hard theme, had both in EF yesterday at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, I wouldn't blow the 1400 points for tak legs. The everfrost legs are half price, with 4 ac and 15 hp less. <br />
<br />
Now, this is comming from someone that can't adventure much... so it may not apply to you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I took the MM legs...havent looked back yet :) <br />
<br />
I can say, get the Tak opened up early though. Sitting on 1800 points and no Tak armor is both frustrating and stupid. :(<br />
<br />
I will be at 2100 before my first piece...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Binnamar.<br />
<br />
Mir 760  Malevolent Greaves of Suffering<br />
AC:44, Sta:8, Cha:8, Wis:5, Int:5, HP:70, Mana:65, CR:10, MR:10, type1,type2,type3  <br />
<br />
Tak 1492  Royal Attendant Greaves of the Sand<br />
AC:48, Str:10, Wis:6, Int:6, Agi:10, HP:85, Mana:80, FR:13, DR:13, type1,type2,type3  <br />
<br />
15 adventures for 6 svs, 4 ac, and 15 hps doesn't seem like a good use of time to me.  Also, the Miragul pants have +8 sta/cha, which most people would consider more useful than the 10 str on the tak legs.<br />
<br />
Use those tak points to get the 40 hp aug for the Miragul legs.  That's what I'd do anyway.  For the points the Tak legs would cost, you can get the miragul legs and be 8 adventures from the 40hp aug for them.<br />
<br />
Also if you want to get anger III you will need the miragul points anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tak legs are broken IMO, as are the Everfrost BPs, due to the missing STA.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you're always shammy buffed, the STA doesn't matter.  Ever then unless you Adventure like mad, I think the Everfrost armor it the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The dropped 12/15 hp augs don't fit on Royal Attendant armor.  HP augs (and mana but warriors don't care about that) are type 7.  You can only put regular stat and resist augs in slot one of all Royal Attendant armor.<br />
<br />
I have the Royal Attendant BP and put a MR aug in slot 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Btw, what does type 7 fit on?<br />
<br />
I should know, but I think I forgot...<br />
<br />
All the LDON item stuff is 1, 2, 3...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Type 7 is for everything, except weapons, that's not either bought with LDoN points or dropped in PoTime. That's everything from your newbie tunic to elemental type gear.</div></div><hr />
