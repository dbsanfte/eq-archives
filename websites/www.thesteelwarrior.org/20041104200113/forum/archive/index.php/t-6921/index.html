<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Everyone,<br />
I am now looking to get back into the planes and upgrade my gear. I don't normally get to play during the raid hours and am currently unguilded since I changed jobs. Given that, what are my chances of getting a GBoS? Is that an item that I can get to only via a raid or is it something a group can do? I have read on the boards that this should be a weapon any warrior should be able to get with a little effort and time so I thought it would be a great place to start and make a nice upgrade for me. Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mini raid can get pretty easy, ie 2 groups.  just need 2 clerics and a slower and its not to bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just checked your Mangelo and I don't really think you need it to be honest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Cimmar, GBoS isn't that big an upgrade for you at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i agree ... its not worth the hassle for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, it may not be an upgrade for him or worth the hassle but It would be for me :)  So feel free to goahead and offer answers/advice to his original question for my benifit. :) LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL, are you the Gaylon of Torv (cause I'm at work and can't look at your 'gelo)?  That name cracks me up.  I'm sorry.  Someone mentioned your name in /gu the other day.  GBoS is a good warrior weapon and fairly easy to get (EP/TIme/GoD guild could do with 2 groups I would assume, maybe even 1.  Assuming that you are not this level because why would you want it anyways if you could get better stoof, 3-4 groups would be trivial.).  The dude also isn't too  bad to kill since he can drop ornate plate BPs.  His other loots suck iirc.  Like a knight shield or something.  Since I can't see you Magelo at work, I think I remember see you packing a BoC and a CHoS.  GBoW &gt; CHoS but by how much?  I wouldn't go through the hassle unless you and some friends wanna go for it, or there is an open towers raid or some crap going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh yeah, and I think the dude that drops the GBoS has an AE mana drain that the casters can stay out of range to avoid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">he is doable with 4 enchs a warrior and a cleric .... i know that much for sure  :D <br />
