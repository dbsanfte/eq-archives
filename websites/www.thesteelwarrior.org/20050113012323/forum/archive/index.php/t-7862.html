<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, dropped Corinav a few days ago, now we just gotta take a serious look at Rathe and drop him, and my guild is in Time. My guild is DKP, so I need to make my purchases count.<br />
<br />
To that end, I've been tuning my Time wishlist.<br />
<br />
To the Time+ level warriors, can you take a look at my wishlist here:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=256610&amp;alt=157883<br />
<br />
and critique?<br />
<br />
Looking for several things:<br />
<br />
Top three priorities in no particular order: Avoidance, AC, Shielding.<br />
<br />
Is there anything i'm missing, or can I do better with the three priorites I've identified?<br />
<br />
Secondly, which items on this list are extremely rare, other than DBoTW, that I may need to settle for an alternative, and if so, what'sa good alternative?<br />
<br />
Thanks folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The biggest danger in a DKP guild is upgrading and then replacing that item again, soon. For that reason:<br />
<br />
Don't discount GoD drops. The Glyphed Prayer Ring and Jointed Scale Greeves are not that far out of reach. Your legs a bad enough that they do need replacing, but if you can possibly get Jointed Scale Greeves, thaey are a better choice.<br />
<br />
Don't totally ignore Q'Vic and beyond. Since you already have a Raex Helm, I probably wouldn't bother with a Helm of Flowing Time. There isn't that big of an improvement and a Vadd Helm is much better (IMO). The same might be true of your Raex Boots and Gauntlets.<br />
<br />
You might also want to take a look at the first few Phases of PoTime. There are one or two worthwhile drops and you will be doing those phases a whole lot.<br />
<br />
I'm happy for yas. PoTime is a lot of fun mastering and your guild is about to gear-up significantly.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting the Helm from PoTime really isnt a big of a deal if you have raex, esp. if you have a decent bracer.<br />
<br />
Don't count on getting multiple Quarm drops -- many guilds have a limit to how many you can earn, etc etc.  I made my list with only one quarm drop -- the bracer.  I figure by the time Quarm hits farm status, I'll have most of my items anyway on my wish list (placed in my profile, if you want to compare.  I'm going to change to VZ orb over saryrn, but other than that I kept what I'm at).<br />
<br />
My suggestion to you would be to stick with the Raex Helm (since the helm of flowing time will only be an &quot;upgrade&quot; by allowing you to swap out your haste item, but the only worthwhile bracer is from Quarm, so its not something you can expect to get any time soon).  Then, keep your earthen energy bracer, and if you do get the quarm bracer put that in place of your haste until you get a better haste item.  Also note that the earring of corporeal essence has haste, and is better than one of the earrings you listed (I just noticed this, gotta swap my shoulders now lol)<br />
<br />
For face, I went with the 60ac 170hp Faceguard of Frenzy over the 52ac 195hp berserker visor that you went for.  You lose out on 15 total saves, 15cha, 10atk and 25hp, but you gain 8 raw AC and since it comes from an earlier phase, it really can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Keep Raex over the gloves of airy mists.  40hp some saves and cha vs 10ac.  AC wins imo<br />
<br />
Ear, I'd put corporeal essence in over the celestial energy earring.  You can only have one form active at the same time, and form of the defense is what you'll want to use most often<br />
<br />
That's about it that I can see right now</div></div><hr />
