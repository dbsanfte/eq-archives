thats the most recent lucy link, the only thing looks warriorish is the exhultant bellow line.<br />
<br />
here's the good part, aa info pulled from the jan/06 test executable and lifted from graffe's. theres no classes listed, but some definitely look warriorish and are interesting, such as weapon affinity, heightened endurance, warlord's tenacity, etc. it will be disappointing if destructive force/whirling blades isnt a warrior ability, since it's a real rampage just under a different name and what our rampage should have been; since there are two identical ones with different names it seems as though they'll be going to two different classes. sturdiness will be given to every class no doubt. note rapid strikes, flurry under another name, which makes it sound as though it's intended for a class that doesnt currently have flurry(in other words, not for warriors). staggering shot will be nice, especially if works on red cons(i assume its warrior because only warrior's get kicks that stun afaik).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see any real &quot;wow&quot; skills for warriors there. A few fixes to skills we already have(longer range on shielding and upgraded kick) but all in all pretty /yawn. <br />
<br />
But I guess it would be a pretty hard to come up with stuff that will excite people on the 6th or 7th expansion :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a **** load of tasty Beastlord, Paladin, SK, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Mage stuff there and ****-all for warriors.<br />
<br />
- Extra HP? That should be innate over other classes and I wager it's open to all melee's at least.<br />
- Kicks that stun higher levels and do more damage. The bash one sounds like a paladin skill to add to their 2h-bash one.<br />
- Warlord's Tenacity.... will need to give a LOT of HP to be useful at all. At least 75% if not 90% of warriors are at least taking double 400s from their foes in exp groups.<br />
- Shield specialisation? Yeah we all use shields sooo much. Grats Paladins and SKs.<br />
- Extended range on /shield. Wow uber.<br />
- Rapid Strikes sounds like Flurry for other classes. Another of our nice skills no longer being remotely unique.<br />
- Intense Hatred sounds like it should be a warrior skill but it's been shown that DS's do not contribute to the wearer's hate and thus the naming of the skill is a misnomer.<br />
- Heightened Awareness is surely a monk skill. Note it says BLOCK. Bet it's designed for monks when pulling.<br />
- There's one there for hitting through a mob's defenses. Warriors already have this! It's Tactical Mastery so you can bet other classes will be getting yet another of our great skills.<br />
<br />
The only interesting one I see is Weapon Affinity. Increased Proc rates. Could be handy but it's once again enhancing the use of the RNG for aggro and will it stack with the Time-gear Combat Effects (sp?)? Also Increased Endurance Regen of course but it was pretty much a given that that was going to appear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions I would have had; things that seem in line with what they appear to be offering other classes in terms of utility and power...<br />
<br />
Mastery of Forms. Raises the skill cap for a weapon type. <br />
and/or<br />
Weapon Specialisation. Exactly like casters' specialisation. One for each weapon type. Only one can go over 50. Increases the chance to pass all checks (dual wield, triple attack etc etc) with that weapon type.<br />
<br />
Frenzied Stamina. Gives the warrior an immediate burst of Endurance but then freezes endurance regen for &lt;some period&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually it's quite hard to think of new stuff that doesn't either just ask for better versions of what we already have or impinge on caster abilities! I'm sure the list is not complete yet so let's cross our fingers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;and I wager it's open to all melee's at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
With what they did to Natural Durability, CA/LR, CS/ID ... I wouldn't be surprised if they offered the hp boosts to EVERYONE. Or hell just come right out and do it, and give em to casters ONLY.<br />
<br />
(sorry, I'm still bitter)<br />
<br />
&quot;- Shield specialisation? Yeah we all use shields sooo much. Grats Paladins and SKs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, grats clerics. They use shields. They bash. In fact they equip shields more than knights do.<br />
<br />
&quot;- Rapid Strikes sounds like Flurry for other classes. Another of our nice skills no longer being remotely unique.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hopefully monks can train that. :P<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know it'll piss some warriors off. But Flurry is probably the coolest damn AA I WISH I could train right now. And so it'd be nice for that wish to come true.<br />
<br />
&quot;- Heightened Awareness is surely a monk skill. Note it says BLOCK. Bet it's designed for monks when pulling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope so. I really do. However, one thing to keep in mind, with all the &quot;focus&quot; on shields lately ... OTHER classes are probably going to receive BLOCK in this upcoming expansion. So, maybe that's not just a monk one.<br />
<br />
&quot;- There's one there for hitting through a mob's defenses. Warriors already have this! It's Tactical Mastery so you can bet other classes will be getting yet another of our great skills.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe not. The way I read that, it seems like the EXACT description of the the warrior ability. Maybe they're just going to FIX that ability (this is taken from LUCY after all). And tweak it to where you do actually strike through their riposte and don't get hit yourself. Or something like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Weapon Specialisation. Exactly like casters' specialisation. One for each weapon type. Only one can go over 50. Increases the chance to pass all checks (dual wield, triple attack etc etc) with that weapon type.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd LOVE for the pure melees to each get something along those lines.<br />
<br />
Hand to Hand Mastery is an AA I've been calling for monks to get for ages, and would be similar to that.<br />
<br />
Heck, many people have wanted the SKILL CAPS to be raised for awhile. Maybe this could be a way to do that?<br />
<br />
Pick a weapon type, specialize in it, and suddenly your skill cap raises to 305 with that weapon (with monks getting the choice of hand to hand added to their 1hb or 2hb weapon skills).<br />
<br />
Would be neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd think shield specialization is only available to Warriors.  It really wouldn't make a lot of sense for anyone else to get this ability since it's either a freebie (all classes that normally use shield have no penalties for using a shield) or utterly pointless (monks, rogues, rangers, bards, etc).</div></div><hr />

pwned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of all of these the one that caught my eye was packrat:  additional stacking damage on all DS's.  That could be fairly powerful depending how it is implemented.<br />
<br />
Weapon affinity sounded cool too: more procs are good</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, Phantron suggests that Shield Specialization should only be available to Warriors because all other classes either A) Don't suffer penalties to use a shield, or B) Wouldn't use a shield anyway.<br />
<br />
Knights low DPS plummets even further when using 1H + Shield.  This sounds like a Knight ability as much as anything else on the list.  All three plate tank classes generally do not use shields.  It would be nice if this were part of a package to make shield use viable for those classes.<br />

<br />
It's listed as a monk ability.  Also it doesn't say it further increases it, they just basically gave TM to monks<br />
<br />
Interestingly, it appears they also gave monks flurry, only theirs is better than ours.  Ours requires a successful triple attack, monks only require a successful double attack.<br />
<br />
They also appearently gave rampage to monks.  So much fun losing 3 of our unique abilities and gaining little that is specific to warriors.  Of course they've been gradually giving away our uniqueness for a while now.</div></div><hr />

Heh heh heh.  Marginal = Didn't get it as a member of an &quot;elite&quot; guild in some place only we and our buds can go.<br />

Man, sometimes the unexamined arrogance of people can be breathtaking!!  You said that so matter-of-factly, like it was perfectly reasonable.<br />
<br />
EQ is changing, Ketel.  The vast majority of the paying customers do not belong to exclusive uber guilds.  Soon there will be many avenues for any long-term player to achieve what you have.<br />

I don't believe the game was intended to be EverLootz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
personally that bothers me being an excellent tank ( hpts/gear wise ) is no longer a matter of raiding hard with many people for long hours, but is now simply a result of spending much mundane time in LDoN or BoT grinding out AA points<br />
<br />
and the gap between the ubers and not grows smaller<br />
<br />
<br />
edit spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a flipside to this Baeaan ...<br />
<br />
Perhaps now, instead of one's tanking ability being TOTALLY gear dependent ... it'll start to become SKILL dependent.<br />
<br />
There was a time when a non-guilded warrior simply couldn't tank well at all. There were no good aggro weapons. People were debating between Black Blade of Tormenting and Frostbringer. <br />
<br />
And then there was the upper end of the spectrum. With Blade of Carnage or Luclin hate weapons.<br />
<br />
The gap was immense.<br />
<br />
And people complained about it. And one of the BIGGEST pleas warriors made was to have the TOOLS to do their job made AVAILABLE to them at all levels of the game, uber and non-uber alike.<br />
<br />
And now it seems those tools are becoming more and more available to the non-uber.<br />
<br />
Lay off Baeaan. Let people play the game for once and have some FUN. Let others feel POWERFUL. Let others ENJOY the game for once.<br />
<br />
How's it going to hurt YOU? You're still in your guild. You're still powerful. You're still having fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh?  I must've missed the part where the ubers can't get those AA abilities.  We'll just ignore the fact that they'll probably get them faster and will get more out of the ones that are a % boost based on unbuffed stats.  Clearly it isn't easy being uber.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Oh, and if the gap has decreased, I must've missed the point where I had negative hitpoints... Because that's where I would've been if they had me beat by 5khp a year ago.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is not meant as a blanket slam to ubers...  I think it's great you can do and get what you do.  Just give me the same respect.  My gear may be craptastic to some, but I've worked long and hard for it.</div></div><hr />

Now it's a matter of dungeon crawling for long hours with a few people.<br />
<br />
Back in the day..... (breaks out his pipe and stuffs it with Longbottom)...puff, puff, puff<br />
<br />
The developers at EQ were surprised by the whole &quot;Raiding&quot; phenomena.  They never anticipated or expected it, they said there were certain things they never really intended to be killed.<br />
<br />
But they started catering to it, built an interface and a system that made it integral, and a whole expansion designed for it.<br />
<br />
The whole game changed.  Us old skoolers remembered the excitement of the good, old dungeon crawl.  Back in the day, when holding the Green Room in Blackburrow with yer tattered armor and bear head cap was just as trying and difficult as raiding Vindi is today.  Even with dual wield, a shiny fine steel longsword *and* a Polished Granite Tomohawk.<br />
<br />
Don't be tempted to disparage LDoN as drudge, and characterize raiding as big fun.  Lot's of people dislike raiding, it also is a huge time sink.  Setup time, the inevitable mass wipe, the long rez and corpse retrievals.  All for one or two drops, which 12 of the 36 people in attendance all want.<br />
<br />
Many, many people love the single-group dungeon crawl, which was the hallmark adventure of this game in the beginning.<br />
<br />
How much talent does it *really* take to setup a Cheal rotation?<br />
<br />
It takes real finesse to drop a big boss in LDoN with one warrior, one monk, one druid, one necro, one rogue, and one beastlord.<br />
<br />
It's fun as hell to us old skoolers, and it's only fair.  Good loot and good abilities should not be the sole province of those who desire to dedicate the entirety of their lives to the game.<br />
<br />
You are no more skilled than any other warrior, simply by virtue of having 80 other people to help you get item a or item b.<br />
<br />
In LDoN you have 80 other people helping you also, they just help you sequentially.  And the reward is in precise and accurate ratio to effort, for everyone, with no favoritism and no politics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and the gap between the ubers and not grows smaller<br />
<br />
OK lets get back to reality here.<br />
1) No one in LDON gear is going to break 10K with this AA. Getting there is still going to take the Elementals or at least a totally farmed out VT.<br />
2) Being a 10K tank doesn't mean you are more skilled than the 8K or 9K tank beside you. It means you chose a guild/raiding force that accelerated that path.<br />
3) Uber-guilds are defined by skill, not the number of lemmings they have to throw at a mob, or the amount of time they farm an_uber_mob_01.<br />
<br />
Now I don't you, Baeaan, or your guild, but I do know a lot of idiots that are in Elemental guilds that don't know how to tank, but are attrition numbers for their raid forces, thus in better gear than I am. I don't really care for the most part, until someone has the mistaken impression that their gear makes these clowns superior. In some cases it is true, in many it is most definately not.</div></div><hr />

Did you read the description on Warlord's Tenacity?  You get more HP for 1 minute but it slowly goes away and you end up with less than you started with.

If its just current HP then it will be handy emergency heal type thing if you are about to get wasted. Doesnt really matter if it places a 1 minute HP dot on you.<br />

<br />
Nah.<br />
<br />
You're not thinking straight.<br />
<br />
LDoN and AA's take a lot of time too.<br />
<br />
Really, they do. For the casual player to GRIND through a suit of LDoN armor AND the augments ... it'll take them far longer than it would take a raid level player to gear up.<br />
<br />
All this does is give the non-raiding player an actual PATH to journey on. It gives them a carrot too. So they don't HAVE to join a guild to obtain the items.<br />
<br />
There is no longer a CEILING.<br />
<br />
That's all.<br />
<br />
It'll take a casual player far longer to become &quot;trivial&quot; than you seem to think. <br />
<br />
The hardcore players are the ones you need to worry about. Those are the ones who will get both the RAID GEAR AND the LDoN gear. Both the AAs AND the augments. Those are the ones that will make the game trivial.<br />
<br />
Not Johnny-Casual-Warrior who spends the next three months saving for ONE Anger 3 augment.</div></div><hr />

Lemme rephrase what I mean a little bit. This is turning into a game where gear = good. it's just trivializing it to the point where everyone has the gear, the hpts to the point where skill is really no longer a necessity. <br />
<br />
You make a good point, but it's not really a matter of skill.  There are many highly skilled warriors who don't have Planar gear.<br />
<br />
What it really comes down to is having the necessary loads of time available to be a part of a high-energy, fast moving uber guild.<br />
<br />
EQ ended up having a very broad appeal, I know lawyers who play, and they have about one hour a day to spare.<br />
<br />
Yet they pay the same dollars as everyone else.  Why then should they not have an avenue of some sort to permit them decent reward?<br />
<br />
I can only speak truly for myself, but even after I have full LDoN gear I seriously doubt I'll ever try to get into the Plane of Time.  Or any of the very high tier planes for that matter.<br />
<br />
I simply don't have the time, and I really don't have the patience or desire to spend two or three consecutive days on one mission.  No matter how sweet the loot.<br />
<br />
My prediction is the game will begin to segregate, and you'll have the classic uber gamers like yourself.<br />
<br />
Then there will be the second tier ubergamers who congregate in LDoN and the upcoming GOD instanced zones.<br />
<br />
In the final analysis, the classic ubers will have better gear.  But the second tier will be able, rightfully so, to be damn proud of their own exceptionally decent gear. <br />
<br />
They'll likely be good enough to jump into the occasional planar raid to fill any gaps, assuming they are flagged.</div></div><hr />

The integrity of the game, that's what. I'll readily admit EQ is the worst timesink I've ever seen - that's partly why I don't play anymore. But, if the game is not for you, there are many other games out there.</div></div><hr />

Ours requires a successful triple attack, monks only require a successful double attack. <br />
<br />
That's not true. I parsed and confirmed before that flurry only fires on a succesfull double and is independent of triple attack. In any case, it's impossible to say how much of an impact it has without knowing what the rate at which it fires is.<br />
<br />
As for sturdiness - it might be 500hp - but I would be suprised if it didn't stack with the durability AA's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As much as I hate to say it, I consider myself an excellent tank too.  I'm unguilded.  I'm a casual player.  I will never get close to the level of power that those in hte uber guilds will, even with the new additions and changes.<br />
<br />
Your long hours spent raiding will still get you so much more than the just-as-long-hours I spend (over a longer time-range) will get me.<br />
<br />
So get your uber whiner head out of your ass and grow up.<br />
(Note: I'm not complaining about what I am able to get - I l'm not complaining that I will never see PoTime. )<br />
<br />
Weapon Specialisation. Exactly like casters' specialisation. One for each weapon type. Only one can go over 50. Increases the chance to pass all checks (dual wield, triple attack etc etc) with that weapon type.<br />
<br />
THAT would be awesome!</div></div><hr />

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=865124&amp;alt=160344&quot;&gt;LDoN, mostly max hp&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
I didnt put in the 12hp augs in slot 3, because I dont think I'd do that even if I decided to go all out LDoN hp gear (namely because I just joined a time guild...).  That buffs to about 9.3k...all out HP augs, it will probably be 9.4 or 9.5.<br />
<br />
Just food for thought.<br />
<br />
Also, realize that that's assuming the warrior is tanking LDoN hard and got a LOT of the 15hp augs, and has max HP AAs...but it can be done.<br />
<br />
And if anyone here is going to say that its not a lot of work, realize that its over 1000 LDoN missions, which is damned well deserving of 10k hp in my book.</div></div><hr />

I've seen around 4-5 of them drop in the 220 or so LDoN missions I've done.  Unless drop rate is significantly higher for Hard (and they do not appear to be) having HP augments is more of a 'that'll be nice' but not something you can plan your gear around.  It'd be more practical to get Radiant Pebble of Perfection (20hp/20mana for 1150) in all slots then having a Pristine Garnet of Constitution on all slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suggesting that the integrity of the game is somehow dependent on the supremacy of 24/7/365 ubergamers being the only ones able to achieve high reward is vanity of the highest order.<br />
<br />
Surely you see how, even if unintentionally, you insult all those many folk (the vast majority) who do not play in uberguilds every waking moment.<br />
<br />
This game began as a dungeon-crawl, where raiding was not even an imagined let alone a planned element.  What is happening is a return to the original vision, while preserving the innovation of raiding for those who desire it.<br />
<br />
In the beginning the typical subscriber could play a couple hours a day and achieve the highest rewards possible in the game.  LDoN and the maturing AA abilities simply return to the game a semblence of that original reality.<br />
<br />
To suggest that only a fanatical obsession with the game equates to &quot;integrity&quot; displays a certain narrowness of vision.  Nothing is taken from the ubergamer in these changes, the success of those who walk a different road in this game is not levied from your hide.<br />
<br />
I see no rational reason to besmirch or deny others their enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you had walked that other road you'd still be playing the game and enjoying it.  I have for five years now, and see no reason to stop.  The time I spend is reasonable, the achievments I've accomplished many and proud.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I've found in raiding guilds (in my years of exp through multiple releases before PoP in raiding guilds) there usually 3-4 talented warriors...3-4 average warriors and a bunch of &quot;free rides&quot;.  Folks that garner DKP, talk crap about their gear, but then talk their ass from their elbow about how to tank.  <br />
<br />
Does that mean that these tier 2 and 3 warriors are &quot;skilled&quot; because they show up and follow directions from other people?  <br />
<br />
Whether the game is getting watered down or not is a whole different animal....I think the whole AAXP thing really has changed the game...odds are more AAS will again alter it.  But growth is good and growth and people is what keeps me in this game.</div></div><hr />

I would take the atk.<br />
<br />
the fact that casters got 355 and melee were left out is a disparity. The question is though, casters get wis &amp; int... but we have 4 stats that affect melee, and some of those are marginal at high values. I would not mind a pair of AA's that give Str,Sta and Dex,Agi boosts to 355, BUT make it 10 combined ranks of +5 each rank.. something like that. <br />
<br />
Now. A Stamina related AA that would be useful is this..<br />
<br />
Innate Durability- 5 ranks 3 AA each. Each rank of this ability increases the value of your Stamina in natural hps by 1 per. So at level 5 each stamina would be  +5 hps each...  <br />
<br />
Too bad high stats are trivial and useless anymore in EQ. I remember when you used to have to choose between hps and stats, where having BUFFED stamina &gt; 200 was massive, and there were hard choices in gear to make. Now its get everything with one item...<br />
<br />
monks getting flurry, tact mastery, and rampage(oh the humanity) I see as their way of adding dps to just monks to help balance them some. <br />
<br />
WARRIOR <br />
Extended Shielding <br />
Each rank in this ability increases the range of your shielding ability. <br />
more AA's on an ability that increases the DPS of mobs by 25%...<br />
give us an AA to at least make /shield break even.<br />
<br />
Heightened Endurance <br />
This ability raises your natural endurance regeneration by 1 point per ability level. <br />
<br />
if no Endurance regen spells like they say.. gonna be a must have when openings use endurance<br />
<br />
Shield Specialization <br />
Ranks in this ability increase your chance to block with your shield. <br />
How about increasing Bash damage? Chance of Stun? Lowering Bash Timer? just another 1% increase in a mitigation/avoidance ability will not do us much use, unless shields get to be blocking &gt;15% of incoming melee attacks completely, the loss in dps/aggro is a loss when trading a shield for an off hand weapon, especially when weapons now have AC &gt;= AC on most shields...  Oh and FIX Furious Bash...<br />
<br />
Staggering Shot (increase stun level cap on kicks) <br />
<br />
Strong Kick (increased kick damage) <br />
<br />
Slam? wasnt slam supposed to be a benefit for being a large race? with this it will beome even more useless. While we are at it... give kick/slam/bash ability to do KB so that we can better interupt casters...<br />
<br />
<br />
Sturdiness <br />
Each rank of this ability increases your maximum hit points by 100. <br />
<br />
the 500 war only hp adjust seems to be coordinated with the ~5% mitigation boost to compensate for the decreasing hp gap with knights... Of course by expansion release I see every class with this skill, after all its only fair...<br />
<br />
Warlord's Tenacity <br />
This ability allows you to temporarily boost your hit points to get through tough situations. The exertion takes it toll, though. These hit points dissipate over the course of the next minute andleave you having less than you started with. <br />
<br />
seems a lot like the D&amp;D berserker rage ability. Depending on the actual effect, I can see uses, but 1 hr reset, makes it pretty situational dependant. I can see us getting locked into another 'defensive' type rotation with Tenacity if its not looked at beforehand...<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity <br />
Through years of practice, you develop a close bond with your weapons. This affinity allows you to gain enhanced performance from your weapons in the form of an increased rate at which it triggers effects. <br />
<br />
<br />
hopefully this is more than a 2,5,10% increas in proc rate... increasing that 2.6 ppm to 2.86 would be so anti-climactic...</div></div><hr />

watered down? im MORE tired of everyone being a ogre because the HAVE to, not because they wanted to.<br />

furthermore whats wrong with EVERY warrior being ABLE to get HPs? we still increase at the same amount, and let me tell ya from a first hand look at it, the TRASH hits for 700-900 in the abismal sea thingy, we all got more hp to throw around, the mobs throw around more damage, trust me, you wont notice much of a change in pecking order when it comes to people begging the uber warriors to carry their asses to easy xp.<br />
<br />
and skill? all i have to say is a big SCREW YOU, you learn skills, and good playing habits WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE 5k EXTRA HIT POINTS TO FUG UP WITH, YOU LEARN IT WHEN A MISTAKE = DEATH, everyone that got in to time eather learned how from a guide or WENT AND DIED, regrouped and figured out how to do it right, skill has NOTHING to do with gear, it has EVERYTHING to do with having good instincts about what to do and when at all times possible, when the shit hits the fan, when the water is calm, you have to be ready for eather because both can have hidden dangers (like a peanut that was in the crap flying back at you and blinding you, or a shark thinks you look tasty in that calm water)</div></div><hr />

Ok... we ask for an extented range for a long time now... but an AA to FIX that ? it was almost useless, only situationnal and I will not spend AA when I can buy something else and move myself near my target to shield (using /assist + /follow + /shield).

<br />
Heightened Endurance <br />
This ability raises your natural endurance regeneration by 1 point per ability level. <br />
mmm... ok... we saw it coming :)<br />
<br />
Staggering Shot (increase stun level cap on kicks) <br />
Strong Kick (increased kick damage) <br />
Two AA to be able to use Kick at 65 ? 4 AA x 3 EACH ??<br />
Kick should increase AS YOU LEVEL... it is not. But an obscene amount of AA to inflict 20 more damage and a skill already capped to 150... sorry but no, again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sturdiness <br />
Each rank of this ability increases your maximum hit points by 100. <br />
<br />
Warlord's Tenacity <br />
This ability allows you to temporarily boost your hit points to get through tough situations. The exertion takes it toll, though. These hit points dissipate over the course of the next minute andleave you having less than you started with. <br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity <br />
Through years of practice, you develop a close bond with your weapons. This affinity allows you to gain enhanced performance from your weapons in the form of an increased rate at which it triggers effects.<br />
<br />
Ok those 3 are ok... nothing exceptionnal (maybe warlord tenacity will do something useful... with this cost it MUST). <br />
<br />
but now where are the :<br />
<br />
*** DISCIPLINE AAs : now they are coded in spelldat, SOE could be creative and make some stuff like many low cost AA like :<br />
- Wonderous Evasive movement : increase movement rate when you use Evasive or fortitude<br />
- Agression of Kizrak : increase aggressive and fellstrike duration by 10,25, 50 percent<br />
- Perfect precision : increase the chances to proc during precise discipline. <br />
just some idea I throw here...<br />
<br />
*** Dual Wield and 1H+Shield :<br />
Where are the dual wield AA ? something like an AA to gain damage bonus with offhand for exemple...<br />
Where are the 1H+shield AA ? Ok there is &quot;more chance to block&quot; one. Come on... to you think hastened warcry made more people buy warcry ? we trade too much for a shield today.<br />
<br />
My idea about those AA : they are keeping the &quot;cool brutal ones&quot; for the berserker... you know, using great axes, hurling large objects, etc... We have the crap that you buy and then parse before saying &quot;oh this one increased my chance to XXX by 3,76 % !&quot;. nothing flashy and clearly useful.<br />
<br />
But of course if you see the rogues ones you'll feel better. pickpocket AAs, not a single DPS thing... Rogue citation :<br />
Wow. They really out did themselves this time. Not only do we not get any offensive AA's that help us in 90% of situations, but they managed to make us just that much less desirable for groups. Neat.</div></div><hr />

does it seem that warriors are getting the sandpaper condom when it comes to aa's again?<br />
<br />
7 skills, 3 are nice, 2 are situational at best, block with shield is kinda weak, and if kick might be the best if you could actually see an increase in dps.. doubt it though as our kick is so low that it misses 1/2 the time anyway.<br />
<br />
now looking at the knight ones.<br />
<br />
SK-8 skills 1 is a pet thing so lets say 7<br />
<br />
600 point added to leachcurse<br />
crits on dots<br />
damage shields that do more damage<br />
Persistent Casting - casting through stuns, this is HUGE for hybred tanks<br />
Heightened Endurance-useless unless they getting skills<br />
Death's Fury (This ability imbues your pet with the ability to land critical hits) <br />
recover - no clue what this is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pallies get 7<br />
<br />
Heightened Endurance -usless<br />
Persistent Casting - HUGE<br />
Mastery of the Past - not great not crap<br />
Hastened Piety - group lay on hands every 12 min.(could be wrong)<br />
Blinding Reverence - bash stun increase  not bad not crap<br />
Increased Bash Damage -same<br />
Radiant Cure Purification - This ability allows the paladin to remove all harmful maladies from himself. -Situational<br />
<br />
Ok.. so after typing that looks like pallys got shafted too.<br />
<br />
monk on the other hand take away what used to be Warrior only. Yes it was a toy but it was our toy, we were the only ones that could do it <br />
monks get rampage<br />
<br />
Destructive Force - When activated, your attacks will strike every enemy around you. Additional ranks increase the duration of the effect. What the hell they mean by duration. Sounds like rampage but for 1 tick you hit everything around you, so if you swing 2 times you hit everything around you 2 times?<br />
<br />
and  monks get Strikethrough and Weapon Affinity as well.<br />
<br />
so this expansion takes crit hits (that used to be warrior only and got whored out to every melee class) and gives it to pet classes. (this part of tasso's rants brought to you by nerf beastlords)<br />
<br />
Then the next thing they take is rampage. Another warrior only skill.<br />
<br />
Why am i not thrilled.</div></div><hr />

There hasn't been good content in this game since velious.  Since I know the same people aren't making this expansion, I have zero doubt that the content will suck total shit.  Since the content WILL suck (fuckin PoP and LDoN have completely ruined my faith in this teams' abilities to make an expansion worth a shit), all we have left is AA's.  These don't impress me.<br />

You don't have to agree with me. Some people enjoy the festering shitholes that were LDoN and PoP.  I happen to think they're utter shit, and this one has a long way to go to stand out from the pack.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I guess the plus side is, I only have to really go after a couple AA things from GoD before I go back to finishing off 3 and 4 expansions old AAs.</div></div><hr />

Every time we raid in PoP all I can think is how much cooler and more interesting than Vex Thal it is.  PoP has by far the most interesting and unusual boss mob encounters of any epansion.  Almost any PoP fight is more interesting and takes more diverse tactics to win than anything in Luclin (or Velious for that matter).  PoP has been out for close to a year and a half now, and only the very top guilds on most servers have beaten it.  Granted, some of that is due to the flag timesink and the large numbers required for plane of time, but for the most part it's the huge number of bosses in PoP and the diverse tactics.  From a raider's perspective I would have to call PoP my favorite expansion (although I have only seen half of it), followed by Velious.</div></div><hr />

Umm...<br />
<br />
600 point added to leachcurse -- this is a typo.  I assume it's Leech Touch, which is something I dont feel to be worth the waste of AA.  A 72 minute refresh 2100 point lifetap does little for a raid when it keeps you from throwing off an 8k HT.<br />
<br />
damage shields that do more damage -- We're tanking less and less, and DS's dont contribute to aggro.  Pretty useless outside of a duel, imo.<br />
<br />
Persistent Casting -- sure, after I get channeling focus.  Got 73 more AA to spend bumping resists before that.  =P<br />
<br />
Heightened Endurance -- Glad the worthlessness of this was seen.<br />
<br />
Death's Fury -- My pet is a freakin' pulling tool.  The &quot;free DPS&quot; argument doesn't apply when I have other things to worry about than micromanaging my pet.<br />
<br />
Crit Dots will be nice.  I could go for that.<br />
<br />
You forgot Mastery of the Past, so that I can spend another 12 AA to not fizzle spells I dont bother to mem.  Shallow Grave vanished from the list.<br />
<br />
On another note, casters get Planar Enlightenment because they dont get Planar Durability.  They get 355 Int/Wis, which gives them the potential for all of another 80 mana, instead of boosting their hp by five percent.</div></div><hr />

At least we will have 500 HP from this expansion.  Only monks get any kind of offensive AAs at all out of melees (and long overdue really... they're supposed to do more damage than we do and yet they have less offensive AAs than we get).  Ranger arrows currently add a proc of 150 damage max which is utterly pointless at the 2/minute proc rate, unless it's coded to proc at cleric hammer speeds.  I think that AA is being revamped but other than that no other melee type even gets anything to add damage unless you think Mug or improved chaotic stab is more DPS.</div></div><hr />

I dont use it for any 'l33t sploits.'  If I cant get a LoS or it's farther than I think I can run from it's spawn point to where I'm supposed to put it, then I send off Mr. Level 9 Jabober to go die.<br />

<br />
Same reason on a pvp server you can be sitting next to guards, and a high level pet class can sic their pet on you and you have to zone to survive.  If there were 50 mobs standing in a small circle, and you send your pet on one of them, you will only aggro one.  Sounds kind of buggish to me.<br />

I'm from the orthodox school that warriors should have the most HP's and AC. The 500 should have been given without buying it through AA - GOD is giving us the opportunity to spend hours achieving nothing more than what we have lost from prior expansions. This to me is not &quot;value&quot; from a warrior perspective.<br />

In any case I do hope the HP increase is warrior only. Maybe the itemization selected for GoD will be better than in the past.</div></div><hr />

In regards to the folks talking about how now not &quot;good&quot; tanks are going to infringe in thier hp area, /rude. Just because you play in a &quot;uber&quot; guild and I dont does not mean your skill is better than mine. I have played for 4 years in this game and I doubt you will find better tank as skill just randomly picking a &quot;uber&quot; guild warrior.

And then? Life goes on, pick up the pieces and see whats left.<br />
For me its Weapon Affinity assuming this is an actual noticeable increase in procs.  As for me it is its not rare for me to proc 12-15 times on a BOT mob with a single group with auged weapons.  Give me more procs plus incite and it wont matter what anyone does in group, so lets look on the bright side.  We are starting to be come exellent taunters and finally giving ( Sturdiness  )  to warriors *only* is a welcome change in attitude about warriors.    WE ARE THE TANKS... atleast they didnt give Sturdiness to sk's and pally's, that atleast speaks for something, not that im happy I have to pay tons of aa's to get it but... you get the point.<br />
<br />
On the other hand:<br />
A few people made some great points. With this new expansion rogues go back to kunark, whos wants greedy sticky finger, group coin/ gem stealin' rogues in xp groups? Not me.  Bad idea.<br />
&quot;you guys want a rogue to join us?&quot;  Me- &quot; hell no, get some other dps class&quot;.<br />
<br />
Monks getting rampage.  Pets getting shielding.  Pets getting crits. PETS mind you....  /rage<br />
<br />
WHAT in God's name is going on here?  Ok fine i want gate.....<br />
and sow and heals to be more usefull in pickup groups.... thats bs.<br />
<br />
They are stripping classes or their uniqueness.<br />
By the next few expansions classes will be such a blur classes wont matter, multi classes can slow, haste, heal, snare,<br />
tank, mez.<br />
<br />
Can we get back to basics... is any developer listening?</div></div><hr />

Pets getting shielding.  Pet classes have had their pets being able to /shield them for quite some time.  Mages are just now getting the ability to more do it on command, which makes a pretty good amount of sense when you think about it.  They do use their own pets for bodyguards, you know.</div></div><hr />

The COST of those AAs.<br />

It's much cheaper to get them as a warrior, going on preliminary reports of AA costs in Gates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Increasing my proc rate: I like that too.<br />
<br />
Increasing the range on /shield: Maybe some warriors don't use /shield, but I do every time taunt fails and the skill is available. It isn't often that the other PC is out of range, so this increased range won't be extremely beneficial to me I don't think. What I would prefer would be a decreased refresh time. Another thing that would be nice would be to reduce or remove the increase in damage that I take from /shielding someone. Increasing the percentage of damage that I /shield would be cool too. I'd spend AA on a /shield that takes 75% of the damage off of my enchanter, and I mitigate 25% percent of THAT damage. Bleh, I can't figure out how to word that. Say mob hits enchanter for what would be 1000 damage. I /shield enchanter. Enchanter takes 250 damage, and I take 500 damage. Hmm.. I can already see that being exploited. Heh.<br />

<br />
Improved kick: Umm ok. *golf clap*<br />
<br />
This is of course speculation. In about a year or so when I catch up on the AAs that are already in the game and I start working on these GoDly AAs, I'll let you know what I think about them.</div></div><hr />

its coded as a heal atm?,dosent raise max hps like i expected the from what the limited txt said<br />
and level one adds 500,and takes away 50 for 6 ticks<br />
lev 2 is 1000 ,and -100hp x6<br />
lev 3 is 1500 and -150x6<br />
they arent taking away more hps then their giving like txt says<br />
<br />
on other notes,does anyone know if the proc rate mod would affect proc buffs,or only weapon procs?</div></div><hr />

The first two are Unresistable, while only the third has the poison resist (if it's an activated self-only AA ability, it's not supposed to be resisted).  They always seem to put a placeholder at first in that looks somewhat like what the final one will do.</div></div><hr />

quit the bitching about large races, warriors as a whole get fucked yet again. <br />
<br />
So, by your reasoning since the incomplete list of prosposed AAs dont have much to excite you, in your words.. &quot;warriors as a whole get fucked&quot; that it is A OK to fuck large race warriors even worse?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
Frankly, I really like an improved chance to proc, 500 more HP aint shabby either, yeah, I think we need to see something to take some melee stats to 355, but I wont die without em, heck, I would still love EQ and a horse... /shrug. At least I will be able to run a bit faster yet again. <br />
<br />
Go look at the shamman boards if you wanna see a group pissed about GoD... esp in the AA dept.<br />
<br />
In short, yeah, I think we need more dps AAs, more defensive ones and some utility would be nice, but, since this list is NOT final.... there is no use bitching about it, use /feedback to suggest changes.</div></div><hr />

No more fucking int casters with nd ca cs lr id, none of that fucking faggot shit.  However Warlord's Tenacity seems promising.  Basically increases a warriors &quot;prime tank time&quot; to about 4 mins.  3 mins of disc, furious or fortitude, then cap it off with this.  By the time the neg effects kick in you will either be A cring or B deciding loot.</div></div><hr />

Warlord's Tenacity has shown up on Lucy.  3 levels, 500/1000/1500, lasts 36 seconds and drops by 50/100/150 each tick.  Doesn't look like any stacking problems.  <br />
<br />
Thing that hasn't been mentioned outright really is that this is an instant heal that warriors get.  Yes it's self only and yes it's 1 hr refresh.  But once an hour you can do a 1500 point LoH that has a deterimental side that's RCable.<br />
<br />
That's a nice trick to have in the bag.  I'll be using it a lot on LDON and somewhat in Time.  (accidental aggro etc...)</div></div><hr />

From looking at the text, it does seem as if it can be a heal also.  I do hope it's RCable too.<br />
<br />
Brenlo made a post somewhere saying that the lists of AAs out there are not complete.  He was talking to Rangers at the time, but it deserves noting.<br />
<br />
Also, I couldn't see any mention of this (please correct me if someone's said it), but Warriors are getting a shield-based AA:<br />
<br />
Shield Specialization<br />
This is a passive ability; it does not need to be actived.<br />
Requirements: Level: 65, No previous ability requirements.<br />
Ranks in this ability increase your chance to block with your shield.<br />
<br />
Anyone agrees that this means the innate blocking when wearing a shield will be in around GoD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edone</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">worstcase the shield aa costs 45pts for L5 (3/6/9/12/15), if it provides full skill level of block (parry upgrade monks get that triggers twice as often),it'd be worth it<br />
<br />
anyone checked what L2 costs,if its 3/3/3/3/3 it probly blows~<br />
<br />
shields would be viable on an time equiped war, planesmasters, eoe or db,aug'd with anger, and AA greater proc rate level 5,and incite would hold aggro<br />
<br />
anyone know what the rest of the progressions are?<br />
<br />
Improved Innate Run Speed 5/5<br />
Improved Innate Regen 3/?<br />
Improved Lung Capacity 3/?<br />
Packrat 3/?/?/?/?<br />
Heightened Endurance 3/6/?<br />
Weapon Affinity 2/4/?/?/?<br />
Sturdiness 4/?/?/?/?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of last night, according to a friend this is the following war AA list for gates:<br />
<br />
improved innate run speed - 2 levels, 5 cost<br />
improved innate regen - 2 levels, 3 cost<br />
improved lung capacity - 2 levels, 3 cost<br />
Packrat - 5 levels, 3 cost<br />
Heightened Endurance - 3 levels, 3 cost<br />
Weapon Affinity - 5 levels, 2 cost<br />
Sturdiness - 5 levels, 4 cost<br />
Warlord's Tenacity - 3 levels, 5 cost<br />
Strengthened Strike - 3 levels, 4 cost<br />
Extended Shielding - 3 levels, 4 cost<br />
<br />
<br />
Packrat- &quot;each rank of this ability improves the efficiency with which you store your gear effectively reducing your overall weight&quot;<br />
<br />
Strengthened Strike- &quot;each rank of this ability increases the damage you do when you kick or slam&quot;<br />
<br />
Notice the lack of a few AA's that were there the day before. Obviously still tweaking things and hopefully there will be much more abilities added, otherwise its a tad bit bland.</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm.<br />
<br />
Interesting.<br />
<br />
Currently useless in relation to the game (I mean, it's not helping a monk do much and they were the only class with weight restrictions).<br />

But still might be kind of fun to throw points at if I ever got careless with them.</div></div><hr />

it's probably another way to dumb things down, so people dont *need* WR bags.<br />
i wonder how long it'll be until you can AA armor and weapons.</div></div><hr />

If you dont like /SHIELD , or dont use it...<br />
Then you should really start learning how to play a warrior.<br />

Damn i always have /shield MyCleric or+and  /Shield MyChanter.<br />
<br />
I dont even count how many times this has saved us from a wipe.<br />
As i dont even count how many times i shielded and 2 sec later got OOR.<br />
And shield down.<br />

<br />
I agree about the rogue abilities too... stupid as hell.  Every few months the ethical issue of pickpocketing in groups gets brought up on the safehouse.  There's always a few aggressive rogues that trot out their tired old sayings like, &quot;FU NEWB!  Pickpocketing is part of my class and I'm gonna do it if I want to!  If U don't like it, screw U! Then U don't need my L337 dps!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Yeah, it's a lameass excuse for ripping off their group.  Those are the kind of people that make it harder for good rogues to get groups.  And many classes can add good dps, so we'll just take them instead.  /bye.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somehow I doubt people bother creating a group to kill one MoB.<br />
<br />
Get over yourself Haass. try to see that there are other people out there. Let the super ego go. Center of the universe you are not. Try not to carry the huge burden of telling everyone how to live their lives, for it is hard.<br />
<br />
Breath...<br />
<br />
Plus, no one mentioned fuckin 4pp off a mob. They said stealing 4pp off a mob. Not even sure how the former is done.<br />
<br />
But tell ya what big guy, since you have all the answers...<br />
<br />
Start doing pick up groups, for say 1 month. Tell every group you join that they must give you 4PP for each MOB the group kills or you are going to look for another group. I am sure they wont mind.<br />

The last time I did a pickup group, I went to Seb to camp a ToD for myself since i seem to have lost mine.  I grabbed a couple mid 50's that I really didn't need to mooch XP off me because we were the only 5 in the zone.  Loot conditions?  Turn split off, I don't care about anything except the Trunch.<br />
<br />
I watched them loot a runebranded girdle and didn't say a word.  You think I'm fucking concerned about rogues taking pocket change off a mob?  It's not that big of a goddamned deal.  People who don't have money in this game aren't trying, but there's a lot of whining around here from people who don't want to try at this game.<br />
<br />
If you're bothered by a rogue who is doing ridiculous DPS and increasing your XP rate who occasionally hits the pickpocket button and steals some silver, then you've got bigger issues than I've got.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its actually quite interesting how diverse the word fuck and its different implications can be used. For instance:<br />
<br />
as a noun, &quot;lets have a fuck&quot;<br />
<br />
as an adverb, &quot;Dave talks to fucking much&quot;<br />
<br />
as an adjective, &quot;Dave is a fucking moron.&quot;<br />
<br />
as a verb, &quot;Dave is fucking Carol&quot;<br />
<br />
As nearly every word in the sentance, &quot;Fuck the fucking fuckers&quot;<br />
<br />
It can also show a borad range of emotion:<br />
<br />
Fraud- &quot;I got fucked at the used car lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dismay- &quot;Ah, fuck it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trouble- &quot;I guess im really fucked now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aggression- &quot;Dont fuck with me buddy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Difficulty- &quot;I dont understand the fucking problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inquiry- &quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Disatisfaction- &quot;I dont like what the fuck is going on here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Incompetance- &quot;Hes a fuck off&quot;<br />
<br />
Dismissal- &quot;Why dont you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself.&quot;<br />

Iv got plenty of plat in the bank, most of the best items are no drop anyways, but...<br />
<br />
Its an ethics thing.  Grouped with a druid that had 600k in the bank bragging about his cash, and how ubbar he is.  <br />
He was rolling on specs againsted people who needed it, won everyone grats'd him but me.  Then i casually asked him if he needed spells, slow response..&quot; yah im missing 1 spell&quot; which was complete bs, I called him on his shit. He can go &quot;buy&quot; that 1 spell, they cant thats why I dont roll if anyone needs little stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I dont care to much what a mq spec can bring, gems or reg cash, but i do care about ethics, its one if the few things that makes the game interesting to me.<br />
<br />
And yes I know rogues cant pick magic items.<br />
<br />
If someone feels they would rather choose a nice mage<br />
over a rogue who is soon to get an extra attack that pickpockets on every success (non activated skill), in addition to reg pickpocket skills, its a free dam country.</div></div><hr />

First of all, 99% of the shit in PoP doesn't even drop cash.  Second of, you have to actually turn off attack at the current time in order to pickpocket.  That's one extra button to hit at minimum if you made a hotkey for it, and 3 if you didn't, and that's a lot of work for your average AFK melee.<br />
<br />
It's seriously not something to get worked up over.  .</div></div><hr />

Your god complex is astounding in the completeness of its development.<br />

Cily and others simply react to your sub-simian bad attitude, and that uniquely abrasive arrogance peculiar to those with chronic self-esteem and insecurity issues.<br />
<br />
You are like the person who farts in elevators, sneezes openly at the dinner table, uses the word &quot;cunt&quot; in the presence of ladies.<br />
<br />
You get a reaction from thoughtful people, because the depth of your unexamined boorishness is so remarkable.<br />
<br />
Don't fool yourself into thinking you're important enough to warrant a &quot;crusade&quot;.  Even though mosquitos are insignificant in and of themselves, everyone still swats at them.  This does not elevate the mosquito to any great status.</div></div><hr />
