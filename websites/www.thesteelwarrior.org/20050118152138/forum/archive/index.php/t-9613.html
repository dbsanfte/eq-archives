<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's your formula to determine how much HP derives from AC? I've looked at it as 1ac=6hp a while, but in the past week or so, I've had thought on the subject!<br />
<br />
We all know that one is not good without the other, so I thought of a possible formula to find how much AC shines out from a person, rather then a preset number that may not reflect the person.<br />
<br />
HP=AC<br />
HP/AC (Your hit points divided by your AC) = how much each AC is worth<br />
<br />
Some Examples:<br />
<br />
05000hp and 2000ac, 1ac = 2.5hp<br />
07500hp and 1500ac, 1ac = 5hp<br />
10000hp and 2000ac, 1ac = 5hp<br />
12500hp and 2500ac, 1ac = 5hp<br />
15000hp and 3000ac, 1ac = 5hp<br />
17500hp and 1500ac, 1ac = 11.6hp<br />
Randomized Examples:<br />
<br />
06666hp and 1000ac, 1ac = 6.66hp<br />
07428hp and 1232ac, 1ac = 6.03hp<br />
07859hp and 1348ac, 1ac = 5.83hp<br />
08237hp and 1478ac, 1ac = 5.57hp<br />
09129hp and 1535ac, 1ac = 5.94hp<br />
09857hp and 1714ac, 1ac = 5.75hp<br />
10392hp and 1827ac, 1ac = 5.68hp<br />
11029hp and 1940ac, 1ac = 5.68hp<br />
11604hp and 2073ac, 1ac = 5.61hp<br />
12237hp and 2163ac, 1ac = 5.65hp<br />
12953hp and 2236ac, 1ac = 5.79hp<br />
<br />

My goal is 12000/3000 because of the way OOW is (low atk, low min hit, high max hit).<br />
<br />
I still follow the 1ac = 6hp rule overall for choosing gear.<br />
Which means that 60ac 170mask = 40ac 280hp for me, and i refuse to loot items<br />
that will lower my ac, even if the HP gain is astronomical.<br />
<br />
GoD = Shielding &amp; AC/HP (They reminded me of RZ &amp; Fenin)<br />
OOW = Avoidance &amp; AC (They remind me of Quarm)<br />
<br />
PS : Yes i know ac was king in GoD, but having done Ikkinz4 , Bartx , Xxeric i can<br />
tell you with min hits from 1600 to 3000 having high AC didnt matter as much<br />
as having HP/Shielding and defensive up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure it affects you at all, but the AC softcap figures in here.<br />
<br />
Since I have no idea at all where the softcap begins, I picked an arbitrary AC goal - 2000AC and resolved that I wouldn't put 40HP for example in a slot where I could put 10AC until I exceeded that goal.<br />
<br />
As I gained access to better gear and filled up all the slots I could with 10AC LDoN augs, I began looking at items and augs that carried above average AC and decent HP's. Probably the best example of this is my Platinum Cloak of War 40AC 185HP's with an Opaque Saphire of Bulwark 20AC on it. That's works out to a 60AC 185HP cloak.<br />
<br />
Unless you are able to obtain the very best equipment in the game, I think that's a more rational approach. Choose an AC and HP goal, get all your 10AC and 40HP LDoN augs and as you upgrade try very hard NOT to sacrifice AC for HP's or vice versa. A 10 AC 125HP cloak sucks, and so does 20AC 80HP cloak. It's sorta immaterial trying to decide which sucks more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My thought is... what are the high end tanks using? Seems they are around 11000 HP and 2500AC unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Putting on 1HP you gain 1.2 HP. Actually I check right now, 100HP Item = 117 HP.<br />
<br />
Putting on 1AC you gain 1.6 AC. I check... 35AC Item = 55AC... 1.57.<br />
<br />
Base HP and AC naked are (ok I'm not dead so I'll guess as close as I can)... 4500 HP and 800 AC.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
I want to gain 6500 HP at a rate of 1.2 per point, i.e. 5400 HP on items.<br />
I want to gain 1700 AC at a rate of 1.6 per point, i.e. 1100 AC on items.<br />
<br />
So roughly I think 1 AC = 5 HP when it comes to deciding on items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Figured I should just point out that my guild is not elite or uber and that aiming for 3000ac for me would be pointless. Getting that high would require a guild that raids enough for you to be extremely choosy about the items you loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran some numbers on the top 10 (in some cases the top 20) authentic mageloes for these levels: 55, 60, 65 and 70. <br />
<br />
At level 55, if you sort by top AC, the average of the top 20 warriors is: 3.17 hitpoints/AC.<br />
Sorted by hitpoints, the average of the top 10 lvl 55 warriors was 3.3 hps/AC.<br />
<br />
Level 60<br />
by AC, top 10: 3.36 hps/AC<br />
by hitpoints, top 10: 3.56 hps/AC<br />
<br />
Level 65<br />
by AC, top 20: 4.22 hps/AC<br />
by hitpoints, top 10: 4.43 hps/AC<br />
<br />
Level 70<br />
by AC, top 10: 4.42 hps/AC<br />
by hitpoints, top 10: 6.75 hps/AC<br />
<br />
There are some caveats here: for example, two of the level 55 warriors have over 120 AAs, so I'm pretty sure they're, uh, not typical. Also my sample size isn't the same for hitpoints and AC lists in a couple cases, mostly because I just got tired of using my calculator. The smaller samples in the &quot;sort-by-hps&quot; categories would, if anything, make the hps/AC higher for those figures than if I'd sampled the top 20.<br />
<br />
Also, of course, the AC listed on a piece of gear gets a boost when you put it on a warrior, so a theoretical 10 AC/60 hp piece of armor will not result in a 1-to-6 ratio when you put it on. <br />
<br />
At any rate, these warriors are, relatively speaking, adding hitpoints faster than AC as they go along. Even the warriors who are AC heavy are adding hitpoints faster than AC, which results in a trend toward a higher hp/AC ratio as warriors advance in level. <br />
<br />
It might be that OoW is having some effect on the &quot;spread&quot; between the ratios for the level 70 warriors. If you run out and start slapping on the relatively high hitpoint gear from that expansion, you'll get higher hitpoint ratios than have come in other expansions. The other possibility is that I got tired and punched the wrong numbers into the calculator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my server at least, very few (1?) of the high end raiding tanks have authentic magelos. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the authentic ones are semi-raiding or casual types who are gorging on all the new high-hp low ac god/oow gear. It takes a lot of effort and discipline to keep AC moving up, compared to HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bardeil--aye, you're probably correct about that. the reason I did it that way was that I'm pretty sure that some of the magelos at various levels that aren't authentic are, hmmm, perhaps not accurate (I don't mean that the top players have inaccurate Magelos, just that other searches would lead to other potential caveats).<br />
another problem is that not all slots are created equal; random (and made up) exampe: a 6 AC/65 hp ring might be pretty easy to find, but a 60 AC/ 650 hp BP might not be so easy to find. In terms of deciding on the merits of a upgrading an individual slot vs. a different upgrade in another slot, the variables increase pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

My magelo is acurate...take a look.  I'm a twink but non raider.  Spent close to 300k in the bazaar. 3.38 ratio here with no AA's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like this policy.  It's not an upgrade IMO unless it has equal or better ac AND hp to what you're wearing.  If you have to choose between 10 ac and 50 hps, don't loot the item, because it's not a good enough upgrade to spend points on.  if you are trying to choose between two items that are similar, one with slightly better ac, one with slightly better hp, then take the first one that drops, it doesn't make much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree w/ above, for upgrades I look for raw AC, then HP/shielding/avoidance.  There's only a few &quot;high&quot; AC items per slot to chose from, and they tend to have respectable hp/effects on them as well anyway.  The opposite isn't true, there's lots of high HP gear that has rotten AC (caster gear imho).<br />
