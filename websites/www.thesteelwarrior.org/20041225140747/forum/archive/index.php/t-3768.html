<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyquinn</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm kinda curious to hear from some non-ogres who have bought this skill - I'm a barbarian warrior myself and one of my big irritations is when a mob comes running at me, hits me for a round and stuns me, leaving me in that slow spin while he rushes behind me to chew up the casters in my group...so do these AAs lessen incredibly the amount you get stunned, say to the point where getting stunned is an odd occurrence or are they not really noticeable? Just want to know they're gonna help take care of this annoying issue before I spend points on them that I could be putting to good use elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a human warrior with SE maxed and I have found it reduces stuns by about 70%.  So only about 1 in 3 stuns gets through now.  When it works, you see a handy message that you dodged the stunning blow.<br />
<br />
So SE is well worth it for races other than ogres.  For ogres maybe it comes further down the priority list, but still useful even for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's definately worth the 2 pts for the first level.<br />
<br />
The first level is like 25% avoidence of stuns. I have level 1 and see the &quot;You avoid the stunning blow&quot; a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ogre's it might be one you wait a bit on but I love it as a human.<br />
<br />
I avoid about 70-80% of stuns now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its definitely worth it as a barb, especially in places like BoT where they like to stun you on the first hit and then go beat on the chanter while you spin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, with SE3 stunning is an odd occurance.  I find that it's greatest value is at the beginning of a fight.  Right when you engage a mob is the most likely time to be stunned.  (They get all their combat swings in at once and bash/kick.)  Right when you engage a mob is also the WORST time to get stunned because it has a much higher affect on your initial aggro.  SE must help with a tank's dps a little, but the aggro is surely the best feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, SE3 rocks, especially at the start of a fight.  Not only does it help you keep churning out the aggro, often you need to be able to move, to either get to the mob, or to position the mob.  How often does this happen: you get aggro, the mob stuns you, shaman lands slow and mob goes chasing him, and you're stunned and can't do anything about it?  SE3 prevents a lot of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you can Taunt :D If you get stunned and the slower lands slow, you taunt and the mob will hit you even if you are stunned still. Of course, it depends on Taunt working but its not like you get stunned and you pray to your god to save the group cause you cant do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pray to save the group??I knew being agnostic would come back to bite me ;)<br />
<br />
Knowing when to use Taunt is a must.I actually instruct my grps now ifpossible to slow while the mob is incoming,then I hit them/taunt before the mob gets to camp but after the slow....helps tremendously with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">works wonders when you ge them dumb mobs the summon you behind them. they can insta turn and give you a round in the backside normaly bash you to with of corse stuns you. then give you another round for the heck of it before you can turn to face them again.</div></div><hr />
