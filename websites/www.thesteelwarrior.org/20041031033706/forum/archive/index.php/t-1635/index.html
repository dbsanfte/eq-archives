<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goarath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right now I have a Barbarian Warrior sitting at level 52.  On my second account I have an (almost) full set of Corroded Plate armor to MQ for him, and need to make a choice.  The problem with my warrior is that he's Agnostic.  The Heladric Tundra Cultural is extremely good droppable armor, and I do not have the time required to dedicate to a &quot;good guild.&quot;<br />
<br />
On my second account, I have a level 65 cleric who could help accelerate the growth of a new warrior if need be.  Question is, is it worth it?  I did a few magelo simulations and it looks like I'm missing out on about 80AC and 500HP.  I there some droppable PoP equipment that is around the same price as the Cultural, with about the same effectiveness?  It seems to me for some slots the answer is yes, after doing a few bazaar searches.<br />
<br />
If you think re-rolling is the better idea, any other tips other then making a Barbarian Warrior following the Tribunal?  It would seem to indicate that race has very little to do with it, it's mostly religion.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Reroll? Nah.<br />
<br />
I'm 59 Half Elf Tunare Warrior, I have some agnostic armor (bracer x2, legs, boots) they are better than champion's. however, myrmidon legs and boots &gt; agnostic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the only pieces that you'd be hard pressed to find better of, are the 80hp fierce heraldic greaves and maybe the 55hp bracers. but of course if money's not an issue, you could always buy some Ornate molds. If there are even any of those in your bazaar.<br />
<br />
i'm agnostic, and I am still stuck with 35/40hp bracers in elementals, as are many of our warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bracers of benevolence work fine. more stam little less hp. good (not sure about ac comparison)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what do plan on killing that you think the better armor will help with so much? most exp grinds dont require the best armor. even fighting things unslowed, you adjust to a safe spot for CH.<br />
<br />
sucks not being able to use the deity class armor, really they should put in a quest to pledge your loyalty to a different god, but its not gonna kill ya in the long run.  the fact that some pieces are better than armor that most of us spent weeks farming from ToV is really sad. nice they made trade skills useful, but a trade combine of mymridon+random_item_01 would have been nice. pretty much made ToV armor obsolete, for warriors at least.<br />
<br />
depends somewhat on your pl ability too, some ppl could be back to 52 in 2 or 3 days. personally im not one of those ppl, and wouldnt bother.</div></div><hr />
