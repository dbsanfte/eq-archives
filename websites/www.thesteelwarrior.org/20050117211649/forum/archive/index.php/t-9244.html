I'll take this one.<br />

I believe the official term is &quot;Assloads.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, there are multiple droppable ingredients required to make them.  Some of them could be Discordant Scorea, Discordant Dust, Trean Flies, Slugworms, and the augments themselves.  All of the items that I listed are going for 10k+ per in the bazaar, not worth buying IMO.  You should just group in the OoW zones and snag whatever drops you can.<br />
<br />
Besides those you need a ton of vendor bought stuff, so for the average augment, fully made and not failing once, you're looking around at least 10-20k per one, and that's if you don't fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doh, that was supposed to be &quot;Don't fail&quot;, and yes the trivial is about 360 on them.  Here's a little equation on just the first combine.....<br />
<br />
Success = Skill - 0.75*Trivial + 51.5 <br />
<br />
252 - (.75*360) + 51.5 = 33.5 <br />
<br />
JCM3 halves failure rate. 66.5 / 2 = 33.25. <br />
<br />
Success Rate = 66.75%<br />
<br />
And that's only if you have JCM3..... I would suggest salvage before you or any other person you know attempts the combine.</div></div><hr />

  I was looking for a much more specific link then just eqtraders.com. I've been there and couldn't seem to find what I was after.<br />
  Maybe this is not the site for that.<br />

Go to the message board and look at the submissions to see what people have made, or their data base for the stats. There probably isn't a comprehensive chart yet, as I don't believe all of them have been made yet.<br />
<br />
Oh, and <br />
I believe the official term is &quot;Assloads.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sure this will vary by server. On some servers, it will be &quot;buttloads.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I made a +6 dmg shield ferocity 2 aug and even though I'm an enc, I'll be damned if I'm going to sell that thing for any amount of plat...unless maybe you have a firstborn you'd like to get rid of.</div></div><hr />

Is that all?  For a good 45hp aug with a good effect I would gladly pay 50k.  People on Drinal are stoned out of their mind.  They're asking around 30-40k for just the plain old augment, not radiant, no effects, just a plain old augment.</div></div><hr />

Check this out, I look in bazaar,  Lesser and minor muramite runes. 80k<br />
<br />
Charged magnetic BP 150k, the components to make em 50k each. (you need 4 to attempt and other minor things)<br />
<br />
the fly crap to help with augs? 20k...<br />
<br />
it reminds me of early ornate in pop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait 6 months before prices get reasonable if you want to pay for it.</div></div><hr />

agreed. i'm just waiting to see what the first 45hp 40% haste aug goes for /shudder. might actually be worth it to free up the waist slot for an ac/hp upgrade though.</div></div><hr />

Heh either you live on a server with a really small economy, or you are joking.  On 7th anyway, I wouldn't expect to see a decent aug fully loaded with black inlay stuff, i.e. a 45HP aug with Cleave III or a 45 HP aug with MP V or similar focus for less than 250k starting out.</div></div><hr />

 Cheapest aug I've seen on Brell was the +4 cold resist one. 25k. No way in hell I'll pay that.</div></div><hr />

was lucky enough to pick up a 10hp one for 15k, and get it changed to 45hp...now trying to decide to if i want to attemp the upgrade of now...maybe add the mark, but dont upgrade it...less chance of losing it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I got my first 10hp one for free and the first combine actually worked on it.  I was so thrilled that I didn't want him to go further with it, so I took the 45HP and put it in my hand slot.  As prices drop and these go to 5k or less I may try to pick more up, but until then I'll just get them as they drop and keep them at 45hp so I don't have to worry as much about losing them.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I got a +4 SVF last night for 500pp..... pretty good deal, and I feel okay about losing it while trying to put some 40% haste on it   :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and here's a good laugh..... I saw someone last night trying to trade a +4 INT aug for a CoF   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You need to be introducted to tribute.<br />
<br />
Don't tie yourself to haste anymore, you're just hurting yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Tribute haste is all good and well, but the cost can be quite high.  I already run 150hp and AC in most EXP groups and it's pretty rough, around 60 or so per 10 mins.  I'm not sure how much 40% haste would cost, but I can only assume it would push me to about 100 per 10 mins.  I usually only turn in about 6k in tribute per week and that already costs me a few k plat.  <br />
<br />
I sure as hell won't buy a 150k 40% haste aug, but I would take my chances on a friend crafting one for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tribute haste is all good and well, but the cost can be quite high.

<br />
I dunno what you're doing then.  I've got somewhere in the vicinity of 50k tribute just from turning in all the bullshit I loot during the week that isn't sellable in the bazaar.  Copper hammers, for example, run like 4k on CT and tribute for 12k.<br />
<br />
I was running AC/HP/Haste for a cost of 98 Tribute for awhile, and now I realize I've got so much of it that I can afford to turn on Vengeance 10 too.   It's definitely not that much of a pain in the ass to turn on Haste.  Fuck, you can sell your haste belt, and just tribute the plat and that will buy you enough tribute for a couple of months easy.</div></div><hr />
