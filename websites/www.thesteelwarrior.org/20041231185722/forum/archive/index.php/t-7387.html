I am OGre warrior of 63 seasons.  I started EQ with that character basically because I love the class, but I also have a 65 shaman that I solo with whenever getting groups is taking too long.<br />
<br />
I know the shaman class well, and no one who dared to challenge me to a duel ever survived... but lately I have been been taunted by 65 SK's and Pallys daring my warrior into battle.<br />
<br />
It's kinda insulting actually.  I haven't accepted a challenge yet, but I would love to lay a whoppin' on some of these loudmouths with my warrior.  <br />
<br />
Other than a buttload of alchemy potions available to me what kind of tactics could be used to knock a 65 SK down?  Their ability to Harm Touch and Lifetap is almost scary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;Avg&quot; SK has 2 to 3 times more HP than you.<br />
The &quot;Avg&quot; Paladin has 4 to 6 times more HP than you.<br />
<br />
Even if you avoid DT (thats HT), you will loose, the sheer amout of HP (via taps/heals) <br />
they have means its a lost cause.<br />
<br />
You can beat them w/o spells, but with spells, its over.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Problem with mighty strike during berserk is they can just run around till timer runs out, and unless you're talking full buffed, self buffed 2handers aren't gonna swing fast enough, land enough times, and stagger enough times to keep a SK still. I normally try to duel weild during it on other classes to perm stun and hope 1 min is enough, which normally is to win.  <br />
<br />
But yeah until you are uber uber, not just uber, you have no chance against an equal SK.  Even when you can resist their life tap and spears, an equal SK is gonna have max HT to hug you with.<br />
<br />
On a one on one fight, warriors are terrible PvP, no matter how good you are, you have no blue bar to work with, and no way to heal back what you lost in any workable time.<br />
<br />
PVP in my opinion is a retarded way to compare classes, especially when a superior pvp class wants to duel you, and feels bad ass about it.  Gear plays too much role in PvP, when PvP should be about skill.</div></div><hr />

if not a option get your ds as high as possible, insta click cancil majic, first 4 buff slots free(if you need to cancil yourself) you want to kill their mana regen asap. bash like mad soon as they start casting or heck as often as it pops. you can't catch the horse just stop and turn on healing will. right click hold and move mouse will spin you faster then any other method. fight in a crowded area so you cant be kited easy. crippling blows stun you get low hit it and pop off a bow shot and stop them in their tracks and rip um a new one.<br />
<br />
if they say no disc well then you say no spells.<br />

you will lose alot. a whole lot. seriously tons tons of losses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I can't beat an SK, I probably can't beat a bard either, that doesnt make warriors terrible in PvP.  Thats 2 classes I have trouble with, haven't dueled a paladin yet, but I have plenty of screenshots of dead rangers, beastlords and dresswearers that make me think we arent too bad off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I play on VZ and fight alot of SK's, most of which I have double AA points and at least equal gear, I dont think I have ever even came close to beating a SK who had the 65 Lifetap.  Now this doesnt mean that we warriors suck in pvp in fact I like fighting Robes, we do pretty well against them, we can also do ok against rangers if we have enough resists.  Pallys, Bards kick our ass, Druids dominate warriors if they are anywhere near equal geared/AAed.<br />
<br />
  Also the person who said break out a 1h and pray to stun them enough, probably hasnt tried it, because in Pvp a SK will be jousting (if they know what they are doing) so your 1h weapon will be doing absolutly crap to them while they Tap/spear/joust you down.<br />

It's doable.  But problem is when they get low they'll just start running (or shadowstep).<br />
<br />
Unless you know for sure who you're going is going to stand still and die (which is unlikely) you should never duel anyone as a Warrior because you can't kill anyone that's running unless they're significantly weaker than you.<br />
<br />
Or get Ton Po Shurikens.<br />
<br />
Versus paladin it's absolutely hopeless.  No chance to win at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rarely lose to pallies... I've even beaten one that had VoQ without telling me (he eventually admitted it). It helps to have decent regen against a pally, because even if they joust their damage is so low, especially if you're a good jouster, they'll hardly touch you. Just be ready to slam 'em when they try to heal, and if they do get off a heal that's only like 1 or 2 solid rounds of combat with any halfassed 2her. Pallies are just boring as shit to duel, but with some luck you can kill 'em before they get off LH and make it into an insanely long fight. SK's on the other hand, the only way to beat one would be to get very lucky with either fellstrike or mightystrike.... Mightystrike is nice when youre berserk and every hit stuns 'em, but unless youre lucky and they die within that mightystrike you're shit outta luck because they'll just tap it all back. One time I got close to beating an SK with a 1600ish cripp with fellstrike on, but then he just tapped it back ;( I'd say SK's and bards are the only ones that, unless theyre a complete moron, warriors really have no chance at beating. Anyone else and you stand quite a good chance actually.</div></div><hr />

Neg 500 svm on touch of innoruuk so a resist is unlikely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no way you can beat a high end Paladin in a duel as a Warrior, even if they're standing there.  Much, much harder if they're actually running.</div></div><hr />

For one you don't even remember the name of who said it, second you don't read close enough, which is a pretty annoying fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
My reply to the 2hander was to Eoden who said 2hander with MS during berserk is best bet, which doesn't work well vs SKs because of running around(Jousting is an example).  I said I try to 1h other classes (which we're talking about SK, so that means anything OTHER than SK).  Read before you state things next time.<br />
<br />
I've done my share of dueling, both from low lvl gear to average to EP type gear, and granted I don't play on a pvp server, but a 1on1 self buffed duel in bazaar is something I know about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Far as I'm concerned, gear means too much to a warrior, any warrior who is mediocre to good gear gets wasted by just bout every other mana using class no matter how good you are.  Once you get into the uber range, classes get slimmed down as spells become resisted reliably, but either way, warriors aren't anywhere NEAR top pick pvp when it comes to 1on1 with self buffs.</div></div><hr />

Fellstrike with Ton Po Shuriken is the only reliable way a Warrior has to finish of anyone that's running away.  If you can't kill the other guy, you can't win.</div></div><hr />

I thank all that have contributed to my question.  This seems like a challenge, and boy do I love to win challenges.  All of these posts have provided valuable direction to me.<br />
<br />
From what I can understand melee isn't an option in dueling a SK.  Trying to survive the Lifetapping isn't either, and using valuable disciplines on a running target is useless.<br />
<br />
Keeping these factors in mind ( and that I refuse to give up on this ) ... what do you think of this tactic I am planning to try out?<br />
<br />
The absolute LAST thing I figure a SK would consider out of a warrior is that we would be casting spells at them.  The alchemy potions I can make with my shaman could come in handy here.<br />
<br />
First of all the &quot;Shadow Step&quot; potion could be used to send me out of my opponents casting range, and maybe could provide a little confusion as well.  <br />
<br />
After that I could move in range to throw &quot;Snaring Concoction 3&quot; potion.  Once snared I can again run out of casting range or Shadow Step again.  Then it's time to get my bow out and start pecking my opponent to death.<br />
<br />
Keeping care to stay on the outside range of the bow I should be able to get as many hits as I can before I see my SK opponent start to cast again.  Once that happens I run my butt backward out of the casting range... then sneak back in for one or two more arrows.<br />
<br />
Although I have never tried it before the &quot;Cancel Magic&quot; potions may be able to dispell any snares or dots that land on me.<br />
<br />
This almost sounds like a humiliating way to take an opponent down, but it seems fitting in this circumstance.  I will try this on a SK friend of mine and post my results here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowstep doesn't really help because spells are 360.  The longer the fight goes the more likely you're going to lose, unless you have the HPs to run the SK out of mana, but in that case you already won, and your only obstacle is to find a way to finish off a fleeing opponent.  The SK strategy goes like this.  Assuming no HT (it's basically impossible to win against a SK that uses HT as a warrior), a SK can do maybe 70-80% of your HP damage in straight melee before he runs out.  Hence, the point is to run around to stretch the fight out so his spells (particularly lifetaps) can do the 20-30% he needs.  The longer the fight goes, the more time SK has to use spells to even up the fight, unless you both have so much HPs that taps can't make up for the 20-30%.<br />
<br />
Alchemy potions don't have any resist mod on them if I recall.  Even against a fairly low end SK it's not easy to land a snare, and certainly not on any high end SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
Here's some ideas for you to &quot;level&quot; the playing field a bit.  Expensive, but worth doing if you need it.<br />
<br />
-Since you have a shammy, you have a ready source of IG toe potions (stinging wort?) Anyway, an instant cast 300pt heal that can be made into 10 shot, 3k in a second or two if you click fast.  BIG equalizer to the pally/SK, since you can probably carry more potions than they have manapools (i.e. 1 10 slot backpack = 30k hp).  Expect to be called a cheater tho, they won't like it. ;)<br />
<br />
-If you are rich and/or elemental tagged, consider getting a driftwood compound bow (50 pt. mana tap)... it'll help, but bow procs are hella rare so don't count on it.  There's also a dagger (insanity crawler fang?) that has the same proc.<br />
<br />
-fight the SK at the BOTTOM OF A SMALL VALLEY.  shadowstep ALWAYS places the caster at a location equal to or lower than the starting location that has NO higher elevation between the start/end loc, and never goes through walls or terrain of any type.  I.e. if you cast shadowstep at the bottom of a pit, you don't go anywhere.  You could also get your own shadowstep item, war useable boots drop in the vamp castle in teb mtns (fairly long cast tho).<br />
<br />
-use a bio orb to blind them (cast time isn't too bad, good range), snare glands and/or sceptre of forlorn to snare them, or crystal webs to root.  Forlorn totem of rallos zek (stonebrunt drop) is also a decent right click stun, tho I'm not sure it'd stick to a level 65 toon.<br />
<br />
-get a pet to help follow them and/or interrupt their casting.  Easiest one drops in uguk, but is extremely low level elemental (brasier of some type, from summoner), can also do gnollslayer quest for a level 30ish shammy pet.  I'd imagine all the old sk pet summoning teeth are gone by now.<br />
<br />
-Amulate of necropotence + 2x shrink = very tiny skeleton, MUCH harder for them to joust you and keep track of where you are at.  Won't stop them casting on you, but will make meleeing them much easier.  Shammy illusion potions for small races also work if an AoN isn't an option.<br />
<br />
-duel in a water zone like the ferrott; pc's can't cast into or out of water.  Watch for casting message, jump in or out as needed.  Cheezy but works and evens out the playing field considerably.<br />
<br />
-Also cheezy, but amazingly effective vs. fair weather duelers, is fake emotes that look like /discs being used. :)<br />
<br />
-and weapon selection... ToD for slowing, tash stick for debuff, there's some nice dot weapons out nowdays, stun procs are good, and if you can get one, so are lifetaps.<br />
<br />
Just some ideas.<br />

my favorite &quot;SK&quot; item killer ( not always ).. pretty much just &quot;kite&quot; the SK until you proc then pop healing will ( take off your haste item so you wont waste arrows and still keep the 2 proc per min ratio). After oom just hope your the better jouster =P. Pack some pumice as well, it annoys them a lot.<br />

<br />
My favorite tactic for dueling is DISARM. It is a pretty useless skill against mobs unless they are light blue and carrying Fine steel weapons, But against players I usually disarm first shot everytime. It not only lowers the amount of damage from the other player, but it also makes them rummage through their bags looking for theier weapon for a few seconds.  It's a great tactic against bards when you disarm their instrument so they can't mez or charm you.</div></div><hr />

I have only been beaten by 1 warrior and he has done it twice.  We were self buffed only and he used a TSBS both times.  The hits wrecked me as I am not a jousting dueler.  That being said I have also killed warriors who had over 2k more hps then I did when I was self buffed.  I prefer to face my opponents head on so they have a good look at who kicked their ass.  Gear plays a part but its all about the player and the tactics used.<br />
<br />
As for the guy who said to dispell and run and joust, I had a 65 rogue try that once.  She was doing pretty good until I dropped a 5k HT on her.  Spells + HT bomb &gt; jousting.</div></div><hr />

We do pretty well at low levels with poisons and a few tricks but once resists kick in seriously, I've yet to find much profit in duelling anyone but finger-wigglers.  Even then things are hardly easy, although a good PvP Rogue can often harry a wizard or mage enough to cause fits.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason why jousting is the standard 'fighting' tactic when duelling other melees, is that in a pure toe to toe fight, there is absolutely no skill element, while jousting allows the person with better timing/moves to gain an edge over a lesser skilled opponent.<br />
<br />
That said, assuming equal gear and skill, you cannot beat a Shadowknight.  Your only chance at beating a shadowknight is if you are a vastly superior jouster, or you massively outgear him.<br />
<br />
Losing to a warrior as an SK requires a colossal act of mental retardation on the SK's side, or being incredibly outgeared.<br />

The bow procs a 1k mana drain over one minute.</div></div><hr />

HT is a hard one to win agianst, if your fast an have a shiny brass idol you might live, other then that it's a instant-win for the SK. This is being changed soon, but as it stands it's unresistable. <br />
<br />
Their life taps, you should resist all of them but the level 65 one, but it has a one min recast time on it an does 500hp non-focus/crit. <br />

<br />
Worst thing an sk can do beyond DT/HT, is a DS, keep a dispell item handy, rember their pets, you have no channleing skill. Don't waste time trying to cast if you have something beating on you.<br />
<br />
Healing pots are a good idea if you got em. as far as keeping the sk (or any one else from running) not gona happen as a warrior, unless their way under geared.<br />
If you hunt Howling stones it never hurts to have a glob of goo (name is off but close).<br />
<br />
The valley idea is great if you get to pick the location. Your best chance to win is to resist their spells an keep them in melee. Most will just joust, which is about 10 min of boredom if the sk doesn't have DT up, by them some one wanders off.</div></div><hr />

That would slow the SK down for some crippling blows, or whatever discipline you wanted to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem with using bows is that, even with WA5 and max dex, bow procs are stupid rare and unreliable.  The 1k mana dot is a good one since it &quot;keeps going&quot;, but for snaring I'd stick to an instant click instead (fungusbeast gland, sceptre of forlorn, etc.).<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, for jousting the biggest non-skill-based advantage besides runspeed is size.  A shrunken skele is REALLY hard to see/keep track of, if you are fast you can stay &quot;under&quot; the other guy's viewport if they use first person view.  Can also &quot;hide&quot; in corpses (tho they can still cast on you), etc.<br />
<br />
A fun place to duel is a place where the topography makes strategy and situational awareness a factor.  Lavastorm is a good place, the layout makes using shadowstep iffy (i.e. fight near the big lava lake, shadowstep puts you at the BOTTOM if you land in it, etc.).  Fighting in towns or dungeons makes aggro control and placement/pathing an issue, etc.  Stand-up dueling in an arena is fairly boring after a short while, find new places to keep it interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AThousandYoung</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be able to take advantage of the fact that these guys play on a blue server and play easy PvP classes, so may not have much skill.  Their gear may not be PvP appropriate, etc.  First of all, pick one of the two classes to prepare for.  The Paladin for example...it's probably the one that's easier to prepare for.  Have a suit of gear that is solely dedicated to your having good MR and hardcore AC, HP, regen etc.  Kite with the manatap bow whenever the mana DOT isn't on him and joust otherwise with a high damage high delay two hander.  If people at your level have high resists as a matter of course, you can ignore resistable proccing weapons in favor of pure damage, AC etc.  Damage shields are nice but in a jousting fight probably not that useful because hits on you will be rare and for high damage.  I always remember blue server tanks (and tanks played by crappy PvP players) having bad resists.  I remember owning an even SK with my Wizard, a fight which favors the SK, mostly because of resist differences...his Spears bounced off me and my nukes landed on him. <br />
<br />
The only thing a Paladin will have on you really will be stuns, buffs and massive healing which is equivalent to many more HP...and channelling too.  Your advantages are slightly better DPS, better AC and HP unbuffed (not counting heals), innate MR advantages, and being better prepared for the class matchup/terrain/PvP in general.<br />
<br />
One tactic will be to win through boredom.  The fight will be long and boring, and since the Paladin has the inherent advantage and is usually the better duelling class against most anyone, he will be overconfident, and especially as the fight goes longer and longer will be more and more likely to do something stupid.  Don't let this happen to you and try to get him to make mistakes and capitalize on them.  You can use psychology too by taunting him and not letting his taunts get to you or affect your game.<br />
<br />
Terrain should help too.  The more extreme a zone, the more of an element of unpredictability there will be, and the more of an advantage there will be to someone who knows the zone well...Lavastorm would be good like Remf suggested, and zones with aggro mobs or ones that you have high faction with could help too.  If you have high faction, that's kind of unfair, but if the mobs are just generally aggro then they are equally a factor to both of you and it's fair but an advantage to someone who's more prepared/experienced.  Knockback items are good for extreme terrain fights.<br />
<br />
Also, in general, make sure you have your PvP skills.  Know how to joust, and practice often in duels against any melees and hybrids you meet.  Have instaclicks to protect your buffs against dispells, have dispell items, have instacast items, have items that cast or proc cool spells like Snare or Blind, be prepared to be disarmed and be fast at redrawing your sword or axe if it happens, be able to swap weapons or items quickly as you need to, have emotes that look like discipline use or that say you died or whatever, make sure you disarm the opponent, etc etc etc.  Make sure you dispell the hell out of him because he's going to be highly buffed.  You might be able to dispell off his heal over times too.<br />
<br />
Warriors do have more killshot ability than Paladins because of crits and cripples, especially when dual wielding with fellstrike as was already mentioned.  I remember jousting a Warrior with my Ranger on Tallon Zek and being utterly surprised by his Weighted Axe crit killshot.  I went from like 30-40% to DEAD if I remember correctly, though it's been a long time.<br />
<br />
Also, if you get him to Lay on Hands, you might want to begin prolonging the fight while whittling away at him with the manatap bow and any DOT proccing items you can find so that you can regen your HP back to full.  Using Lay on Hands is for the purposes of the duel a nearly permanent penalty for the Paladin, unless the fight gets REALLY long, which might happen for Warrior vs Paladin now that I think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* load up on potions and debuff clicky buyables<br />
* use those potions/clickies on your enemies<br />
<br />
<br />
if youre fighting a monk/rog/pal/zerker ... get a high dmg/delay and joust<br />
<br />
if youre fighting a caster get a quicker higher dps 2hander (GSoFW) and do some serious up close dmg and pray for an interrupt<br />
<br />
if youre fighting a sk/ranger/bard ... try and run .. they'll fuck you up<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
once you hit the highend with endgame resists and weapons, i'm sure the strat changes, but for us non-ubers just use your discs as best you can and use your head.  you can win .. the odds just arent stacked in your favor.  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit- ps .... you are going to get kited  now and then and there isnt much at all you can do about it  :( .   your best bet is to first debuff the hell out of them, and then perhaps using the blind clickey item to land a quick &quot;wtf ... i cant see!&quot; on them.  if blind lands try and catch up to then and blow offensive discs hardcore while you have the advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For casters, always remember that good ones will try to move to a wall/corner to try and channel spells because interupts come easy with a knockback, but if they can't be knocked back due to geometry then no interupts except from a stun. The key is to never fight them into a wall/corner, you should always be able to manuver yourself so that you aren't hitting them into a wall. Corners can be trick, but you shold be able to move behind or enough to the side to knock them out of the corner.<br />
<br />
Remember caster need to be buffed to be fully effective, dispell their buffs and they are at a disadvantage. Your attack should already be higher than thier AC, so you should be dealing max DPS against them. High magic resists, and all resists for that matter, can't be stated enough. Use your resist disc.<br />
<br />
Really you should be only at a big disadvantage if you don't have a cancel magic item. Or when fighting a hybrid, especially SK, melee. Pure melee, I've really never had a problem with because most at based around situational damage. Warriors can be tough, its really a battle of gear if both know what they are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we had the druid to 80% and the mage at 75ish% when my warrior friend went down to the druid dots and a swarm of mage pets + a nuke (he got rooted with low MR) .... <br />
<br />
After downing my friend they let their guard down and i ran in with my boom stick (yak + gsofw) and hit my fellstrike disc (i was at 80% because they conentrated on 1 vs the other).<br />
<br />
the ninnies stood there and tried to cast through the onslaught and i ignored the pets.  <br />
<br />
i squished them both in about 3 seconds total.  while they played with my friend i had debuffed them both fully.  they were both sow speed, though, and i couldnt catch them till they thought they had won and decided to burn me down.<br />
<br />
<br />
warriors make great additions to a pvp group, but solo we are at a huge disadvantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only sk i beat was a pretty poorly geared one who ran oom when i was at 50% ... neither one of us had outside buffs, so he went down rather quickly after that.<br />
<br />
with my bp click i can hit 260 MR without breaking a sweat ... it really helps on root/snare .... it helped in that fight most of all in that i resisted his harm touch heh (he didnt disc it /boggle)</div></div><hr />

Good luck if you do dule them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok that bow proc is really mean, and can make a huge difference if it procs.  ToInny's recast is not 1 minute though or I wouldnt have lived through most of the stuff I have :D.<br />
<br />
Here is an example of the typicial spell line up I use when dueling another melee.<br />
<br />
Snare, ToInny, ToVitalis, HS, Spear, DS, Spear, and Lifeleach or Blood of Hate.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the nerf to Lifetap DoT spells and the fact that all the SK debuff spells dont work on PC's (/rude SoE) it does hinder my spell line up a bit.  When dueling a caster I will sometimes load up my self rune to eat what tiny bit of spell dmg is can.  <br />
<br />
The best way to beat a SK is jump him in the arena w/ atleast 2-3 other people.  A couple of guildies did that to me this weekend and it was a 6 on 1 fight.  I burned down the Monk and did what I could until I had to hightail it out a 3% hps hehe.</div></div><hr />

Nice &quot;new&quot; dueling weapon for warriors, staff of the slavers.<br />

<br />
Drops on Ikaav in Barindu, looks like a (rather lame) spear when equipped but is 1hb.  Proc is a 200dd + 200 mana drain, sv magic with a -200 modifier.<br />
<br />
Here's another with the same proc, would be a very nice jousting weapon but no idea where it drops:<br />
