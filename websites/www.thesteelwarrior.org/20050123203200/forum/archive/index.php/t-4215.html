<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, here's the deal. I'm a 65 warrior w/ ND3, working on other AAs &amp; I have the cash to either upgrade to CoF or just keep getting better armor. Right now I have a Soulscream Belt &amp; a Cloak of Greater Pernicity, which I would change to a Cloak of Flames &amp; a Heavy Rubicite Girdle. The overall stat changes are:<br />
<br />
+14ac, +9agi, +9dex, -23cha, -16sta, -30str, +55hp, +19svf, -1svc<br />
<br />
So what should I do? Its only 5% more haste &amp; I could upgrade something else instead of this... or is the 5% haste really necessary? Thanks!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those two bits of info will help answer your question better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilwee Beasty</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is do LDoN Everforst *hard* missions till you get one of the 90 hp haste cloaks. Of course this is dependant upon your level of play since hard missions are no joke even with some Elemental gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm much more of an exper, my guild is trying to get to VT... my unbuffed sta right now is like 252 I think? Not sure about that though, my str is 273. SO basically will the sta I'm losing hurt me more than the HP I'm gaining?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have 252 sta unbuffed you can almost max it with Boar even after losing 16 on your cloak.  &gt;255 STA has lesser hps than before 255 as well, so even if you max at 296 and have max planar power, you are only missing a few hps at most from not having STA capped..  Also, if you're going to VT your sta will be maxed soon (see my profile for the silly amount of STA on VT loot, I am around 370 sta unbuffed now).  You should always be wearing the best haste item you can find, and you won't miss the STA .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another choice if you have lots of LDoN points is to build up a haste item with augs and such.  There is a 36% haste aug slot 3 I believe and quite a few LDoN items that have 75 hps with type 1/2/3 slots.  There was a thread in this forum about that the other day you might search for it</div></div><hr />

Seeing as you're in a guild headed for VT, I'd guess that HoT wouldn't prove to be a problem for you folks.  I've done everything needed for Silver Bracelet of Speed (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=31461)<br />
<br />
I didn't notice your magelo, so I dunno if it's a downgrade for you.  However, this solves your haste problems (41%), probably an upgrade for you and then you can wear whatever in your waist/back slot.<br />
<br />
Dozekar can be 1 grouped, but 2 or 3 groups makes it much more certain (we did him in 10 minutes last time).  The other minis are up once a week, like Doze (I believe) and can all definately, easily, be 1 grouped.<br />
<br />
I got all my symbols in one night of killing 4 of the minis, then did Dozekar with 3 guild groups to get my plat tear.  We cleared the rest of the minis in 3 hours tops and pretty much got almost all the symbols needed for another bracer!<br />
<br />
I've only done Dozekar twice, but I guess his plat tear is semi-rare, so it may take a couple of kills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dozeker quests sucks to finish sorry. We worked on it with my old guild some years back. I think we got 150 drops and was capable of finishing only 4 items by putting all the drops we got in a big bowl and see what we had (multiquest). <br />
<br />
If you like to Xp then farm the 1492 helm from tak and the 1150 36 % haste from MM. (haste augment is range, waist, back and helm slot only)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">41% haste (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3735&amp;highlight=woven+shim)<br />
<br />
not a bad haste item there, 41%.  easy to do in 1hr, 2-3 groups.</div></div><hr />
