The barbarians got the shaft on the original cultural smithing stuff, so there aren't many barbarian master smith's out there; nobody thought it was worth the effort at the time.  That may change over time now that the Helanic Tundra stuff has been implemented(one of the best armor sets around).  I hope it's easier for you than me. (seems like the only thing tougher to find is a troll master smith) :)<br />

I got my smithing to 175 relatively easily, then it just got waaaay to expensive for me to keep going with it.  And while I'm sure there are a few GM barbarian smiths on Innoruuk, they're still extraordinarily rare. (but if you need a new suit if banded armor, I can help you out) :)<br />
