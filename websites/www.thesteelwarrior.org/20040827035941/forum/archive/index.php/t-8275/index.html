<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say warrior, cleric, enchanter. It's the holy trinity for a damn good reason. Your DPS will be a bit low, however.</div></div><hr />

 Hrm. No snare IS a bad thing, I forgot about it. The reason I suggested enchanter over shaman is for the combination of mez, slow and group mana regen. A shaman is definitely a decent replacement though, especially if you plan on just buying KEI before heading out. No slow will kick your butt at the high end, fyi.<br />
<br />
  Alternate group makeup: Warrior, shaman, druid. Reasons: shamans will take care of buffing, debuffing, slowing and some healing, while the druid will be main healer, snarer, additional buffer and porter. The combo should be higher DPS than warrior, cleric and enchanter as well as buffing to higher hp. Cons: No form of mez, less efficient heals, worse haste and less mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tough one here. It really all depends on the zone. I do a War Shm Cle trio sometimes and yes the dps is a bit low but the shm DOT's and pet help that. I just have to pick spots where snare is not needed. I would say any of the ones listed above are good it depends upon personal style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I 3-boxed warrior, cleric, mage for a while and it's a good combo if you don't need slow.  Warrior/cleric/beastlord would be good if you don't mind running a second melee, but you still have no snare.  <br />
<br />
You could use a druid as your main healer, but if you like being self-sufficient then not having res sucks.  War/Druid/Shaman or War/Druid/Beastlord or War/Druid/Enchanter would all be viable I think.  Personally I love my cleric, and any 3-box combo would include a warrior and a cleric.  Necro would be a pretty good third....you have snare, invis, FD, and pretty good dps with that trio along with premier defense in your tank and healer.  If you really have to have slow though, you're stuck with a shaman, enchanter, or beastlord, which means you have to have a druid healer if you want snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>david559</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My main reason for 3boxing is to do ldon. druid, warrior, and shaman covers a lot of bases. Only thing i would miss from cleric is pacify, which might be a must for those rooms that have 5 or 6 mobs in them. Also would want a combo that could have enough dps that could finnish a ldon in time to win the mission. Thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman and Warrior has always been a good combo.  But if your doing something that needs snare or cc your going to have problems.  Wiz would be great for snare and dps and its so easy to box one.  But if you need CC then chanter and cleric is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warrior, cleric bard<br />

Bard = puller, slower, haster, mana, mez/CC. snarer<br />
Cleric = self explanatory<br />
Warrior= self explanatory<br />

It's lethal.</div></div><hr />

I like warrior,cleric,beast to go through pre GOD stuff.Gotta get over snare has said above.My friend used to do LDONs np with her cleric and beast(she was a great player though) and sometimes invited me along.She used stun and positioning mostly.She crawled most dungeons that were out pre god I think and did well,but, rl has since distracted her.I'm not the player she was and lack of snare scares me hehe.For god you will need cc or singles...Dump beast for bard or chanter probably.Sounds like dps hell tho.If you stuck with undead Necro would be perfect but....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>david559</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I never played a bard before. From what I understand about them bards require a lot of attention to get full use out of them. I think they would be more work than fun to box with. Not sure but I think I would do better to box another class I can get close to its full potential than to box a class that requires alot of attention such as a bard. That being said, I never played one so I am just speculating.<br />
  I would not want to play a hybrid tank just for the reason warriors are easier to box and can take a pounding like no other.  :)  <br />
  The only time not having a snare is a problem is when the mob is sow. Trying to chase a mob that is sow is a pain and at that time I am always thinking I wish i had snare. <br />
  Thanks for the replies. I am still debating on which 2 classes will to box with my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would say your best bet is going to be Warrior, Cleric and Shaman.  Buy a snare whip for a few K if that and snares are covered.  You can also switch out the Shaman for a BL for a bit more dps, slightly less buffing and at some point I think the BL gets AAs that allow the pet to snare.  <br />
<br />
I wouldnt look at dropping a good slower for snare.  Running mobs can be a Pita, maybe even train ya.....but you will see that an unslowed mob is just gonna eat you or your healer/snarer if you dont get agro set.  <br />
<br />
I would say cleric is a better choice over a druid for healing, but druid ports sure can be nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love my wifes shammy.She's pretty strong at healing now with aa and gear and  ok dps.A beast does more for a trio through a large part of the game though and is formidable with a stronghealer.Heck they buff for more hp...poor shammys hehe. :)</div></div><hr />

If you don't mind being on the up and up, it's possible to twist 4 songs with MacroQuest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warrior, Cleric, Bard is the ultimate defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scurian Toanfro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the solution is this - Warrior, Cleric (make sure to go DE-innorruk worshipping cleric and do the snare necklace quest) and either, shaman or enchanter as your 3rd.  This way you have the snare covered pretty early on.  I may choose to go the shammy route on 3rd as your slower simply because the buffs rock, however if you go to high lvl the shammy buffs will probably be overcome, IMO, by the chanter crack for the cleric and a DC pet.  So early on a shammy would probably be better for DPS and buffs while high end the chanter would probably take the lead once you get DC.<br />
<br />
Hard sayin which is the best choice for the last spot, personal preferrence probably, but I think this combo is about the sweetest set up and covers as many bases as you can with 3 toons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the best combo is Bard, War, Cleric not War, ...<br />
if you take a bard, you will need to use it as main because it's the one the bring the more possibility so it's the one that will need more work (pulling, CC, Buff&amp;Debuff).<br />
if you don't feel the bard as main, then forget about it.<br />
the second best choice is War, Cleric(HP/AC buff, pacify, nuke because mana support via Chanter), Chanter (Haste/Slow, DPS via DC, Mez, Mana support, stuns)<br />
War, Sham(Haste/Slow, Buff/Debuff, HoT, DoT, Pet, ...), Druid (DS!!, Nuke, Port, Main Healer, ...) No Stun, No Res -&gt; better with a Pal but still ok with a war<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
as you can see, there plenty of choice, it depends on the work you will invest on the other toon. for an easy to go setup war/Cle/Enc is the best but you must consider charm not as an option in higher content.<br />
for a biger versality, Bard/Dru/SK is very powerfull but need lots of work (less buff but more in fight tools -&gt; harder to control).<br />
If you want a War and no charm then War/Sham is the best, and to complete the trio Druid is no more an option you will have strong buff, and you will have the possiblity of strong debuff, DoT, HoT, Heal, Nuke, and smaller pet. you won't have rez but Port/Sow/speed debuff/root... might be as good for a quick run back and get out in hurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">my brother and i have had a lot of success with war cleric bst. we farmed mini names in bot and tactics for ornate drops which turned into and absurd amount of cash after we used all the molds an patters we needed back when our gear wasnt as hot. LDoN we've done with those 3, but it took up almost the entire 90 mins (more like 80 if i remember right). we've also hit up most of veksar, some of SolC and a fair share of CT. good DPS with a bst over shammy, our cleric is DE and has the snare necklace, and my bro now has the snare AA for his pet which he says procs every other second. plus, bst buffs give you a little more hp over just a shammy and you get that extra 9 mana and hp regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just make a Troll/Inny following shaman, or a DE/Inny following cleric and quest for the snare necklace they get.  It is not a long duration snare but your not quad kiting just stopping runners, cast it at about 30% and always Malosinia the mob to help it stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">if you have cleric i'd do beastlord instead of shaman, the only thing they really dont have going for them besides lack of heals (which cleric covers) is resist debuff, but sooo many benefits..  mana regen, greatly increased dps, etc.. oh yeah and one of their pet procs you can cast is snare although not sure if its 100% reliable</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess I will ask the obvious question. How many machines? That matters more than most other things. And how are they equipped?<br />
<br />
More machines = easier<br />
<br />
On one machine you would be a fool to do anything other than something like warrior/cleric or druid/slower and you likely wont be able to do GoD (the lag for me is horrible on my 3 box in GoD when the zone is empty except for my total 6box) and this is the best machine Dell makes with 4GB and bband<br />
<br />
On two+ machines your options are open but if you are gonna do GoD you have to have warrior / druid or cleric  / slower, anything  else is risky unless nicely equipped<br />
<br />
The one major disadvantage of pet classes for dps is the push, if you are boxing 2 or less machines then put the warrior on the solo machine so you can reposition him to hold aggro<br />
<br />
My setup varies but is gonna be in the next week:<br />
3 machines, 6-7 total active accounts<br />
3box - monk on top (tag pull), cleric, wizard<br />
2-3box - chanter on top (CC), shammy on bottom, ranger for tracking/dps (if needed)<br />
1box (laptop) - warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end compare # of machines, projected content, desired/current equipment, and come up with a configuration (to include what goes where) that works. And abuse the hell out of your hotkeys, they are essential! If you want to do anything quickly you will likely have /assist and /follow hotkeyed to your puller (whoever that is gonna be). Hotkey your heals as well.<br />
<br />
Its also far easier if you overpower your content to offset your complexity (in short dont expect to 3 box things that a grp of 3 can kill unless those three likely have a 75% to kill). You can ride the edge once you get the hang of it but things that a normal grp can kill easily at my equipment level are more challenging for me as I keep flipping back and forth (course 3box is far easier than 6). The ultimate challenge to your box is anything that drops your tank fast (i.e. GoD) as lag is your enemy. If doing that kind of content then your cleric needs to be keyed to the tank (less nuking) and likely on top (top active box).<br />
<br />
GD<br />
<br />
And btw you can 3box on dialup ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>david559</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have 3 seperate computers. I would like to keep things as simple as possible and still be effective. Boxing a warrior/ cleric is not to bad. I like the way they complement each other. Everyone here seems to agree that there is a need for a slower. So adding a slower to that combo would either be chanter, BL, or shaman. I dont want to charm so I think BL or shaman would be better. I think between those two I  would choose the one that I could box the easiest and still be effective. <br />
  If anyone has any experience with boxing between those 2 I would like to here it. I like to say thanks for all the responces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Warrior, Druid, Beast is your best bet.<br />
<br />
Warrior tank means druid heals are good enough.<br />
<br />
Druid has snare, mana-regen hp buffs, DS, snare, evac, ports, nukes.  All of which are easily macroed via hotkeys, and require little attention.<br />
<br />
Beastlord has a good enough slow, mana-regen, paragon, nice pet, nice pet procs (stun rather nicely), good melee, GREAT tanking ability for a slower (can slow on inc, and tank til you get agro, will have to wait with your shaman or enchanter.  Resisted slows are nps, since you can just recast immediately and /disc protective spirit and take 10% of the regular damage.  Better buffs than a shaman, argueably, ferocity, etc.<br />
<br />
Warrior....well you know that one.<br />
<br />
Shaman/chanter and cleric is ok, but not as good imo.<br />
<br />
I box my wife's druid with my beast some, and I am damn glad she has over 1kac, so she can take some hits (in older content that is) w/o worry.  When it comes to boxing, durability is a GREAT thing.  Chanter are fragile, and can easily die before you can get to the controls and save them.  Shaman are only marginally better.  Beasts are magnitudes better then either.  Druids are slightly worse than clerics, but clerics have too little utility.</div></div><hr />
