<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any idea's on how to make platinum.<br />
It seems that most warriors my level are superior in gear in every way(Except in a few areas). This really has me down, because at level 61, i was out ACed and HPed by a 59 warrior(Ogre,super twink).<br />
<br />
But I need good ideas on how to make PP so I can upgrade my armor, but I also want Exp while I'm at it. Any ideas would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
BUT, the good news is, with your new mitigation ... and your healing will disc ... and your unlinked discs ... you actually have a shot at doing some interesting farming.<br />
<br />
Tradeskill items are good. Spider Silks are quite popular. Or LQ hides for making padding. Or make the padding/silk swatches and sell them.<br />
<br />
You can farm coin. Killing dark elf guards inside neriak was always popular back in the day. Or dorf guards in butcherblock.<br />
<br />
Or just go and rape a lower level zone (Sol A, Najena, Runnyeye, whatever).<br />
<br />
Or you can hit some LoY zones (Dulak's Harbor with the boats are quite the popular spot) and farm raw coin/gems.<br />
<br />
Sebilis is still a spot to snag some coin.<br />
<br />
Just tossing out ideas.<br />
<br />
I hate farming money, so don't do it often.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can get some 200pp splits in LDoN, while getting some xp and points, not bad at all.<br />
<br />
Heard the Initiates in Gunthak temple entrance drop gems, but bring some Snare device ( Whip or Kunzar Kuthingy) cause they flee like they had a stake of fire in their asses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My little secret is Permafrost. Usually get about 50ish pp and a pile of gp per clearing of the gobbies. Tares Lichen and Snowfall Algae sell to vendor for 6gp each and are stackable, wt 0. Plus a few 20-200pp bazaar items and some bronze/FS/ringmail, minor gems, research crap etc. <br />
But the money maker is permafrost crystals, which sell in bazaar for 40-50pp each and I get about a stack per hour. There used to be a decent market for Ice Goblin Blood too, but I think MLers in Miragul's are holding it out, because the market is flooded now.</div></div><hr />
