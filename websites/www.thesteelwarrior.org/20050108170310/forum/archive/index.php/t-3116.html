<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mondion</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone used the lifetap augment at all from the BB camp?  I thought the idea was cool, so I put it on my BoC.  The proc appears to be bugged, was wondering if others are having the same problem I am. <br />
<br />
I first noticed it in Plane of Water.. best way I can describe it is that it spins you for a split second and then runs you in the other dirction.  Kind of messed up when your trying to tank.  Thought that this was the only zone that it was bugged in, but later found that the proc actually pulls you tward the mob in non water zones, nothing huge.. like maybe a couple feet.  Didn't think much of this until I tried to corner a mob, and every time it would proc I'd get pulled on the other side of the mob, turning the mob on the rest of the melee.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty upset about it, I've talked to a few gm's and they've said that QA will work to get it fixxed if it is indeed a bug.  Never said for certain if it is.. Looks like I may have to eat the points I've spent on the proc.  Sad thing is I'll probably buy it again when it gets fixxed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think YOU'RE bugged.  Cause i put this on my BBB for fun and its worked nothing but great for me. /shrug<br />
<br />
No problems.  Haven't used it in water yet, but have in Time and Air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mondion</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, I wouldn't say it was an aggro reducer.  But I wouldn't say it is a big aggro proc, if at all.  Its just for fun I suppose.<br />
<br />
You don't notice any movement at all when it procs?  I could be bugged, I haven't ruled that out, lol.  Maybe I'll get an illusion and see if I still have the same problems.. /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is a well-documented bug.  I.e. http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4374&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Lucy lists the lifetap procs as having a &quot;Push Back&quot; of 1.  Sony typoed.  It should have been 0.  Don't ask me how the hell you fuck that up, but there you have it.  <br />
<br />
Because Lifetap is the opposite of a DD, rather than pushing the mob back, it pushes the player forward.  I'm not sure why Khalim isn't experiencing the effects...<br />
<br />
This bug is corrected on Test and will probably be patched for live servers with the next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">graderr</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the push back from the life tap aug has been fixed, from a 1 to a 0<br />
is probly why khalim didn't get effected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They also changed it from FR resist to DR resist on test server.  It was pretty useless in SolRo/PoFire etc w/ the FR resist, tons of resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Graderr, I don't believe they have actually fixed it yet on live servers.  Although the pushback data is fixed on Lucy's from live to test, no patch has gone into effect on our servers.  Folks in my guild with this proc were still being dragged forward. Or is Khalim test?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not test.  And Still not noticing this problem.  my only speculation is that its so minor that I don't notice it during the fracas of fighting /shrug.  Or maybe . . . I dunno, maybe it has something to do with what weapon I put it on?<br />
<br />
Are you guys using the 50 pt LT or the 75 pt one? I have the 50 pt one, maybe they are slighlty different?</div></div><hr />
