<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got a Bed Leg Club (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17259) to drop in PoJ tonight and was wondering if I should use it instead of my Guard Captain's Mallet (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6824).  I only use the mallet when I'm not tanking and need faster DPS than I can get with a big 2 hander(ie Agro Kite)  I will be using it in my main hand with my Defender's Lightblade (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17200) in my offhand.<br />
<br />
The ratio on the mallet is a bit better, but the str/stam on the club should make up the hp and atk difference between them.  I dunno, seems really close between the 2 for which would be better.  Anybody see something that makes 1 better that I'm missing?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The bed leg club has a magic bane damage of +2 and a damage bonus of 11.  I'm not sure of exactly how these bonuses work, but *should* at least erase any dps advantage in the better ratio of the guard captain's mallet.  I would go with the club, selling the mallet and saving up for a weapon with a good aggro proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DPS wise, guard captains mallet is definatly better.  If you are using when not tanking, that should be all that matters.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Doh, missed the 2 magic damage that the bed leg club works.  I have heard conflicting stories on whether the damage is added as bonus damage, or added to base damage.  So in short, I am not sure which would be better.  Never mind what I said at top...oops...*shuffles for the door*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's a resistance check everytime you hit the mob. i'd actually probably go gcm/bed leg club because to me the DL is too slow but definately<br />
mallet over club.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">K thanks y'all.  I did some checking in the Bazaar earlier and found 5 of the clubs for sale at 200-250pp and 4 of the mallets on sale for 4k+.  Guess I'll keep the club and apply the cash I get for the mallet towards some upgrades.<br />
