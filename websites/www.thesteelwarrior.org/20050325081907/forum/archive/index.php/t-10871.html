We killed all the drakes in the area, plus some goblins and got 0 drops.<br />
<br />
Anyone had any success with this task, or is it broken?</div></div><hr />

Clearing every accessable mob in the zone to get the 2 spider stones for whatever the name of the mission was and getting only one stone blew hard. And no, we didn't let any corpses rot.<br />
<br />
There is another where it asks you to inspect the destruction in the lair... we killed and killed and killed and walked around and looked everywhere but were never able to complete the second of the three subtasks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also it seems like repops will never have the drops, so you actually have to know which areas you've cleared.  My suggestion is to never do that mission.</div></div><hr />
