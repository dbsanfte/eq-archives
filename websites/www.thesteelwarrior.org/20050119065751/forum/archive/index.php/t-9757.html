<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrathhob</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok...i'm a lvl25 Warrior and I don't have too much time (ok...and not that patient also lol) to farm until I have 5-10k to spend in a weapon. on the other hand, i do like to do quests so my question is: what are some quests which reward is a Sword? (being a lvl25 soloing)<br />
good lvl20-30 quests would be good for now:))<br />
thks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Langseaxe of the Wolves, Gnoll Slayer and Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies are the only ones that come to mind for me. I haven't done any of the lower level luclin quests, but I think there are a few. One in DS if I remeber right.  Also, the Luclin Twilight sea quests had a sword that was pretty good Soldiers Longsword i think it was called.<br />

The thing that will depress you about questing a weapon at that level is that there is nothing questable that will be better than a Centi Shortsword and you can buy that for like 50pp.  The bazaar really is the best game in town for weaps at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krenayn</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too wanted to quest for a weapon at your level but quickly resigned to the bazaar.  I used stone bladed axe (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6423) and Centi Shortsword  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=32149) until Short Sword of the Ykesha  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5500) started proccing.  When I hit 36 I picked up a Barnacle Covered Axe (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=40029) for 50pp in the bazaar.  For tanking aggro, the Yak and BCA are crazy aggro.  So get your dex up heh heh.  If I am secondary melee, I use Bladecatcher of the Marshall (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69296) and Stone bladed axe.  I'm satisfied so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everquest is pretty weak on the questing, especially at lower levels.  The newbie armor was a nice addition, but otherwise there are so few quests until you get up in levels that it is depressing.  Your best bet is to search the bazaar and look for deals, and even at higher levels for weapons you'll be looking at drops.  There are some nice armor and other slot quests though, especially when you get into your 40's/50's and can start hitting Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, weapon quests are not a functional part of the game at your level (actually, at most levels). I still have the Langseax of the Wolves in the bank. I finished the quest in my teens and was very happy indeed when I got it. I actually used it for a few levels.<br />
Anyway, start thinking Centi weapons, especially the short sword (bang for the buck). If you already have that, and something either faster for the primary hand or better ratio for the offhand, you're set. <br />
At 25 I think you can hold aggro with the cenit warspear and the Sarnak battlehammer too. <br />
If you have better than these weapons, don't worry about upgrading what you have for now, as what you have will do the job if you're playing well.<br />
What weapons do you have now, anyway?</div></div><hr />

Not positive at what level you'd have to be to complete it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are quests and spots to farm weapons.Thing is, on any server thats been up awhile it's far easier to buy other peoples(higher level hunters) drops in the bazaar than it is to farm and quest most of your own stuff.It's always been one of the worst problems in EQ imo.Leads to all sorts bad attitudes.<br />
<br />
Also the fastest way to improve your gear at that stage in the game is to level.Then you can mudflate encounters for better drops and earn pp much faster to again buy other peoples garbage.Group xp bonuses have helped to make leveling a really fast process.<br />
<br />
When Stromm opened my wife and I went there to try the game from the ground up.It was very kewl for awhile.Anyways,the bazaar was empty early on decent items sold for huge amounts.Gunnar got his own stuff and got to do a lot of the old quests which were actually kinda fun.You can get a langseax now if your faction is ok or you fix it.I had to kill the fellow 4 times to get the 2 hander(langseax of the wolves) which was uber  :)  for a little while when I got it.In your 30's(can't remember exactly when i did it) the sword I stepped up to was the Praetors blade mentioned above.The only problem with it for me was slow proc rate with the poor ratio not supporting aggro much.Both fun quests though.The Praetors sword lasted me until about 54 when i got the generals sword from echo.When it procced it was ok and I used it to MT in kael and gear up in the plate house hehe. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
This stuff won't compete well against twink/bazaar warrior gear tho.<br />
<br />
There are other weapons  around when you get a little older.Some things like the whips from the Paw and the sword from COM with engulfing darkness can be ok.You have to balance your own proc rate against ratio tho.If you're playing with low dex ratio can be better when you are young.</div></div><hr />

<br />
these are nice suggestions...i'll give it a try to see:)before posting here for quests,i'm already in the middle of Gnoll Slayer quest so i'll finish that up 1st:)<br />
probably that's the best to replace Zraxthril (my offhand) from the 3 mencioned right?<br />
 <br />
If you have better than these weapons, don't worry about upgrading what you have for now, as what you have will do the job if you're playing well.<br />
What weapons do you have now, anyway?<br />
<br />
i now dual a Bladecatcher of the MArshall and a Zraxthril Battle Axe:| i'm happy with the sword but now that much with the axe...<br />
<br />
isn't there a minimum lvl to be able to do the Praetor's quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh I still get a warm feeling when remembering back yonder when I tanked Dozekar with my Praetor Blade of Debility mainhanded and my Black Blade of Tormenting offhand....but if you get a chance to go get a Praetor Blade it's quite a neat weapon for mid levels and, well, I used it until ToVN as a reference of it's longevity ( and yes, I am quite outdated :D )</div></div><hr />
