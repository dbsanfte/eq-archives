Vex Thal is a really nice zone IMHO.  Anyways we killed Va'dyn Karath guy and got the palace key.. ok so we got a few hehe, we went in to open the first door at the steps of the Palace.. we cleared some of the mobs in the agroed in the next room.. damn that Knock back sucks... but when we were done clearing we couldnt progress further up.. what drops the second key to  open the next door? we did have a Rogue and he locked picked the door so we can do some more exploring but what drops the second key to acutaly go in pass the little section befor you actualy go into the palace couse the one we got off the huge rock didnt work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bargran</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you enter the palace, the doors at right and left used to be pickable by rogue, but not anymore.<br />
You need someone with the key (north wing key) to open it, key wich drop behind them, on mobs called Va Xakra, guarding the nameds, Thall Va Xakra.<br />
North and South, 1 Thall Va Xakra, 2 Va Xakra, each Va Xakra drop 2 keys, so 4 Keys at north, and 4 keys at south.<br />
<br />
For your first run, bring someone who already have a key, ask him to open the door, then get your keys.<br />
<br />
Other Key (north tower key) is usually not a pb to find / use, but for the first one, it is quite annoying since door isn't rogue pickable anymore.<br />
<br />
If you can't find someone with the north wing key that want to open the door for you, there is some tricks to open it, but not as easy :)</div></div><hr />

We had to do that when we first got into VT because the key to open them is past the doors which makes no sense.</div></div><hr />
