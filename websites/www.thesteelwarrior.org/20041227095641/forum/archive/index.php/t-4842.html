<br />
Personally, I abandoned bash so long ago I can't remember it because I knew I wouldn't be carrying a shield in the higher levels. <br />
<br />
But if I can bash &quot;with my body&quot; to interrupt casters, then I need to be doing that!<br />

<br />
And only large races can 'bash' with their body, but its called slam, same skill check though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash works for me fairly well, but not many pickup groups are keen on the Warrior with a shield, no matter what it does. In guild groups, tho, hell yeah - I'm still trying to max my bash, and I just got Zek Crested Buckler.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash stuns the mobs more than Kick, and since it has a higher lvl cap (240) a higher chance to actually land. I ghetto bash most of the time, cause of the added dmg (is higher than kick) and for casters, since it has a bigger chance to land and interrupt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loredena</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I slam all the time, but I'm a barbie :)   Any stun is nice (especially with not-snared runners), the damage is better then kick due to the higher cap, and it gives me a shot at interrupts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only barbs, ogres and trolls can slam. It is relatively easy to switch in a shield for your secondary or a 2hander when bash key refreshes in order to use this skill, but surprisingly few smaller race warriors or knights do so. Note that knights get an aa allowing them to bash with a 2hander equipped, but we don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grobsmashprexus</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash will stun exp mobs the majority of the time if you do it from behind.  A monk friend of mine use to have him tank the healers so I could interupt there casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went the kick route since In The Beginning I didn't know about ghetto bashing.  On the other hand, ghetto bashing is a PITA, so I don't do it now, even though I know I can.<br />
<br />
At level 55, kick interrupts spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I gave up bashing not long after getting dual weild. At the time it was a DPS and training question. Is there aggro with bash though? Like paladins get with a stun? I'd probably use it again if that were true.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious Bash items are a joke.<br />
<br />
If you have a choice between a Furious Bash item and an Enraging Blow item, go EB all the way.<br />
<br />
You'll generate SIGNIFICANTLY more agro duel weilding an EB item over bashing with a Furious Bash item.<br />
<br />
In fact, it is my belief that you will generate more agro swinging ANY weapon in your off hand than you will using Furious Bash.  It just doesn't generate much agro at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a barbarian, I have both Slam (Bashin disguise) and Kick maxed.<br />
<br />
Usually use Kick in exp groups, since Slam do not get the damage bonus from shields because you don't have one equipped .. DUH.<br />
<br />
So Kick does more damage in that case. I'm, fairly sure I'd do more damage with Bash using a shield over regular Kicks, but dropping an offhand weapon is worse DPS than a shield I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I don't and never will unless they make significant changes (maybe using a 2hander minus the damage bonus and a shield).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">being a barbarian i can and do slam. it works more than half the time and stuns them for a second or two. that short time allows me to get a round of damage in so its significant in reestlishing lost agro. and all by itself it interrupts complete heals maybe half the time. so yes its very worthwhile. so much so id swap in a cheap shield to interrupt healers if i couldnt slam without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Equirs</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...Hmm.. well, certain UIs allow you to switch betweem your secondary and shield between bash refreshes. I mean if you use F8 for rapid targetting all you have to do is hover the shield over your secondary with a mouse, click..switch, bash, then click and switch again..  <br />
<br />
For lazy people...kick works just as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i always keep my shield on me incase there's a stuborn mob that is healing a little too much. i recall doing the BoT named guy at the lightening wing (west?) and interrupting several spells with a quick ghetto bash. i also notice i land bash more often than a kick, probably due to the higher skill cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">levonbaird</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well when u r a newbe every newbes or most newbes above lvl 6 use bash because u can do 2 lots of dmg at the same time and it might stun that annoying flippy darkpaw that atked u</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another barb. Have always used Slam due to the ability to stun and interupt casters. If you rely on kick (i.e. small race and don't ghetto bash), you don't gain this ability until 55. And believe me it helps with the whole breaking mezz thing to lead with a stun-type attack... only gives an extra second or 2 but it is still time in your favour.</div></div><hr />
