<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I know we hate these kind of threads but gonna do it to you anyway.  I am in a small guild, currently I am level 55.  We don't really have the manpower to kill higher lvl mobs to obtain weapons for me that way so my sole source of uprgrades at the moment is the bazaar.  Currently for weapons I have a frosty, a guard captain's mallet, and a club of the ice ocean.  I've found that my best combo for aggro is currently the frosty mainhanded and either club off hand, both combos seem about the same to me.  I was just wondering if anyone could suggest any cheap (under 5k) upgrades for my offhand.  I was wondering if I offhanded a BCA would that be an improvement perhaps?  I had one once upon a time and wasn't too impressed with it, maybe I just had a bad streak with it at the time?  Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Am I crazy or didn't a 9/20 1hb that proced Stun drop from Gruplinort area in Sebilis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TrendosGnomeWar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah that weapon does drop in seb, called Sarnak Warhammer and is commonly confused with Sarnak Battlehammer, also is a rare drop. These are hard to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the reply, aye, its the sarnak warhammer, I also considered that one, but wasn't sure about the proc rate, anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Minowara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used sarnak warhammer for waaaay too long and I can say that it has a decent proc rate, maybe slightly higher then average. Most procs in one fight = 9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i got 11<br />
of course it was a 6 min fight. i liked it it's like a pal stun and if it procs like crazy it's amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">arf arf<br />
<br />
And I'm pretty sure Dobbo is  the fellow I bought my Sarnak Warhammer from (after seeing all the recommendations he made for it on TSW :D).  And it procs for me quite nicely, and I still use it offhand w my SotB in primary when I DW for aggro, and it seems to me that that combo snaps and holds aggro a little bit better than my GSoT (platinum pending for a shinier toy :)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Muggzy Mafungu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not sure what prices are on your server, on Saryrn, you can get Sword of the Bloodsworm for about 5k. Has a nice DD and stun that creates some decent agro. I used it at level 55 and had some good taunt with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you can muster 2 groups or so of guildees you may try going to Droga.  After the revamp you might find some nice upgrades there for you and other guildee's if you are in a small guild.  Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn drop there as far as aggro weapons.  (think the named are around lvl 60).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unless I'm totally wrong, the Greatstaff of Thunder is required 55, so you can use it.  31/30 outdamages your current weapons, it outaggroes that set by a huge margin AND a GSoT is going for under 200pp on SolRo so unless one of our servers is really screwed up, my guess is you can afford it.<br />

Get the GSoT.</div></div><hr />
