Included on these boards are class boards, with each class having 3 forums. One of these is called Class Balance.<br />
<br />
You might want to drop in there from time to time. The paladins are kicking up a stink, and the warriors aren't saying much of anything. <br />
<br />
Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but the devs actually pay attention to these boards, and there is a rep that looks in on them. So far, Brenlo has responded 4 times in the last week alone to the pallies.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not advocating whining...but if we aren't represented well, we're surely going to see either dumbed down content or worse. <br />
<br />
Sony actually appears to be listening to these boards. Don't know if they'll do anything about what they hear, but they are responding.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth...<br />

peace,<br />

Apparently they are talking about giving knights defensive (or at least a defensive like ability.)  <br />
<br />
I don't remember the exact quote, but Brenlo said something about &quot;he asked the developers if this would be possible and the idea was well received by the development team&quot;.  (I'm sure the wording was a little different, but that was the gist of his comment)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep...here is a link to a thread talking about possible knight defensive changes...<br />

SoE board link (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=paladinbalance&amp;message.id=964)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">defense meaning weapons sheild, not defensive</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen both discussed.  I personally think weapon shield is ok...but not defensive...(unless there are other compensating changes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha....they finaly made a site to post about balance where you can actually post in the knight section without being banned=)  And all the angels wept...../grins   I know they might not have been that bad but definatly one sided.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem there is they make these vast sweeping claims that have no support whatsoever. I read and posted on that FYI thread a few times, I mean really it's sad how they try to doctor up their words to make the cause sound so dramatic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a feeling Brenlo is going to want to slit his wrists before this is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted a bit on the paly board at everquestlive.  What a waste of time.  It's too bad Sony actually pays attention to those useless class boards.  For instance the paladin one is another place for disgruntled knights to trot out the same tired old bogus claims like &quot;Our spellbook is worthless!&quot;.  An SK there really is trying to use that one again.  /boggle.  Is anyone foolish enough to believe it?  Hopefully no one at SOE is.<br />
<br />
But honestly, what do they expect when they put up class balance boards at everquestlive, one for each class?  What they're in effect asking people is, &quot;do you think your class needs any upgrades?&quot;  Hmm.... geee... what do you suppose they'll get in response to that question?  I don't know.  What do people say in response to, &quot;do you want $100?&quot;  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
How the H**L do you expect SoE to get feedback if they don't ask for it?????  Sheesh!<br />
<br />
Of course there is garbage there, but there are also a lot of very good posts and some very well thought out ideas.  In my opinion those are very useful boards...you just need to sift through the b******t posts and find the good ones.  The same comments you made could have easily been made about a lot of posts here when they were trying to figure out how to balance warriors.<br />
<br />
As to the question about &quot;do you think your class needs any upgrades&quot;...look at the responses on the warrior board...most of them essentially say, &quot;nope, we're fine now as long as you don't overdue it with knights.&quot;  So, yes, I think SoE can expect most people to be reasonable in their responses.  Are there whiners? sure (even a couple warrior whiners), but there are a lot of people that are actually trying to be productive on those boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, I'm just saying many classes are probably fine right now relative to other classes, but when each class has an eqlive board created called &quot;Class_01 Balance Issues&quot; there's going to be a lot of unrealistic garbage there.  Maybe I just don't care for the style of it.  Maybe I'm just tired of reading all the knight bitching that turns an issue with a few mobs in a few new zones into a gamewide bitchfest where they claim crap like, &quot;we've had tons of ISSUES for a long time now.  GoD was just the last straw!&quot;  Uh huh... BS.  We've all got issues.  Fix meeeeeee.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm overreacting.  Maybe Sony is competent enough to sort through the high volume of garbage these boards will generate.</div></div><hr />
