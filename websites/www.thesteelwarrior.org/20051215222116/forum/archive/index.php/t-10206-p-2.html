Use Shield Bash when ever it is up.  Good threat generation for a cheap cost (10rage).  For mantaining aggro I will use Revenage first if it is up. If Revenage is not up, Shield Bash. If neither of those are up, Sunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the talent plan I've come up with to use on my warrior.  I'm consentrating on high DPS for solo/PvP, but with some nice Protection abilities to tank Instance Bosses.  I don't claim its perfect, or the ultimate raid tank plan.  Its what I think will fit into my playstyle of Battle Grounds raids + Offtanking.  Equipment should lean towards Sta/Agi/Str in that order.  Primary weapon should be a big hurty two-hander with a Mace/Shield combo on switch.  Here goes...<br />
<br />
Arms Talents (33 points)<br />
<br />
# Deflection - 5/5 points - more mitigation<br />
<br />
# Improved Rend - 3/3 points - dps + unlocking &quot;deep wounds&quot;<br />
<br />
# Tactical Mastery - 5/5 points - necessity<br />
<br />
# Deep Wounds - 3/3 points -  big hurty 2h will make for some free dps<br />
<br />
# Improved Overpower - 2/2 points - This talent is godly, combine with &quot;deep wounds&quot; for teh win<br />
<br />
# Anger Management - 1/1 point - necessity<br />
<br />
# Impale - 2/2 points - more Overpower dps<br />
<br />
# Two-Handed Weapon Specialization - 5/5 points - dps + unlocking &quot;mortal strike&quot;<br />
<br />
# Sweeping Strikes - 1/1 point - AE tuant + dps across multiple targets<br />
<br />
# Mace Specialization - 5/5 points - more stuns for you switch to mace/shield<br />
<br />
# Mortal Strike - 1/1 point - best tier7 talent period<br />
<br />
<br />
Fury Talents (5 points)<br />
<br />
# Cruelty - 5/5 points - dps esp. when combined with &quot;deep wounds&quot;<br />
<br />
Protection Talents (13 points)<br />
<br />
# Anticipation - 5/5 points - mitigation even w/o a shield, unlocking &quot;iron will&quot;<br />
<br />
# Iron Will - 5/5 points - less stun/charm for PvP and Elite PvE effects<br />
<br />
# Improved Revenge - 3/3 points - stuns and more aggro when offtanking<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just food for thought if you are thinking of re-specing your War or starting a new one.  At the moment my warrior has the first 7 &quot;Arms&quot; talents and is tanking well in instances and holding her own solo and in PvP.</div></div><hr />

something to note about this talent, it tends to nerf all CC abilities like sheep, fear, etc.<br />
<br />
Warriors get their 8 sec AE fear but I found my self never using it.  It was because I had this talent and the few times I did use fear it broke cause of the dot from my crit.  <br />
<br />
I just respeced and ditched this talent and now my fear works much better.  A definate bonus when the shit hits the fan and you need to make a hasty retreat.  Of course the down side is mildly lower dps.<br />
<br />
p.s. I'm finding fear to be my 'free life' move in 1v1 pvp duels.  It mezzes the target for 8 seconds.  So fear, self target and bandage up.  Its enough to put you back in the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How so?<br />
<br />
Your group sheeps the mob you're on?  It should be no different than in EQ.  You pull a few, group assists you, mage finds the odd man out and sheeps him.  Delay your multiple target effects until after the Poly and you move away.<br />
<br />
Seems like a needless respec to me, unless there's more to the story that I don't understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">naa, its more like I'm a target switching fool, combined with a 1 in 10 chance to crit, I end up putting dots on most of the mobs in a pull.  I dont normally have a CC class with me so its usually me on that job.  When I do have one, I try to work it out so I know when they'll be sheeping and at what point to get out of their way.<br />
<br />
I dont play the assist game the way I did in EQ.  I ask the rogue or mage to do that so I am free to switch targets as needed to keep aggro on me.  Most CC skills are single target, so the EQ approach to mezz doesnt quite carry over.<br />
<br />
In the PvP realm, which I am enjoying more and more everyday, I was nerfing my ability to fear my opponent because normally they'd be bleeding from a crit.  Once I ditched that talent, I was able to mezz for 8 sec with fear and my chances to win the duel went way way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">draken</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to get good agro in the higher lvs instances i use Piercing Howl  and Improved Demoralizing Shout  along with tuant and SHLD DIPS and shld bash and shuder and revenge.<br />
<br />
Iam not sure how much more threat is made from IDS but it works.<br />
WIth IDS  and PH if i spam it i can hold agro on multi mobs and if one mob starts to walk out of the pack of mobs beeting on me odds are 9/10 times its dazed so i just target tuant &amp; hit it a few times swich back to the first target and there is very low chance the mobs will ping all over the casters.<br />
<br />
Also if you got Defiance you get rage so fast its never a concern.</div></div><hr />
