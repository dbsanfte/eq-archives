<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothmaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.  I'm a level 56 warrior with the following weapons:<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
<br />
I know these combos are both about agro, not dps, but I'm wondering, at my level, which one will give me better dps.  I don't really understand how the whole 2hb damage bonus thing works.<br />
<br />
I'll be tanking for a shaman, so my primary need is for agro, but would like to maximize my dps while still holding agro.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think I read somwhere that GSoT was ~105 dps and CHoS/SotBS combo was ~95 dps. I could be way off though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I parsed both these combo's at level 56, and found them to be roughly equal. After a lot of fights in PoV, neither combo really pulled ahead from the average of 55-60dps. <br />
<br />
If you're going for aggro, you'll get more procs from the 1-handers so I'd use them. As you get closer to 65, the GSoT should start to pull ahead, as it's damage bonus will increase a lot more than your primary 1hander bonus will.<br />
<br />
If you want DPS, buy a WMBS. At that level mine parsed out noticeably higher than the others, by 5-10 dps.</div></div><hr />
