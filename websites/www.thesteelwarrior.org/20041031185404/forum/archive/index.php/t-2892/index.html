<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heafstaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get yerself some 6/65 rings and then kael, kael, and more kael. Champion's armor will be a nice upgrade for you in pretty much every slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back:  Cloak of the Maelstrom, Cloak of Greater Pernacity<br />
Neck:  Glimmering Mirthril Torque, Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
<br />
Upgrade the haste item, FBSS with no stats is a waste.  Silver Chitin Hand Wraps are a step up and have some good stats.  Then get a belt with some stats like the one Heafstaag has.  Or a Spider Fur Belt if pp is low.</div></div><hr />

Are you on FV as your info suggests?  If so, you should be camping the bazaar (and whatever plat zone you prefer).<br />
<br />
Why?  On FV, not only are the Champion/Berzerker gear you should be interested in No-Drop, but so are the Corroded Plate pieces needed if you want to do the Thurg quests yourself for Champion gear (assuming you have the faction in Thurg).<br />
<br />
I just made a new warrior on FV (rerolled an old one, also have a shammy and monk there - yes 3 accounts).  I personally have purchased 2 Corroded Plate wrists at 100pp each, and although I have corroded plate gloves and boots already, the commonly sell for about 200pp and 500pp respectively.  Assuming you can get the gems, you can get corroded plate very cheap on FV.<br />
<br />
Here's some suggestions for the rest:<br />
<br />
Neck: Glimmering Mithril Torque - I've seen them around 200pp.<br />
Fingers: 6/65's as suggested - around 300pp (although I've seen them less).<br />
Face:  Crystal Spider Eyes - picked up one for 500pp before, sells on average around 800pp.  However, with a group you could probably hunt for one in Velk's.<br />
Earrings:  Cougar Claw, Orc Fang, Griffin - anything but that Lodi Kai earring.<br />
Head:  Skull Shaped Barbute is a small upgrade over crafted, but since it easily sells under 100pp you should use that until you can get Champion/Berserker.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that the GSoT is dirt cheap now on FV - I bought one for 500pp for my level 27 warrior, even though I can't use it for nearly 30 more levels.  Hope you've worked on 2HB!<br />
<br />
After that, try getting a group together to camp Veksar for a Soulscream belt (31% haste and good stats).  Easily done single group at your level.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you want to hunt Kael for Corroded Plate, you may want to get your guild to schedule some Kael Arena or Plate House raids.  Or, check the FV Message Boards Battlefield section - there are several Kael open raids scheduled, including one hosted by Yours Truly.  I did Kael open raids for weeks back with my 1st warrior, and was completely geared up by the end (including a lucky roll on the Corroded BP).  <br />
<br />
That should be enough to keep ya busy for a while!</div></div><hr />
