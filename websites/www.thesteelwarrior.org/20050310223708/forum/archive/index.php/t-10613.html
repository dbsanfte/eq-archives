&quot;Who's on first?&quot; might have turned out something like this....<br />
<br />
<br />
COSTELLO CALLS TO BUY A COMPUTER FROM ABBOTT . .<br />
<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Thanks. I'm setting up an office in my den and I'm thinking<br />
about buying a computer.<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Mac?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: No, the name's Lou.<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Your computer?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Mac?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou.<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: What about Windows?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Why? Will it get stuffy in here?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with Windows?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I don't know. What will I see when I look in the windows?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Wallpaper.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Software for Windows?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write<br />
proposals, track expenses and run my business. What have you got?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Office.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: I just did.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: You just did what?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Recommend something.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: You recommended something?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Yes.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: For my office?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Yes.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: OK, what did you recommend for my office?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Office.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Yes, for my office!<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: I recommend Office with Windows.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I already have an office with windows! OK, lets just say<br />
I'm sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I <br />
need?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Word.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: What word?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Word in Office.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: The only word in office is office.<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Which word in office for windows?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: The Word you get when you click the blue &quot;W&quot;.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I'm going to click your blue &quot;w&quot; if you don't start with<br />
some straight answers. OK, forget that. Can I watch movies on the<br />
Internet?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Yes, you want Real One.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Maybe a real one, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of<br />
your business. Just tell me what I need.<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Real One.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: If it's a long movie I also want to see reel 2, 3 &amp;4. Can I<br />
watch them?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Of course.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Great! With what?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Real One.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: OK, I'm at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do<br />
I do?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: You click the blue &quot;1&quot;.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I click the blue one what?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: The blue &quot;1&quot;.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue w?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: The blue &quot;1&quot; is Real One and the blue &quot;W&quot; is Word.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: What word?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: But there's three words in &quot;office for windows&quot;!<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: It is?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Yes, but to be fair, there aren't many other Words left. It<br />
pretty much wiped out all the other Words out there.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: And that word is real one?<br />
<br />
ABOTT: Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part<br />
of Office.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: STOP! Don't start that again. What about financial<br />
bookkeeping? You have anything I can track my money with?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Money.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Money.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I need money to track my money?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: It comes bundled with your computer<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: What's bundled with my computer?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Money.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Money comes with my computer?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Yes. No extra charge.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer? How much?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: One copy.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: Isn't it illegal to copy money?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Microsoft gave us a license to copy money.<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: They can give you a license to copy money?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Why not? THEY OWN IT!<br />
<br />
A FEW DAYS LATER . .<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you?<br />
<br />
COSTELLO: How do I turn my computer off?<br />
<br />
ABBOTT: Click on &quot;START&quot;..........<br />
<br />
<br />
