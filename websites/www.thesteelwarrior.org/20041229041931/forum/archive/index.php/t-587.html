Here's the thing, I play once/twice a week due to RL commitments but I do have time to leave my character in trader mode and sell stuff all day long.  Plus I can make FH armor which means my cash supply is high.  I'm pretty sure I've got all my bases covered, and now I'm just trying to grind and get levels.  Other than a cloak of flames and another bloodmetal earring I don't see any equipment that I might need.  I'm holding off on a windblade as at my level it's not all that great.  By the time I'll need one the price will probably have dropped some.  <br />
<br />
Well, anyone see any tradable or one group items that I'm lacking?<br />

Also, how about a cowl of mortality - same haste percent but better stats.<br />

Boots of the Storm?<br />

The 1-handers aren't that great - plenty better tradable weapons out there.</div></div><hr />

yeah, i'd look into a FH neckpiece for ya and see about some new haste; either a CoF or something with some non-mana on it.<br />

hell; nothing to complain about there though 'nomer</div></div><hr />

Sure, money is flowing well for my level but there is a limit.  I've got about 150k left to spend on upgrades.  I'd like to stay away from the cowl of mortality as the AC seems a little low for the price.  For some reason some people feel that 9 stam is worth 40k?  Not to me, at least not at level 52.  There are a lot of no drop haste items I'm sure I'll get in the future.<br />
<br />
Here's what I think I'm going to do.<br />
<br />
sell CoCW 40k<br />
Buy CoF ~60k<br />
Buy Bloodmetal earring ~35k<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
Leaving about 95k.<br />
<br />
Being a 'nomer  I've got to look to keep my strength up since my starting strength is so low.  Sure it doesn't really add that much to dps but I'd like to be able to get to 255 str with just HoS.  I'm wondering if the draconic pauldrons might be a good alternative to FH.  <br />
<br />
As for my one handed weapons.  I could get a fleshgrinder or frostbringer (if you have other suggestions for tradable 1 handed weapons let me know) but I HOPE to be getting my epic within a few months (after I hit 55) and then I'll only need another 1 hander, any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Also the new yak's are decent aggro same damage/delay as a FB, but it's kind of nice to have weapons that are rather rare.  There's only one troll smith on Rodcet Nife as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">come to look at that RZ gear+yaks; i think down the road if i progress into that ( RZ follower myself ) the lack of inborn strength is going to hurt me ( wood elf ) as well...if you're going for the epics i'd get them than just get up to level 60+ and get some nice no-drop goodies to fill the weapon roles and maybe a new BP ( vindi seems perfect for that or even statue when the time comes ).<br />
<br />
best part about the rZ gear is when/if it bcomes a focus of your upgrades; you can most likely make a nice profit off it rather than taking up spaces in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mightie Gnome</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny thing is, I was using the exact same weapons as you until a few days ago (lammy+centi ss).  I got the yaks for an extra pair of FH legs I had, so it was a pretty good deal, I didn't have to spend any cash and I was getting rid of surplus armor.  Plus it's cool to be weilding yaks again, it's almost like the new &quot;old school&quot;.  Weapons and armor are so plentiful now, and everyone seems to be shouting &quot;frostbringer!&quot;  Sometime down the road I'll be either buying or in a good guild and able to get either SoD, BoC, or CHSD to go along with my epic, and eventually replace the epic probably but those are expensive weapons and I'm defintely not high enough to be MT and be first in line for them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if 9 stam ain't worth 40k, you should look into getting a solstice earring instead of another bloodmetal.<br />
<br />
If you can get nodrop haste soon, good for you, but I don't see it in my future so I'm wearing a CoM and cloak of pernicity.<br />
<br />
You're pretty much at the point where tradable upgrades get pretty hard to find and expensive.  Here's a list of things I can think of offhand.<br />
<br />
FH collar<br />
Bloodmetal earring<br />
Heavy rubicite belt<br />
Bone carved shortbow<br />
Crystallized acid pauldrons, wrist<br />
Amygdalan mask<br />
Tormax boots, gauntlets<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten things better than everything on the list, and I think I can still make a bunch of money if I tried, but I'm pretty content where I am now.  Watched prices and got a bladed staff and greatstaff of thunder on sale.  Perhaps if I had 150k, I would try to save up for a SoD, but everytime I hit 50k or so (slowly), I've been crossing one more thing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to stay away from the cowl of mortality as the AC seems a little low for the price <br />
<br />
uhh<br />
<br />
Cowl has more AC, and more HP than the Cloak of Flames, for (if you're spending that much anyway) a marginal amount more.  <br />
<br />
I'm not seeing your logic.  If cowl is not worth the price for 9 sta, 50hp and 16ac, why is Cloak of flames worth it at 10ac 9 agi and 50hp?<br />
<br />
Cowl is as good as tradable gets, bar none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cowl = -10 AC +5 Sta (25ish hps) +15 raw hps over current helm<br />
<br />
CoF = +50 raw hitpoints over current cloak.<br />
<br />
So just getting one or the other, the CoF is a better upgrade.  Now, if he were to get a cloak of the maelstrom AND the cowl, it would be a net gain of 15 Sta (roughly 75 hps) and 70 raw hitpoints for -9 AC.  <br />
<br />
So, Cowl + Maelstrom = -9 AC +145ish hps<br />
CoF = +50 hps<br />
<br />
Basically it's 95 hps vs 9 ac.  Pretty much an even tradeoff if you believe the 10 hps = 1 ac theory.  Cowl and Maelstrom will be a lot more expensive.  Also, I'd bet it's easier to find a high ac/hp helm than cloak.<br />
<br />
Cowl of Mortality was uber back in the days of the AC soft cap.  If you value AC though, it's still a good item, but it is very low ac for the helm slot on a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mightie Gnome</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant that the cowl has low AC for the head slot.  Since I've yet to break 1200 ac, AC&gt;HP.  It's not worth spending that kind of money for something that may or may not be considered an upgrade using the 1ac=10hp rule.  The COM+Hiero cloak of something to think about, plus I'd love to get my hands on a cloak of pernacity.<br />
<br />
Having a priority of<br />
<br />
1. AC<br />
2. Raw HP<br />
3. Stam<br />
4. Str<br />
5. Dex<br />
<br />
I like to try and including #4 and #5 as much as possible in my upgrades when some people don't even look at them.  For example.<br />
<br />
Upgrading<br />
<br />
Fingerbone Hoop<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM<br />
Slot: EARS<br />
AC: 2   WT: 0.1<br />
STR+5  STA+5  CHA-10  INT+5  SV POISON-8  SV DISEASE-8  SV COLD+5  SV FIRE+5  SV MAGIC+5  <br />
<br />
To a<br />
<br />
Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
( 0.3 WT, 7 AC, +40 MANA, +70 HP, +12 STR, +6 DEX, +8 STA, +15 SV MAGIC)<br />
<br />
Is an upgrade of<br />
<br />
5raw ac, 3 stamina, 7 str, 6 dex, and 70 raw hp.  <br />
Is this worth a 30k upgrade? (35k-current earring approx)<br />
<br />
I'd say it was, however comparing:<br />
<br />
Helm of Raldukan<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM<br />
Slot: HEAD<br />
AC: 26   WT: 2.5<br />
STR+4  STA+4  HP+35  SV DISEASE+7  SV COLD+7  <br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL SHD BRD <br />
Race: ALL <br />
<br />
To<br />
<br />
Classes:  All Classes<br />
Races:  All Races<br />
Stats:  16 AC +50 HP +12 AGI +9 STA +15 SV DISEASE<br />
Special Attributes:  MAGIC, LORE<br />
<br />
-10raw ac, 15raw hp, 5 stamina, 12agi, -4 str.<br />
<br />
This would be (for this slot anyway) an 80-90k upgrade and IMO just isn't worth the money, there are other items that are.<br />
<br />
I know I asked for advice and I thank those who took the time out to suggest a few good items that I didn't think of.  Does anyone have approx. PC's on this stuff?<br />
<br />
Heavy rubicite belt<br />
Bone carved shortbow<br />
Crystallized acid pauldrons, wrist<br />
Amygdalan mask<br />
Boots of the storm<br />
<br />
<br />
Are ones that I will look into, of course they are seldom sold.  Of course I'm leveling still and I'll probably wait as long as i can to get some of it as prices will continue to drop on some items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most people don't worry abotu str and/or dex because a lot of people have either the quested velious armours which carries a lot of  str/dex ( dex especially on myrmi ) OR are of a larger race where their inborn str number is about where you're sitting now if not more.<br />
<br />
You've got the right path of thinking Mightie though; I doubt when the time comes you'll make a bad decision. I used to play around a lot with Magelo trying out different items and more often than not could come to a reasonable conclusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice gear, looks like you are set up pretty well. I really wish my warrior could wear FH!! Here are some suggestions with current TT pricing -<br />
<br />
Heavy rubicite belt - 25-35k. I wouldn't bother with this for a while, only a small upgrade in your case.<br />
<br />
Bone carved shortbow - 40kish if you can find one. These seem to e pretty rare. Also not a very big upgrade for the price. I think you would be better off saving for an elemental bow. Currently on my server you can get bows from 150k (Air bow) to 220k (earth bow). ITs a huge upgrade and most likely the last range item you will ever need.<br />
<br />
Crystallized acid pauldrons, wrist - acid bracers are going for about 100-125k on TT. Never seen the shoulders for sale. The wrists are the last upgrade you will need before getting Raex's. You might want to consider Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates, only 5hp up grade, but the 31ac rocks. You can get those for 30-40k.<br />
<br />
Amygdalan mask - Never seen one of these for sale. You will probably have to go and get this yourself. Not too bad for a group of 60+. If you happen to find one for sale I would expect to see a pretty hefty price tag on it, upewards of 75-100k.<br />
<br />
Boots of the storm - These are starting to get a little more common. They seem to be popping up for around 125k on Terris.<br />
<br />
I would try to score Boots first, then 2x acid bracers. From there just save your plats until you can afford an elemental bow.</div></div><hr />

Now I've got something to work towards.  I did get my CoF for 60k yesterday so now I think I'll save up for some weapons and those boots!</div></div><hr />

I got myself some decent gear, but I got tired of it, and decided to lvl.  There is a cap of how far decent gear can get you, but then you run into the expensive stuff.  If you are doing tradeskill stuff for money, keep going if you have the time.  There are items out there that are extremely expensive and that would make you somewhat uber uber.<br />
<br />
Items like . . . <br />
<br />
Helm of Ral Zek<br />
Boots of Lightning<br />
BoC<br />
ToD<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Keep saving if you enjoy making money, but eventially you'll have to lvl.  Helm runs for like 200k+ and the boots I dunno.  There are plenty of uber expensive gear out there so it depends on how much you want to save.</div></div><hr />
