<br />
If you honestly believe this Bourbon then I will recant my &quot;flip off&quot; and apologize.  Just right now I hold a lot of the statements from SOE and some fellows from here with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
Frod, I apologize, I honestly hope you do prove me wrong and are a &quot;correspondent of information with out bias&quot; for us warriors of all level, rank, and guild affiliation.<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quiet opinionated there Frodlin, and your &quot;the warrior correspondent&quot;?<br />
<br />
A corresponent only communicates the information from those he/she is a correspondent too, which for you is supposed to be warriors.  Your opinionated views are making you look more of a thriving politician.<br />
<br />
I honestly do not feel as though you can correctively and un obtrusively convey information from the masses of warriors to SOE without bias.<br />
<br />
/flips off Frodlin<br />
<br />
Fae<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey Fee,<br />
<br />
I had a similar concern when I was asked to be the class correspondent.  I have *always* been extremely outspoken, and at first I declined the position because I didnt' want to have to temper my ability to be outspoken on issues by taking the position.<br />
<br />
What Kythera told me I'll quote for you:<br />
<br />
You are still part of the community and are welcome, as a correspondnet, to still voice your opinions. The only thing a correspondent is required to do, or not do I guess would be a better choice of words, is to not make decisions for the class on their own. Correspondents are not representative of the class, they are in place to aid in directing discussions, help us gather information and help explain things we may not understand so we can present data to Developers. <br />
<br />
If you think you can &quot;temper&quot; yourself at least to the point of refraining from making decisions for your class instead of discussing things with them and determining the &quot;majority&quot; decision, then it is fine. <br />
<br />
We do ask that when posting correspondents do their best to refrain from flaming and attacking other community members on the SOE boards, but we do not ask you to stop posting your opinions, thoughts or feelings about your class<br />
<br />
Note:  This is not an SOE board, nor have I flamed anyone on an SOE board.   <br />
<br />
When I took the position, I did so for the benefit of many warriors, as we had an unknown, inexperienced correspondent.  I not only didnt' agree to give up my right to opinions, or to state them, I specifically declined the position if I was going to be told to.   I was assured that this wasn't the case (as you can read above), and have done up to this point a hell of a job gathering and forwarding information which may or may not agree with mine, just as I intend to do with the issues with casual warriors.<br />
<br />
If you can find a SINGLE exmple of me showing bias in reporting the positions of warriors, then I urge you to point it out.  Since it's not happenned, it won't be possible, but I'm going to have positions on issues regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I may not always agree with Frodlin; I don't always disagree; I don't think he always replies on topic to his adversary in the heat of debate; I don't think he always misses the intent either.<br />
<br />
But he has been an exemplary correspondent when he acted in that role, without fail, every time I saw.  Even if his correspondence was contrary to his opinions.  Even when I don't think he understands what my issues would be (or why I have them), I think he would represent them well.<br />
<br />
I had my doubts here and there during this bruhaha, took another look around, and was more than satisfied.</div></div><hr />

Re: Your comments about revamps. Add the CT revamp to the list. Ask anyone who has bothered to do it if it's an improvement.<br />
<br />
The hard truth is the SoE has done all the Blackburrows it needs to do. Oh a Mistmoore revamp would be nice, but IF they we're to do one, I'd urge them to put Mayong down in his dark basement crypt and have him come out of his coffin at sundown. And they'd be beyond silly to have him be level 54.<br />
<br />
I too have repeatedly asked that SoE put Fabled mobs back in the game to instantly revivalize many zones that are currently empty and to provide many more targets.<br />
<br />
YES, I would go after an FFBSS or the Mithril 2Hdr for my twink Paladin (prolly the sword, I'm not greedy the sword is plenty good enough) but with things for him to do, that would add to the population of level 52's /lfg and available to have fun. Heck, he'd be happy to MT for you if you needed a decent tank.<br />
<br />
Your problem, and you've said it yourself, is NOT that there is no content for you. It's that you are at the bottom of the pecking order of level 65 Warriors.<br />
<br />
Do you have an LDoN aug in every slot possible? I do/did (replaced some) - do you for a moment think I LIKED LDoN? If I was in your position Lcae Katta and the Vampire Troubles quest would absolutely be on me hit list. There are MANY things you can do to improve and you know it.<br />
<br />
Persist in claiming that you need more content and that no progression path exists for you, and providing you don't delete your Magelo, I swear I'm going to do a gear check on you and find 150AC and 1000+ HP's in content you CAN do and items you can acquire in the bazaar.<br />

Here is the thing frod, so what if you do not need a port in any longer? plane of hate was changed to do the exact same thing and they only made things slightly harder, and what about all these people saying, if you don't have (insert a class here) as a friend then its your fault (mind you, this is not the right way to look at the game imo, but it is what some people will try to forcefeed you)<br />
<br />
<br />
My stealth point of vp (as noted in my sarcasm) is that we are not stone dumb, we can handle harder content and since non-raiders do still pickup raid alot of people can get their butt into the zone, if sol ro was like that alot more players would be there for me to group with.<br />
<br />
Now I gota go, RZ is up tomarrow and I gota try to kill it in another DKP pickup<br />
<br />
BB, I am not the bottom of the pile, you make silly assumptions.<br />
<br />
I am not the bottom of the heap, there are plenty of warrior in my guild, my pickup raids and the raids I join that fall in step behind me, on emarr at least, we dont have every warrior having a ball in GoD<br />
<br />
Once GoD gets more popular I will agree that 7k is the normal hp amount for more warriors, but it has not caught on, emarr at least.<br />
<br />
Only people taking advantage of it is affliction and 2 other top guild types so alot of people become chicken shits about trying it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the thing Gerick...<br />
<br />
There was no port into PoM.   The zone in was in the back of North Temple of Veeshan, Past 5 dragons and all the surrounding drakes.  It's not a matter of a port in, it's a matter of Clearing NToV, and being *completely* inaccessable by non raiding melee.   The port in was put in a place where you could get to it *AND NOW YOU COMPLAIN?*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Moreover, the conclusion of those other raiders is not contrary to my own. They conclude that Tipt is really fucking hard, for a time or elemental-geared tank. I totally agree. I don't feel the trash has been at all ramped down. Maybe other parts of GoD have been affected, but I do not feel that Tipt has. The trash is just as difficult as ever it was in my experience of it.  <br />
<br />
Every zone in GOD uptil Qvic is MUCH MUCH easier now then it was at release. Tipt, Vxed and Ikkinz are no exceptions. At release, shit would consistantly hit for max every swing and proc chaos claws every round, sometimes multiple times. Kyvs wouldnt miss. Cragbeasts would proc stuns every round. There was a time not long ago that 2boxing warrior+cleric in Barindu was a challenge because the mobs hit so hard and procced so much. Now I can 2box Vxed, Tipt, Kod'Taz and have killed several Hynid Howlers/Cragbeast Ragers with just these 2 characters. The entire expansion had a major shift downward and it became very accessible to non-raiders.<br />
<br />
The thing I find most funny is that certain people have been crying out statements like &quot;open the content, let the difficulty deceide who should be there or not!&quot;. Then they are given an expansion in GOD where the first hurdles are entirely 1groupable, and they complain about it being too hard. Asking for something in one breath, then complaining about that very same thing in the next seems quite odd to me. Then its made much easier, and some people still complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Well, MY complaint is twofold: Even though I'm able to tank in those zones, for some reason all your buddies don't seem to think so when I put on the /lfg tag. Even folks in guilds below Time seem to get the collywobbles at the thought of a tank they actually have to watch to heal. Secondly, I could gear up outside of that - I do. My magelo will show you that. But when the Time guilders decide it's time to make an alt or do a tradeskill, progression mobs just go right off the table. BB makes an example with his twink Paladin. That'd be all well and good if he took his twink 52 Paladin and tried to do the content, but if it's droppable or he can log the Paladin in the zone, I don't compete with the toon that uses the gear, I compete with his Time++ main, and that's not possible to win unless he has a stroke at the keyboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Partha, my buddies don't go out of their way to group with any non-guild Warrior unless its an in-game friend.

Mostly they fail and sometimes they don't. Lower level players that DON'T suck get to group with higher level players more.<br />
<br />
Partha, perhaps you missed the part where my alts do not and never have accepted items, flags, or assistance from my guild. My Druid equipped himself. My Paladin uses items acquired by my main.<br />
<br />
Did you miss the part where my main generally passes on loot that drops in groups? That's right Partha, my main does it soloing the loot, always giving up camps to anyone who enters and will get experaince, and any group that looks like they need the camp and asks.<br />
<br />
That's right Partha, my Time+ main solos the loot, the Fabled mobs, and any quest assistance either needs. If I can't do it under those circumstances, then they do without. Ever solo for a Molktor Hide, Swordfish Bill, or a Fabled Ghoulbane? Make a wild guess - do either of my Twinks have their Epics? Why not?<br />
<br />
Remember, they are twinks intentionally kept at a level where they can't even get flags into zones where my guild kills mobs and some loot ROTS if a twink doesn't pick it up. No Guild Rots for them. A greedy player would be sure that his twinks got in on that gravy train wouldn't he (not that I contend players that do this are greedy, I just don't do it)?<br />
<br />
Now if you in a group can't grit your teeth a little and take out mobs that I take on solo, you've got more than a little work to do, haven't yas.<br />

Poor little Partha, the greedy PoTime Warrior is spoiling all my fun. Pbbbbbt.<br />

I don't want the groups you'd get into based on your merit. I don't want the drops you can get with such a group. I don't want your raid mobs. And when I do go after something for a twink, I do it on my own - yep, I agree unfair competition. No wonder you're upset.<br />
<br />
Oh, I fully understand all high level players don't share my attitudes. With lower level players in the game with the attitudes of Glatius, Gerick, etc. and even worse, how do you think some players would turn out when they reached PoTime+?<br />

 I'm not certain what the point of that little speech was, BB. If you're trying to rub something in my face, it's not working. I'm not going to blow up like Glatius just because you're being juvenile.<br />
<br />
 And, of course, when you say you 'don't want my raid mobs or my drops', and then mention that you're going to go after them for a twink, well, which is it, m'man? Is you is or is you ain't a farmer?</div></div><hr />

You know, it's really pathetic how you strain to make a point.<br />
<br />
Farming - returning numerous times to the same zone for the express purpose of acquiring loot. This can be a guild farming ToV for armor they need to progress or a player perma-camping (a farmer) Lodizal in order to sell the Lodizal shield in the bazaar on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
So no, I don't concider getting a twink an item once every 6 months or so farming and me being a farmer.<br />

<br />
 No sir, you misunderstand my point. I'm not restricting my argument to PoTime+ Warriors when I talk about Time+ people going back to content 4 and 5 and 6 expansions old and farming mobs that are still valid progression and upgrade targets for lesser guilds, and how that backblasts down the pipe to the guilds below that, and to the guilds below that as well. It's my opinion that even more than reservations, farming slows the overall progress of a server population. And, of course, the slower the progression down the line, and the more stratification of the player base, that can't have a positive effect on grouping.<br />
<br />
 Please argue what I'm saying, not the strawman you want to argue against.<br />
<br />
 Glatius: Apologies, but it's fairly clear you've let the argument get under your skin, since you're not usually stooping to cheap shots like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After having been tag team goaded by Frodlin, BB, Apo, Mr. Ed, and a host of others, yeah I probably have let it get under my skin.  It's one thing to have a difference of opinion.  It's another to heap scorn on the other party because of a difference of opinion.  And I think you and I both know that the other side of this arguement has been chalked full of arrogance, condescension, belittling, and insults.  Frankly at this point, even if the other side actually is completely correct in all aspects of what they're saying, and I still don't believe that they are, I'd still tell them to go get buggered because they've been such asses about it.<br />
<br />
Am I without sin?  Absolutely not, but I typically respond to the attacks of others.  Only occassionally will I attack first.  Truthfully, some people I had a great deal of respect for *cough* Frodlin *cough* have pretty much forfeited that from me specifically because of how they've acted on this thread.  And BB, who I actually occassionally listened to and thought sometimes made some good points, has shown me that was a grave error on my part, his comments are now not much more than white noise as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that the majority of the most out spoken individuals who argue counter to what people like you and I have been saying really know what it's like to be non-guilded or to be a member of a small guild in EQ any more.  They &quot;claim&quot; they do, but then they start talking about how this or that is trivial if you bring two or three groups of well geared characters.  Or if you play an uber geared monk with a botted shaman.  Which for many people is completely unrealistic.  What they fail to see is that they're arguing that if you aren't a member of a &quot;machine&quot;, be it large or small, forget about accomplishing much in EQ.  Maybe that's what they want, to force everyone to participate in the game in only one way and to have alternatives be completely unviable.  But it wasn't always that way.<br />
<br />
They preach about how they've &quot;earned&quot; the right to high end content, exclusive access to tradeskill components, higher experience, good loot drops, weapon and armor upgrades.  Yet in the very next breath they'll explain how they also have every right to go back and take out old content, screw anyone who might actually need that content for their progression.  They want their territory protected from the ignorant unwashed masses while feeling perfectly free to poach on that content that they claim they're beyond.<br />
<br />
The hypocrisy is rampant.  The arrogance is palpable.  And if these are the model examples of what it takes to be a &quot;high end&quot; raider, is it any wonder people like you and I reject that play style?  I think not.<br />
<br />
The fact that Romidar has left the game to me speaks volumes on it's current status.  And just because a number of people who happen to be at the top of the game should claim that everything is wonderful isn't particularly convincing.  But, as a retired board whiner, I really don't have solid ground to argue they're wrong any more.  I believe it.  I'm thoroughly convinced of it.  But my credibility is weak and all they'll do is continually throw that in my face in an attempt to negate anything I might say, regardless of how true, accurate, or correct it may be.<br />
<br />
So at this point, I'm pretty much done.  They can continue to spew the bullshit and try and con everyone into thinking it's all freaking roses.  I'll sit back and watch the subscription numbers from the sidelines and let that be the confirmation of my position.</div></div><hr />

Yes Glatius, that's exactly what I'm arguing.<br />
<br />
If a player logs on for a couple of hours a week and only seeks out pickup groups they are going to have to be pretty darned &quot;uber&quot; to make any progress. EQ is not Doom where you log in and blast through a couple of progression levels based on your skill or twitch reflexes.<br />
<br />
Instead, EQ is a game of accumulated small advantages that generally, unless you are badly undergeared and virtually anything is an upgrade, don't fall into your lap. You have to plan, organize, and execute in concert with others to &quot;move forward&quot;.<br />
<br />
If community, even as part of a regular group of like-minded players, translates to you as being &quot;part of a machine&quot;.......<br />
<br />
If accumulated small advantages is interpreted by you as no path or a path that takes forever......<br />
<br />
If succeeding at conquering progression challanges like the PoJ Trials is to you only artificial barriers/making you jump through hoops that spoil the game......<br />
<br />
Then EQ is clearly not for you. The era of going &quot;Ding level 5!!!&quot; or &quot;Woot, FS Longsword&quot; every five minutes is in the very distant past. Now it's grind LDoN or a best doing the Vampire Troubles Quest if you want a decent piece of gear. It's conquering progression challanges like PoJ rather than enterring every zone at will.<br />
<br />
SoE is not going to hand out Golden Tickets to the can't be bothered to make the effort crowd so they can see VT or the EP's. Neither set of requrements is soooooo arduous that players don't see the content beyond - you just, for some content, have to be &quot;part of a machine&quot; at least sometimes. On my server, perhaps 750 players have seen the EP's. Soon it will be 1500 players.<br />
<br />
When everybody that wants to see the EP's except Glatius and other players sharing the same views, have seen them, will you finally conceed SoE maybe wasn't favoring the ubers, but created challanging content that you just opted not to try doing?<br />
<br />
You've got to get past the PoJ trials to see parts of PoP. You can't expect pudding it you won't eat your meat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What they fail to see is that they're arguing that if you aren't a member of a &quot;machine&quot;, be it large or small, forget about accomplishing much in EQ. Maybe that's what they want, to force everyone to participate in the game in only one way and to have alternatives be completely unviable. But that wasn't always the way it was. <br />
<br />
Actually what Frodlin was arguing is that GOD has a viable upgrade path that is very acheivable to casual players upto Kodtaz/Ikkinz trials. I was saying the exact same thing in the few posts I made on either of these stupid threads. I know that its viable because I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE WALKED IT. It takes good players, ppeople who are willing to die alot in order to acheive their goals, people who work well together. It takes people willing to look past the pessimistic attitude held by others such as yourself and try things for themselves, with an open mind. People like you doom yourself to failure because you are unwilling to try anything for yourself.<br />
<br />
Raiding isnt the only path to move along in EQ, and casuals have several paths open to them. LDON/bazaar for those who have the patience. POP for those who wish to participate in open events for flags. GoD for those with a few friends who share their desire for a fun experience, and the balls to seek it out. The other path is one of seeking out only the safe and sure. In a game like EQ this only leads to boredom, disappointment and mediocrity.<br />
<br />
So at this point, I'm pretty much done. They can continue to spew the bullshit and try and con everyone into thinking it's all freaking roses. I'll sit back and watch the subscription numbers from the sidelines and let that be the confirmation of my position. <br />
<br />
The game isnt all fine and dandy, and subscription numbers im sure are falling. However I would also bet that the numbers are fairly uniform across casual/raider demographics. There is plenty of issues affecting raiding guilds that are causing people to quit in droves. Endless recruiting/reflagging cycles, continual buggy content and bland encounters being just a few. There is also several games that have come out recently (City of Heroes etc) or are due soon (WoW, EQ2) that people are quitting for already. You claim of being right simply because people are quitting doesnt examine at all the people who are infact quitting, or the reasons why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And by the way give me 10 new zones in OoC that I (and most non-raiders) can use and I will be happy. That and some new slightly better drops. Oh and give me some content that challenges without have 1.5K+ hitters as well.<br />
Argh.  GoD offers all of this but all we hear about is how nobody's happy with it.<br />
<br />
- 10 new zones for non-raiders, GoD has this, it's actually 12 including Abysmal.  (6 non-instanced, 6 instanced, plus 3 more (Kod/Ikk/Yxx) if you can beat these 12.)<br />
<br />
- Slightly better drops, GoD certainly has this.  (Better-than-hard-LDON drops from mobs that are easier than hard-LDON.)<br />
<br />
- Content that challenges without 1.5K+ hitters.  (Mountain mobs don't hit that hard, but I assume you were referring to them.) Surely this is offered by the events in Qinimi and Riwwi, and the mobs in Ferubi and Barindu?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">After having been tag team goaded by Frodlin, BB, Apo, Mr. Ed, and a host of others, yeah I probably have let it get under my skin.<br />
<br />
In other words...<br />
<br />
Because the entire thread disagrees with you, you're going to throw a hissy fit.<br />
<br />
You aren't making any sense.  All you say is &quot;Casuals deserve a place to hunt and gain good gear&quot; and they and I say &quot;Hey, there is that place&quot; and then you start misquoting Shakespeare and flaming people.  <br />
<br />
 It's one thing to have a difference of opinion. It's another to heap scorn on the other party because of a difference of opinion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Right, so you can stop doing it now.<br />
<br />
 And I think you and I both know that the other side of this arguement has been chalked full of arrogance, condescension, belittling, and insults. Frankly at this point, even if the other side actually is completely correct in all aspects of what they're saying, and I still don't believe that they are, I'd still tell them to go get buggered because they've been such asses about it.<br />
<br />
No one has been asses but you.  Hate to break this to you, but everyone has been trying to be helpful, has been spat on, and spat back.  You're going to push someone and they're going to shove back.  The only reason you perceive anyone being arrogant is because they *are* better than you.<br />
<br />
I'd take the word of Zotha or Apo long before I'd even consider the words of someone who doesn't play EQ, admittedly has no idea what he's talking about, and instead of argues a point, flames the hell out of someone not for having that point, but for not having *your* point.<br />
<br />
Am I without sin? Absolutely not, but I typically respond to the attacks of others.  <br />
<br />
Bullshit.  You have attacked indescriminantely.  You just attacked Partha for saying you attack people.<br />
<br />
You troll through these threads and flame anyone who might possibly have a varying opinion.<br />
<br />
Only occassionally will I attack first. Truthfully, some people I had a great deal of respect for *cough* Frodlin *cough* have pretty much forfeited that from me specifically because of how they've acted on this thread.  <br />
<br />
Don't worry, I doubt Frodlin will lose sleep because some moron who trolls threads and calls helpful people assholes has no respect for him.  You act as though who you like and who you don't like matters to anyone - no one has any respect for you, no one has *had* any respect for you, so why would anyone care if you respect them?<br />
<br />
And BB, who I actually occassionally listened to and thought sometimes made some good points, has shown me that was a grave error on my part, his comments are now not much more than white noise as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
You admit it again.  You don't care about the arguement, you care that someone who has at one point disagreed with you states an arguement, and therefore it's wrong.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that the majority of the most out spoken individuals who argue counter to what people like you and I have been saying really know what it's like to be non-guilded or to be a member of a small guild in EQ any more.  <br />
<br />
Since you have no idea what it's like to hunt in Gates of Discord by your own admission, anything you say is invalid.<br />
<br />
Hell with your huge gap in credibility after just randomly attacking everyone in this thread, your credibility is non-existant anyway.<br />
<br />
They &quot;claim&quot; they do, but then they start talking about how this or that is trivial if you bring two or three groups of well geared characters.  Or if you play an uber geared monk with a botted shaman.<br />
<br />
This is such bullshit it's not even funny.  Now you're trying to alienate people who are similar to you because they've seen the truth.<br />
<br />
Glatius, I'm going to let you in on a little secret.  The reason you weren't successful in EQ had nothing to do with the content being poor for you and your &quot;family&quot; guild, it had to do with the fact that you're an asshole.  Who would want to group or go places with a pussy who's afraid to try new things, and then flames people for suggesting it?  I can just see the hell you would cause in guild chat over this.<br />
<br />
Every guild I've been in has had someone like you - scared to try new things and covers that fear in attacks on the person defending their idea.  Every single time they were kicked out and I would never talk to them again.<br />
<br />
You alienate people, you make people not want to be around you.<br />
<br />
Perhaps when you learn a little charisma you'll be a bit more successful in an MMORPG.  Might I suggest Drakan?  I hear they have plenty of items available for the casual player who can't put forth three hours a day to it.<br />
<br />
EQ. Maybe that's what they want, to force everyone to participate in the game in only one way and to have alternatives be completely unviable. But it wasn't always that way.<br />
<br />
Note the words massively multiplayer online role playing game.  Massive, as in you are expected to be social and work together to achieve goals.<br />
<br />
But the fact is, you're wrong also.  There are a plethora of ways to become powerful in this game.  You simply won't get off your ass to do them - but because you won't do them, you don't want others to do them.  Are you jealous?  Is that what it's all about?  You don't want to exhert effort, and so you lash out at those who will exhert the effort.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea...you don't play the game, so go away.  No one cares about your input any more.  We don't care about what you say, we don't care if you respect us or not, we don't care if you can't get Time + Armor from North Ro Adventures.<br />
<br />
I don't care if you were 2,000 hit pointed level 65 warrior who couldn't get groups in Bastion of Thunder.  I don't care if your family guild threw you out because you're a dick.  I don't care about any of your sob stories.  What it all boils down to is you don't have the balls or the drive to do what's necessary.  So instead of coming to terms with the fact that you lack said balls, you try to cover it up and make it look like SOE slapped you in the face.<br />
<br />
Which is wrong.  John Smedley does not have little meetings with his staff and goes &quot;Okay, our Screw Glatius Ratings have gone down, how can we fix this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could put elemental geared armor in and around Gates of Discord and make it easily obtainable, while in the meantime sending out propaganda to give off the idea that it's too difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's brilliant!  Glatius will surely be screwed now!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's stupidity to believe that SOE's one goal in life is to alienate a large mass of people.  The problem is, many of these people buy into your propaganda.  That's what this whole thread is about, it's about saying &quot;Hey, don't trust the person who's never been there.  Trust us, and if you don't trust us, trust someone just like you who's been there and tried it and enjoyed it, and if you don't trust them, do it yourself and benefit from it - we've been there, we want you to try it and benefit from it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glatius, show me the arrogance in that statement.  Show me where I'm trying to screw the little guy.<br />
<br />
I WANT THE LITTLE GUY TO BENEFIT.  I want to see more Dedgerex's Flintforged Cudgels rotting.  I want to see Diamond-link Chainmails on every rogue, ranger, and shaman I pass by.  I want to see the casual player in a casual guild go &quot;Nah, I don't want that earring, it's just not as good as my Barindu earring&quot;. <br />
<br />
I want them to have fun, enjoy themselves, and see the accomplishment, and have the challenge for that matter, that comes from Gates of Discord.  Here's what it takes:<br />
<br />
-A little guts<br />
-A willingess to fail at some things and succeed at others.<br />
-The ability to problem solve.<br />
-Adaptability.<br />
<br />
For Ferubi you need to use old school dungeon crawl techniques.  Not LDoN stupidity - the whole &quot;Well, whole rooms are about the same as one Plane of Valor mob....so let's do that&quot;.  It's a lot like Sebilis and Karnor's all over again - great loot, great fun, great danger, great exp.<br />
<br />
No you can't bind outside of the zone and invis to the nameds.  In other words, you can't turn GoD into Bastion of Thunder.<br />
<br />
But hey, here's how it works.  If you decide you don't want to go to Gates of Discord, if you decide that it's &quot;oh wah too hard I haven't tried it, but my word is law&quot;, if you decide you'll never grow the balls to actually learn the stuff there, fine.<br />
<br />
I'll just continue to rip you off on easily obtained one groupable items.  I have no problems selling Watchman's Supple Armwraps for 40k, Dedgerex's Flintforged Cudgel for 70k, that bard horn from Viqu the Blindeye (that I let rot more often than not) for 30k.<br />
<br />
Think about it Glatius, cowards like you keep my bank full.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
They preach about how they've &quot;earned&quot; the right to high end content, exclusive access to tradeskill components, higher experience, good loot drops, weapon and armor upgrades. Yet in the very next breath they'll explain how they also have every right to go back and take out old content, screw anyone who might actually need that content for their progression.<br />
<br />
Yes, we can be in 20 different zones at one time after raiding zones that most of us want to just go to bed after.  Let me tell you, when I'm done Uqua, the last thought to enter my mind is &quot;OMG, Outsider Domination is trying Vindicator, let's stop them.&quot;  or &quot;Hey, the Coalition is trying to do Terris, everyone, we must stop this blasphemy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, I go &quot;Hey, this guild is doing this mob, how about I go and help them?&quot; Or &quot;Hey, you guys know how to fight this guy?&quot; or &quot;Need a Time geared tank?  A time geared rogue?  Need some buffs?&quot;<br />
<br />
On weekends, I'll go &quot;Hey, King Tormax isn't bugged and trapped inside the world, who wants to one group him?&quot;<br />
<br />
No one's in the zone, no one's trying him, so we do him.<br />
<br />
We get our alts Sleeper's Tomb keys, and we go to Sleeper's Tomb.  Oddly enough, that's also always empty, and the Master of the Guard is always up.<br />
<br />
That means the lower end guilds aren't doing these zones and they are open game.  You're being an extremist and are exaggerating greatly.<br />
<br />
List to me the zones you see cockblocked nightly, and tell me the zone the guild was raiding just before they felt you were important enough to cockblock.<br />
<br />
 They want their territory protected from the ignorant unwashed masses while feeling perfectly free to poach on that content that they claim they're beyond.<br />
<br />
Uh...no.<br />
<br />
That's trying to play the wounded duck.<br />
<br />
Tell me, why do you believe that guilds on off days kill Avatar of War?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but when you've killed the right mobs, done the right quests, and achieved the right gear, you *have* earned the right to exclusive zones.  You *have* earned the right to get certain exp.<br />
<br />
When you kill Suled Dar's Shade you've earned the right to enter Veeshan's Peak and get the badass exp and get the very nice drops.  It's your right.<br />
<br />
The hypocrisy is rampant. The arrogance is palpable. And if these are the model examples of what it takes to be a &quot;high end&quot; raider, is it any wonder people like you and I reject that play style? I think not.<br />
<br />
Mind showing me some examples of hypocrisy?  Or did you just open up a thesaurus and look for similar, intelligent sounding words to words you think are derogatory?<br />
<br />
The fact that Romidar has left the game to me speaks volumes on it's current status.  <br />
<br />
Glatius,<br />
<br />
Romidar left because it's boring to him.  He has said he doesn't like raiding and he won't do raiding.  He said he accepts raiders should get better gear than him.  He said his best gear will be bought in the bazaar or gotten off of one groupable mobs.<br />
<br />
Man, people like you (paladins and the whiney fatalist) totally use Romidar's retirement as ammunition in arguements where it doesn't belong.  You're kind of abusing his name.  He just left the game, it's not a big deal.  People leave and come all the time.<br />
<br />
Furor left, so what?  Thott left, so what?  Romidar left, so what?  <br />
<br />
If Romidar's leaving speaks volumes to you, you're reading too deeply into his leaving.<br />
<br />
And just because a number of people who happen to be at the top of the game should claim that everything is wonderful isn't particularly convincing. But, as a retired board whiner, I really don't have solid ground to argue they're wrong any more.<br />
<br />
Now you're learnin' boyo.  <br />
<br />
But let me ask you a question, how do you think people got to the top?  By sitting on their thumbs and saying &quot;Wah it's too hard&quot;?  Or by going &quot;Hey, that's hard, let's figure out how to beat it&quot;?<br />
<br />
The people know that it's good for lower end, because they were the first to try it and can say &quot;Hey, these guys don't hit that hard, they don't have that many HPs.  You can do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
 I believe it. I'm thoroughly convinced of it. But my credibility is weak and all they'll do is continually throw that in my face in an attempt to negate anything I might say, regardless of how true, accurate, or correct it may be.<br />
<br />
You haven't said a correct statement this whole thread...<br />
<br />
So at this point, I'm pretty much done. They can continue to spew the bullshit and try and con everyone into thinking it's all freaking roses. I'll sit back and watch the subscription numbers from the sidelines and let that be the confirmation of my position.<br />
<br />
It scares me that this is all a human has to do with their life.  Instead of obsessing over a game you don't play any more, stalking people on boards belonging to said game, and whining about content you never tried, why don't you go Wal-Mart and buy a game that better suits you?<br />
<br />
Go pick up Pirates of the Caribbean or something.  <br />
<br />
I've heard Frodlin reference Morrowind, but I'd advise against that.  I don't think you could handle not starting an anti-Bethesda rant because Dagoth Ur requires too much of a &quot;time sink&quot; by getting his bane weapons from Red Mountain, and that that's just screwing the casual player out of the high end content.<br />
<br />
<br />
And by the way give me 10 new zones in OoC that I (and most non-raiders) can use and I will be happy. That and some new slightly better drops. Oh and give me some content that challenges without have 1.5K+ hitters as well.  <br />
<br />
As stated above...this exists in the game already.  I have never in my time run into anything in Riwwi, Coliseum of Games that hits for 1.5k. <br />
<br />
The highest is a warlord ra`tuk that hits for 900ish, easily brought under control by a group that knows how to handle it.<br />
<br />
My fear is this:<br />
<br />
OoW will give you *more* zones like Gates of Discord.  But you'll be too afraid to try them, and then continue to go on these forums and say you're screwed.<br />
<br />
Yes, Kod`Taz is a hard zone.  Yes, Yxxta is a hard zone.  Yes, Ikkinz is a hard zone.<br />
<br />
Those are hard zones that require you to beat a hard monster.  When you're ready for that monster you can advance, until then, stay in the *NON* hard zones, such as Riwwi, Qinimi, Ferubi, Barindu, Vxed, and the Sewers.</div></div><hr />

It saddens me that you have lost respect for me, but I suppose that's the price of taking a position, and demanding a certain level of evidence in responses.   <br />
<br />
It also saddens me that in this entire thread, you've lashed out at everyone who's questioned the depth of your knowledge of the expansion you're complaining about.   Saddens, but not surprised.  You've historically had a pretty thin skin when it comes to being challenged, but it's just part of what makes you you.  Everyone has something that makes them stand apart, and you and I are no different.   <br />
<br />
My aim here is to introduce people to what I truly believe is the greatest opportunity Everquest has ever come up with for the non raider, and I'm not about to let down on that.   I believe in this expansion... strongly.   I want people to enjoy what I've enjoyed, and to have as much fun as I have to this point, even moreso.   <br />
<br />
There's a hint of truth to what you're saying though, and that's that it's not &quot;pickup group&quot; content.   I've never denied this, but I think that what makes EQ so special is that you form relationships with people and achieve common goals.   I dont' want to play a game that's so impersonal that I don't remember the 5 idiots I grouped with somewhere, this game isnt' about &quot;me&quot; it's about 'us', and I dont' want it to EVER turn into a game about &quot;me&quot; regardless of who the &quot;me&quot; is.   I dont' EVER want EQ to turn into a game where I find 5 random idiots to take advantage of until I've gotten what I want and forget them.<br />
<br />
I think that deep down you dont' either, but your specific circumstances make you not able to rely on a close network of friends and associates, and you suffer as a result.  I would argue that rather than trying to turn EQ into that, you move on, as you have.   I respect that you've moved on financially, but I don't really respect that you haven't moved on emotionally, that you seem driven by a desire to see EQ fail because it's not the game you want it to be, and it relies upon friendships and networks to accomplish things.  Oh, I'm sure you've made friends, but your schedule doesn't allow you to excel with a group of friends, but rather to survive with a group of strangers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frodlin, I've lost respect for you because mixed in with your claims of evidence and statements of what you consider to be fact have been numerous put downs and obvious attempts at belittling me and others.  You are the one who coined the phrase &quot;retired board whiner&quot; and while you may have meant it to include others, it was also obviously targetted at me.  You've not normally stooped to insults while trying to make your point in the past, which is one of the reasons you had my respect.<br />
<br />
It also saddens me that in this entire thread, you've lashed out at everyone who's questioned the depth of your knowledge of the expansion you're complaining about. Saddens, but not surprised.

Everyone has something that makes them stand apart, and you and I are no different. <br />
<br />
You at one time I might have been concerned that you are saddened, but no longer.  There are basically two people who's counter opinions had some value to me in this thread, you and Iksander's.  Yours because of your knowledge and your attempts, at least in the past, to be scrupulously fair.  The fact that you have apparently abandoned that recently troubles me greatly.  Your stance on mini-defensive and the to hell with all the non-PoTime Knights and non-EP geared rest of the world really showed a side of you I'd not seen before.  Your stand on this topic has only amplified that perception of you being far more interested in protecting &quot;your&quot; game than in the health of the game over all.  Troubling, deeply troubling.  <br />
<br />
Iksander's opinion bothered me because the only time he felt the inclination to chime in was to throw barbs at me.  Apparently I annoy him and he feels the need to strike out at me from time to time for no more reason than I annoy him.  I'm bothered by that.  Probably I shouldn't be, but I am.<br />
<br />
Most of the rest of the people in this thread who lambaste me are pretty typical to the internet.   The majority are trolls looking for their next target to have a feeding frenzy on.  Some may have some decent points to make but can't seem to do it without being complete tools about it.  So basically I couldn't care less what they have to say, I've dealt with their kind before.  <br />
<br />
I respect that you've moved on financially, but I don't really respect that you haven't moved on emotionally, that you seem driven by a desire to see EQ fail because it's not the game you want it to be, and it relies upon friendships and networks to accomplish things. Oh, I'm sure you've made friends, but your schedule doesn't allow you to excel with a group of friends, but rather to survive with a group of strangers.<br />
<br />
Haven't you figured out that the arguement is over?  I'm done arguing the points one way or the other with you.  Must you continue to try and drive home what you believe?  Haven't you already articulated it frequently enough?  Do you think that at this point continuing to beat on the issue is going to somehow force some kind of concession from me?  What are you looking for anyway?  You have your beliefs.  I think you're wrong, at least in some of the specifics.   End of story.  I'm ready to drop the whole damn thing and let it die, except people keep trying to brow beat me some more about it.  Let it go.  Drop it.  If you don't want to hear from me any more the best way to make that happen would be to stfu and move on.</div></div><hr />

After page 15 I got tired of reading insults and the same stuff being tossed back and forth, so I'm sorry if I'm repeating shit, but here are my thoughts. First, here's a post I had on PoN a month ago about this stuff, and about what it really comes down to:<br />
<br />
Progression options that fit various play styles (in order to keep customers happy at all levels without alienating other players):<br />
<br />
Wrong. A non raider hits a ceiling and then has nothing to work for after a minimal amount of work. Any non-raider that plays a lot spends months without a single upgrade often. Raiders (presumably in a guild that is progressing and doing new content) have constant options for upgrades.<br />
<br />
There are lots of non-raiders that look at what is reasonably attainable and say &quot;not much of an upgrade for the effort involved&quot; whereas the effort involved in raiding guild A in elementals for those elemental molds is really no different than the effort of the time guild for that phase 4 drop, or for raiding guild in qvic for the molds there. The primary difference between competent raiding guilds is how much time they raid and how well equipped they are in the first place, and how much they push doing newer harder content rather than farming old stuff.<br />
<br />
If you take a level 65 paladin with 1200 ac and 4000 hp, then yes, they could potentially get a ton of upgrades as a non-raider relative to if they joined a raiding guild that worked on a point system or whatever. That is simply not true for the level 65 non-raiding paladin with 1500 ac and 6000 hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
There is a plateau of risk vs reward and an absolute ceiling on any upgrades at all for the non-raider that can be reached relatively easily. LDoN type systems rewards those players that play that much by giving them something to do and a reason to keep paying. Such a system is not a threat to raiders because the vast majority of people don't play enough to every get more than a couple items, and many raiders have an opportunity to fill in a weak slot.<br />
<br />
That plateau for most raiders is far far away and might never be obtained for that matter, going along with substantial upgrades potentially available every day you raid.<br />
<br />
This doesn't even bring up the issue of those that rarely play. A raider that has seen their play time fall off is always going to be able to get huge upgrades with little play time as their guild is farming content and stuff hits non-desirability or rot status. A non-raider that has seen their play time fall off is going to get nearly nothing.<br />
<br />
Raiders don't get gear falling from heaven like rain like some non-raiders believe (outside of time or vt or ntov), but the idea that raiders don't have an advantage on gear upgrades is patently ridiculous.<br />
<br />
The fact is, another tier of ldon armor gives that tiny fraction of players that don't raid much but play a LOT progression options, goals to work on, and a reason to keep paying/playing. It doesn't threaten the raider, as they keep a significant advantage, and on average will actually get more out of it than the non-raider since they probably play enough outside of raids to fill holes with said new ldon armor (raiders at the elemental and time level, obviously not at the qvic+ level).<br />
<br />
However, with regard to Brenlo and him basically being a fucking liar, read this thread and juxtapose it against the couple week more recent graffe interview:<br />
<br />
http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=19908.topic<br />
<br />
In particular, that thread links to this one from the SOE boards and look at the 7th post down (from 6/17 by Brenlo):<br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Monks&amp;message.id=2973&amp;no_redir=true<br />
<br />
That SoE forum thread was in RESPONSE to the comment by Zajeer that new &quot;elemental equivalent&quot; armor (and lets not nitpick over what &quot;elemental&quot; means, it obviously means shit with near the hp/ac of the elemental armor, not the actual pieces or even the same stats) was &quot;just a rumor&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, we have:<br />
<br />
Dev says &quot;just a rumor&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenlo says &quot;not a rumor&quot;<br />
<br />
And a couple weeks later Brenlo says &quot;just a rumor&quot;<br />
<br />
And even more insulting he tries to make it out as if its completely unfounded and just hearsay from people that got overblown.<br />
<br />
Brenlo has consistently acted like an ass on the sony boards, closed threads without any real reason other than they enumerated problems that sony was refusing to acknowledge, and has turned back on things he himself has said. Makes me almost wish for the old Verant devs...they'd basically tell you to fuck yourselves that its their game, rather than say whatever calms the storm at the moment regardless if it is true or not.<br />
<br />
Again, back to the tak armor discussion, the problem with it and with ldon hard accessory slot items is the lack of AC. I can't begin to describe how much easier tanking in KT is with 2000+ ac compared to 1600+ ac. Its not even comparable. The lack of high ac options, even with ALL the KT and ferubi and ldon AC augs on single group content drops, is very glaring. To a casual player that looks to keep playing, and keep playing casually in expansion after expansion that Sony puts out, the AC gap is a hell of a lot a bigger deal than the HP gap between raider and non-raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I strike at you by saying a tactic in one of your posts is bad? please keep taking this thread personally.<br />
<br />
also I've directed perhaps two whole posts at you since you dropped off the boards and came back. you've been posting with a fair amount of sense but in this thread you're just tweaked out and keep telling the other side to stfu when you could end your displeasure yourself. I'm serious, just stop posting even if someone tries to flame ya. don't even respond to this post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">curious, what does a PoN link to a sony board equate to graffe link?<br />
<br />
Second, he's stated it's rumor about elemental level armour, not armour.<br />
<br />
He's feeding information out as he's allowed to and as he gets it.<br />
He's working for a large company with departments that don't always talk together quickly.<br />
<br />
Calling him a liar on something that is impossible to say was a lie is retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Maybe if you'd have bothered to read the linked threads you would have seen that BRENLO stating earlier, in response to people questioning about what happened to putting in &quot;elemental level armor&quot; in ldon after another developer said it was &quot;just a rumor&quot; and wasn't going to happen:<br />
<br />
Yes there will be new LDON armor.  Not sure when yet but it will come.  The only controversy is over whether it will be elemental armor or even elemental equivalent.  I can say that it will not be actual elemental sets, but we have not yet determined what the relative power of the armor will be.<br />
<br />
And then stated in response to the graffe interview:<br />
<br />
1) Any eta on adding new elemental level LDoN armor? I am trying to<br />
decide whether to save points or continue purchasing upgrades.<br />
<br />
Hehe this is a nasty rumor going around. We do want to look at adding<br />
more items to the adventure merchants, but if/when we do it will not be<br />
elemental armor.<br />
<br />
So he first said that there WILL be new ldon armor, just that when and exactly what quality hasn't been decided.<br />
<br />
Then, he turns around and laughingly calls it a &quot;nasty rumor&quot;, and says they are &quot;looking at&quot; adding some items, but &quot;IF/when&quot;....<br />
<br />
Everyone with half a brain knows they aren't putting elemental molds on the ldon vendors. Everyone with half a brain knows it will be generic armor sets (plate/chain/silk/leather sets). Everyone with half a brain knows that when we talk about &quot;elemental level&quot; armor we are talking about items with near or at the ac/hp/mana on actual elemental armors (even if that means fully auged with ldon augs, i.e. adding ~20 hp/mana to new set).<br />
<br />
So everyone with half a brain can understand that Brenlo is now qualifying that their &quot;might be&quot; some new armors, and implying that the devs ever stated that they would be &quot;elemental quality&quot; is nothing by made up bullshit.<br />
<br />
Take what you will from it. I take it that he either:<br />
<br />
1) Didn't know what he was talking about before<br />
<br />
2) Doesn't know what he is talking about now<br />
<br />
3) They have back peddled and are trying to make it seem like they never said what they said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Roneb McRae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Gee, YOU guys are upset about getting no armor imagine how I feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Abazagaroth,<br />
<br />
Having stated that he didn't know what quality any armor added to LDoN might be, it's remotely possible that he believed some armor pieces were going to be added. That does not mean that such armor might not be a 1850AP per piece set falling well short of EP quality or any other armor they might have been concidering adding 3 expansions from now.<br />
<br />
It was very much a &quot;nasty rumor&quot;. If you look at the questions he was asked, they were all of the &quot;So when is that new aggro weapon being added to the merchants?&quot; variety. What aggro weapon? SHOW me the statement by SoE that says 'We will be adding EP or near EP quality armor to LDoN merchants.' Such things may have been discussed and I know some players were in favor of it, but I've never seen an authoritative statement by SoE that it was going to happen.<br />
<br />
After reading numerous posts like yours awhile, it sounds like a 14 year old ambushing his parents and saying, &quot;But you said I could have a dirt bike when I reached 14.&quot;, when what they said was &quot;You're 12. You can't even get a permit till you're 14. We'll see.&quot; Yep, Mom and Dad might have discussed it later and decided it wasn't going to happen. Having let junior know their descision when he turns 14 and asks again, he tries the &quot;But you said I could!!&quot; ploy.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, so be all means show me the post by SoE saying 'We will be adding EP or near EP quality armor to LDoN merchants.', or admit you were mistaken, or admit you were trying the ploy - nothing ventured nothing gained, or be called on it.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen Brenlo being nearly as devious about this than several others that ought to be named. When asked directly, he responded directly - being much more forthright than saying &quot;We'll see.&quot; When he knew the answer and was asked, he told people the answer.<br />

Are you a fucking retarded idiot?<br />
<br />
I quoted BRENLO, a representative of the DEVELOPERS at SONY saying they WILL be adding the armor. I quoted it in my last post for christ's sake!<br />
<br />
Jesus fucking christ, every time I can't think people can't get any stupider, I get suprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">The qoute you posted that I saw said they will be adding armor to ldon at some point of some undetermined quality...Just that it wouldn't be elemental sets.Not much to go and could reflect a lot of devs hands in the pie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">every time I can't think people can't get any stupider, I get suprised.<br />
Well hang on to your dunce cap.<br />
<br />
What you quoted Brenlo as saying:<br />
Yes there will be new LDON armor.<br />
Hasn't said what kind, just that there will be some armor.<br />
Not sure when yet but it will come.<br />
He doesn't know when this new armor of unspecified quality will be added.<br />
The only controversy is over whether it will be elemental armor or even elemental equivalent.<br />
Ah, I see. You think he was stating it was going to be one or the other.<br />
<br />
But there's a good case he was saying:<br />
There's a controversy if it will be elemental armor. There's a controvery if it will even be elemental equivalent.<br />
<br />
Or even more likely given the bolded statement below:<br />
There's a controversy is over whether it will be elemental armor or even elemental equivalent [or NOT.]<br />
<br />
So it WAS a misunderstanding, which he tries to avoid even the possibility of by stating:<br />
I can say that it will not be actual elemental sets, but we have not yet determined what the relative power of the armor will be. <br />
<br />
Now, read his second post again. Any conflicts? I thought not.<br />
<br />
Due to your limited capacity to understand people, you call him a LIAR and me retarded. You can take your seat now, but hang on to the cap, I predict you'll find a lot of use for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Except that the quote was a *rebuttal* of another developer's statement that they weren't adding &quot;elemental level&quot; ldon armor. It wasn't an isolated statement in general, it was in response to people saying, &quot;hey, what's up with this? I thought they were adding new armor to ldon?&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;elemental&quot; term is irrelevant, as we all know the point of the matter is an upgraded armor set above the 1492 AP armor. Whatever the actual stats, the entire point is that its an upgrade to that armor. And saying, &quot;well, he didn't say elemental&quot; or &quot;he said elemental 'quality'&quot;, or whatever is semantics. We all know what is meant, and so does he, and arguing what &quot;is&quot; means doesn't change anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll notice that he was CRYSTAL CLEAR that he had no idea what the relative quality of the armor was going to be, and YOU are choosing to interpret the initial sentence of &quot;The only controversy is over whether it will be elemental armor or even elemental equivalent&quot; as a choice between putting say.. Raex on or putting an exact replica on, when neither is necessarily the case.    He didnt' say that those were the only two choices, but a lot of people misread it that way, and you still do.   He seemed to be pondering the notion that there was a controversy surrounding whether it's be of quality of EP armor OR NOT (note:  The not isn't ever once excluded, contrary to the position you try to put forward)  He then followed it up with specifically stating that he had no idea the relative quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">BB, you can go fuck yourself, because you are a liar yourself that is incapable of rational thought. Of course, what could we expect of someone that picked one line out of a class description and expanded its definition to mean whatever you wanted it to mean AND as gospel that could never be changed (unlike every other class description from that time period apparently) and argued ad naseum about it for months.<br />
<br />
Argue the definition of &quot;is&quot; somewhere else. We all know what the fuck we are talking about:<br />
<br />
An upgraded armor set to the 1492 armor.<br />
<br />
Is that so fucking hard to understand?<br />
<br />
An upgraded armor set to the 1492 armor.<br />
<br />
It doesn't fucking matter what the quality is, its the point that it is better than the 1492 armor (and more expensive).<br />
<br />
Can you understand that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Frodlin:<br />
<br />
Quote me where I said he said they were putting in elemental armor.<br />
<br />
What did I make CRYSTAL CLEAR?<br />
<br />
That the point wasn't whether it was &quot;elemental&quot;, &quot;elemental quality&quot;, &quot;elemental level&quot;, or any other adjective used as short hand to refer to armor that doesn't yet exist and put it in a frame of reference.<br />
<br />
The point was that it was an upgrade to the 1492 armor.<br />
<br />
There is a big fucking difference between<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we will be putting in new armor that is an upgrade to the current 1492 AP sets and will cost more&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a nasty rumor, we have no plans at the moment to introduce new armor sets though we reserve the right to add some kind of items at some point to the ldon merchants&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">The &quot;elemental&quot; term is NOT irrelevent. You quoted Brenlo as having the following exchange on Graffe's:<br />

<br />
Hehe this is a nasty rumor going around. We do want to look at adding more items to the adventure merchants, but if/when we do it will not be elemental armor. <br />
<br />
He didn't say there wouldn't be (or would be) an armor set. He, consistant with his earlier statement:<br />
I can say that it will not be actual elemental sets, but we have not yet determined what the relative power of the armor will be.<br />
reiterated it won't be an actual elemental set, without stating there will be no armor at all added.<br />
<br />
I can't even find where he said 'A better than 1492 armor set will be added to the game.&quot; in fact, he specificly says &quot;....we have not yet determined what the relative power of the armor will be.&quot; Yet you try to put those words in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Given the fact that he already stated there was controversy about adding an elemental-type set and they had no ETA (if ever) and confirmed that the controversy was resolved and there wouldn't be an elmental -type set, I'd say he gave the best information he had when he had it.<br />
<br />
Brenlo might not be a great communicator, but to calling him a liar is uncalled for.<br />

Re-interpreting things said in black and white or ignoring what is said is not going to win you many battles, IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Yes it is irrelevant when the point is that they said point blank they were adding armor, then they said they weren't. Of course the term is &quot;relevant&quot; as a framerof reference to the kind of stats it was going to be, but its irrelevant to the point they said they were definitely adding new upgraded armor and then backpeddled and said they &quot;might&quot; add &quot;something&quot; at some point. Not even inferring that it would actually be armor sets at all.<br />
<br />
I know logic and rational thought is foreign to you BB. You prefer dogmatic belief and playing semantic games in order to focus on minutia in order to &quot;win&quot; a broader discussion that you never even actually get into again after spewing the &quot;gospel according to BB&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is cut and dry.<br />
<br />
They said they were adding new armor.<br />
<br />
Then they said they &quot;might&quot; be adding &quot;something&quot; at &quot;some point&quot;.<br />
<br />
They backpeddled. Or they lied. Or Brenlo is completely fucking misinformed.<br />
<br />
Considering the way Brenlo posts on the SOE boards, you know, nice things like telling rangers on their class balance thread to stop whining and reroll if they don't like the way rangers are now, I think they changed their fucking minds and now he's pretending he never said what he did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">But hey, maybe I'm just jaded. Maybe Brenlo is a great guy. Maybe he really was making a distinction between &quot;new armor&quot; and the &quot;elemental level&quot; armor that is always referred to in questions in order to deflect criticism when the &quot;new armor&quot; goes in and has like 10 hp more than 1492 armor.<br />
<br />
But I doubt it.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
<br />
I'm going to step back and stop bringing up old shit. No point in tarring BB or glatius or frodlin or anywhere else with perceptions based on past experiences on PoN. More appropriate to just argue the academic points and facts here. So, I apologize for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">if they just tack on 10 hp and 2 ac and +1 to whatever stat and make it dubble the cost of current tak armor i for one will be ticked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">It may be that SoE is planning to add armor that is better tuned for higher end melees for 1650 AP's - that has more AC, the same HP's, no effects at all, and a spot for a Type 8 aug and only a Type 8 aug. We don't know and he didn't, if you read every word verbatim, say.<br />
<br />
At the same time, SoE may realize that being able to sell back an RA BP and pick up a near EP BP for a few 100 AP's is ludicrous. It's nothing at all equvilant to the effort needed to go from a Kizrak BP to a Raex BP. You might have salivated at the prospect of something for nothing and they sadly came to their senses. If this is the case and they realized how unfair it was, you'd still want them to do it? Greedy aintcha?<br />
<br />
When someone says something you don't like, you can not react like a bull with a cape waved in your face - it's not productive and it blinds you to what IS said (and what is NOT said).<br />
<br />
And by all means, bring up anything you want from PoN. I'm a bucketload happier with what I said about some of the topics discused there than many of those that disagreed with me.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd just backpedal and apologize for calling people names and perhaps suggest what a 1650 AP BP might look like that wasn't darned near 0 effort for someone like you with an RA BP. Else, I'd just slink away quietly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I'm sorry, I'm going to have to say that Brenlo is backtracking for whatever reason. Look at it again, and lets take the major point which we are dicussing.<br />
<br />
Yes there will be new LDON armor. Not sure when yet but it will come. The only controversy is over whether it will be elemental armor or even elemental equivalent. I can say that it will not be actual elemental sets, but we have not yet determined what the relative power of the armor will be.<br />
<br />
Self explanitory, he says there will be new armor. Didn't say anything else speciifc about that armor, just that there will be new armor. The &quot;have not yet determined&quot; statement indicates that it is in active discussion.<br />
<br />
The important part though is that he confirmed, and rebutted a previous dev statement, that there will be new armor available.<br />
<br />
And then stated in response to the graffe interview:<br />
<br />
1) Any eta on adding new elemental level LDoN armor? I am trying to<br />
decide whether to save points or continue purchasing upgrades.<br />
<br />
Hehe this is a nasty rumor going around. We do want to look at adding<br />
more items to the adventure merchants, but if/when we do it will not be<br />
elemental armor.<br />
<br />
He is responding to the statement that there will an &quot;elemental level LDoN armor&quot; set added in the near future. He specificly denies the existant of an upcoming elemental LDoN armor set.<br />
<br />
He does however say that they don't want to reconsider adding more LDoN armor sets. Since this was in responce to a specific question asked, maybe the rumor is the &quot;elemental part&quot; of the statement.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok, so what we can glean from these statements are that they are considering adding new amor sets to the LDoN merchant. However, they will not be of &quot;elemental&quot; caliber. They could be level 20 gear for all we know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Abz,<br />
<br />
The problem is you read more into the statement than was really there.<br />
<br />
He never said upgrades, or new armor or even compareable armor would be put in.  He said armor would be put in, end the sentence there.  You misconstrued that, same way you misconstrued Frodlin's statement.<br />
<br />
You didn't read what Brenlo said, you read what you wanted Brenlo to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Oh yeah, he must have meant they were putting in &quot;new ldon armor&quot; that's half way between the 760 and the 1492 AP armors!<br />
<br />
/bonk self<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm such an idiot. I mean, with the context of every thread and every discussion as well as the logical coherency that any normal human being can see talking about an upgrade to the 1492 armors, it absolutely can't be a higher cost higher quality armor!<br />
<br />
/sarcasm<br />
<br />
I'm flabergasted at what ridiculous arguments people come up with on message boards trying to rationalize shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">&quot;It's nothing at all equvilant to the effort needed to go from a Kizrak BP to a Raex BP.&quot;<br />
<br />
but it is equvilant to going from bazaar ornate to raex every slot but bp. i mean ornate,ef,tak all about the same. only 2 you have to work for and one you buy. <br />
<br />
in the same tone as your argument .why cant this stuff i have to accualy work to get not be 2 times better then ornate?  i can just buy ornate  with pp from PA, and get at no risk at all in the baz off a perma merchant. so my gear that i &quot;work&quot; for deserves to be 2 times better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Abaz...listen to your words.<br />
<br />
Now, go back and read what Brenlo said.  He simply said they were considering adding new armors.  This means nothing more than new items are to be added to Lost Dungeons merchants.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry he didn't say what you wanted him to say.<br />
<br />
But here I have a new strategy to get elemental armor for you.<br />
<br />
It involves killing a pantheon of gods, rescuing one, dueling another, solving a mystery, and then ending up in these funky places called the Elemental Planes.

I'm shocked that anyone with an RA BP and augments that could be resold and would be able to get a new 1650 AP near-EP BP for almost no effort would try to rationalize their greed by insisting &quot;Well they said they'd do it.&quot; Especially as it appears they didn't say that.

It certainly would be more GoD compatable and an upgrade from RA and for those intending to do GoD without doing PoTime.

I agree with the sell back, and upgraded set would have to be VERY high cost, otherwise theres hardly any effort. Even the laziest afk raider would do more work for less reward than a jump like many are suggesting be implemented. I mean, 1900 point armor for elemental quality...wtf, do you guys want the armor to have no value what so ever? part of what makes powerful armor so appealing is that it is hard to get, and rare is the person that has a slew of top tier gear. it reqires A) a guild basicly twinking a character with top gear, or B) someone working there butt off to get those components.<br />
<br />
Do you guys really think that those top magelos (the ones that aren't fake) are gotten by people with average playtimes and a small guild? No these guys jave been pushing the content for a long time with thier guilds. they spent their vacations, weekends and most every night with the single purpose of pushing through new content and saving DKP for the best drops. The stuff isn't handed out, nothing is handed out in EQ, you have to earn it. Thats what gives it value, not just uber stats. Really, if everyone you knew wore a raex BP, you would car less about it. Its common, its not special or rare anymore than bronse armor or centi shortswords. FH armor, OMG, it would be the shit if everyone and their brother didn't have it.<br />
<br />
Really if I wished for anything, it would be new plate looks and weapon graphics, to go along with new armor and weapons. I'm tired of seeing everyone running around with the same ol CHoS/SotB combo. Dyes helped a bit, but still I think somewhere in Norrath a faery dies each time I see a pink orge run by...<br />
<br />
I'm still a fan of an NPC that you can turn in weapons for a new graphic. Same with armor, they already can remove a graphic. I wish they would extend it changing graphics. Here's hoping the new character models due out next year will include better amor and weapon graphics.</div></div><hr />

That was done on 6/14-18/04 then we get the smart remarks from him in the graffe interview in the middle of july saying that is is just a &quot;nasty rumor&quot;...so it seems he just can't make up his mind on which verison of the story he wants to tell us today.</div></div><hr />

Yes there will be new LDON armor.  Not sure when yet but it will come.  The only controversy is over whether it will be elemental armor or even elemental equivalent.  I can say that it will not be actual elemental sets, but we have not yet determined what the relative power of the armor will be.<br />

Initially, I would like to comment that I am extremely offended by the casual use of the word 'retarded.' However, I realize that it reflects the paucity of the vocabulary generally used here.

Tak : 314 AC / 605 HP for 8952 AP (between 10 and 20%  of increase for twice the price).<br />
VT : 381 AC / 830 HP (if no mistake) or between 20 and 38%  without counting all the little bonus (atk/regen/worn effect) of inprovement fron tak. If SoE follow a linear cost progression this would make a a 24.4kAP armor set (8 slot unauged !!!). and this is only a comparaison of the visible slot! the none-visible got an even bigger improvement.<br />
Raex : 492 AC / 1353 HP + lots of atk/regen + AoE, this is just for comparaison. it shouldn't been available to LDoN.<br />
<br />
so I don't see tak armor being around VT quality, even if they are better than than ornate (at the BP and Glove exception, but only for the clicky, so we can have both if we are rich). and if we make a count with the augment, we end up alike since we can't put AC aug type 1/2/3 on the visible slots, only the 40HP type 2 aug, which has an equivalent for type 7 and 8 (except for hands and arms so we end up with 60HP more for tak aug above VT aug  ~&gt; not anougth).<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : arrgghh, need to take more cofe... I forget some slot in the calculation of the %.<br />
well it's close to 27kAP for a full auged EF suit and close to 33kAP for the auged Tak suit. <br />
the unauged Tak suit is between 10 and 22% better than the EF but cost 96% more. so for a VT quality suit (between 34 and 68%  better from EF) we end up (if linear cost) with 24.4kAP the unauged suit (or 3050 per piece) or close to 45.5kAP for the auged one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Let's remember too that there are several &quot;fit in all slots&quot; augments in GoD that can plump up a RA BP quite nicely. I'm pretty sure a patient player could with the BiC quest aug and two other all slot augs make out quite nicely with an RA BP. I'll admit the BiC quest is pretty much high level player only at this time - however, at one time so was the 10th Ring War.<br />
<br />
Nothing prevents a player from picking and choosing from available armor - perhaps starting with with a RA BP/FH legs/FH Bracer/Valorium Ring and with effort upgrading to Jointed Scaled Greeves/Glyphed Prayer Ring/Cleave bracer etc. <br />
<br />
You may however have to find some like minded players to pull it off. Like minded players that want simular items and their GoD spells drops and can not find a high level player with any interest at all in Jointed Scaled Greeves/Glyphed Prayer Ring/Cleave bracer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I aggre, that why I prefer to compare the unauged armors. Morover I didn't used the drop aug when looking after auged suits because of we were comparing AP bought to drop loot.<br />
and about the BiC aug, I don't think it as been meant to have more than one so it's pointless to use it in the comparaison for the moment (otherwise a 110+AC/500+HP WAR/PAL/SK/CLR would really be unbalancing).<br />
And if I didn't used any GoD loot, it's because I wanted to points out that the new LDoN armors (if they exist one day) can be much better than Ornate without getting close to EP gears. Yes there is GoD gears that can be obtainable by  non-raiders and that fit this gap between LDoN and EP, but it doesn't fit in the LDoN flag.<br />
Personnally I think they should just increase the mumber of low GoD armors (not only few slots) because  it  gives more zone to explore rather than these so borring LDoN zones that we have seen for the *** times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">The problem Yoda is if a RA BP with 3 aug slots is compared with a BP with 1 aug slot, it might not accurately reflect the true difference once maximized. With the BiC aug and 2 more &quot;fit any slot&quot; GoD augs, the RA BP outclasses Kizrak not just a little, but complately. Looking at them unauged doesn't give the true end result.<br />
<br />
Once BP's beyond a certain level required killing a major (for the time) boss mob (Trak, Vindi, Aten Ha Ra) or entering and clearing a zone with some flag requirements and/or hard hitting mobs by the score. Let's remember an RA BP does not represent the efforts of a raid or even a cutting edge hardcore group. My girlfriend's cat 5th. best twink can get one at the cost of doing LDoN Normals - the 3000 Orc Scalp Turn In Quest.<br />
<br />
That for me is the problem with tradeskill, LDoN, and bazaar buyable BP's - acquiring one does not require great play from a near cutting edge raid or even group Warrior, therefor IMO such BP's should not be near cutting edge either.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">I said &quot;the new LDoN armors (if they exist one day)&quot;, and &quot;Personnally I think they should just increase the mumber of low GoD armors&quot; and &quot;Raex : ... it shouldn't been available to LDoN.&quot;<br />
so why do you think I want &quot;near cutting edge&quot; BP from &quot;tradeskill, LDoN, and bazaar buyable BP&quot;.<br />
My def of 'cutting edge' gears is EP/PoT and Inkiz4+ (since Jointed Scale Greaves are barely equal to Greaves of Furious Might). <br />
My def of 'tradeskill, LDoN, and bazaar buyable BP' is Ornate/EF/Tak armor.<br />
since low GoD loot (Bracer of the Heartstriker) is approximatly on par with VT loot, and that they are single groupable by top non-raider, I pack them (VT and low GoD) in the same availability. <br />
as I said. &quot;if new LDoN armor come true&quot; they could be of that efficiency unauged. indeed type 2 slot can give similar possibility than type 7/8 buyable (but are weaker than the type 8 dropable), type 3 are mainly side effect (some ATK/regen) and type 1 for stats (BiC being the execption, but since you can't have more than one, theoritically, and since BiC before inkiz is statless if I remember well, it is out of discussion). and remember that if they use a linear cost it makes 3050AP per armor slot and 45kAP for a full auged set. so without the creation of new High rewarding mission, it would be really mad to try to complete it.<br />
that's why I said these gears shouldn't be LDoN armors but low GoD armors because there is much more chalange in it. And I never said that they must be dropable (afterall niether LDoN armors and GoD armors are). Thus it wouldn't feed bazzard players but only twinks and hardcore non-raiders (a full grroup of bazzard toons will have some difficulties to beat Tipt, but not impossible).<br />
<br />
so BB could you explain me why you think I want close to cutting edge quality gears in Tradeskill/bazard (I separate LDON since even if it's possible to have 50kAP with completting only normal mission, it still represent more than 875missions so a damn lond playing time just doing over and over the same thing again and again till you have a white beard).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you can pull and split off the final four mobs with low healing but you need to kill that nasty big golem in the first place.<br />
<br />
I know that the Tacvi guild on my server has done this with pretty low numbers (3 or 4 groups, not sure) but they are insanely geared.<br />
<br />
and, &quot;My def of 'cutting edge' gears is EP/PoT and Inkiz4+ (since Jointed Scale Greaves are barely equal to Greaves of Furious Might.&quot; - quote<br />
The ikkiniz gear is all better than time level (the legs certainly are... more ac, more hp, more shielding) but are small loot-tables covering just a few slots and classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">I separate LDON<br />
Because with LDoN Merchant purchased armor and augment buyback, it's possible to turn in a RA BP and it's augs to acquire a new/approaching Raex (Elemental/PoTime) BP for a heck of a lot less than you indicate - even at 3000AP's for the new BP. With the possiblity of using GoD augs (this BP is intended to help out with doing God, neh) the upgrade might be as little as 20ish LDoN's.<br />
<br />
It's this I mind - near top level gear shouldn't drop from grind it out single group content with a near 100% success rate for virtually any player. Top level gear should drop in top level content, be that raid or group instanced content.<br />
<br />
The problem is, if you put such armor only on instanced group content that is hard enough to justify the armor being there (perhaps the Ikkinz group trials, but in truth they aren't really close to being the same effort required to get to the EP's, PoTime and killing the armor mold dropping mobs), then those running around in Vindi or RA BP's are going to say they need armor upgrades in order to obtain the armor upgrades. That's what several people have been saying all along eheh.<br />
<br />
Maybe OoW and level 70 will make this all moot - I certainly hope so.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">partly right...<br />
yep on the BP separation, with ornate and LDoN we (at teast me) forgot that the BP has always been a separated piece from the rest of the set. so I aggree that grinding LDoN pts should not allow to get a BP as powerfull as the Shadow BP fron Aten Ha Ra.<br />
I understand now your point : LDoN make every single piece of gear at the same value even if they don't have the same power. So when I compute complete set of armor, I am forgetting that any non-stupid player will just get the BP for 3050 AP (which is almost a gift) but will let aside the boots (for exemple).<br />
so yes they should not put any new better armor on the same scaling (same cost whatever the slot) nor on the same AP (should separate AP fron easy/normal/hard and from Group/Raid).<br />
but once again I disagree with you when you say that VT quality of gears  are &quot;approaching Raex (Elemental/PoTime)&quot; quality. even Great Shadow BP is not any close to Raex BP, it's much closer to Reax Greeves, but this scaling has always be true.<br />
<br />
Edit : for the 'type all aug' from GoD , I may be wrong (so correct me if so) but I thought that only 4 'type all' aug drop from pre inknz, which are BiC, 2 regen aug (Lore), and 2 +35HP aug (Lore). this can make a break between a Tak BP fully auged (75 AC / 255 HP, 6 STR, 19 STA, 6 DEX, 10 INT, 10 WIS, 17 CHA, 100 MANA, 160 END, SV: 18M, 18C, 18F, 6P, 6D) and auged Great Shadow Platemail (86 AC / 205 HP, 32 STR, 32 STA, 32 DEX, 25 AGI, 15 INT, 15 WIS, 6 CHA, 125 MANA, 185 END, SV: 6M, 36C, 36F, 6P, 6D, 50 ATK) but this is possible only for ONE slot. after the rest will be of the same caliber of normal auged Ornate vs droped auged VT (it indeed drop nice type 7 aug in low GoD).<br />
<br />
second EDIT : and don't forget that I sugest to just increase the number of low GOD armor (excep the BP of course) on part of VT difficulty/quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">How are a couple of groups of non-raiding friends going to get jointed scale greaves?<br />
Well here's the issure in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
I've seen things posted like:<br />
<br />
1. Provide an alt-key quest to the EP's.<br />
<br />
2. Provide near EP armor in LDoN.<br />
<br />
3. Epic 2.0 sould be a single Wariror in forced gimp gear vs. a mob in an instanced areana to level the playng field.<br />
<br />
To level the playing field......<br />
<br />
That's the rub. Some players can only log on for 2 hours a day/3 days a week, how much should they be penalized? Some don't like raiding. Some don't like grouping or raiding. Some think the 4 years they have played, regardless of what they have done during that four years, should put them near the same level of players that played efficiently for 4 years - using the game as it has existed to maximizr their outcome.<br />
<br />
The only possible solution to please some of the players is pertetual level 1's, no accumlated gear and no persistant gear - everything wears out and quickly. All mobs the same difficuly and the risk/rewards the same wether it's a moss snake with one player or Quarm with 50.<br />
<br />
I'm exagerating, but that really is what some want - all players near equal able to achieve the same ends no matter how they decide to go about achieving them.<br />

<br />
The question in a nutshell!<br />
Id love to raid more. The thread &quot;why do you raid&quot; really got me inspired<br />
Im also in Europe on a US server. I suppose i could go to VS but i have my friends on Luclin.<br />
As a corporate drone there is a definite limit to my playtime as well, so raids are quite few and far between so consequently i mostly start Ldon groups and look for other europeans.<br />
<br />
Obviously i should be a far way from more ambitious players, but what is an appropriate range of L65 warriors? <br />
<br />
<br />
another question is i guess is warrior a class than can be played this casually? <br />
Perhaps I would be better off taking my bard (55) as a main, get FM and maybe a few LDON instrument mods to cover my epic-less-ness? or my wizard (55), get some bazaar and ldon ft, bazaar focus and buy some spells..</div></div><hr />

However, my 55 Druid is getting very close. I think his sweet spot may be level 60. He of cource needs more FT, but Focus items are no problem at all. The Druid is to my mind a perfect casual class. Not huge equipment requirements and big time fun to play solo, grouped, or small raid.<br />

They are mixed and matched. And for some they are a non-DKP substitute for what otherwise would be a raid acquired item. One of the posters in this thread with an RA BP is in PoTime. Obviously an EP quality BP for 1650AP's would be QUITE attractive given merchant item buyback. Lessee. RA BP at 1492 AP, 3 LDoN Augs at 1150 AP's but keep 1 asuming a new Tankish BP with a Type 2 and Type 8 aug and we get the new BP for free and need to add a Type 8 all-slot aug.

There were more than plenty RA BP's alone tweaked out to the max.

Well, now yer just fiddling with semantics.  Penalized or rewarded, the fact of the matter is my enchanter has more HP than Haass.  No, this is not dickwaving, this is pointing out how seriously out-of-wack with reality the game has gotten, how vast the difference between raider and non-raider is.   You can outfit me in the best LDoN and GoD armor available to a non-raider and push me to 8k.  You can outfit a raider in the best gear available to him and push him to 12k.  No way would I have to deal with the same shit he deals with, but a 4k difference in the best achievable loot is pretty fuckin' vast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">A 50% difference is what you are describing.  I think the difference has always been around 50%, from Velious onward.<br />

When top raiders had 7k-7.5k in Velious, non-raiders had 3.5k-4k.<br />
When top raiders had 8.5k-9k in Luclin, non-raiders had 4.5k-5k.<br />
When top raiders had 10.5k in POP, non-raiders had 5.5-6k.<br />

When top raiders have &gt;13k in GoD, non-raiders have 7-7.5k.<br />

<br />
When a casual player can take 8-10 max hits from the mobs they face withour needing a heal and I can take 6ish concidering the mobs that hit me,  reposte, and AE and DoT, I'd say things aren't out of whack at all. Except perhaps when I do an LDoN I don't want to do for loot I don't want to have.<br />
<br />
A casual player should have access to equipment that allows them to find an entry level position in a new just starting to do the raid progression level 65 guild if they decide to try out the raid game. Their gear however should not be adequate for them to join one of the top 5 or 6 guilds on their server and not need very substantial upgrades to handle the much harder hitting content raids encounter.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you don't remember public Vox and Naggy raids and the injunction that you must have resist gear or you're a liability. Well you can't noodle around in old casual content and expect to have ready for the EP's or Kod'Taz mini's gear either.<br />
<br />
Single groups did not have the capability of doing Vox, Naggy, Inny, or CT nor to get loot of that caliber - at least until years of mudflation took affect.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't be surprising that they can't do the EP's, PoTime, QVic or Inkta'Tu today or get that caliber of loot.<br />
<br />
Level 70 and LDoN merchant buyback is going to help casuals out quite a bit, but they still will have to expend effort to achieve progress on their path. IMO they shouldn't be asking for parity with hardcore raiders, they should be asking for a robust fun to do progression path. Perhaps OoW will give them even more of such a path.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">That would be an interesting measurement of a warrior.  Actually, there would be a couple of interesting numbers.<br />
<br />
A. Number of max-hits til death on the mobs you fight.<br />
The 6k warrior doing krigers lasts 8 max-hits.<br />
The 8k warrior doing hard LDON also lasts 8 max-hits.<br />
The 10k warrior doing regrua also lasts 8 max-hits.<br />
<br />
B. Percentage of max-damage done by the mobs you fight each round.<br />
The 100AA 1400AC warrior doing krigers probably gets hit for average 30% of max damage per round.<br />
The 200AA 1600AC warrior doing hard LDON probably also gets hit for an average 30% of max damage per round.<br />
The 300AA 1800AC warrior doing regrua probably also gets hit for average 30% of max damage per round.<br />
(pure speculation on my part there, no parses to back it up)<br />
<br />
C. Frequency of receiving bad rounds (damage spikes) from the mobs you fight.<br />
This I suspect is fairly constant within each expansion, i.e. the rate of damage spikes on krigers is probably the same as on regrua, but the rate would be different in hard LDON, and different again in Tipt.<br />
<br />
Some empirical numbers for these kinds of measurements might actually show us whether there really is a &quot;power gap&quot; for 7-8k warriors.<br />
<br />
Some even more useful meaurements would be &quot;DPS received from the mobs you fight, divided by your total hp&quot;.  This could lead to some interesting conclusions, such as possibly, &quot;The 8k 1600AC warrior in Hard LDON has the same danger of dying as the 12k 2000AC warrior in Kod'Taz.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our gear (besides weapons) is pretty equal as well and I have less raid gear than Apol and Sass (I have none). The thing is, it's not fair to compare yourself to the very top non-raiders because EP is ancient in raiding terms. Compare the upper crust non-raiders to the upper crust raiders (high end GoD) and it isn't even the same world. <br />
<br />
I am in no ways saying it should be equal, I just don't think it is fair at all to compare the most motivated groups to only moderate level raiders.</div></div><hr />

Because we fight to gear ourselves in ep content that is no longer material?Most of the posts here desiring gear quality or close to it with raiders have been touting rex as their main concern which drops in ep's.Should the ep's be eliminated from the field of play?Mudlation with level 70 will certainly begin this process,but, presently guilds wishing to get to time still have to go thru ep's and gear up.POP is not dead yet.I don't know what will happen when lvl 70 and oow comes out but guilds will still have to progress through that content.BTW I was where you guys are now before months and months of farming ep's.Are you saying that effort was without meaning?That I should have gained no advantage for doing so?<br />
<br />
I don't know how it is on old servers ,but, there are probably more people raiding thru ep's than time now.On my server there are about 6 or 7 ep guilds and 1 established time guild...we just broke in so i'm not counting us.It is still meaningful content and is relavent to our discussion at hand.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to have to completely disagree here as it is the crux of my position. I was working on the Malevolent Priests before they nerfed the trials down. I had  10+ parses (my hard drive crashed this week :( ) of Pixtt Annihilator fights that lasted as long as 3 minutes where she did 1k+ DPS that my group of equivalently geared (Some magelos below) people won. We were farming tipt bracers watching time geared groups wait for their corpses. Before the tune, we would go through stacks of emeralds and my exp bar would drop a good bit every single night. We worked HARD to get where we are. The barriar wasn't down, we just climbed over it, just like the guilds that have pushed into the end game raiding content.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point is, I'm not asking for a free ride. I'm not asking for Raex level armor to be handed out.  I'm asking for the ability to play as hard as I want with my small group of friends and not meet dead ends shortly after the expansion is released, or be forced into the same LDoN missions 500 times (and I did do it 500 times) to make any progress gear wise. GoD accomplished this pretty well, I would just like to see more of it.<br />
<br />
This topic has taken so many turns, but at some point I said I'd post some magelos of where my group was at when we did tipt the first time. Anyway, here is some more current magelos of the people I group with. Everyone is about the same gear level as these. There is an alternate profile on each profile named tipt that has the gear we had then (although we have a lot more aa now). Also, we never had any outside help getting through anything. Everything was done with all gear at this level.<br />

No way a top raiders during velious era would have 7k-7.5k, hell  even now.<br />

That's a pretty good profile displaying a fairly high end non raider vs. a top raider.  (Raider is alternate profile).<br />

I can't see myself at 1750 AC ever Frod.  All the profiles I see floating around here with that kind of HP have a SERIOUS AC impairment. <br />

The gates shit may make up for the HP difference, but we're long past the point of HP being king.  With CH's already landing on me occasionally for max, and me not being fully healed, HP are starting to wane.  I honestly can't see putting on almost 500 ac.</div></div><hr />

reason: people were selling ss mq's once their guild no longer needed it.<br />

the draconic pauldrens and bobs were easy to do with a druid friend.<br />

champs was defintly one groupable befor the drop nerf that moved it to only arena royal and bank. and arena mobs were not truely that hard but the bank was alot better.<br />

add to that many casuals are part of a guild and sometimes do hit a raid target. plus many got far in the ring quest just with one group.<br />

10.4k  vs 13k is 80%<br />

well fod, basically it's ok, but I would have pefered some change :<br />
1. Loathsome Bludgeon of Depravity isn't an aggro weapon, so if we want AC/HP we use a shield but not this. put insteed a CHoS or a GBoS.<br />
1. since the crafted wristband give better haste, go for the loyalist shield of honor is back slot (60/75 is far better than 27/65). <br />
2. you forgot the food &amp; drink, it helps too.<br />
3. ornate isn't the best choice for the BP, either Royal attendant and Farwater are better (without counting the clicky).<br />
<br />
<br />
but without this, everything else is ok. I understand what you want to say with this comparasion between velious and now, and I agree. <br />
but the hiden pb is that SoE is increasing the number of top raider specific zones in each expension: from one plus some part of others out of more than twenty five (so let say 10% or 15% of the expension), to seven and more out of less than twenty five (so let say 33%).</div></div><hr />

If this is meant to prove that non raiders remain at a potential 80% of raiders i would only object that you are comparing a fictious potential non raider at 8-8.4k vs acctual top raiders at 11.4k. like for like it seems more fair to either compare top real non raiders (from this site i guess) or maybe simpler use a top potential raider profile as well which seems to top out at around 13.7k (on dream profiles)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">Mokor, Draconic Pauldrons didn't exist in Velious era.  The quest was introduced partway into Luclin.  So it really doesn't belong in the non-raider Velious magelo.  Imbued granite spaulders were probably the best non-raid shoulders at the time.<br />
<br />
Strictly speaking, AOW drops didn't exist in Velious era, either.  I believe the first legit AOW kill was the day Luclin was released.  I wrestled with this when trying to build my own set of magelo profiles for Velious era to create some &quot;real&quot; numbers; should it include AOW gear or not?  Vulak gear, however, was eminently farmed during Velious, by those guilds who had gotten to that point, so I have no issues with that being in the magelo.<br />
<br />
To Lelith, who said there was no way raiders exceeded 7k, my own guild had a warrior with 7.1k with only one Vulak item (katana), and no AOW or Tunare items.  NTOV gear can equip a warrior surprisingly well - matching LDON in most slots, in fact - if you farm it enough.</div></div><hr />

That's nonsense, if your raiding 5 nights a week was doing anything remotely as challenging as what the single group person in the profile was doing, you'd have better.  Raiding Agnarr for 5 nights a week doesn't count.    As a matter of fact, if you look at the Magelo, there are very few items that you cannot wear, and in each of those slots, if you're raiding anywhere near the same level of content, you can get better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">To Lelith, who said there was no way raiders exceeded 7k, my own guild had a warrior with 7.1k with only one Vulak item (katana), and no AOW or Tunare items.

<br />
He was most likely buffed ( and even that I don't believe it ), over than 2k hp from buff during velious ? ( 1735 direct hp from buff, without counting sta  )<br />
There is absolutly no way ( in a realistic way ) that a war could have more than 5khp unbuffed let alone 7khp unbuffed which didn't exist up until few weeks in PoP.<br />
<br />
To requote what was said :<br />
When top raiders had 7k-7.5k in Velious, non-raiders had 3.5k-4k.<br />
<br />
These numbers are not possible at all.<br />
The max counting AoW loots would be about 5100hp at best ( and that would be a war in full doze / vulak / KT boots ).<br />
The max hp from buff achievable during velious is about 1800hp ( slight less actually ).<br />
5100+1800 = 6900hp.<br />
So unless your guild has stacked / exploited focus and other it's impossible.<br />
Still with buff that would put the non raider warrior at about 2200hp which is close to nake hp.</div></div><hr />

A level 60 war naked with no AA ( obviously ) has 2405hp ish ( iksar war with 20 sta added ).<br />
Aegolism = 1100hp, DS = 200hp, focus = 435hp, total hp from buff = 1735hp.<br />
2405hp + 1735 = 4140hp.<br />
And I don't count CT drops from the era, vulak loots/doze was better than CT ones and not sure when his looted table was revamped ( I started to play a few month in velious ).<br />
Frodlin gave a magelo ( http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1081409&amp;alt=237929 ) which is at 4900, from different tests I have done some times ago ( to see mudflation through different era ) it's about the same.<br />
Frodlin magelo is missing some pieces right and there ( KT boots instead of vulak ones, fleshak arms, silver charm, doze shoulder mainly ) which makes up for the AoW loots finally ).<br />
Also the BoC was trash during velious and few weeks in luclin ( still if I recall well ), If I am not wrong there was no HP and for sure no EB on it.<br />
<br />
The stacking part, it was possible at one point during velious ( and/or it was luclin not sure ) to stack multiple times focus.<br />
There was definitly no war with more than 7khp buffed during velious, maybe a few month in luclin ( most likely ), but not during velious era.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I'm not trying to pull your chain or be argumentative.  We really did have a tank over 7k before Luclin.  I don't know if I can make it add up.  I can take a stab at it.<br />
<br />
Frodlin's magelo is missing some Velious-era gear.  Offhand:<br />
<br />
Replace arms with Beldron's (+10 hp, -3 ac)<br />
Replace boots with Mithril (+50 hp, -10 ac)<br />
Replace greaves with Koidoken (+5 hp, -2 ac)<br />
Replace Camii's with Doze charm (+50 hp, -0 ac)<br />
Replace Viik's with Doze shoulders (+25 hp, -3 ac)<br />
Earrings were crap in that era, but an elec BS earring would have added +25 hp, -8 ac.  Not sure if I am forgetting a better earring from somewhere, e.g. from upper PoHate v2.<br />
<br />
Right there is 165 more hit points for -26 AC, and I don't pretend to have trawled all of the gear available in that era.  (Remember that this AC was worthless prior to AC changes in late Luclin.)<br />
<br />
Aegolism didn't exist in that era, we used Marzin's Mark + Heroic Bond, which gives +65 hp over aegolism.  I am not sure about stacking tricks, my memory is hazy about that, but buff stacking was messed up in a lot of ways in those days.  We took what advantages we could get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">SS Legs were that top at the time at 80hp. And Storm boots over mithril.<br />
<br />
I can't remember well enough either way, but I thought I remember 6.5 being godly at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">6.5 buffed was pretty decent. I was at 6.4 buffed for a while which was ok considering I made some poor gear choices. 7k would've been beyond rare, perhaps 2-3 warriors per server (if that), but offhand I'm not automatically putting it outside the realm of possibility.<br />
<br />
Were Chardok Earrings/Spirit Wracked Cords before or after Luclin launch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">nope seam swc was placed in magelo in december 2001 but was it one groupable.<br />

<br />
this should be buyable and or one group, or the random guild raid. (raid is debateable even non raider went sometimes to the planes epics and some velious) 9th ring is iffy so is the swc. and team epic for the epics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">neck is from luclin era, war epic was a pipe dream for a not raider, even for those doing &quot;pick up&quot; raid.<br />
If epic war is on a non raider profile in velious era, then the base weapon for a warrior today is HG / BF or BoW as agro set up, and it would be more realistic.<br />
I don't remind camps deep in chardok being one groupable by &quot;non&quot; raider, it was 2 / 3 groups most often.<br />
Bracer of benevolence would have been really tricky and I don't think it would have been one groupable, by the time the sergent or what ever was dead, CoV mobs would have killed you ( again after agro patch ) and at the time it had a lot of hp.<br />
No guild having a BP / legs SS would have sold it to a stranger too and HoT was far from being one groupable in velious.<br />
Maybe some few other pieces but even that.<br />
<br />
The only armor that I have seen in MQ during velious was the kael quest one, but a bp ? lol...Hell during luclin it was impossible to buy a SS bp, I was offering 150k+ for a friend and not a single one available.<br />
This profile would be the one of a war in an up and coming guild.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Also SWC quest appeared with luclin ( maybe slighty before luclin ), same with the revamp of chardok if I recall well, at least it didn't exist until really late in velious. ( october / november 2001 ), so unless that I am mistaken, the both drop from chardok should be removed.<br />
<br />
Aegolism did exist in velious, it's blessing of aegolism which appeared with luclin.<br />
<br />
Finally crystal spider eyes was put on loot table during luclin on the 2nd or 3rd velk revamp too I think.</div></div><hr />

The max HP for raiding warriors seems a little on the high side, given the general &quot;uberness&quot; of the raiding warriors.  The max HP for the nonraiding warriors seems a little on the low side, given the starting + buff hitpoints available to a non-AA warrior.  This means the theory that the &quot;gap&quot; between raider and non-raider hasn't widened ... has some flaws.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I think that only one thing has changed.  Raid and non-raid people are running into each other in LDON missions, which leads to direct comparisons between them.  In previous eras, the two types of people were seldom seen together, so comparisons weren't made.<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion, and I'll be happy to be shown wrong.  I'll try to find time to finish some magelos.</div></div><hr />

The equipment hasnt magnified the visibility of the gap, the content has. GoD has made the differences noticeable in almost all of its 1grpable content. Hard LDoNs did the same but many non-equipped warriors dont bump into hard ldon+ equipped warriors because they dont get invites.<br />
<br />
Basically there are very few places where a non-raiding warrior runs into a 1k (or near) hitter. In GoD they are commonplace in any of the content worth doing with many being near 2k. That shows the differences pretty quick :)<br />

Tipt mobs have been nerfed imo and when pulled with annul no longer seem very dangerous to me(trash).I'm sure tanks of a lot lighter weight could get through there especially with a pet for the boss.Some of this stuff was admittedly intended for level 70 folks too,another consideration.<br />

If this will actually move the discussion forward, I'm happy to take a first crack at early expansion non-raiders.   How about you create some early expansion raiders.  I'm assuming we are talking the _end_ the expansion; we are not going to add AA; and I'll be adding things that are honestly typical nonraider with a group or two.  I have no idea with which expansion you would like to begin.  Because we've been talking about disaparities with Velious numbers, I'm planning on making that.  BTW, starting out naked I have 2400HP so I'm thinking your 3.5k number is woefully incorrect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the end of velious a top of the line raider Warrior had a smidge over 7k fully buffed.  A more casual player, who could get one group or perhaps two, was just over 5k fully buffed.  Those people discounting Champions as being one or two group acquirable are incorrect.  I one grouped the Kael arena prior to the release of Luclin.  The area around the bank was easily one groupable, although drops were very slow.  And the plate cycle could be done with two groups comfortably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u188"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p188">I'm not sure that the plate cycle existed before Luclin (it was for one of the ring steps that were added much later), but you might be right.<br />
<br />
I threw a Velious magelo together and got 5200 hp buffed for a fairly hard-working non-raid warrior, if he was grouped with shaman/paladin/cleric all with their level 60 spells (which would have been very rare in Velk then, but is necessary for this comparison).  That puts the non-raider at 74% hp of the 7k raider.<br />
<br />
To maintain that 74% gap today, if the top tanks have 14k today, the non-raiding warrior would have to have 10.3k hp buffed.  Although this is not an easy figure to reach, it IS reachable by the non-raider, *without* Ikkinz or Kod'Taz, and is probably not any harder than 5200 hp was in late Velious.<br />
<br />
Velious Raider (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1076810) - buffs to 6835 hp<br />
(Note, I did not go whole hog on this guy.  2 Vulak items, 3 AOW items, 1 Tunare item.  No buff stacking tricks.)<br />
<br />
Velious Non-Raider (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1076810&amp;alt=240277) - buffs to 5243 hp (77%)<br />
(This guy has bought 2 pieces of Myrmidon armor, and a Frostbringer that he doesn't have the faction to quest for, and he has some rare drops from Velk's and Sebilis, but has not done the Dain 8th ring.)<br />
<br />
GoD Raider (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=217036) - buffs to 13916 hp<br />
(This guy is not the top GoD tank out there, but is pretty close, and is probably a good correlation to the 6835 hp Velious tank.)<br />
<br />
GoD Pre-KodTaz Non-Raider (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1071587&amp;alt=233761) - buffs to 10037 hp (72%)<br />
(This guy would have a few hundred more hp if he had gotten any Hard LDON loot and a couple of Solid Coal of Prowess; and a Tak BP filled with multiple hit point augments would be a big boost.)<br />
<br />
Edit - in fact, I think that the last magelo is misleading, since it DOES exclude LDON completely.  I'll make up a proper mixed LDON/GOD magelo and replace it shortly.</div></div><hr />

My memory is fuzzy as to when I got things compared to when expansions were released, but I thought 9th ring became available before the close of Velious (which would be the end of 2001) or shortly after Luclin was released (Christmass of 2001).  <br />
<br />
<br />
I threw a Velious magelo together and got 5200 hp buffed for a fairly hard-working non-raid warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
That magelo is crap.  That is not a hard-working nonraider.  Mostly purchasable gear and total ass with few pieces with actual HPs.  It seems designed by a low-end casual twit not a hard-working dedicated nonraider.  One did not wear full champion's if one wanted HP.  One did not wear Crystal Spider Eyes or Spider Fur Collar.  <br />
<br />
The magelo I made for a nonraider of that time is Here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1087056).  It has 3.85k HP unbuffed.  Your raider has 5.0k HP unbuffed.  That is a 1.15K HP difference.   Maybe you can take a few things away from my guy, and even if we went with your nonraider profile, which I think is subpar for a hardworking nonraider but I could be wrong, the difference is 1.8k HP when buffed. <br />
<br />
<br />
To maintain that 74% gap today, if the top tanks have 14k today, the non-raiding warrior would have to have 10.3k hp buffed.  Although this is not an easy figure to reach, it IS reachable by the non-raider, *without* Ikkinz or Kod'Taz, and is probably not any harder than 5200 hp was in late Velious.<br />
<br />
<br />
I MADE a magelo with the SINGLE BEST items I can acquire with single-groups.  It's attached to my real magelo and it even includes some pieces I got raiding in Velious/Luclin. <br />
<br />
My best magelo is 8.1k HP unbuffed.  I'm looking at the top Povar raider, who has 11.2k HP unbuffed.  He does not rank particularly high server-wide.  That is a difference of 3.1k HP. <br />
<br />
Now I'm willing to take my velious nonraider down a notch, but even going by your own standards, the difference is 1.8K HP between the two.  The difference between my dream profile today and the raiders profile RIGHT NOW is far more than this - and the raiders haven't even reached the end of the expansion yet and actually geared up whereas my dream profile is pretty much as good as it gets for me in GoD.<br />

I'm not sure it matters whether or not the plate cycle existed for purposes of acquiring armor.  The Arena did, and my guild of the time, with 1-2 casual raiding groups, could take one side of the arena.  Some fights took a while and it was a big event for us, but we could do it.  the same people could camp the Bank in single groups, and BPs did fall from Bank mobs. <br />
<br />
The plate cycle does matter for purposes of the 9th Ring, which I am 98% certain was actually fixed and running by the end of Velious, in late 2001.  The 8th shawl, iirc, was still borked but meh.</div></div><hr />

I agree the gap has widened (people also are forgetting you could buy raid loot back then even if you couldn't get it yourself, which isn't making it's way into non-raider profiles). However, out of curiosity, why haven't you included and KT/Ikkinz stuff on your doable profile. You could make him a bit more kick ass. Also, you are missing 300hp from sturdiness.<br />
<br />
Glat,<br />

I am 100% positive the plate cycle existed well before Luclin. I will try to dig up hard proof, but I switched guilds well before Luclin came out and I did plate cycle a bunch with the first guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going for realistic.  I haven't finished the sturdiness line yet, so I can't include that (although good catch); and I'm grouping with a guild that is in mostly velious/low-end PoP gear.  I don't see them making it through the trials and camping safely in Kod'Taz, much less successfully killing Ikkinz trial named, during GoD.  While I am working hard to upgrade myself with single groups where possible, the people I like to hang out with don't view this game with the same kind of ferver and dedication that I tend to (my old guild, that I &quot;progressed past&quot; does, but they've since all joined a raiding a guild and moved to MR *wry laugh*).  I'm helping to lead &quot;raids&quot; into Ferubi and Riwwi, but as for the extremely challenging one-group trial content, if I want to experience it with these friends I won't be completing it soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's the crux ... there is a difference btw realistic and plausible.  If you're going to take the most hardcore raiders and parade their profiles around, then you should take the most hardcore non-raiders and use their profiles or potential profiles.<br />
<br />
Just as your average raider will never see over 11k hp unbuffed, your average non-raider wont see over 8k unbuffed.  That's not to say it isn't doable though.<br />
<br />
It's not realistic to assume your average raider has 11-12k hps unbuffed, because i would wager 80% or more of the raiders out there haven't even seen PoTime or any of the goodies you find there or beyond.<br />
<br />
Best raiding warrior in game is around 13k unbuffed (not realistic but &quot;possible&quot;)<br />
Best non-raiding warrior in the game can push 9k unbuffed (not realistic but &quot;possible&quot;)<br />
<br />
This is about a 30% difference, which can be expected as the latter never needs to kill anything which requires the coordination of more than 12 people.  Not to mention a non-raider has no real use for the 9k hps they have, whereas a 13k warrior needs every bit of ac/hp they can muster for raid encounters which can still come close to one-rounding tanks.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the difference is far greater, but the proportional difference is the same, is what I am trying to say.<br />

I will always agree that non-raiding warriors are getting shafted on AC.  Absolutely.  But I don't see the difference in hit points that you refer to as having gotten worse.<br />

- won 5 easy LDONs a week Sept-Dec. Earned 4k points and 40 AA.<br />

- spent most of April-June in Riwwi/Sewers/Ferubi.  Earned 40 AA, 7 loots and 7 augments.<br />
- spent most of July-present in Vxed/Tipt.  Earned 30 AA, won 3 loots and 3 augments.<br />
- has never done BiC or Kod'Taz or Ikkinz and does not participate in pickup raids.<br />

You are correct.  The guild I was in at the time fell apart when some people didn't have the computer power to run Luclin, and we were doing the plate house with 2 groups by then, and the arena with 1.  I can definitely prove it was conclusive since I'm not in that guild anymore, and I know what caused it to break up, and that was luclin :)<br />

I am, Apolyon.  I am comparing the best current povar raider with the _dream_ profile of a hard-working povar nonraider.  If you can't understand the comparison that I don't get you.  <br />
<br />
If you'd like to compare the current best raider and dedicated nonraider. It would be 11.2k HP for the best current raider and 7.3k HP for the best current dedicated nonraider.  Instead of doing that, though, I was giving you the benefit of the doubt by suggesting that the raider's profile wouldn't even CHANGE between now and the end of GoD by stacking it up against what I see as being the damn near best nonraider gear available.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, this maintains the proportion seen in Velious, without Kod'Taz or EP's or inordinate amounts of LDON points.<br />
<br />
I don't get you and maybe I'm being dense here.  First off, I've flat out disagreed with your hard-working velious nonraider profile by about 600HP.  I come out at a difference in Velious of about 76%.<br />
<br />
I can no longer click your GoD profiles, but using the good GoD raider _right now_ I get 11.2k and using my dream profile I get 8.1k, which is still a bigger variant than 76% and it assumes the GoD raider won't actually get better gear in the final zones of GoD - which we both know is a faulty assumption.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a very difficult time formulating an argument to the logic you've posted this morning.  I can't compain about the velious profiles you've made, and I don't know enough about GOD to comment on those, but I'll assume that since you made decent Velious profiles, that you know what you're doing.  I noticed there are a lot of augmented slots in the GoD profile, but I also can't complain with the logic you've posted about the number of LDON adventures during the week.<br />
<br />
In short....bravo.  I will concede that the power difference has stayed basically the same, AT LEAST from now compared to Velious.  Whatever mistakes were made in POP appear to have been corrected by LDoN or GoD, and I can't rightfully bitch about the state of affairs 2 expansions ago.  I can't complain about what you've asked of the non raiding characters, and for that, you win the argument.  The only possible recourse for the non raiding side at this point in the debate is to state that perhaps the ratio has stayed the same, but the fact that the greater difference of total of HP is causing the imbalance, and I really can't argue that point either.<br />
<br />
Raiding people SHOULD have more HP than non raiders.  I don't think it's fair for me to buff to 12.7k and you guys to buff to 14k.  I do think that mudflation and buff-flation is getting out of control here, and that is possibly the problem instead of itemization, because from what you've posted here, there is definitely a way, it is definitely possible, and there are a lot of people who haven't put in the effort to get there.<br />
<br />
Now, having said that, you've got to understand something.  PoP was REALLY fucking hard on non raiders.  A lot of us are disillusioned and jaded, and rightfully so.  LDON wasn't the answer, but combined with GoD, it does appear to be the answer now.  Alot of us are pissed off about the state of affairs of the game during PoP, but I'm not sure how anyone can form a logical argument for that rage now.  The systems are in place, the content is in place, the itemization is in place, you CAN get back into the game if you really have the drive to.<br />
<br />
Congratulations...you've done what a lot of other raiders couldn't do in 75+ pages of this thread, and that is conclusively prove that there is no reason to bitch....at least right now.</div></div><hr />

I saw your GoD nonraider before the profile was borked and it was 7.5k (remember, I am talking UNBUFFED and you are talking buffed).  That is a 200HP difference between the two so I dont' see any reason for your snideness.<br />

I don't think there is much point in me going on either.<br />
<br />
Haass, thanks for the reply.  I can see your point about POP.  It was with much relief to me when my guild finally started raiding POP about a year ago.  I recall all too well how discouraging it was to sit in PoValor week after week with no rewards to look forward to except AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">Again, you're judging by raw hitpoints, when the *ratio* is what matters, raw numbers aren't meaningful.<br />
<br />
If the 'raid warror' were X% higher than non-raiders in Velious, and Luclin, and increased in PoP (I have no doubt it increased in PoP incidentally, PoP was very not good for non raiding players, which is why I'm still perplexed why so many are focused on the Elemental Planes, which is also... not very good for non raiders), yet the ratio has returned in LDoN and GoD, and has actually diminished a bit, then it's not a &quot;widening gap&quot;, it's a stagnant gap or even a narrowing gap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u205"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p205">Haass and Vigdis might agree with Sassinak, but I don't. I think this analysis overlooks a number of key points. <br />
<br />
1. The AC difference is unquestionably larger by any measure now than it ever has been -- AND that AC means more than it used to. HPs are not the only measure of &quot;power&quot;. You can't just allow this point, and then move on to HPs like it doesn't matter. Same with dps, and other aspects of character &quot;power&quot;. <br />
<br />
2. Even if the power relation between raider and non-raider were fixed at a constant level between now and the past (when it very clearly isn't), the relation between mobs and characters is also. What happens then is a spiralling of power for the raider -- he gets access to high exp zones AND the ability to kill those same blue mobs are far more exp than the non-raider gets. So not only are they proportionately far more powerful, yet still exping on blue con mobs, but they are also doing all this in higher ZEM zones, like Earth, Fire, or whatever. Spending 60 AA on sturdiness is a lot more thinkable when you can crank an AA every 20 minutes than it is when it takes 90 minutes - two hours.<br />
<br />
3. These magelos that are posted neglect that fact that raid rot loot is frequently better than anything the non-raider is getting. Consequently, raiders gear up far faster, for far less effort, than non-raiders.<br />
<br />
4. Beyond magelos and gear, with the introduction of PoP, especially, huge areas of the game are simply, and absolutely, shut off to anyone who doesn't feel like getting involved in mass group raiding. There's more to &quot;progess&quot; than increasing the amount of hps my magelo has. That has nothing to do with &quot;skill&quot;, paying dues, or anything else. It's the way the game is constructed. Sure, maybe I could cobble together a magelo of cherry-picked items  from selected zones and wave it around and say I've progessed. So what? I'm still living in the ghetto. If the game is constructed in such a way that I am restricted to the margins because I don't want to raid with 9 clerics and 70 people, than I think that's pretty bad game design. So I've voted with my feet. I'll just play other games that don't treat people who dont' feel like mass group raiding this way. At some point some accountant at SoE will have to run a spreadsheet and see if the game is viable as presently constructed. If they find it is, more power to them. If not, oh well -- too bad they ruined a good game. Either way, I'm gone.<br />
<br />
I've played the game both ways. There's just no question that all the ancillary benefits of raiding, plus the direct benefts, give disproportionately more power than to the non-raider, per unit time. The raider isn't working harder for his advantages -- he's working relatively less hard.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just remember early EQ. Yes, even then there was differentiation between raiders and non-raiders -- sort of. But we were all on the same map. They were in Guk, and I could go to Guk too. Anything there was to do in the game, I could do -- eventually, and on my own terms pretty much. The difference between me and the best warriors on the server was certainly great, but nothing like what there is now, where people are basically playing different games. Only now one of the games gets a lot of attention -- and the other gets hand-me-downs. It's a completely different experience. I guess some people like that. Not me. None of that has anything do with paying dues, skill or any of the other rationalizations raiders like to employ to make themselves feel better. It's just a matter of game construction and play patterns, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u206"><b>Abazagaroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p206">7th shawl was the cap until LoY or POP. It definitely did not include an 8th for a long time.<br />
<br />
That's not true. 8th shawl was completed by at least early mid luclin, as that's when i did it. I certainly didn't do it on the cutting edge of it being completed either.<br />
<br />
As to this whole stat focused debate, its kinda beside the point. Its not just the issue of hp, its ac as well, and its all relative to the stuff that's being fought. A &quot;casual&quot; player or non-raider can't get enough ac to start seeing an impact in the dps spikes of GoD mobs in single content stuff. They also can't usually get enough saves to resist the mean ass procs of that content. It isn't just a matter of &quot;adding another healer&quot; to get through, its a matter of said tanks simply not being able to last at all because they get either 1 rounded or 2 rounded between heals.<br />
<br />
The question isn't, &quot;has the hp gap remained the same&quot;, but, &quot;has the gap between what is doable remained the same&quot;. In many of our minds, mine included, when you isolate the content and say, &quot;well, if you can't tank jhiru you don't deserve to be in KT or ikkiniz getting those drops anyway&quot;, it sounds perfectly reasonable. But when you juxtapose that against the relative lack of content for those that are elemental+ geared, it becomes a question of what are those people playing for (and paying for)?<br />
<br />
Until luclin you could take a mediocre geared player with droppable stuff bought in EC or Gfay (depending on server) and have them join a high end raiding guild and perform well enough as they got equipped. Midway through luclin that status came back with the blue diamond cultural (for tanks), though resists were becoming even more important (and people could no longer &quot;afford&quot; to bring resist kits with them to switch out, they couldn't afford to lose the ac/hp). PoP destroyed that and GoD made it worse. Take a 7k5 hp /1500 ac unbuffed warrior, for example, which is a realistic &quot;high end geared non-raider&quot;. Can they apply to your local uberguild and tank in high end GoD? I seriously doubt it. But take a relatively equally equipped warrior in kunark and velious, and they could against all but 1-2 mobs, and in luclin all but a handful.<br />
<br />
As the difference between what players have and what they need to survive gets smaller and smaller at the high end, the casual players fall more and more behind, regardless if according to some stat (like hp) they remain &quot;relatively&quot; the same.<br />
<br />
To be even more simple, something like TZ in time that hits for 3k+ a pop. Compare that to AoW in velious and how hard he hits. Did warriors in PoP have 3 times as much hp as in velious at the same level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u207"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p207">You're right, Tugurok, the power of mobs has risen too, and therefore the overall risk might have changed.  I'm trying to think of how to measure overall risk without using a time machine.  Here is the best comparison I can think of right now:<br />
<br />
When I started raiding in TOV in mid-Velious, I had 5300 hp and 1300 AC fully buffed at level 60 (i.e. equivalent to my &quot;Velious non-raider&quot; magelo that I posted earlier).  On the drakes in TOV I needed CH to start at 60% every time.<br />
<br />
The first time I got access to BOT (before it was opened to all), I had 8600 hp and 1400 AC fully buffed and 100 AA.  This is probably very similar to what non-raiders had 6 months later (about a year ago).  On the krigers I needed CH to start at 60% every time.<br />
<br />
The last time I did a hard LDON, I had 10100 hp and 1600 AC fully buffed and 280 AA (i.e. nearly equivalent to my &quot;Gates/LDON non-raider&quot; magelo that I posted earlier).  I recall that I needed CH to start at 60% every time.<br />
<br />
From this admittedly narrow set of data, one could conclude that the difficulty of TOV HOT mobs in late Velious was equivalent to BOT krigers in POP or Hard LDON mobs today, for non-raiders of those eras.<br />
<br />
Of course, one CH was a lot more of the mana bar for a cleric in Velious, so a CH isn't the perfect constant for measurement between different eras, but it's a start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u208"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p208">In my mind, that comparison actually shows that the power gap has actually widened. A non-raider being in HoT at the end of velious was at the very top of his game. A non-raider getting into BoT early in PoP was at the top of his game. A non-raider doing Hard LDoN now is doing alright, but there is quite a bit of content that is considerably harder (Vxed+). In top end GoD content you probably would need CH to start at 80% to 100% or even on incoming which means the non-raider is relatively weaker now than they were in velious or PoP.</div></div><hr />

Strange, my experience of a guild raiding NToV during late velious was that loot for a raiding guild came pretty fast indeed.  While my experience of a casual guild was that gear came slower, but still far faster than it does in today's EQ.  I guess we have different perceptions.</div></div><hr />

That was exactly his point, Lelith.  Instead of being snide about it just look at the contradiction in your post.  To gear up raiders now it takes about 1-2 months, and before it took about 6 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. These magelos that are posted neglect that fact that raid rot loot is frequently better than anything the non-raider is getting. Consequently, raiders gear up far faster, for far less effort, than non-raiders.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my casual guild, I'd say I got a loot upgrade maybe once every 6-10 weeks or so.  Not bad.  When I left my friends and joined my first &quot;raiding&quot; guild, I got a loot upgrade maybe once every month or so - they were still in VT and low-end PoP and while there was a lot of loot dropping in, say, VT there were quite a few people who needed upgrades too.  Now I'm raiding with my enchanter with a Time/GoD guild using DKP.  My loot upgrades vary, but on average I'd say I get an upgrade once every one-two weeks.  My upgrades have now stalled because there isn't actually a lot dropping that I need.  For people who hit Qvic early, almost every raider in the guild is fully-equipped with Qvic armor and it's only been about three months since the zone opened up. <br />
<br />
So, to answer your remark Lelith, no, casual warriors are not worried about working for our loot.  One of them merely suggested that on average it takes far longer and far more time invested to gear up a nonraider than a raider.  Your little diatribe concerning the time it took to gear up your raiding guild only verifies that statement.<br />
<br />
In the end, comments like the one you made in your post aren't the least bit helpful, either in furthering the debate or remedying the problem.</div></div><hr />

Kunark Raid - 14/24 / 14/24 (not sure about VP loot if any was better than epics)<br />
Kunark Non-raid 12/24 CSS or 9/19 Lamentation or 9/18 Jade Mace<br />

Non-Raid - I think non-raiders kept velious weapons or got the UP weapons which were similar ratios. Fleshgrinder come on the scene here at 12/19. I personally was using SoD/HoH. I'll use 13/20 as non-raider, 15/20 at best if you could afford BoC and they were being sold.<br />

While I agree that low-end GoD and LDoN have shit-all for warrior tanking weapons, PoP saw several raw tanking weapons at practically all levels.

Since the debate is drifting to dps disparity between raiders and non-raiders its probably not useful to include the raid only no drop weapons from tier 3 and above in an &quot;available to all warriors&quot; list since those are not reliably available to non-raiders. <br />
<br />
I have a GSo4W, I can forsee getting a Great Blade of Storms and possibly the Obsidian Scimitar if I surrender to the open raid machine but beyond that I have nothing left to obtain.<br />

I'll double check but I don't think GoD offers any weapons that will replace those few items for me without a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">Since the debate is drifting to dps disparity between raiders and non-raiders <br />
Before the Droga weapons it was probably accurate to say that just acquiring aggro weapons was a major problem for casual Warriors. This is no longer true.<br />
<br />
For Warriors following the raid progression path through the EP's to PoTime and beyond there are IMO not quite enough options. With BoW drops rates more than a little spotty on some servers, it's not rare ar all to see Warriors in the EP's with BoC and CHSD or CHoS. Later on you can expand the meaning of aggro weapon to include things like SeWS and VDD, but in all truthfullness, these are non-aggro weapons players slap an Anger 3 proc on because they can't get a real aggro weapon. I'd much rather have a BoW than a SeWS or DBoW/EoE than VDD.<br />
<br />
As a fairly hardcore raider, my DPS is far from stellar. But then again, I'm a Warrior and that's not something I focus on. I suppose I agree the the casual Warrior DPS weapon selecton is fantastic now until about level 60 and then tapers off. But a casual warrior mainly tanks and AGGRO should be any Tank's chief concern, not DPS.<br />

Droga weapons did a lot for non-raiding warriors for aggro and dps both on that we can agree. Your view that aggro should be my chief concern is a bit narrow though as  casual and non-raiding warriors find themselves in grouping situations not generally encountered by raiders. <br />
<br />
When I raid (because even non-raiders do from time to time) I know before we engage if I'm MT or if I'm filling some other role like rampage tank, off tank or backup in case the MT goes down and I select my weapons appropriately ( or keep my weapon bag open for a quick switch if its necessary ). Even in open raids most people know its important to control aggro and keep it on the MT and act accordingly.<br />
<br />
When I'm doing pickup groups there are frequently situations when I have to maintain aggro and contribute as much dps as possible. Its situations like that where I'm actually considering Anger3 augging my GSo4W or getting a Ykesha augment from Guk.  Its the same reason I have a snare whip, a tash stick and am saving for a Truncheon of Doom although I might get some friends to help me get a Willsapper. I'm frequently in situations where I have to use those weapons not for the aggro value but for the utility of the proc. DPS is just a different kind of utility I can provide. Any weapon I can get my hands on that lets me fill more than one role is a good one. <br />

Droga weapons may fill the bill for LDoN hard but do you honestly think they are acceptable weapons for GoD zones and non-raiders accept those as the end of their progression weapon-wise?</div></div><hr />

A tank should really be beyond the droga combo before delving deep into GoD (beyond trials 1-4).  There are a myriad of other perfectly acceptable weapons out there ... just don't expect to find them in the bazaar.<br />

<br />
This is where our opinions completely diverge. Making raiding a pre-requisite for anything related to progression is a poor design decision. It doesn't increase options for players, it limits them by dictating a certain playstyle over all others. <br />
<br />
Raiding should be a choice in the same way doing tradeskills or questing (for the few quests out there worth doing) or seeing just how far a single group can push themselves is a choice. <br />
<br />
If raiding were a pre-requisite for jumping into intense content I'd never have tried duoing in Qinimi or a sewer trial or grouping in BoT because I, and other non-raiders, have been told at various times that we don't have enough hp/AC/AAs or the right gear to do the things some of you raiders are now suggesting we do to advance. <br />
<br />
Like it or not there are mixed messages coming from the high end warriors about what we can or can't do in the non-raiding game and its because of your single-minded devotion to the &quot;raiding is the only real progression&quot; model that SOE has been feeding you.<br />
<br />
Make all planar and GoD zone progression quest based, make raid targets triggerable with reasonable timers to prevent farming, spread out some (not all) of the itemization of weapons and armor to &quot;minor raid&quot; mobs doable with 2-3 groups of reasonably geared players (for the tier they are in) and let the content determine how far players advance, not the amount of time in one sitting a player can devote to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">If *minor raiding* includes small-scale raids (hedge walk, Xanamech), single groupable but difficult trials (PoJ, for example) I wouldn't find that objectionable or even obstructive.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u235"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p235">The term &quot;minor raid&quot; is probably a bad one to use anyway amongst ourselves since its based on perceived difficulty.  AoW isn't a minor raid for the people I play with but its single group content for time+ players. <br />
<br />
With tiered content like PoP and GoD its easier to just call it 2-3 group encounters with the understanding that the content is a step up in difficulty from the previous tier. <br />
<br />
Ideally the 2-3 group encounters would offer some reward for doing content harder than single group exp content but nothing on par with the triggered big game targets that the real raiders would be doing. Access to the next tier, while quest based, could require a drop from the triggered raid targets so that a serious non-raider could plan in advance when they can attend such an event without sacrificing rl commitments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">I think one of the reasons this topic is so hot for many people is that as a classs we are by far the most gear dependent. Now that we add weaps into the topic, it really illustrates how large the difference is between raiders and non-raiders. HP's and AC seem to be the most talked about because its something that everyone (other classes when forming groups included) can easily quantify and rate. <br />
<br />
But there are also huge differences in weapon DPS, innate weapon agro, worn attack, haste, worn effects such as riposte, shielding, stun resist, agro modifiers, regen, etc., clicky added procs for more agro, access to far superior  augs, and resists.  When looked at as a whole the difference is much larger than just the HP and AC.<br />
<br />
Is the gap larger than it should be? Maybe.....opinions obviously differ wildly. <br />
<br />
Is the gap more significant for warriors than for other classes? Definately.....and I think that is a huge contributor to some of the angst expressed on this board lately.  In effect this gear dependancy results in other classes desiring a tank that is much  better geared than they are for X content, and as such can be very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Fixes? Not sure myself, lots of proposed changes in this and other threads. Maybe OoW will adress some of people concerns. Firstly, would like to see some change in LDoN itemization. After being out for this long the drops could use some shaking up. Would also like to see some no-drop armor coming off of challenging single group encounters that was modeled after the parchment system in PoP. Where a person could turn in a dropped &quot;armor parchment&quot; for a slot they are weak in. Be nice if you had some flexiblitly in determing which slot a drop could upgrade.<br />
<br />
Anyway, still getting my 13$ worth of fun from EQ and enjoying playing with my friends and meeting new people. Hope OoW adds to the fun for a wider variety of the playerbase, and more people start to enjoy the game again.</div></div><hr />

Horn of Hsagra is 13/20 droppable. <br />
Jaelen's Katana is 14/19. <br />
<br />
So your numbers are off right off the bat by making the droppable weapons worse and the raid weapons better. Jaelen's Katana has a 13% better ratio<br />
((14/19 - 13/20) / (13/20)).<br />
<br />
Fleshbiter (note, not even the best weapon out of GoD) - 34/30<br />
Club of Mad Researcher 17/20<br />
<br />
((34/30 - 17/20) / (17/20)) = 33%<br />
<br />
I don't see that as being constant at all.<br />
<br />
Hell, in Luclin Raiders has 16/20 and non-raiders could get 15/20 which is only 6.6%.<br />
<br />
Edit - Obviously there is more to weapons than their ratios, but it seems a decent place to compare. It is pretty obvious that raiders are not in the same ballpark though when i hear numbers of them parsing out at over 2x my DPS. There is no way that in the earlier eras that it was near that large.</div></div><hr />

One can be gotten as the result of a 0 difficulty xp group grind ... the other one requires you to kill enourmous monsters.  Content has to reflect content.  34/30 weapons are out there and you're welcome to take them ... just dont expect them to drop off of teenie weenie group encounters.<br />
<br />
Something that takes 54 people to kill should invariably drop something better than what can be done with 6 or even 18.<br />
<br />
If you complaint is that raiding takes too large a time investment, then youre in the wrong fucking game, my friend.  This game has always, and will always require huge amounts of time investments ... often for elongated periods of time.  If it wasnt this way, sony would be out of business by now.  EQ = massive timesink anyway you look at it.  Most, though not all, people who experience hardcore raiding content spend much more quality time in game than those who dont.  Sure, you find some casuals who spend huge amts of time in game, but generally said people lack the will/desire, not the ability to raid, and prefer to invest their time in there friends rather than their personal advancement.  Some are lucky and get to do both in a good guild  :).  More quality time invested = greater rewards ... and i emphasize &quot;quality&quot; rather than wasted time.<br />
<br />
All that is beside the point ... the dps gap is there but isnt the enourmous gulf you present it to be.  For warrior utility, on the other hand the 34/30 weapon runs circles around the 17/20 club ... as it should.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hell, in Luclin Raiders has 16/20 and non-raiders could get 15/20 which is only 6.6%&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Sure, if you were willing to fork over half a million platinum, which i daresay is harder to do than to kill AoW imo.  Droppable raid loot needs to be considered raid loot no matter how you look at it, and AoWar was still very much a raid target in the luclin era.  I dare say that AoW wasnt even killed for the first time until right before or after the luclin release by Afterlife on Mith Marr.  The average top of the line non raider weapons in the luclin era were the epics and various weapons found in griegs and UP which only required small groups, as well as various other velious droppable goodies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I'm not arguing that I want a 34/30 weapon without working into wherever it drops. I would just like there to exist somewhere in the EQ world a few upgrades so I have something to work toward that didn't require raiding. I couldn't care less if it was 15/19 or 34/30. It is something so I get to have fun trying to acquire it. It's not fun to have the same weapon for years.

And this my friend is why this game will die at some point. Time sinks worked back in 1999-2000 when the game was by itself. You notice that not one game is attempting to emulate that (other than Sigil)? Not only that but SOE is de-timesinking this game all the time.<br />
<br />
That being said I believe that the high-end raiders should have toys that non-raiders or casual raiders dont. I do think, however, that by the time things are two expansions old that things should be opened up as much as possible. Something like a flag to play in the zone but one that prohibits the holder from picking up certain flagged loot unless they go through the normal progression. So you could do EP but you couldnt use the quest flag to skip progression and not take down the GoDs for loot. Minis maybe, that is the point where things would become interesting.<br />
<br />
In the end its not suprising that this discussion is essentially 125pgs long (the other thread included) vs the most on any other board of like 25. Warrior itemization sucks for many but especially for the non-uber (i.e. plays all the time) warrior (either non-raider or raider). And if we cant tank then what can we do?<br />

Apo, you mention EP craftable armor.  Are you by any chance a black smith?  Because if you were, you would know that EP craftable armor is exceedingly rare.  Each set has at least one type of component, of which you need several, for which the drop rate is rarer than hens teeth.  I've attempted to purchase the components and haven't seen enough on sale in the bazaar to even make it feasible, given the failure rate on black smithing combines and sub combines, let alone at a price that was realistic.  And prior to my departing the game soon after GoD was released, I've never seen ANY of the armor for sale in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
It's hard to give much credibility to droppable items having given non-raiders huge mudflation when the items in question are rare enough to be next to non-existant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I disagree.  If you don't have access to the EP planes to actually hunt down the armor components yourself, the EP tradeskill stuff is basically out of reach for a lot of people.  The prices are insane.  If you can hunt there and get all the components then you can usually find someone to try the combine for you for free.  Otherwise you're paying 100k+ per item in a lot of cases.  For most people that's not doable.  <br />
<br />
PoP was a total disaster for casual players from a loot perspective.  The XP group mobs drop anything ranging from nothing to crappy loot comparable to bazaar items.  Unless you are flagged for Sol Ro your chances of getting even Ornate armor is very slim.  Ornate is roughly comparable to tradeskill armor you can buy for 5k a piece.  I'd hardly consider that quality loot.  To get anything better than that either requires a raid or a solid group of people who don't need the loot because they have raid gear.</div></div><hr />

I've attempted to purchase the components and haven't seen enough on sale in the bazaar to even make it feasible, given the failure rate on black smithing combines and sub combines, let alone at a price that was realistic.  And prior to my departing the game soon after GoD was released, I've never seen ANY of the armor for sale in the bazaar.<br />

It's hard to give much credibility to droppable items having given non-raiders huge mudflation when the items in question are rare enough to be next to non-existant.<br />

I spend large amounts of time in earth, water, fire and occasionally air farming pieces for bows, jewelry, and armor.  My friend is a master smith and fletcher, so though the influx of armor is slow and costly, bazaar upgrades still exist.</div></div><hr />
