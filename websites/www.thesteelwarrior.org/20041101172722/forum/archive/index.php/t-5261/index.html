<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kardein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I got a really good deal on a WMS/WMBS and I am not that impressed. I am level 52 is it worth keeping?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep it till you're 60 at least....you'll see a vast improvement in the damage that weapon will put out once you have the max skill cap and a higher damage cap.  At 52 you don't get the full output of that weapon yet...which is why you're probably not impressed with it at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL using one on my 30ish SK and on my 65 warrior main :-p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WMBS does pretty decent damage for me at 65.  I borrowed my friend's and was surprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it's probably the best droppable non-proc 2h.  Definitely a nice weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I am hard pressed to think of a better 2HS that you can buy.  Parses suggest it's just slightly better than the windblade, which costs a lot more.  <br />
<br />
2H is the way to go for max damage.  I think I hold better aggro dual wielding, but I definitely do more damage with a 2H weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">War marshalls bladed staff is one of the best weapons you can buy, right next to a greatstaff of thunder. Whereas a GSoT delivers solid agro for a rock-bottom price, WMBS gives you DPS comparable to that of a windblade for much cheaper.<br />
<br />
Dual wielding is good, but not for the warrior on a budget ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I first joined my current guild, my standard weapons produced too much agro and I found myself spending too much time not attacking when I wasn't MT.  The WMBS solved this nicely.  At first I considered a Windblade since I'd get fewer ripostes and almost as much DPS, but then I realized that if I'm using a non-proccing weapon, I'm not tanking anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WMBS sounds like a pretty decent weapon. But was considerably more than the Granite Halberd of Chance (http://eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=rujarkian&amp;item=13497).<br />

Have any of you guys parsed the damage output of it. BTW it is 2HS and not  2HP as the link shows.</div></div><hr />

That link requires a flashlink membership, here's the link from LUCY:  Granite Halberd of Chance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45134).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The best buy for 2hs no aggro dps wep I've found for under 7k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it can hold agro too with an aug. i put a 75dd one on mine and only spent 100 points for it lol. i held agro in PoV and BoT with WMBS. not as good as my  dual wield combo for agro or dsp BUT i take alot less riposte damage and have NICE agro plus it can be used when offtanking as long as the MA has a good dual wield setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your server is different than mine, I guess...on The Nameless, the WMBS is regularly between 5-7Kpp, but GHoC is rarely below 15Kpp.<br />
<br />
WMBS is a great weapon to have in your bag-o'-tricks for when you need to do damage and not get aggro.</div></div><hr />
