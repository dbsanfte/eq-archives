I'd love to hear how you filter and divide up the chats....maybe give me some better organization over my own!<br />
<br />
As I noted in that thread, I have five chat boxs.<br />
<br />
1.  General chat (/gu, /say, /t, /auc, etc)<br />
<br />
2.  Combat (my hits; his hits) - heavily filtered to only show the numbers, set inviz to the left<br />
<br />
3.  Spells - again heavily filtered to show group and NPC, set inviz and upper left<br />
<br />
4.  &quot;Too far Away&quot; &amp; &quot;Cannot See&quot; - minimized<br />
<br />
5.  Everything else - NPC spam, rampage/enrage/flurry, PC spam like emotes, crits, deaths. <br />
<br />
What's yours look like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">two boxes: one for /gu, channels, say, group, ooc ect plus skillups, rampage, enrage.<br />
<br />
other one is basically all melee and spells. would be hard to look at but my hits, my misses, me getting hit, me being missed are all in bright different colors so i can still tell whats going on<br />
<br />
my custom ui is already cramped enough to add anymore than 2 chat boxes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got 3.<br />
<br />
 Battle spam is in it's own really small box with /chatfontsize 1.<br />
<br />
 /gu, /rs, and /tells go in another, the rest gets shoehorned in the big one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/chatfontsize 1.<br />
Okay, I gotta get me some of that in my &quot;everything else&quot; box!</div></div><hr />

OMG how could you read or see anything?????<br />
<br />
I have the main chat window and 4 others<br />
<br />
Main chat window, bottom of screen, slightly to the right of center with any conversation going into.<br />
<br />
Immediately to the right of the main chat window I have another window in which all spell casting information goes.  I have this one set to near the same opacity as the main chat so I can see when mobs are casting (and either ghetto bash or just kick - now that i'm over 55 and kick can stun) to interrupt them<br />
<br />
In the upper right corner with opacity set to 0 (so I don't see the box) I have an abbreviated window showing the monster hitting meet (shows about 8 lines worth of hits, so I know what is hitting me, etc.)<br />
<br />
To the right of the me taking hits box I have a very narrow, 0 opacity chat box (so I don't see the chat box iteself, just the numbers) of all my hits.  This is pared down to just the numbers.  Sure I don't see when I miss, but that is pretty obvious to tell by watching as I do swing animations but no hit numbers show up.<br />
<br />
In the upper right, again with opacity set to 0 so I don't see the actual chat box, I have spell damage and damage shield numbers.  This way I can see if the lazy ass wizard is actually nuking, which of my damage procs went off, how much my group mate's procs are doing or when the damage shield is off (or how much it is hitting for).<br />
<br />
This generally keeps my chat window cleaned up so I can read what is going on.<br />
<br />
This is all on the standard EQ interface.  I couldn't imagine having everything in one chat box.  The spamola would be HELL!!!<br />

I plug an ethernet cable into the adaper that was retrofitted into my skull :D<br />
<br />
Actually, I got damage in a seperate box from regular spam but i keep the borders at 0% visibility ( kind of like the old hitsmode before they implemeted custom UI's ) so i really never see it or count it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One for others hits and mob hitting one.<br />

One for my hits and misses.<br />
<br />
One for the rest.</div></div><hr />

I also color code my messages.  My friend once took a look at my boxes and said, &quot;Taste the rainbow!&quot;  =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raid box <br />

<br />
Melee Box <br />
- All hits, misses, mob hits, mob misses, I use full message, this is nice because it shows dodge/riposte/parry etc. The 4 types are color coded. Also in this Box is RAMPAGE message this way I can verify if i am on rampage.<br />

/gu,/g,/t,/rsay,/channel#,etc<br />
One for anything that spams<br />
Combat,spells,/ooc,/say,/shouts,/auc,etc<br />
Quite effective in making sure I never miss anything someone says to me.Unless they /say or open channel it during a fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only thing I have different from any other I've read is a window stuffed in a corner and made as small as possible for other's hits when I wanna parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got one of those too, grimm. It's just uh... I couldn't tell ya where it is anymore :(</div></div><hr />

 No, folks, that's NOT a ponytail. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screenshot here (http://www.criesofinsurrection.com/files/tallonzek.jpg)<br />
<br />
Basically I have one for mobs hitting me, one for damage done to mobs, one for guildofficer chat, one for /guildsay, one for crits + skill related messages, and one for everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I played I had 6<br />
<br />
1. Tells<br />
2. OOC, Shout, AUC<br />
3. Melee + Spell Damage<br />
4. Guild, Group<br />
5. Junk - says, random, the other misc stuff<br />
6. Raid Channels<br />
<br />
Anything that was shareing a window was heavily color cordinated so i could instantly pick out information.<br />
<br />
The setup made it so I could grab any information that I wanted with a quick glance, from attack to tells it was clearly there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm.  I haven't updated my ui filters since apparently they separated out RAMPAGE from ENRAGE, etc.  I'd love to have ENRAGE in my main chat screen (I fucking hate it when I'm busy sending a long tell and a mob enrages :p )...<br />
<br />
Hey, Bum, grats on Talon! =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rugal Bloodwind</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. My hits, me being hit, me being missed, procs<br />
2. All sorta spellcast spam<br />
3. Tells<br />
4. Perma minimized, all other battlespam (for parsing)<br />
5. Anything else (main window), with Enrage in bright yellow text<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to seperate  a few channels extra, but that'll wait 'till my big monitor works again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always had two, one for chat, one for spam, but after seeing emilia's UI I added one for &quot;my spells&quot;.  Nice to see your procs without them getting spammed off the screen, and it's always nice to be able to see what the CH chain heals are landing for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 large one for combat. 1 large one for all chats. and a little that has tells so i dont miss any. bout it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Battle spamage (except crits, OK, I'm vain) in one, everything else in a second.  It was a big deal to add that battle spam box, like Shik I'm old school.  I had to frantically scramble to put the &quot;A&quot; key back for auto attack after that last patch cause I was screwing up so badly with the &quot;Q&quot; key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only go with 2 windows: Main chat has all combat spam, spell casts, ooc, shout, say, and auction.  2nd has guild, channels, group, raid, and tells.  If I could find room for a 3rd window, I'd turn off some filters and send it all there.  All I have on for combat is my hits, me getting hit, and all crits/crips.  Depending on if I'm on a raid I might have player spells on.  All mob casts stay on(monk is still my main, gotta know when they cast so I can time FD)  Maybe if I bump my resolution up again I'll have a bit more room lol...</div></div><hr />
