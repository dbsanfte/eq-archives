<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Allright for those of you that do not know -- You can have all three epic swords on you at all times.  Here's what you do:<br />
<br />
Create the 2hs epic.  Put it in your inventory.  Have a mage summon you a sword of runes.  Put it in the red scabbard, just 1, and hit combine.  Out will come the 2 1hs epics.  Voila -- you have ALL THREE EPICS on your person and you can bank the scabbard.<br />
<br />
Now with the introduction of LDoN something amazing has happened as a side effect of this.  Make sure you have all three swords on you.  Get your Scabbard.  Go see the Dorf next to Wendan and Kragek in EFP.  Hand him the 2hs and the scabbard.<br />
<br />
BINGO - you now have all three epics given to you in their NEW / unsummoned form.  THIS MEANS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ITEM TAG IDs.  Take note that you now have TWO red blades, TWO blue blades, and the Jagged Blade of War.<br />
<br />
THATS RIGHT YOU HAVE TWO -- 500HATE PROCCING 1hs WEAPONS!  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Just click teh link ! :D<br />

**edit:shikarii. bleh, i tried to link it up. i think it's just a borked up somehow ( i saw the pic too and re-entered the URL. no dice )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hemorrhagern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, yep, definitely a mistake on SoE's part, a welcome one, but a mistake none-the-less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It will probably be fixed in some emergency patch tonight.  God forbid our epic give us TWO hate proc'ing weaps.  Let's just forget the fact that you can buy a better pair of weaps in the bazaar for 30k or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">so you get new 1hs'ers and a new 2hs for the old 2hs and bad right? so do what kiras said but, could you get 2 2hs'ers too? theres how..<br />
<br />
take yer 2 1hs and the 2hs, equip 2hs go die in the arena or somthing.... make the 1hs'ers into 2hs get another blade from a mage, make new 1hs, go turn in 2hs and bad get new 1hs'ers and new 2hs'ers loot yer old corpse in the arena... got 2 2hs'ers and 4 1hs'ers =p<br />
<br />
no real useful point, just kinda cool maybe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/shrug.<br />
<br />
a pair of 14/24 weapons that are essentially taunting blow on a shitty resist still isn't worth doing that pain in the ass quest for.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised there are still epics left in the game after the new droga opened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Be interesting to see what augmentations they can have... could we be lucky enough to get a delay reduction and harder to resist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">only a matter of time b4 SOE fixes it *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pic should be attached...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nah...they won't &quot;fix&quot; it...it's a part of the new melee balancing, don'cha know? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's really moot anyhow.  Agro still sucks even with 2 x red blade vs CHoS/SotB.  I tried dual red epic in LDON, but quickly switched back to the Droga weaps when the mob ping ponged all over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A +3 damage augment, making it a 17/24 hate proccing weapon wouldn't be too shabby.<br />
<br />
Nor would a second hate inducing proc, if they fired off at different times. Say something like a 0.0 stun or something with disease counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only problem being that you are better off putting that +3 dmg on a CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Originally posted by Draxus Diablus <br />
The only problem being that you are better off putting that +3 dmg on a CHoS.  <br />
<br />
Yup, any augment that you might consider adding to an epic sword, would serve you better by adding it to a CHOS instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">now...   if you could only combine the two red blades, or the two blue blades together to form an AWESOME lightsaber!!<br />
<br />
so powa~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
btw:<br />
&quot;Classes are not that out of balance --AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That should be no problem.  Just drag your guild around to do the warrior epic twice.  &gt;:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">anyone try giving the old epics to that guy in pok talking about weapons befitting a warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Epics have a single slot 4 arrangement as is standard with just about all other weapons pre elemental/time.  The only three damage augmentation I've seen posted so far was Time (slot 8) only. Wouldn't hold my breath on bringing the epic back into vogue I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Carrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ok i dident read al them but what can ya do if you already did your turn in?......this would be awsome and sony screw up now =P but hey who cares</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">2 blue blades would be nice when trying to skill up fletching.  All that dex would really help and no more begging for a dex buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So, no Type 5 slot on the epics.  No way to actually give them a decent ratio again.<br />
<br />
Kinda pisses me off.  A perfect opportunity for SoE to let us upgrade weapons that were a bitch to get and they don't do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Silly question: if you hand in your scabbard and real <br />
<br />
2hs do you get the scabbard back though?<br />
<br />
Kinda nervous about handing that bag in,  still want be be able <br />
<br />
to get my 2hs back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">When you turn in the scabbard and 2hs, you get back both 1hs and the 2hs ( with augmentable slot 1, type 4, --proc types-- ) and your scabbard is not returned. They did this so you would not have to combine the 1hs to make the 2hs cause that effectively destroys them to summon the 2hs, thus augmenting something you commonly destroy would have been a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">As for no type 5 on epics, there is no type 5 on any non LDoN weapons.  If they were to put them on epics, then they would have to go through and add various types for all old items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Oreana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just browsing this thread, so if I missed something, forgive me :D .<br />
<br />
Is it possible to put something like, say, an Ykesha aug on your blue swords? The added dex of a pair of these weapons, coupled with an aggro aug could create great aggro.<br />
<br />
Oreana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It's not hard to max Dex with a shaman or chanter in your group. I play an ogre with no point in dex, and he's maxed when buffed by my 56 shammie. You would get far better results putting an aggro proc on the red blade than the blue. And even better results ditching the epic altogether and augmenting some Droga weapons or a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Drakshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OK<br />
<br />
So I have two red blades, 2 blue blades and 1 2hs. Equiping 2 reds or blues don't seem to yield stats x 2. Could this mean that only one of the reds will proc?  Anybody else experiment with this?<br />
<br />
Drakshar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>kiras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes you do get twice the stats.<br />
<br />
Easy check.<br />
<br />
Put both reds on.  Check ATK.<br />
<br />
Put one blue on.  Check ATK.<br />
<br />
Put second blue on.  Check ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Does this still work as the orginal poster stated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Last time I checked, it still worked.</div></div><hr />
