3 time enabled guilds<br />
<br />
3 additional guilds in elemental planes<br />
<br />
2 guilds on the verge of breaking in to ele planes<br />
<br />
<br />
On too many nights the only choice for a raid is Inny, BB or LDON. HAHAH, have even been checking 10ring war spawn on bad nights /sigh.<br />
<br />
Can you feel the walls closing in? There has always been competition for spawns but i am seeing compression in the tiers that was never there before. Less mobs to go around means less LOL customer satisfaction. If you were SOE  what tactics would you choose to remedy?</div></div><hr />

Not to mention quite a few VT enabled guilds.<br />

I'd say its crowded but I like it, there's alot of raid targets out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Time = 2 guilds (1 American and 1 German/European)<br />
Elemental = 5 guilds (2 American, 1 Spanish, 2 German/European)<br />
Close to elemental = only 1 American guild that I know of may be there soon and possibly a German guild<br />
VT = Probably 7-8 guilds or more enabled but not sure who all does it regularly (we do it on off nights when it's up)<br />
<br />
I really wish there wasn't so much competition personally. On patch days probably 70-80 percent of the stuff we go after is killed by European guilds before we have sufficient raid #s. We get whatever's left. I can't really blame them as we'd do the same thing. But it seems like every time the spawns start to get on our time, we lose them to either an ill timed server crash/reset or patches :p .</div></div><hr />

- 2 Time guilds (one that has killed Quarm, one that just entered within the last week or two)<br />
- 1 other Elemental guild besides those two (my guild)<br />
<br />
Fire and Water are the only things in high demand...Air/Earth are usually always up if we get bored.</div></div><hr />

The 2 american guilds have a deal in place to share time, which works out quite well, as well as deals for elem planes.<br />
<br />
There are 2 other guilds in elem planes, one that has been in a few months and one that just got in yesterday. Tunare isn't as crowded as it was in the past, or at least there is more room. During velious and luclin, the overcrowding could really be felt, I know that our one powerful euro guild, moved servers cause they were sandwiched between an asian and american guilds and nothing was ever alive for them.</div></div><hr />

Two Time enabled guilds<br />
Three Elemental enabled<br />
One nearing elemental access.<br />
And like four or five guilds clusterfucking in VT.<br />

Its not so bad. As long as my guild has something to do I'm happy, and we can usually find a decent target. I'm rather happy I don't have time access, but I hope they hand out asprin with that flag &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Edit: Not quite sure what I was thinking when I said four.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 Guilds in Time - one U.S., one Asian<br />
<br />
4 Guilds in Elementals - unclear when any of them will break into time.<br />
<br />
Odd thing about the guilds in the elementals on my server, for the most part they seem to be struggling to retain members and progress.  We have a European guild that keeps breaking its teeth on Fennin Ro for some reason, despite having sufficient forces and equipment (they have monopolized VT for months now).  Another guild downed Coirnav 4 months ago and has been stumped by Rathe ever since.  And a third seems unable to deal with the Spider script in Air, leaving them stalled on Xegony.  <br />
<br />
All of this is counter to my expectations - I thought the Elementals would be like VT, much easier than the gatekeeper (RZ) that kept you from them.  And now SoE is tweaking the 4 gods to make them tougher - Xegony got a boost in that last quick server down.<br />
<br />
Seems clear that they are trying to keep the number of Time guilds down, at least till they cobble together the next raid expansion.</div></div><hr />

Outside PoTime flagged guilds, there are like 4 or 5 in elementals, and my guild is on its way there... giant clusterf*ck in there I've heard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed servers from Tallon Zek about a month ago.  A month ago there was 1 guild which just had broke into Time and two other guilds which just had gained elementals access.  Hardly overcrowded there, hehe.  If you don't want to be on an overcrowded server, and you don't mind being griefed on a regular basis, go there.  :)<br />
<br />
I am playing a mid-level character on a blue server now.  Mid-level zones are not even marginally crowded and targets are never lacking.  I prefer the mid-level game to the high-level game....  so once I hit 65 with this char and start to break into elementals I will prolly start another newb char.  :p</div></div><hr />

If your in time your in time B.  Time A is nothing, its a museum of scenes from PoP, thats it.  There is nothing in the zone besides portals into time B until you kill Quarm.</div></div><hr />

Create high end instanced content. And not the pretend high end instanced content that LDoN offers. Some real deal instanced raid level encounters, with a few hooks to keep that segment of the gaming population banging its head against it for at least 6 months.<br />

You know, your standard Sony reaction.</div></div><hr />

My apologies; as I'm sure you noticed, I haven't been there before.  We have one guild that is way deep into Time, and two others that have barely scratched the surface.</div></div><hr />

Two guilds and a two guild alliance well into the Planes<br />
My own guild just entered Sol Ro with another closing in<br />
And all of these guilds plus another are keyed for Vex Thal<br />
<br />
The intresting thing about our server is how bloated the rosters are. When one of the previous top guilds on our server imploded everyone went on a recruiting binge. Its not unusual to see The Relentless, one of the TimeB guilds, having THIRTY clerics online.</div></div><hr />

Two in time. Circle of Legends as a guild is not there. They have some members that were flagged by Arch Overseers, but the guild does not have a flagged raiding force.</div></div><hr />
