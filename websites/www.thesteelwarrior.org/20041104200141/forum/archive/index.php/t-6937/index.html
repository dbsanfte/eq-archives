<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hoping to get criticism to what I have, and what I can get. I've been farming CT for cash cuz I'm saving for a BoC (like every single other warrrior, hehe). I'm with a guild that has been smacking Luclin and a lot of first couple Tiers of PoP. Mostly, as you can see in my magelo all the things I want are from LDoN's bought from merchants.. except weapons. Also, criticize on the things I want as future things... if I can get better or if they are fine as they are. Thanks, hope that's good enough info to get this going. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd suggest you do the Strength of the Elements (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6989) and Loyalist Shield of Honor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15971) quests. They'd both be good upgrades for you and trivial for you to do, the shield can be duo'd with nearly any healer all the way up until the final encounter, you'd just need a bit more DPS and some special weapons (which are magic and droppable, so you can just buy them and dual wield em). The elements quest is pretty easy to, you just have to tag along on some old world epic raids to get the pieces you need, or just bring a solid group to each zone and get the pieces you need, whatever works.<br />
<br />
I'd say that your weapons are fine and the 400k+ that you'd spend on a BoC would be better spent on other upgrades, such as:<br />
<br />
Helmet of Rallos Zek<br />
Amygdalan Chain Mask (spelling may be incorrect)<br />
Ornate Gauntlets (Or Warlords Steel Gauntlets)<br />
Sell the Sash and swap it out for a Soulscream Belt(better stats)<br />
<br />
You should be able to afford all of that, and the other slots should be replaced with Royal Attendant armor, if you have the points to do so with. I'd also suggest augmenting your weapons with ykesha augments as well, that way you'll have 4 procs and all of them will stun.</div></div><hr />
