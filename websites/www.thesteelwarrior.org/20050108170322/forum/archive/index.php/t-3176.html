Humm well I guess the 2nd one will do more total DPS, as it has a 13 hit instead of 12. Well the question is if both weapons were the same, say 19/12 and the only difference was the proc on the first one and no proc on the 2nd which would do more DPS? Assume both are in main hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason I wonder is becuase if you watch your toon when the item does proc he has some kind of animation and it appears to me during this time period that he is not swinging, is this loss of time spent swinging worsen the dps or not, or does the toon still continue to swing even after a successful proc as if there was no proc?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I been reading a ton about agro on this forum and I thinks this guy is correct:<br />

 Red epics are a &quot;decent&quot; to &quot;nice&quot; weapon however :<br />
- the crappy ratio<br />
- the crappy delay<br />
- the crappy resisted proc<br />
<br />
Makes them subpar weapons compared to what can easily<br />
be obtained for less effort, and give much better result.<br />
<br />
As for some other info :<br />
<br />
- Bard melee is gimp, give a bard BoC/SoD ands he still wont draw agro.<br />
Their dps is pathetic, they dont really taunt/kick/disarm.<br />
However that doesnt mean they cant keep agro if needed (twist 4 dots)<br />
As for slow/debuff etc etc, they lowered the agro of all bard songs.<br />
To prevent bardsplat on every single raid during a pull.<br />
<br />
- DPS is universally the best source of agro for any melee.<br />
(Since spells arent accounted for). Get a clue if you cant Ebay for one.<br />
<br />
A 110 dps warrior will keep agro off a 180 dps rogue ..<br />
Why ? Proximity/Taunt/Kick/Disarm vs Evade/Distance<br />
<br />
A 110 dps warrior will keep agro off a 220 dps wizard ..<br />
Why ? Proximity/Taunt/Kick/Disarm vs Concussion/Distance<br />
<br />
This is why all MT get a small head start, avatar/fero<br />
and everyone stays at max range.<br />
<br />
Procs are not needed for tanking <br />
<br />
Where do procs come into play ? AGRO LOCK<br />
<br />
2 Fine Steel with 1000 agro procs would probably be good for tanking.<br />
However if you dont procs (luck) and if ur procs are not well<br />
spread over time (luck) your agro will be close to nothing.<br />
<br />
Get 2 20/20 weapons without proc. I'm willing to bet<br />
they will just own 2x 1000 Agro Fine Steel in agro Quality.<br />
<br />
I have a 48/32 (BoW) and end up MTing often.<br />
During many fights i've been able to keep agro (notice keep) and<br />
let DPS do their job with ZERO, ZERO procs.<br />
<br />
PROCS help you to LOCK AGRO. DPS helps you keep it <br />
<br />
While the difference may seem subtile its actually immense.<br />
<br />
I'll trade 50/30 EB for 65/30 any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Beeing able to say &quot;LOCKED BURN&quot; is indeed nice.<br />
But having 5 to 50 people just waiting for you to proc in order<br />
to do their job is not efficient.<br />
<br />
True sometimes you need that proc to save the day.<br />
<br />
But i prefer steady medium agro (which means everyone can adapt to me once and for all)<br />
To great Streaky agro (which means they have to pray i proc or go splat and cant do their job)<br />
<br />

All this random stuff with the procs is not for me, I have a chanter so I have like a Voice spell (10percent exta hate) on my warrior all the time now (and 50percnet less hate on the puller/chanter - pulls with slow), thus I am taking the 19/13 no proc better dps over the 20/13 Hammer (Keeping the SoTB 19/12 in offhand err humm maybe the hammer has better dps then the sword in offhand - guess I better looks into that)... <br />
<br />
Ok SoL in main and CHoS in offhand....</div></div><hr />

You continue to attack like normal, even though it doesn't look like you are.  So you don't lose any DPS.</div></div><hr />

SOL is that shortblade of ligthing ?  I would do CHOS main and SOL offhand.  The proc on the hammer is good for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">13/20 + stun proc is MUCH BETTER for aggro than 13/19 and no proc.<br />
<br />
The DPS difference between the two is insignificant.... and a stun proc is as good as it gets for aggro with the exception of EB.<br />
<br />
While DPS is a very important part of aggro, and is much more reliable than procs, you need to weigh the difference in DPS against the value of the proc.<br />
<br />
In your case, you are choosing an insignificant DPS advantage over a very good proc... and that is a mistake.  If the DPS difference was significant, then it might be a good idea.<br />
<br />
Pure DPS does create and hold aggro.  (I had great success for a long time tanking with my TSBS strictly because of DPS aggro.)  However, that only carries you so far.  Over time, casters that I grouped with (and other melee) began to do enough damage that the pure DPS on the TSBS no longer was enough.  With the damage that casters are doing in today's game, you need an extremely high end DPS setup (and a lot of offensive AAs) in order to get by on straight DPS.<br />
<br />
I notice that you list weapon delay first, and then the damage (19/13 for 13 damage/19 delay).  It is common to list them in the order of damage/delay (or 13/19 in this case).  I point this out because I am afraid you are misunderstanding what emilia was posting.  When she says that she can keep aggro based on straight DPS with ber blade of war (48/32) she is talking about a 48 damage, 32 delay weapon... not 32 damage and 48 delay.  A look at her magelo also shows that she has all offensive AAs.  Unless you have access to weapons of that quality, you'll be needing to rely on procs... because you will not be doing enough DPS to get by on DPS aggro alone.  13/19 in your main hand and anything in your off hand won't keep aggro off your caster group.<br />
<br />
All this random stuff with the procs is not for me<br />
In that case, you made a MAJOR mistake by choosing to create a warrior to tank for your group.  Warriors are entirely dependent on random procs and taunt success rates for aggro.  If you want &quot;on demand&quot; aggro control, then you should have made a paladin or SK.  Warriors have some things going for us... but pushbutton aggro control isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Library section there is a thread called the Aggro Weapon Compendium. This should answer most of your questions about aggro weapons. Another section contains Warrior Usable haste items.<br />
<br />
There are numerous threads about armor upgrades, haste calculation, maximum haste, Bard overhaste, etc.<br />
<br />
While it's perfectly fine to post any questions you may have, many of them have indicated a lack of familiarity with the class. It's possible that by doing some reading you will learn things that you haven't thought to ask about like:<br />
<br />
1. Which slot is the best for haste.<br />
2. STA or HP's?<br />
3. What determines proc rate.<br />
In addition, many Warriors include their Magelos which is an invaluable resource.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bards are coded to have less aggro than every other class or else they would have the most aggro of any class because their songs fade after a tick or so and have to be constantly reapplied.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I was serious when I said a SK would be better to box. They have Direct +x hate spells that you could probably hotkey so you know exactly how much aggro they generate in so much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree with Varaho that an SK would be more efficient for XP Multiboxing.<br />
Since he can lock agro easy,and multitank, good for burning down stuff.<br />
A paladin too would be great (LoH &amp; group heals help a lot with 4 wiz)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, having a warrior and 4 wizards would mean<br />
that killing mobs with higher dps will be a lot easier.<br />
(Think BoT tower minis, Vadynn later, etc etc).<br />
Thus farm upgrades easier than with the other 2.<br />
<br />
So basically :<br />
- Warrior = Mediocre Agro, High defence, good for Named hunting<br />
- SK = Great Agro, Good defence, Good for burning down stuff<br />
- Paladin = Great Agri, Good defence, Great backup healer.<br />
<br />
If sam wanted a &quot;Grind tank&quot; then probably he didnt make the best choice.<br />
If he wanted a &quot;Named tank&quot; then he made the best choice.<br />
<br />
LDoN sure screws up the &quot;Named Tank&quot; idea, but still cant<br />
compete with various named in &quot;loot per hour of effort&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for the DPS &amp; Agro ..... Just looked at the magelo link.<br />
You should be ok for a long long time with these 2 weapons<br />
(Slap on 2 ykesha or 2 Anger3, and no more worries)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slap on 2 ykesha or 2 Anger3, and no more worries <br />
<br />
So you think it would be more beneficial to put another proc on a CHoS / SotB then it would to put a Ykesha / Anger3 on a faster more dps weapon?<br />
<br />
Say a Falcion of Storm (12/18) or ShortBlade of Light (13/19) or wow, even a Disembowler (12+3/20) and SplitBlade of Destruction<br />
<br />
Are the two procs &gt; higher dps weapon or is the higher dps only mariginally &gt; two procs ??<br />
<br />
So SplitBlade of Destruction+Disembolwer (w/ ykesha) OR CHoS+SotB (w/ two procs total) ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It comes down to personal choices, not &quot;its best&quot; both have their uses.<br />
<br />
Take a 16/20 vs 12/20 DD180+Stun .....<br />
<br />
Of course the 16/20 will dish out a lot of dmg thus steady agro.<br />
The 12/20 will agro less, but get 2 3 procs in a row and the <br />
mob will turn and stick on you like glue.<br />
<br />
Adding procs (the same procs) wont change anything because<br />
(if u accept proc rate will remain the same)<br />
<br />
You will end up with exactly the same dilema<br />
16/20 DD100+Stun vs 12/20 DD180+Stun DD100+Stun<br />
<br />
Exept that the 16/20 weapon will be getting a huge boost in &quot;burst agro&quot;<br />
Since now it has a proc.<br />
<br />
The 12/20 by doubling its proc rate will proc more often.<br />
Thus the time between procs will lessen. <br />
Resulting in better overall and less spiky agro, but with awesone<br />
agro spike capacity.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate procs, because i am a true believer of &quot;Murphy's Law&quot;<br />
(aka, if the shit can hit the fan, it WILL happen).<br />
Hence you will NEVER proc when u need it the most.<br />
<br />
Sometimes hitting &quot;Hard &amp; Fast&quot; wont help you save Wiz01.<br />
Because you'll need 4/5/6/7 seconds to built back the agro gap.<br />
1 or 2 procs will make the mob turn on you.<br />
<br />
On the  other hand if u hit &quot;Weak &amp; Slow&quot; your useless.<br />
Because Wiz01 has to wait for you to proc in order to start nuking.<br />
And procs are not that reliable.<br />
<br />
I spend most of my time raiding, so snap agro isnt an issue.<br />
Agroed caster = dead caster<br />
Need agro ? = Press AE taunt<br />
<br />
XP groups dont work that way.<br />
<br />
Now to the real question ....<br />
14/18 DD100+Stun or  12/19 DD179+Stun DD100+Stun<br />
<br />
Well it depends on your playstyle, People with who you hunt.<br />
If i could i would take both and put the 14/18 mainhand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps: the same goes for procs ... Anger3 or Ykesha  ?<br />
Imo Anger3 is better for LDoN, Ykesha doesnt seem to piss them off much.<br />
On the other hand ...  Stun is an agro magnet on the old world.<br />
<br />
Then why not one of Each ? Its down to personal preferences again.<br />
But Ykesha adds DPS, while anger does not. Etc Etc Etc<br />
<br />
There isnt really &quot;the golden solution&quot; (exept when u cant choose)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I still have the 3 weapons (not much demand for SotB in bazzar heh). <br />
<br />
I made the warrior for takeing down named (spicifically Diaku Suppier - I try him with my caster group and I die in no time, then my caster group added another persons warrior and the encounter was basically trivial), and for LDoN. After failing on nine LDoN trials in a row it just became to clear that time limit really hurts all caster groups which just plain have to med. I was killing mobs good enough and with more time could have done the job but time just running out..... <br />
<br />
Don't forget I am use to haveing my WIZARD tank, getting summoned isnt going to kill my wizards outright in exp grinding, I dont have to lock agro as fast as you think (also I can get 7percnet AA PER PULL doing PBAOE in PoN on like 10 banshee and wraiths per pull), I heal with supernal light 1.8 second casting time, wizards have shields, now with a warrior as tank instead of wizard its almost laughable how much less work my cleric has to do. <br />
<br />
Also its the chanter that is the puller, with a spell that reduces his agro generation by 50percent, and the warrior has a spell that increases his agro generation 10percent. Given the only pull spell I use is slow (ususaly don't need to tash) the agro lock needs only be taken away from a single spell cast by a chanter, at 50percent of its normal agro.... Not a hard task for a warrior with taunt (level 55 mobs almost always turn on the warrior at the first taunt). <br />
<br />
Agro Lock, after getting it in the first place will occur with DPS cause as long as the cleric has mana the warrior is alive, If I am doing a named that I can heal on faster then the mob can damage the warrior, I can just tank with the warrior until the mob is like 72 percent. If the 3 wizards all do the same DPS (I have avoided working on crits so that they are consistant) then each will do 23percnet of the total HP damage to the mob, while the warrior did 28percnet. Under those conditions (warrior doing more total damage then any wizard) its all but impossible to get the wizards summonded. The wizards also have ways to reduece their agro with concussion spell, and use of tears, and most wizards say crits dont add to ago. Plus the warrior gets taunt and 10percnet extra agro from his damage, plus proximity agro, plus its going to take a while to get the mob to 72 percent so the offhand will proc the stun at some point.... <br />
<br />
I just plain dont need some random burst agro generator. <br />
<br />
That split blade was for sale last night for a dirt cheap 29K, but my funds is zero dang. Ill probably go for that and the Shorblade of Lightning, which I have.<br />
<br />
So for now its the Shortblade of Lighting main and CHoS in off....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can just tank with the warrior until the mob is like 72 percent.<br />
<br />
No need to be that carefull  :)<br />
<br />
Usually Pull with the war, disc while the mob is inc.<br />
CH during the pull (if its a high dps mob)<br />
The second CH lands, AE taunt if needed (priceless cleric savior get it asap)<br />
At mmm ... 95% start  the slow cycle (tash , wait a bit , slow)<br />
Around 90% u can start slowly nuking.<br />
At 85% u should be able to nuke &quot;normally&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not &quot;the guide&quot; but should work for most encounters.<br />
<br />
Or could pull with slow, but thats a dead ench 95% of the time.<br />
Even with AE taunt. :D</div></div><hr />
