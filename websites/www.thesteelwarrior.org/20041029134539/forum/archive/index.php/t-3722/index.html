<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally updated my Magelo. <br />
<br />
I had played this guy to 52 and then quit for 6 months and gave everything away.  Couldn't get anything back when I started again, so what I have now represents a lot of time in EK killing spiders.<br />
<br />
I'm unguilded and likely to stay that way, so mostly fighting in pick-up groups in LDoN and elsewhere.   I have a couple K in the bank and a few K more in sellable stuff (that's not selling well at the moment).  I can always kill more Crag Spiders if necessary. <br />
<br />
The AC shown is a little lower than what I actually have, but pretty close.  I have a couple of 5 sta augments that don't show up either, but basically everything is fairly accurate. <br />
<br />
Looking for any advice anyone is willing to give, but specifically  - <br />
A) Whether or not I'm ok at the moment. <br />
B) What I should look to upgrade right now<br />
C) What I should be looking for as I level. <br />
<br />
I know I still have a couple of really sucky slots. <br />
<br />
Also hoping you will tell me I can live with the SoTB/Frostbringer combo for a few more levels (or go to the GSoT when I hit 55).  A CHoS would be a chunk of change and I'd like to put that off if I can, but I'll bite the bullet and save for it if people think it's necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Combo is good but you'd be neglecting skill ups in 1HB which is not a big deal I guess...<br />
<br />
A quick upgrade is Clattering Bone Neck.. Which sells for 2k on avg.  Also Cloak of Maelstrom getting cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Is Guts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stats on waist and hands = 25 ac  haste and a crap buff ... lose 2ac but get better, combo is good atm, Gsot when you hit lvl its fun :)<br />
<br />
Then work on right ear, shoulders, back, neck, rings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Matsuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">unless you get a chos, you will stick with gsot at 55, trust me .<br />
<br />
&lt;~ 55 warrior with gsot and sotb/non chos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still use my GSoT instead of CHoS and SotB, on command from my cleric, enchanter, and shaman friends. If I save for Anger 3 augs I will switch back though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rathsar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Suggest you ditch some of the 'AC gear' and go for hp's.<br />
<br />
Chet Bone Shield is not he best, suggest Dire Wolf Hide Cloak for 500pp or so.<br />
<br />
Ditch Grif Earring in Favour of Black Sapphire Electrum for more hp's - outlay might be zero or you might even be able to trade.<br />
<br />
Face - Grobb Hide Mask is much better and only 200pp on a good day.<br />
<br />
Enchanted Dwarven Plate Bracer sells for few hundred plat if you are lucky - temp upgrade for the Scavenging one.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Gaunts - sell them and Buy Worked Zathril (around 1K on my server if you are patient) - effect on cobalt gaunts is poor.<br />
<br />
Generally as you are no doubt finding out, mobs at high end smack you about whether you have a few more points ac or not and peeps will ask what your HP are far more often.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it my fellow Dwarf.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the suggestions and information. <br />
<br />
I should be able to implement most, if not all of those with my current budget. <br />
<br />
I finally dinged 55 last night and used the GSoT for the first time.  I was quite happy with it.  My 2HB sucks (I know, I know), but it procs like mad and I got 45 skill increases in an hour (47 to 92) so hopefully the skill won't be a problem for long. (and I held aggro quite nicely). <br />
<br />
If I could feel 100% confident that the staff would be all I need for MT work for a while, I would consider selling the two 1-handers, buying a WMBS for dps work and putting the change into other equipment upgrades.   I guess I'm still not clear on whether 2 handers or dual-wield will give me better dps at my level. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kremib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am level 59 atm and all I use is the GSOT. I think you will be fine with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ahem.<br />
<br />
What if, say....Your 2hb was only like 200 because you neglected it and stuff, um totally hypothetically and things.<br />
<br />
Would your Agro suffer a ton vs. 2 1hs at 250?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for my, erm...friend the warrior guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The GSoT should be plenty for a while, but I wouldnt sell your SotB just yet.  I would, however, ditch the frosty as soon as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In regards to the GSoT..max your 2hb ASAP and you will feel like you're cheating when you use it, hehe. Holds agro very very well. At 65 still using in BoT and anywhere else that riposte damage can be a problem. Use on the Bosses in LDoN assasinate missions too with great results.<br />
<br />
Aside from gear you can buy, you are a nice level to go to UP and try for some very nice armor upgrades off the Gantru Raldukans. (This will take a little time bro, dont head out there thinking you gonna get half a set of armor in a night. Used to be much easier.  Not as easy as camping Elysian, hehe). Note: if you win a Helm, bank it in shared bank slot before returning to UP cause odds are you will see several Helms before a Bp or Legs. You can add to your cash stockpile with any extras.  If you get out there with strong group, you can even try tackling Radiir/Spirit of Radiir for Shadowheart-&gt; 11/17 piercer with nice stats that would take an anger aug nicely.<br />
<br />
Also great level to go to Vexsar with the right group. That Kylong Darkmail sells nicely, and would provide upgrades for you in several slots.<br />
<br />
Finally, keep plugging away at LDoN. Provides some solid drops, cash flow is ok, and never too early to start saving points.<br />
<br />
Good Hunting</div></div><hr />
