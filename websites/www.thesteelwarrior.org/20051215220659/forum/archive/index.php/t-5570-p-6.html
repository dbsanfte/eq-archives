Daabu,<br />
I can confirm there was no one else with these types of procs but me. All procs logged are mine.<br />

I followed Arathena's suggestion and went through the log looking for time snap procs with no associated swing, and guess what? There's tons of them, to be more precise, 388 instances. All of them looking like these:<br />

<br />
etc.<br />
The occurrences happen every few minutes apart of non stop fighting.<br />
<br />
With this newfound data I'd support that it is in fact, only possible to proc once per round, mainhand and offhand of course considered being separate.<br />
Obviously only the possibility to swing need exist, a failed dual-wield still allows offhand to proc.</div></div><hr />
