<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok guys, I am running out of ideas. I have been upgrading to most of the best tradeable items available and I have run out of ideas. There are a few items I am still working on, but due to their rarity I haven't landed them yet. I am working on a 2nd acid bracer and an elem bow so those slots are pretty well taken care of.<br />
<br />
So I am looking for upgrade ideas with the following in mind:<br />
<br />
1. Plat is not a problem, I can just save up if something is expensive.<br />
<br />
2. No drop stuff has to be 1 groupable. I might be able to get 2 groups together but I would probably have to roll on the loot in that case. Not out of the question, just not as easy to do.<br />
<br />
3. I am not interested in a BoC yet. To get a 1h combo better (BoC+SoD) than GSoT would cost a bloody fortune.<br />
<br />
4. Ornate molds are pretty much out of the question because plate molds are never for sale on my server. I would love ornate legs, BP, and arms, but it's just not likely to happen.<br />
<br />
Keeping that in mind, is there something I have missed or an item that is considerably better?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For neck, you might try to find: Black Plated Collar (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=8787)<br />
<br />
For shoulders, you could go with:   Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=13687)<br />
<br />
Rings: Steel Ring of Earthen Resiliance (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29044)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah wandor; dalzhel 'bout summed it up there...you got too beefy sh*t as it is and only real upgrades that are significant are 2+ group encounters. a real timsink would be them chardok shoulders/ring ( spirit wracked cords/regal band? ) but that's just a lot of time to do.<br />
<br />
i'd go with util clickies next tho. dunno, invis item, err, stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOooOoOoOoo! Black Plated Collar looks very nice. I am working on getting the parts to put together an Earth ring as well. I love those shoulders but the morons on my server try to sell em for 100k!!!! No way is 16ac worth 100k.<br />
<br />
Guess I can start working on the clickies. How is this for irony - the only clicky I have is a cobalt bracer ... on a dwarf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For face slot, perhaps Amygdalan's Chain Mask (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27867)  would be a good thing to check into.<br />
<br />
Also, a way to get more hp out of your haste item would be to go with Belt of Raging Nature (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16151)  and Hierophant's Cloak (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1622) <br />
<br />
Other than that, you look pretty set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chuckled a bit when I saw the Cobalt Bracer on your dwarf, but 80% of the raids my small guild does, I go from group to group shrinking everone but Clerics and Enchanters ( they need the visibility over people ). I love mine, and it really bugs the heck out of my shaman friend when I shrink his ikky arse and that huge drogmor $$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can look into the crafted elemental bows:  stonewood, featherwood, obsidianwood, primordeal.<br />
<br />
I missed out on a black plated collar that was for sale earlier this week.  Just didn't have enough cash lying around (and I still don't, but getting close in case another one turns up).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If plat's not a problem ... Stonewood Compound Bow. AoB and you'll make the ranger twinks drool.<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />

Hardest part is Master Yael, but he's duable with a strong group.</div></div><hr />
