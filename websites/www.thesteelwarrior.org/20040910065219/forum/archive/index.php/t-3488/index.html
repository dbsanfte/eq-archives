<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Give us a new skill that we can start training in that dead space of around level 46, call it Arcane Trigger. By becoming more familiar with the arcane nature of our magical weapons, we are able to increase that chance that it's magical properties may be triggered. In game effect would be an increased chance that a weapon held in the primary slot will proc, culminating in about a 95% chance of a single proc when the skill is trained to 200. Put this skill on a 24 second timer so it cannot be overused. This could be even further limited to a specific group of procs (ie, EB proc,planar stun, etc).<br />
<br />
If this is not to be a skill, then make it a class specific AA, with three levels of increasing chances and number of procs.<br />
<br />
To solve aggro at a distance, give warriors a quest item like the Bloody Ancille's Pouch that allows them to summon warrior only no drop +hate proc arrows for an inexpensive component.<br />
<br />
I still like the discipline spell gem idea too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After looking at several ideas, I think we should start to develop a litmus test against which to test these ideas as to whether they can break or trivialize the game.<br />
<br />
1) Is the idea as simple as possible (does not contain convoluted leaps in logic, etc)?<br />
<br />
2) Does the idea fit into the class with regards to roleplay? Does it make sense for the class to have this ability?<br />
<br />
3) Does the idea have a chance of failure so as to add a certain element of risk?<br />
<br />
4) Does the idea take into account for situation in which this ability should not be in use? Can the ability be turned off or not used when it is unnecessary?<br />
<br />
5) How does this idea stack against other classes? Does it overpower the class being fixed?</div></div><hr />
