<br />
So, i decided to reactiviate him in Mid-July, he started out with Defiance/Goranga Spiked Club, and some crusty at an orange into 53 =P So, he has came along way(and causing my bank account to become somewhat limited now =P)<br />
<br />
Here is his magelo: My Magleo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=749314)<br />
<br />
Is there any upgrades that i could get for relatively cheap(50k budget) I know about the Valorium rings, which i will get soon, just not paying 7k a piece for them =P<br />
<br />
Also, will bring him on the next 2-3 AoW kills to get faction hit for CoV and do BoB's, and i have another highly polished gem for another bloodmetal earring, waiting to find an ornage diamond under 4k(got first one at 1500) =P<br />
<br />
<br />
Whew, done =)</div></div><hr />
