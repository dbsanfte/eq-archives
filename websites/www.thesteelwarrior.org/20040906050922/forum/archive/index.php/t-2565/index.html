We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />
thats from live site, how is a discipline change really going to fix melees? and true to the classic SoE style<br />
<br />
&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt; *Polymer* Are there new disciplines for non casters coming out with LDoN?<br />
&lt;Hartsman-SOE&gt; (Rich is grabbing this one...)<br />
&lt;Rwaters-SOE&gt; New features that cover class balance (like disciplines) are the kind of things we try not to tie to expansions. We definitely feel that disciplines need some updates and improvements, and it's something we'll be doing as a free live update instead of expecting you to buy a box to balance your class.<br />
&lt;Rwaters-SOE&gt; &lt;d&gt;<br />
<br />
ummmmm planes of power weapons? isnt that class balance in a box?<br />

<br />
it seems that all they care about balancing is the end game armor and weapons, looks like they could give a rats ass about how hard it is to attain them, or how rare they are to the point that only 5% of the customer base will ever see 1, let alone own it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fuck no.<br />
<br />
Leave my old zones alone. I used to exp in Nurga, and now it's impossible to solo at my level.</div></div><hr />
