<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diminia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.  I would like to ask for any suggestions for my gear.  I dont have much pp, if any at all.  My magelo is not up to date so I will update it either today or tomorrow.  But most of what is on the current magelo is what I am wearing.  Any tips on better armor for little pp would be great.  <br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pogi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your equip is fine although you might want to change your off-hand 10/34 is really weak you could get better ratio fairly cheep on the wallet.  The reason why I say your equip is fine is because it is for lvl 25.  I started playing everquest march of 99 and I didn't even have full bronze till I was lvl 35 and I think I broke 1000 hp around that time to.  Your doing well just get some lvl's worry about gear later.  LDON is extremely easy at your lvl and the items you get from there should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1ac = 6hp = 2 sta. Run with that. Don't worry much about other stats right now; they're worth something, but not a whole lot. Try picking up a jarsath trident (11/22) or a wurmslayer (25/40, primary only). That should be fine for weapons for about 20 levels. Come back when you're 40ish for more aggro advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diminia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doh...haven't updated my level.  I am currently 32.  Sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you get Gothic Steel armor that will carry you for a while till more items with higher rec. levels have their full or at least almost full stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">stuff is fine; my warrior ( now level 39 and climbing ! :D ) has about the same deals ( minus Brutul's haste cloak he threw at me ) ... you're about at the level where ( untwinked ) you can't solo anything except for bixies so get in them groups !! groups and new hunting grounds will get ya some nice stuff; and you're aout the lvel to go exploring the realms of LDoN so rack up them points for upgrades. the gothic armor is dual slooted and you can net some decent gains off dropped augments and save up points towards new gear down the road.<br />
<br />
overall your best bet is that gothic armor stuff; nice AC and decent stats usable for a warrior. Not that you're hurting too too much besides that bracer; that definately needs an upgrade :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diminia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Magelo is updated.  Thought I was 32 but I'm 31 hehe.  Thank you Gaspie for your help with gear.  I went hunting afterwards and it made alot of difference.  My group had a pally and an SK and neither one could get agro away from me.<br />
<br />
Ok enough with that.  Time to search these boards for info.  take care and thank you to all who replied.</div></div><hr />
