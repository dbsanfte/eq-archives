Unfortunately my video card won't arrive until later tonight. And *hopefully* EQ2 will come in today, it hasn't yet &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Any clue if the servers go live when the countdown ends? And...will everybody who preordered get their game by then? heh</div></div><hr />

Servers must be up.  Friend of mine instant messaged me telling me how it's the best game he's ever played.  Interface, interaction, controls, how it feels and looks etc.<br />
<br />
Not getting it myself just yet, I'll check it out a little at his house tomarrow, then make my decision.  I have years invested into a group of characters that I box in EQ1, and have a guild I don't want to just up and leave, and really don't even get enough time to play period...  so I'm definately not going to be playing both games, when I barely have the time for the one.  EQ2 is gonna have to truely be as wicked as my friend is telling me to get me to completely drop everything I've worked for and am working towards in EQ1.<br />
<br />
The hype from my friend about it being the best thing he's ever played before won't sway me... I need to find out for myself.  He was in awe over the look and feel, comparing it to the graphical splender that is Far Cry.  But the thing is, he's only seen me play a tiny bit of Far Cry and has never actually played nor owned any game like that before.  So while the awesome graphics of EQ2 have him drooling that this is the best game he's ever played, it's nothing new to me.  I'm used to the most recent game technologies, and won't be swayed into playing simply cause it looks better than anything &quot;he's&quot; played to date.</div></div><hr />

It's still a beautiful game, but (to me at least) that doesn't save the undynamic quests and extremely painful leveling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Omg...this is great. Turns out what gamestop shipped earlier was the starter kit, which arrived just now. When the game should've arrived. And they shipped the game this morning and it's schedualed for arrival at this time *tomorrow*...wtf what's the point of preordering if you could just get it at the store!<br />
<br />
edit: Ok, as strange as it is, the schedualed time for arrival is still tomorrow but my game just came in 30 minutes ago!<br />
<br />
BUT...bestbuy hasn't even shipped hers yet! And the delivery is schedualed for 13-15th. Yet when she called them on the phone they clearly said it will be there on the 9th, they already shipped it out(few days ago).  So she's gonna pick it up at the store.<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

So what would they need then ?<br />
