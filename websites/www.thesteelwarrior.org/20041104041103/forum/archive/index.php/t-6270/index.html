<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having a dilemma here :)  I have the points to put an anger III augment in my BoW right now, but I am going back and forth between Force of Ykesha and Anger III.  I like the idea of having a damage proc in it, but I think that Ykesha even with WA is probably only around 6 dps so it's not a huge deal and occaisionally it's nice to not break root non-stop when I'm duoing with my cleric.<br />
<br />
Searching through the old threads it seems most people think Anger III is noticeably better than FoY, but I know a lot of you guys bought FoY before Anger III was upgraded and I would like to hear whether you think it's significant, especially those that had Ykesha and replaced it with Anger III.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I removed Ykesha and put in Anger 3 once I had enough extra points.  The aggro difference is there, but not enough to really matter, the biggest difference to me was there is now no more annoying pushback from the FoY proc.   It really is up to the person as to which they prefer, seeing as it does break root I think you may be better off with Anger as well.  Now that I am not in a raiding guild of any sort I would go back to FoY but do not want to waste the points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my old guildmate put ykesha on his BoW; than took it off and threw AngerIII on it. I went straight to AngerIII because, well, the force shock on my GBoS, although small, was still an annoyance when duoing with my wife's druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've got Yak on my BoW.. with WA4 atm it works just fine.  Anger 3 is no doubt &quot;better' agro, but I found incite and Yak proc holds agro through tash/slow just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya know Shiik, your magelo is an abberation of nature.  I bet you are the only warrior in EQ with a BoW, IGS, a Lodi Shield, and 5 pieces of Skyshrine armor.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I put &quot;Strike of Ykesha&quot; on my Blade of War because anger 2 and 3 were not doubled at that time. I really never had an issue with it. I do like the &quot;snap&quot; effect stuns have, so I was happy. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, if you don't have some type of stun component (aten gloves/orb of sky/symbol) pure hate/hate procs seem to not be so snappy. You can get a few consecutive procs before the mob actually turns. I have always felt a stun proc compliments a hate proc rather nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guildy has a BoW with the 125dd Yak proc.  I have a BoW with the AngerIII proc.  The AngerIII proc is just very slightly more agro, however once you get WA5, it really doesn't matter.  You proc so much the mob simply isn't going to move.... at all.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i should put my indo boots back into my profile just for style points. I got so much old krap rotting in my bank it's not even funny. It's like a museum tour. <br />
<br />
after my old guild merged with another; the 6 big guilds left on Terris are either to far out of reach ( Wandor's and Raaj's ); wrong time-zone (my old guild's new merger-guild); and the others have people I have a lot of bad blood with ( or mostly in fact that they all have bad blood with me hahahahha; i ain't exactly mr. personality ). <br />
<br />
So yeah; laugh at my IGS :D. Best 500plat I ever spent.</div></div><hr />

You should try staying up a little later once in a while.  I happen to know a guy on your server that has a level 65 cleric bot and a bunch of fierce heraldic armor and mutiple haste items rotting in his bank.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Force of Ykesha (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4358&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
AngerIII (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4394&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
goes either way aggro wise; depending on Stun=?hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">400hate &lt; stun &lt; 600 hate but with WA5 you can hold aggro just fine with an un-aug'd BoW.<br />
I went for ang3 on my SEWS, but if i had gotten a BoW i would have prolly went with yak. i love stun procs &lt;3</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL&lt; his magelo his really a wierd collection of n00b items and some of the very best thrown together to make one very strange collection.</div></div><hr />

Well to continue ninjaing my own thread, I keep hearing rumors that you still play on Test but still see no evidence of this fact :p.  What level is that elf now?

Kiadan's corpse is in S Ro in a sand dune somewhere; Sand Giant &gt; me  :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We currently have 2 BoW user in the guild, one aug'ed it with Ykesha, one with Anger 3 (me).<br />
<br />
It's really no vastly visible difference. The only times I got aggro over him was on Bertox Backflagging, one of the kings, and on Reparm (which hurt :-/ ). The other months, I didn't have to worry abozt aggro when he was tanking, so I'd say, take the cheaper Yak and get some additional DPS. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have yak in my BoW, thought about changing it to anger 3.  One day exping in PoE, I was grouped with another warrior who had an anger 3 BoW.  Having both of us attacking at the same time, there was no noticeable aggro difference.  I personally like the yak because I think it is easier to control when non tanking.  You aren't procing straight hate so it is possible to use the yak BoW in a dps situation while I think it would be much harder to do that with an anger 3 BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">LOL no offense, but you just contradicted yourself in your own post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">3 BoWs in my guild alliance, I have ykesha and the other 2 have Anger 3.<br />
<br />
We all hold aggro just fine, no noticable difference on any raid mob. On trash clearing generally the one that gets aggro first keeps it.<br />
<br />
Cant say the root breaking thing has ever been an issue, although I duo with a druid so snare is normally on anyway (presuming you bot a shm if root is an issue?)<br />
<br />
I'm in no hurry to swap to Anger 3, I got other things to spend my LDoN points on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Galium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm saving up for some North Ro armor atm, so i have a good bit of points in there, second is in EF. I'm using BoC/GBoS as agro weapons, if i get enough points which should i aug with angII/angIII/Yak first? Also, has anyone found a good dps aug for a GSo4W?</div></div><hr />
