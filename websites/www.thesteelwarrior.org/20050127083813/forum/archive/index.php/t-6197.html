<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On this day, I'd like everyone to raise a mug to the EverQuest teams of yesteryear, and today, who work so hard every day to bring us the most phenomenal computer gaming experience ever created. <br />
<br />
I know its always been 'popular' and 'cool' to flame 989, and then Verant, and finally SOE, for everything you dislike about this game. But think about it. They've done a phenomenal job over the past 5 years keeping this game fresh, new, balanced, phenomenally more cheat-free than almost all games out there, and usually just never lets our efforts get marginalized. <br />
<br />
This is a wonderful game and has given me and many others 5 years of enjoyment, and I have never regretted it for a moment. The vocal minority has for too long been allowed to complain about every trivial problem with this game, and use it as an excuse for saying this game is worthless, and personally hate the developers of this game. <br />
<br />
No more. On the fifth anniversary of EverQuest, let us put down the complaints and simply revel in the good times we've had, the good times we will have, and the cheap as hell entertainment we've had. The 200+ amazing zones that vary so much its staggering, to the dozens of truly rewarding and enjoyable quests, and to the fantastic job of keeping this one of the most stable games ever made, and was and always has been a true marvel in coding. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Few games are as complex as EQ (to be honest, I can't think of any).  They've done and excellent job keeping the amount of bugs and cheats minimized and adding new content.</div></div><hr />

Before this I haden't played any computer game for more than a few days. The first person shooters just didn't grab my attention, but a persistant world-wide online game based around Dungeons and Dragons? Ohh, count me in!!! <br />
<br />
I can say with all honesty that I'll probably see the 10th year party if there is one.</div></div><hr />

I'm not in that camp, I have enough gaming for my free-time with EQ1 as is. Hell, I just got my Sleeper's key tonight! I have a couple years of expansions to get bored with still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because this game is not perfect.  Not even close.  It has serious flaws in game balance and content, not to mention customer service, and the direction sony is heading with the game.<br />
<br />
That being said, EQ was, and forever will be one of the best games ever made.  The problem is that Sony believes that they can churn out crap like SWG and people will buy it just because they own EQ.  Will WoW grab and hold me like EQ did?  I dunno, I'm guessing not.  I've got a lot of good memories from my first year of EQ.  The difference is that WoW designers want the game to be fun...and that's something that just can't exist in EQ.  You have to sit around and be bored for X minutes out of every Y minutes because that's how the game is set up.  That's not a game, that's work, and the only reason a lot of us are still around is because of the friends we've made in this game.</div></div><hr />

Yep, it is the still the best, and probably will be for some time.</div></div><hr />

EQ has provided me with countless hours of entertainment over the last 4 years, and will continue to do so until I get bored. Pretty amazing accomplishment to be #1 for so long, particularly in a market as tough as MMORGs.<br />

/cheers SoE even if GMs are rare spawns</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it's amazing.  It simply shows that the people that gripe the most also care about the game the most.  And EQ is a game that is so awesome, but so easy to see how it could be improved.</div></div><hr />

I recently had to beat the verbal crap out of someone on my guild board for saying this to me.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that I don't give 2 shits about EQ anymore.  I care about the PEOPLE i play with.  EQ is boring as fuck nowadays.  You're either grinding or you're camping something, and either way, you're sitting on your ass waiting for a spawn or you're watching your XP bar.  I'm sure that things are different for those who are past RZ in the elemental planes, but for those of us who can't muster a 70 man raid force to take him down, there isn't shit to do anymore.  LDoN..whoop de fucking do. I've done everything I can do with 2 groups.  I'm absolutely SURE I can kill shit in the elemental planes (maybe not raid shit, but I could XP there and farm tradeskill shit, which would give me a challenge, and something to do), but I'm restricted from doing so, and will ALWAYS be restricted from doing so because I'm not in a zerg guild.  It's an artificial cap on advancement, no matter how good of a player I am, no matter how much mudflation comes down the line I'll never be able to progress thru PoP, and where the fuck am I gonna go instead?  GoD where all the people in POP get slaughtered?  Ya right.<br />
<br />
I was having a lot of fun in ToV lately....fuckin 2 and a half years after velious came out.  I never needed to be on the forefront of the action, but I want to be able to get there eventually.  I can't do that, and I'm not going back to EQ until there's something to do for people who aren't in a fucking 70 man guild OTHER than grinding XP.  Yeah...my accounts have been canceled for about 2 months right now, and I don't miss it one bit.<br />
<br />
You've got to understand that if you weren't in the guild you were in Wandor, and had the play time that you do, things would be far different for you and your toons.  Any game that imposes an artificial ceiling on your advancement based upon how many friends you have and the times you play at is bullshit.  Period.</div></div><hr />

This thread is to look back at how amazing a game this is, NOT to dredge up the same dreck you people post in EVERY OTHER POST EVER MADE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty fucking hilarious coming from Fulorian.<br />
<br />
I do think the game kicks ass.  I believe I said that.  However I think it could be a WHOLE lot better for a WHOLE lot less effort.  You keep talking about the vocal minority ruining the image of the game, well, I have a different view of that vocal minority, and that's people who work 9-5 jobs and then play in prime time uber guilds who are dictating content of the game for me, who works midnite to noon on the weekends and in a guild of 20.<br />
<br />
EQ was great...for a really long time.  But if shit like high end PoP, LDoN, LOY and GoD are indicitive of the direction the game is heading, if you're a halfway decent player who's not in a 70 man guild, EQ will likely not give you anything to do for a long while.</div></div><hr />

I got a chuckle out of that. :cool:  <br />

The most boring party I ever went to was a group of people that only agreed. /burp!</div></div><hr />
