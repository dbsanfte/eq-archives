<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has probably been thrashed around in some old post that I don't have time to dig up.  But I've gotten to the point where my sta is always maxed with shammy buffs.  Would be higher if I were to invest in that planar AA I can't name off the top of my head right now.  I spent alot of time and money getting my sta to where it is, but now I'm not really seeing much benefits to my HP by further increasing my sta.  Been thinking I should be looking more at strict HP increases for upgrades.  Just wondering if my thinking is out of line since I had the whole sta = HP mantra drilled into me since I was a wee warrior lass ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, thank you Fae, but that's not really what I was asking.  Was asking if I should be looking more at +HP items because in the past I was looking for +sta items and at this point, I'm not getting any HP advantage in groups/raids because of buffs by increasing my sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talasan</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes drop some sta items and increase some hp items as long as you are still maxxed with shammy buffs.<br />
<br />
raw hp &gt; sta imho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a post explaining how the basic 1 sta = 6hp formula gets changed with AAs like ND and PE, I think after doing ND3 and PE you get something like 1sta=7hp+, maybe you can replace your gear with STA with gear with HP using that 1=7 ratio and see if it works :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your on the right track.  If your at 280 buffed constantly, try swapping out items that have low HP (like below 40-50), and high sta, for items that have higher hps and don't worry about the sta.  As long as you can keep your base sta at 220 (60 sta from shammy buff I think), you'll be golden.  If you ever decided to get PP though, you'll need to keep it at 245 in order to be maxed.  I will say though that it is nice to have higher base Sta in experience groups, as you don't always have a shaman or beasty to buff you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that's the whole point of working on stamina gear....so that later on, you've got stamina to spare to start swapping out for raw HP gear.  Don't get Planar Power quite yet, just try to keep your stamina around 220 and then start swapping out higher STA items for items with more raw HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diron</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in the end though almost anything you find that has +hp is goingto have +sta not all of it but alot will.  my sta keeps going up and i am trying to keep it down and get as many raw HP's as i can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">one thought, if you do not need a shammie buff then you can keep that slot open for a resist buff or attack or regen or hate buff or cha buff.  Good equip comes with both good hp and sta so keep that in mind while making your choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at lvl 60 my stm was capped with stm buff, maxed later in 60 without. nowmy stm is like 420. <br />
<br />
