<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sarsippius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got back into town this week from a month-long vacation to Central America (yes, I had a blast) and over 2 months away from the game in general.  Im still a bit on the burned-out side from the immense amout of time that this game and my UI accumulate, but I have started playing again and am hopeful that our victory over the rathe council and entrance into Time Tuesday will spark the drive that has kept me playing since May of 1999. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, I put in a good chunk of time on my UI to get it up to date from all the patches that I missed and added a few new features.  Unfortunately due to the amount of files that have been updated as well as the amount of files I have forgotten if I updated over my vacation, the Sars 4 Patch is only available as a full install download to make sure everyone's UI works as intended.  Just wanted to give you all a heads up first since you have given me tons of support from the beginning.   <br />
<br />
I am taking on a couple new apprentices to help keep my UI going and hopefully get back into adding more features as I initially planned, so feel free to stop by my forums or send me a tell on Erolissi Marr if you have any suggestions for upgrades or changes.  Thanks again and good to be home =)<br />

<br />
I hope you realize that both of those things are already easily doable in Sars.  And I also hope you never post anything this worthless again.<br />
<br />
Anyway, WB Sars...since the new melee abilites came out on test I had to switch back to the default UI and I'm having severe SARS withdrawls.  I look over at my bot cleric's computer that still has Sars running and get insanely jealous. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Welcome back Sars.  (and it's good to hear something as slick as that interface came from someone on Emarr :D )<br />
<br />
I just started using the interface a couple weeks ago and it's great!  <br />
<br />
Gnomers - read the 'customizing' section on the web site...it's got easy instructions for the stuff you asked about (I know because I already made some of these changes on my system...and if a troll can do it...:p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;and if a troll can do it&quot;<br />
<br />
But a Gnome!?! Your giving the toe jam of EQ some credit there ;-)<br />
<br />
Anywho...WB SARS!!!</div></div><hr />
