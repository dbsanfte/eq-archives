<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings everyone. I have recently started playing EQ again and currently working on my warrior's AA. I have been hesitant to put points into ID though LR is maxed. So I want to ask this question, does ID depend on AC value? My warrior have 1446 AC, which may be quiet average by today's standards. So should I work on ID or save that for later when I get better AC. Any input will be appreciated. I apologize in advance if this question has been brought up before.</div></div><hr />

by looking at parsesthe only fact we got in EQ it takes off a percentage of total damage recived by character. Percentage stays the same regardless of AC and damage recived. If anything lower AC warriors show get more benifit out of it since they take more damage but mitigate same percentage of it.</div></div><hr />

ID gives a chance to reduce the dmg of every hit you take, very very useful against the uber mobs in Planes / Gates where you're gonna take some smacks no matter what your AC is.  Sure LR is great too but I did ID first because reducing the big hits seemed to me the more useful of the two skills.</div></div><hr />

Well, the damage reduction is almost identical. They both decrease the incoming melee damage by the same amount. The only real difference is that avoidance also reduces contact procs as well. With PoP and GoD introducing tons of mob procs, avoidance probably reduces mob DPS more than mitigation. Also, AC doesn't really represent avoidance (mobs missing in any way) almost at all. Probably whatever ac gained from agi goes towards this, the rest goes towards mitigation.<br />
<br />
  As for the original question, I have to admit that I'm uncertain. You'd have to have someone without ID (perhaps without even CS) parse at various ac levels, then parse again with the added AAs. To the question of waiting or not, don't. Defensive AAs are the most important AAs you can get as a warrior.</div></div><hr />
