<br />
The observation I made (or realized...what have you) is that we have a normalish DB + DI distribution within our hit chart (from Min to MN) and then a reletively flat and even distribution of hits from MN+1 to max.<br />
<br />
Its almost tempting to postulate there are 2 different mechanisms for doing damage, one upto MN, the other higher...<br />
<br />
Anyway, sicne it has a rediculous number of swings, the numbers show in fairly high contrast.</div></div><hr />

What number is that with almost 7000 hits? looks like 96 or so. There was an old formula that could tell you your &quot;magic number&quot; but I can't find it atm.. maybe if someone knows what I'm talking about they can dig it up and see if it still holds true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2x damage + damage bonus, which in fact the 7000 hit spike is. (97). That is quite normal. What is the surprising bit is the massive spike at max, or 218-219. I should throw this log at another parcer and get the hits histogram so we can see each value.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently posted this to other messageboards, so I find it kind of amusing to come across this post.  Anyhow, here is what I posted. <br />
<br />
Each attack is broken up into two portions. <br />
<br />
The first portion deals with your skill. This is the portion that checks for a riposte, parry, block, determines if you are going to hit the mob or miss, includes the weapon's damage bonus, and 1/3rd of the damage. <br />
<br />
How do I know that the damage bonus is attributed to this portion of the attack? Simple, it is part of the formula I have found to work. <br />
<br />
This formula is, Weapon Damage X 2 + Damage Bonus. <br />
<br />
The answer to this formula stands for the maximum possible hit based on the skill check portion of your attack. <br />
<br />
Let's use Ragebringer as an example. Ragebringer has 15 damage, with a damage bonus of 13. <br />
<br />
15X2+13=43 which would be the maximum hit from the skill check portion of the attack. <br />
<br />
15X6+13-x(in this case x=1)=102 which would be the maximum possible hit for a normal attack with a Ragebringer in the mainhand. I will explain the max hit formula later in the post. <br />
<br />
The Everquest combat system seems to overlap values, so the 3 most common attacks you would get with a Ragebringer would be 0, 43, and 102 damage. <br />
<br />
0 Represents a complete miss on the skill check portion of the attack, when this happens the attack portion of the hit never goes through. <br />
43 Represents the maximum possible value on the skill check portion of the attack, along with a complete miss on the hit portion of the attack. <br />
102 Represents the maximum possible value on both the skill check portion, and the hit portion of the attack. <br />
<br />
Due to the fact that through extensive parsing I still haven't seen that much of a change in the first portion of numbers, no matter how low or high my attack goes we can assume that this number is relatively constant. <br />
<br />
Whether you even hit the mob or not, and 1/3rd of the damage is likely determined by how your base offense skill compares against your opponents base defense skill on a roll. <br />
<br />
1/3rd of all random damage done each attack has absolutely nothing to do with how much attack your character has. I say random damage, because the damage bonus applied to each hit is not random. <br />
<br />
There is a possibility, which is the reason I am sharing this information, that your skill in that particular attack(Piercing,1h Slash etc) is also used in this portion of the attack. That is what I wish to find out. <br />
<br />
The second part of an attack is your attack value against your opponents AC. This only comes into play, if the first part of the attack goes through. The first part is relatively constant because your base offensive skill is a constant. <br />
<br />
Which basically means no matter how high your attack goes, you still won't hit for max all the time. The higher your attack goes, the more often the 2nd portion of the attack is for max. Since the first part is based on a constant, it would take that first random number + max value for the 2nd part, which would be your total hit. <br />
<br />
On an augmented vanazir, the maximum hit is 424, the skill check portion of the attack equates to 170 damage(65 damage+40 bonus) so all of the attacks between the skill check, and 170 don't change. So if 5% of all of my attacks do around 100 damage out of 170 on the skill check portion, even if my attack was so high the 2nd portion of the attack did max on every hit, it would still only put 5% of my hits around 354(100 out of 170 + 254 out of 254) damage, as opposed to the max possible of 424. <br />
<br />
So, your attack has reached diminishing returns when the first portion of your numbers is directly proportional to its equivalent max attack value on the 2nd portion of numbers. Not when all of your hits are for max damage, but most/all of the hits on the 2nd portion of your numbers are doing max damage. <br />
<br />
This formula also provides the formula to determine the maximum hit allowed for a particular weapon. <br />
<br />
Your offense against your opponents defense = Weapon Damage * 2 + Damage Bonus. <br />
<br />
Your Attack against your opponents AC = Weapon Damage * 4 - X where X is a counter variable.<br />
<br />
For every 10 damage on your weapon, X is increased by 1. Keep in mind that your weapon starts at 1, instead of 0. <br />
<br />
So, From 1-10 damage X is 0. <br />
11-20 X is 1<br />
21-30 X is 2<br />
31-40 X is 3<br />
41-50 X is 4<br />
51-60 X is 5<br />
61-70 X is 6<br />
71-80 X is 7<br />
81-90 X is 8<br />
<br />
So, the simplified version of the max hit formula is this: <br />
<br />
Weapon Damage * 6 + Damage Bonus - X<br />
<br />
The actual formula is broken up into 2 steps, <br />
<br />
(Skill check: Weapon Damage * 2 + Damage Bonus) + (Attack check: Weapon Damage * 4 - X)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as this information has been useful to me for attacking, it can be just as useful for tanking. Basically, 1/3rd of all random damage taken would depend on your base defense skill. The first part would likely deal more with avoidance, while the second part would be the mitigation part. <br />
<br />
As well, my theory is that the skill in the weapon you are using, is part of the 2nd check. Once your offensive skill determines that you are going to hit the mob, it's your weapon skill(piercing etc) + your atk against your opponents AC that determines whether you will do any additional damage, and if so, how much. It would be possible to gain a skill up in Offense and Piercing in the same swing since they are both being checked each swing. This is where I think the various weapon mods come into play, not by increasing the chance to hit, but by increasing the chance to do additional damage after the hit is determined, basically an increase to DPS. I would also tend to believe accuracy would be on the second half, as opposed to the first, so accuracy would not increase your chance to hit, but would be a minor increase to DPS as it would increase the number of times you do additional damage in the 2nd portion of the equation. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm no expert on warrior tanking, in fact, I've never played a warrior but I would guess that your new mitigation boost would only effect the 2nd portion. <br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but my best guess would be the skill check portion of the hit, wouldn't change, the first 1/3rd damage + Damage Bonus of an attack, but the second portion of the attack, the last 2/3rds damage would shift down 5%.  So really claiming it's a 5% mitigation boost is misleading.  <br />
<br />
A decent percentage of hits likely don't make it to the 2nd portion of the attack, so your 5% mitigation boost would have absolutely no effect on a decent portion of hits.  Even when it does work, it's only working on 2/3rds of the damage.  <br />
<br />
A 5% boost on 2/3rds of the damage is only a 3.33% boost.  When you factor in the amount of hits not effected by it, warriors are really only looking at around a 1%, maybe a 1.5% gain to total mitigation. <br />
<br />
NOTE: I am assuming that mobs use a similar formula to attack us, as we use to attack them.  I'm not too familiar with tanking so there is a chance it is slightly different. <br />

<br />
In the first chart (number of hits) you will see the one at 97 Damage hits to be twice as high as the other spike at 219 Damage hits. While on the second graph (damage chart) they are pretty darn close to eachother, obviously, high damage hits are more important than many thinks, even if there are much less of them.<br />
<br />
Oh ... and the mitigation changes won't affect those graphs, this is offensive damage dealt towards MOBs by a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">over a year ago i saw a similar chart and long explanation. it was a mouthful like this one. it was parsed however with different ATK levels. dont recall the method for varying it whether it involved strength buffs or weapon skill or what. i do clearly remember that no matter what the ATK rating the 2 magic numbers were always the same. with the low ATK rating there were 2 notable differences. the part above the 97 .. the first magic number .. was really flat.  that is there were few hits above the 2xdmg + bonus number. the other thing i noticed was that the part below the magic number was skewed  badly toward the low end. there were a lot of hits for minimum damage (14 i believe for those with damage bonus of 13). on those parses it was clear that minimum damage constituted a third magic number though that number draws no attention whatever on this graph.<br />
<br />
then again it was well over a year ago and my memory might not serve me well so feel free to correct me where i may be remembering wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can take a look at the graphs in the library from Ruartha which she made a real long time ago.<br />
<br />
In that graphs she had also 2 spikes. <br />
One at minimum damage / one at the magic number.<br />
<br />
Cause it was long time ago the atk which was the basic in that time was way smaller than the atk we can have today.<br />
<br />
As a result for our higher atk we will not hit very often for minimum damage. As the  max damage we can deal with a special weapon is limited, there will be a spike when the atk raises.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL those charts are also from the days when 50th was max level. Yes very different than the 252 +250 + 65 numbers we have now. And that indeed is a good and important observation about predicting damage--for the 50 and lower crowd, a good formula for evaluating a weapon is (DB + Damage)/delay where as for me, with that chart (with its 122ish average slashing damange) a much better predictor is (DB + 2.8 * Damage)/Delay.<br />
<br />
The other significant observation, is that for DPS, DB becomes less and less important, there for delay becomes less important.</div></div><hr />

Please stop.  While your theories are interesting.  They are dead wrong on a number of points.  Weapon skill has been proven to be directly related to your hcance to hit.  Also your method to calculate max hit isn't correct.  Your theory on when attack starts to hit a soft cap is wrong as far as I can tell too.  <br />
<br />
Your theory that there is a check for the 2 * weapon_damage + bonus that is seperate from the rest of the attack system is interesting. <br />
<br />
Also, mobs attack FAR FAR differently than we attack them.  Please learn more about it.<br />
<br />
Oh, btw, your terminology really sucks too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about that Brodda...<br />
<br />
Look at any PC's hit chart to the left of (and including) MN and it looks a lot like a higher percision version of a mob hit distribution (wehre mobs have DI * x trunked to 20 discreet steps, PCs have the calculation taken farther so that all values are possible, but there is still that pattern there). <br />
<br />
I will agree that what ever is happening above MN is not something that mobs do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spikes below 2 * weapon damage + damage bonus tend to disappear and you get spikes between 2 * weapon damage + damage bonus and max hit.  And I can't seem to figure out any pattern for those spikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not many, considering that most of it is before the disaplines were unlinked... and even afterword, if I am using incite on every mob I dont really have the end to fire off agressive as often as it refreshes.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruldar</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your theory that there is a check for the 2 * weapon_damage + bonus that is seperate from the rest of the attack system is interesting.  It would explain why there are the 20 spikes that max at the magic number.  Surely this initial check does the classic DB + [1, 20] * DI for only 20 different base hits, and then the later check gives the variety for lots more hit values.  What skills are actually checked for the upper hits and what the upper part of the formula actually are isn't neccesarily right, but there does seem to be a core of truth here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weapon skill has been proven to be directly related to your hcance to hit.<br />
<br />
I can see how it could be confused.  The fact is, the majority of the time your offensive skill, matches your weapon skill.  If both are at the same number, it would be hard to determine whether hit ratio is linked to Offense, or your Weapon Skill.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords are an exception.  A beastlord has 252 Offense, 252 Hand to Hand, but only 225 1h and 2h Blunt. <br />
<br />
If your &quot;proven&quot; theory were true, then a Beastlord would have a lower hit ratio when using a 1h or 2h Blunt as opposed to a Hand to Hand weapon.  There are 100's of parses located at EQbeastlord.com, that prove your &quot;proven&quot; theory to be false.  All of the parses have an almost identical hit ratio.  This is because hit ratio is in fact based on your skill in Offense, and not your weapon skill.  If your lazy, I'll link one of the threads for you, <br />
<br />
http://www.eqbeastlord.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=10317&amp;highlight=parses<br />
<br />
Notice how, no matter which weapon was used, almost all of the hit ratios were within 1% of each other?  In contrast, on the Steel Warrior parses, almost all of the Knight parse hit ratios are about 5% different due to their lower offensive skill.  Since beastlords have 252 offensive skill, the difference between using a 225 capped 1h Blunt, and 252 capped HTH weapon is so minor(less then 1%), because it isn't based on weapon skill but offensive skill. <br />
<br />
Also your method to calculate max hit isn't correct.<br />
<br />
Really, how so? The actual max hit, is simply weapon damage * 6 + damage bonus.  Simply because this is the max possible hit, doesn't mean we ever hit for it.  The problem is not in our offense, but your opponents defense.  The only time the actual max hit would be produced, is in extremely rare situations when you are fighting a mob with almost no defensive skill at all.  Basically, on very rare occasion you would get your actual max hit on the very low level newbie mobs located by the cities in the old world.  I think there is one other mob in game that also would produce it.  The variable X is added to the formula, just to make it more realistic.  <br />
<br />
If the actual max hit is only ever produced .0000001% of the time, assuming you ever actually fight extremely low level mobs at high levels, who cares about the actual max hit formula?  What people want is the formula that would apply to them.  The formula that, 99.9% of the time, would produce the correct max hit.  I added the X variable to the formula for just that reason.  I'm sorry that .000001% of the time, my max hit formula is wrong, have fun fighting newbie mobs outside the starting cities to increase your max hit a little.  For the rest of us that aren't killing level 1 bats at level 65, the formula works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mippo</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your theory on when attack starts to hit a soft cap is wrong as far as I can tell too. <br />
<br />
All of the hits between Damage Bonus and Damage Bonus + Weapon Damage * 2 are constant. Every single attack has to go through that damage range. So, rank the percentage all attacks hit in that area.  Completely remove all hits above your &quot;magic number&quot; from the parse and focus solely on the hits in that range.  40% of all of those hits, will be for max with 252 offense against the vast majority of mobs you fight.  <br />
<br />
Now, do the exact same ranking on the other half of the equation.  Remove all the numbers from the magic number and below, and focus only on the hits in the 2nd half.  What percentage of those hits are for max?  <br />
<br />
At 1620 attack, its around 23.5% of all attacks in the upper portion are for max.  In the first half of the equation, you hit your magic number around 40% of all possible hits in that area but are only hitting max 23.5% of all hits in the second part of the equation.  Obviously there is still room for improvement past 1620 attack. <br />
<br />
I'll make it easy for you to find.  Take off 100 attack worth of gear, then parse a mob for however long you want.  Notice the number of times you hit the magic number, and the number of times you hit for max.  Now put that 100 attack back on, and repeat the parse.  The number of times you hit the magic number will not change, the number of times you hit for max will increase by several percent.  Add another 100 attack, the number of times you hit for your magic number will not change, and yet again the number of times you hit for max will increase by several percent. <br />
<br />
There is a noticeable change in the number of times you hit for max each time you increase your attack but the number of hits at your magic number, does not change.  Interesting. <br />
<br />
Guess what attack value the number of times you hit for max stops increasing?  It's a steady increase all the way up to a certain attack value.  I'll give you a hint, it stops increasing right around 2150 attack. <br />
<br />
This means, if you parse your attack at 2150 and look at the number of times you hit for max then increase your attack to 2350, and look at the number of times you hit for max, there will be almost no change, whereas increasing every value from 1300 to 2150 produced a steady increase.  That is diminishing returns on attack.<br />
<br />
Why is that number significant? Well, because at that attack value, around 40% of all hits in the upper portion hit for max damage.  Directly proportional to the 40% of all hits in the lower portion that hit for max(Magic Number).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thrashette</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the hits between Damage Bonus and Damage Bonus + Weapon Damage * 2 are constant.<br />
<br />
That graph is indeed composed of parts.  But those parts are not what you say they are, and none of them are constant.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is just another mippo-uses-the-wrong-word.  Constant means that all values are the same.  There are no constant hits in this graph.<br />
<br />
Anyway, looking at the graph here is what we have:<br />
<br />
The minimum hit is DB +DI.<br />
<br />
One part of the damage is obviously spikes of DB + (1..20)*DI, with a huge spike at what looks to be DB + 20*DI, which is, not coincidentally, MN.<br />
<br />
A second part is a large spike at the max hit.<br />
<br />
A third part is an uphill ramp of noisish values from DB+DI to MN<br />
<br />
A fourth part is a downhill ramp of noisish values from MN  to max hit.<br />
<br />
A fifth part is a few odd spikes just above DB+DI.<br />
<br />
Now personally, I think we ought to be thinking about the third and fourth part as one thing.  But that's just my opinion, and I've  neither theory nor data to support it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is an idea to kick around--or maybe a rehprasing of Mippo.<br />
<br />
Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away...<br />
<br />
It was thoriezed that the RND (1 20)  part of incoming damage was in fact bigger than 1-20, and the spikes one would see at the top or bottom of a hit distribution (or both) were attribituble to mobs having their RND results affected by AC, and as AC increased more hits where forced down the chart to min.<br />
<br />
Fast forward this idea to PC damage....<br />

instead of capping all hits at DI*20, on the basis of degree of suceess (or just plane old RNG) a number of hits, that for mobs would be at DI*20, for PCs go into a second damage function, generating the non-DB+DI part of the chart...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;I&gt;Notice how, no matter which weapon was used, almost all of the hit ratios were within 1% of each other? In contrast, on the Steel Warrior parses, almost all of the Knight parse hit ratios are about 5% different due to their lower offensive skill. Since beastlords have 252 offensive skill, the difference between using a 225 capped 1h Blunt, and 252 capped HTH weapon is so minor(less then 1%), because it isn't based on weapon skill but offensive skill.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
Those parses show consistently that H2H weapons are hitting for a higher percentage than 1hb or 2hb weapons.  The parses are large enough that the margin of error is well below 1%, roughly at 0.5%.  The 1-1.5% hit ratio difference is significant when you take into account the parse data sample size so you can theorize that weapon skill is indeed a factor in your hit/miss ratio.</div></div><hr />

I can parse it for you if you like. My offensive skill doesn't change when I bag my swords, but my hit ratio DOES in a magnitude that can not be accounted for by 'margin of error.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bridgecrusher</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some experimenting with Mippo's theory that damage is done in two parts.<br />
<br />
My assumption was that the first part of the equation (2*damage+DB = max hit) was distributed across damage intervals just like with mobs, with a probability that was fairly equal across all intervals except the low end (where the probability is lower than the average) and the max hit (where the probability is much higher, on the order of 40%).  My 2nd assumption was that the second part of the equation (4xdamage-X = max hit) was distributed across all values from 1 to 4xdamage-X-1, and the probability had a negative slope.  The 0 and 4xdamage-X values had a higher probability than the average across the other values.<br />
<br />
Example:  Assuming the weapon's base damage is 31, 0 had a probability of occuring of ~13%, values 1 thru 120 had a probability of ~1% down to ~.4%, and value 121 had a probability of ~5%<br />
<br />
If you take the convolution of the first function across the second function, you'll see a histogram that is very close to the charts posted by Kailyn, which confirms to me that Mippo's idea for the formula is on track.  Now how the offensive skills determine the probabilities of the two functions is anyone's guess until we get more parses like Kailyn's with corresponding ATK and skill values.<br />

If anyone is interested in seeing the chart and values for themselves just send me an email at emeradii@hotmail.com and I can send you the zipped excel spreadsheet I used to analyze this.</div></div><hr />
