Twice I became stuck between Madrone of Paladin's of Norrath and Raaj of The Steel Warriors who crashed together in debate over Defensive.<br />
<br />
And from Madrone on PoN:<br />
<br />
Hah he musta had me confused with Gilfalas! He was the one that debated it with Warrior GL of Enlighted Dark and Raaj <br />
<br />
So what did you *cough* discuss? And were there any opinions given by the devs? :P.</div></div><hr />

We...&quot;discussed&quot;...the fact that paladins don't need defensive :) And, yes, he agreed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ruka</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay for those of you that think you know everything about Gilfalas and  and think he is wrong about everything I would like to point out that he is very much aware of the problems warriors have. He is by no means out to screw the warriors in the game, he just would like a chance to be heard on the palidan class issues like we want to be heard on the warrior class issues. He is well aware of how broken taunt is, he knows that incite isn't the end all be all fix that some people on PoN seem to think it is either. <br />
<br />
Gilfalas is an administrator of a community board, just like Raaj, he at  times has to shut inflammatory thread, as I am sure Raaj has, and he has to ban people that only go to PoN to flame with no constructive ideas in their heads. I have heard for the last 3 years that Gilf doesn't want palidans to get defensive but he also feels that palidans should be capable of tanking some content as needed. Knights should be seen as un/holy warrriors, they dedicate their sword and strength to a cause but they are still in a sense warriors. We need taunt fixes palidans need something else but Gilfalas isn't behind some evil plan to get them defensive. <br />
<br />
How do I know this?  Gilfalas is the person that got me interested in playing EQ 5 years ag and we talk regularly. He also mentioned he had some good talks with Raaj about defensive when he got home from the summit.<br />

<br />
Gilfalas is not, by any means, evil incarnate.  Nor would I say that he is completely deaf to the concept of class balance either.  But, and here is the but , he does seem to allow his personal perceptions and feelings to influence who he decides to ban and who he doesn't.  There are a number of people who play Paladins who dance along the banning line consistantly that he does nothing about.  While other people who don't play Paladins get the boot muy pronto, some who haven't even gone near the line.<br />
<br />
Once you gain a reputation as not being even handed and are perceived as favoring those who agree with your stance over those who disagree, you lose the image of impartiality which is fairly important for a moderator to have, if you want the content of your board to be given a reasonable amount of respect.  Having a board filled with people all nodding their heads and agreeing with you, when in fact you've booted anyone who didn't from the board, doesn't make you right.  It just makes you a censor who appears to be working solely for your own best interests.  I doubt that Gilfalas is even conscious of what he's doing or how it's perceived, but bias is bias.  Me, I'm biased and I admit it.  I tend to favor Warriors, because that's the class I play (or did when I played EQ) and the one I understand the best.  But I'm not a moderator and I'm not in a position of power where my actions influence how the content of my board is perceived by the rest of the playing community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ruka, I read PoN for a long time, but abandoned it when it became perfectly clear, after MANY instances, that Gilfalas is simply not a fair admin. Not even close. In fact, the worst I've seen on any EQ board. I appreciate he's passionate about paladins; it's unfortunate that induces him to misuse his admin powers by banning those who disagree with him -- even a number of people who were pretty reasonable with useful things to say. Frodlin, Battleblade, Glatius, Shadowfrost, Landrain, Kavak, etc -- the list of reasonable non-paladins who have been warned or banned is long, while a wide contingent of paladin trolls, flamers, and baiters has a happy home there. The double-standard is both striking and obvious. <br />
<br />
He might be a decent guy. He's a terrible admin. PoN is useless except as a place for paladins to vent at each other. I'm not normally a person to bitch at admins, since I greatly respect people who volunteer their time to do thankless tasks that improve the lot of others. But he's just so inconsistent and pretty evidently biased it's hard to ignore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilfalas Elaandrin</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We...&quot;discussed&quot;...the fact that paladins don't need defensive  And, yes, he agreed.Sure did and it was a great conversation with some real insites (excuse the term) on both sides. Raaj was a passionate and intelligent speaker.<br />
<br />
Wish more of his like would discuss the issue. And for the record for the umpteenth time yes I DO NOT think Paladins need discipline defensive. As was accurately reported on mobhunter I think that Paladins needed 'a little something' to help us tank the yellow + con mobs that void the spell powers that auto fail on the.<br />
<br />
I have also always said, and still say, and I said this to Raaj if my beer soaked brain (at that time) remembers properly that if the issue could be solved by content that was fine too. And it has.<br />
<br />
So done. As long a SOE cam guarentee that content will be appropriate from here on out again I am fine with how I tank.<br />
<br />
Tugurok your list is a little innacurate:<br />
<br />
Frodlin:  Regular poster. We often disagree but he presents himself intelligently and respectfully. Has he been warned in the past? Yes. So have a TON of 'Paladin' as well.<br />
Battleblade: If this is Bburleydwarf then yes he was banned after 6 warnings and by the unanimous decisions of 3 admins and 5 moderators.<br />
Glatius: See the above as well<br />
Shadowfrost: If this is Shadowforstxev I have no idea why they were banned. Someone said it may have been from about three years ago. Since that could have been from before I was even an admin and since our internal recors show no warnings for them they had their account reinstated today.<br />
Landrain: Again as far as I know they still post and are not banned.<br />
Kavak: I have NO idea who this is. There is no ezboard account named Kavak banned on PoN's banned members list. Did they post under a different name?<br />
<br />
And before you go condeming me as the devil and hyper biased (I am neither) how about realizing that PoN has 3 admins and 5 moderators and that all bans are passed by the entire group for agreement? The only time we ban without concensus is when someone posts porn or links to innapropriate material or websites.<br />
<br />
he does seem to allow his personal perceptions and feelings to influence who he decides to ban and who he doesn't.Once the Admin Bot is developed who can unilaterally and dispassionately admin a board I will have it installed. Until then I will state that yes I let my opinions influence my decisions. Opinions on a persons conduct on the board. NOT on their feelings of the game.<br />
<br />
If you come to PoN and insult the staff, the community or the posters then you bet your gonna be banned as a troll if you do it long enough. If you come and present your idea's in a mature and intelligent manner and do not wave your virtual dicks and insult folsk you woll enjoy a long life on the board.<br />
<br />
In any case I wanted to come and thank Raaj for the account fix and to say again it was a pleasure to meet him and I thoroughly enjoyed the talk we had.<br />
<br />
Sorry to see that SOE has decided that nerfing Defensive by negating it totally is their way to balance tanking. It sucks when a class loses an abilty on content.<br />

<br />
Six warnings?  You only recounted 3 to me in private emails and those stretched over a period of almost a year, well 8 months really.  Were you holding out on me then or inflating the tally now in public?  Given that the warnings you said I earned were for a non-specified insult in August, telling someone not to be a jackass in January, and telling someone up yours in March, I can see how my posting pattern must have been horribly shocking and appalling to Paladins everywhere.<br />
<br />
Present it any way you wish, but even if you argue my banning was justifiable, there are numerous other people who have been banned from PoN for far less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I said &quot;warned or banned&quot;, and my list is exactly accurate. You have in fact warned or banned who I said you warned or banned, generally for posts that were very obviously non-trollish. And when I say you, I mean in fact you, Gilfalas, and not other admins, since they were your posts or edits that reported the bannings or warnings. The record is pretty clear. Sorry if that annoys you. Some of them have even been copied to Steelwarrior and discussed. <br />
<br />
You tote up the &quot;warnings&quot; as if those were given out fairly, like the 6 given to Battleblade. I saw those -- they were absurd. Once he was &quot;warned&quot; for suggesting the use of Soulfire -- which was subsequently discussed in that very thread by paladins. Shadowfrost's banning, delivered by you less than two years ago, was because he acknowledged he was an advocate for clerics. You offered some labored interpretation of that as &quot;trolling&quot;, and banned him. Frodlin was &quot;warned&quot; for investigating the background of soledragondead, who we all know to be Seventhsword -- a &quot;banned&quot; poster, yet not somehow not banned. Glatius's banning was a joke. Etc. Meanwhile, Drayron routinely calls Frodlin &quot;Baghdad Bob&quot;, Arbosch starts threads titled &quot;Why I hate warriors&quot; or somesuch, various paladins write as intemperately as they like -- and nothing.<br />
<br />
I realize you want to be fair, and like to think of yourself that way. Your actual performance is otherwise though. I think you simply get carried away by the feelings of the debate.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it really has Kailyn.  We're not really dragging him through the mud.  Just stating our observations about his moderating style.  He is probably a decent man on the whole.  But he seems to have a real blind spot with regards to who he bans and why.  It's not unusual for people to have a blind spot of some kind, but it usually makes sense to listen to others when they point it out to you and at least give what they say some consideration.</div></div><hr />

I usually just take out my frustrations by posting names of people I think are asshats on the moderator board, but usually public humiliation and/or thinly veiled threats via PM are enough to get them under control ;)<br />
<br />
I think sometimes we need to crack down on flamers on this board more often, but banning is more than is necessary most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilfalas Elaandrin</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each board has their own posting and administration style based on the boards Admins and Mod's and the board members. I know I have been compared to being as hard nosed as the folks at EQTraders in how I admin and frankly I find that to be a compliment. They have an incredibly informative board with a thriving active community.<br />
<br />
For the most part the Paladin community has shown me they like how I admin. I have had folks at fan faires tell me they love the board and that they appreciate what I and the rest of the PoN Staff do.<br />
<br />
I of course would never dream of coming to another person's board and tell them how to moderate it. I would not know the topics, the attitude of the people on that board or the mindset. As you show the way that warrior players do things here is very different from the way Paladin players do things on PoN but it works for you and that in the end is what matters.<br />
<br />
Being probably the most frequent and verbal Adming on PoN, I tend to draw the most fire. Which is fine. It does not bother me. As long as the board is informative and free of trash posts and line noise that is all that matters.<br />
<br />
Really I think I have PERSONALLY banned maybe 3 posting accounts and about 10 spam accounts, spam accounts being folks who come back to posts cross links to porn, or objectionable material. That is 3? or so years. Have other admins banned folks? Sure have. But, like you and Raaj, I trust and support my staff's decisions 100%. It works for us and for our community.<br />
<br />
And to reply to Glatius (although I probably shouldn't) your right you were told three warnings and you got three. My reference to see above was meant in the general you got warned and you continued and you got removed as per our rules. <br />
<br />
What you weren't told was that you generated the largest number of complaint emails to my admin account that I have gotten in my entire time in moderating any board, any where. Dude your like a one man living siege or Typhoon. You post a bazilion posts a bazilion times a day over and over and generate HUGE line noise trying to wear folks down through pure repetition. Folks were just sick of seeing your name. hehe<br />
<br />
And about half the complaints were from NON Paladins BTW, some even from WARRIORS! omg  :eek:</div></div><hr />

He's referring to a couple of the trials having boss mobs now that if a Warrior has defensive up, they dump him lower on the aggro list and go after someone else.  Makes using defensive and evasive useless against these mobs, unless you want them to eat your group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, that's retarded.  I thought they were going to reduce the harder trial boss ATK levels, not nerf player abilities.  It also forces you to either go clear through the trial and die horribly to the boss mob, possibly having no clue what went wrong with the aggro, or use spoiler sites so that you know ahead of time.  That's really stupid.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming in game it doesn't warn you.  I'd be pissed as hell at the devs if I spent hours going through a trial and then wiped because of it.  Which bosses is it?<br />
<br />
And yes, I realize that reducing mob ATK levels while leaving defensive alone would make the trials somewhat easier.  I thought that was partly the point, besides giving knights a higher percentage chance of surviving.  I thought Sony had recently acknowledged that they made parts of GoD too hard, &quot;designed for L70s&quot; or something.  So reducing ATK levels on mobs was partly to bring that down to a more reasonable difficulty.  Reducing ATK but making defensive not work may have actually made the trials harder.</div></div><hr />

I do think certain people haven't been edited NEAR as quick or edited at all as warriors have been on pon.  Look at shazzai and some others.  They go as far as insulting people directly and don't get a single edit.  if a warrior posts something slightly rude to a paladin it's edited. (I know it's a paladin board but want credibility apply your rules to everyone)</div></div><hr />

Hehe, yeah that is rather neat how that works out. I say let em run their run their own board, our is run different from theirs.<br />
<br />
The again, I do have to say that claims by someone who got banned at PoN that they didn't do anything to get banned should be met with scrutiny. They have their own posting rules over there and personalities. Same as with this board. For instance, would Haass really be able to say the things he says to people if he wasn't already an established and (somewhat) respectable poster despite his format? This is a crazy board here at SW with very abrasive language and rough attitudes. I would nevere expect to be welcomed to post on other board with the tone and tempo that we do over here and get away with it.<br />
<br />
note: I'm not sure if all that came across correctly, but I hope I got me point across. And, no, that was not a personal attack on Haass. Not that I think he even cares what others think. I just used him as an illistration.</div></div><hr />

Well, I don't deny that I transgressed according to the strict interpretation of the PoN rules so you could certainly argue I earned being banned there.  But there are a number of people who are just as bad or even worse than I was in their conduct who don't seem to be smacked with the ban bat.  Nor, truth be told, did anyone bother to communicate with me privately prior to my banning with regard to my being considered a &quot;nuisance&quot; on the board.  So that point strikes me as being something pulled out of the hat to be used as justification.  Not that some people wouldn't argue that they saw me as being a nuisance, but it seems that a reasonable moderator would drop someone a PM if they were receiving a lot of complaints about that person's posting, wouldn't you think?  Or something, eh?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have my opinion of PoN and their moderator team.  Some are excellent people.  None of them are really horrible people.  A few however seem to be much more interested in purusing their personal class agenda over being even handed moderators.  Ah well, such is life I suppose.</div></div><hr />

You just have to understand that where he is from the word &quot;fuck&quot; translates as &quot;I'd like to point out&quot;. Morons, ideots, asshats, retards are just all his statements of his intelectual superiority. I feel sorry for you if you cant clearly see this, since you will be in pain reading any of his posts.</div></div><hr />

Once in a while Gilfalas warns some of the most retarded paladin posters, but actually not much and certainly not consistent with the style of warnings given to Glatius or BB or others.  <br />
<br />
In short, while most class boards are clearly biased for pretty obvious reasons, I can't think of many that are more prone to absurd exaggeration and inconsistent intolerance as the paladin one.</div></div><hr />

You should expect to be treated a bit more harshly for acting an ass on a different class's board, than the home class gets treated on their home board. We do the same here to paladins, except instead of mederating heavily, we just humiliate and slander the passing idiots. It's this board's style, every board has a different one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But what happens at PoN goes way beyond that. There's a big gulf between &quot;a bit more harshly&quot; and the flagrant abuse of moderation that goes on at PoN.</div></div><hr />

Actually there wasn't any hate, that was a statement about my personality and the wa I interact with people on the internet at certain points. Generall it iinvolves then trying to prove how wrong I am on some matter.</div></div><hr />
