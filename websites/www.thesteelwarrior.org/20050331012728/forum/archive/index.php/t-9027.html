Is there a minimum level for the sewers or mountain trials?  Is there a level range requirement?<br />

Thanks for any info you might have.</div></div><hr />

AFAIK they are all level 60.<br />
<br />
I know vxed tipt are 60, because for a while I had a second cleric camped for reses.</div></div><hr />

The sewers I know for a fact that we had a level 54 twink come in to loot some haste belt.  Then we did another of the 4 trials and it kicked him to Zone-in as soon as he tried to enter to loot.  So either it's different for each trial, or it's somewhat buggy.</div></div><hr />

Can't zone into Ferubi or Vxed/Tipt till 60 tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on your definition of &quot;PL&quot;.  She is a DPS class and can add to the group, even in Tipt/Vxed, even at &quot;only&quot; level 59/60.  Will she add as much as a level 70 DPS?  No.<br />
<br />
She is a friend.  I play the game to spend (virtual) time with my friends.  This happens to be one of the better XP areas in the game, and yes, I'd expect her to gain XP faster here than just about anywhere else she could go.<br />
<br />
Some call that PL'ing.  I call it grouping with my friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ferubi is 55, had a level 55 sk for summoning parked in zone.  PLed him from 53 to 55 waiting for it to allow him entrance.</div></div><hr />
