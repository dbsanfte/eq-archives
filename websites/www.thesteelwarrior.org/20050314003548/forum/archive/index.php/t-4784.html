<br />
Finally getting serious about puting a real aug on a BoW, wondering if anyone has much experience with the guard/spellguard procs.  Other choice is the standard anger3, probably won't go for the yke procs because of the small but annoying knockback...<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<br />
<br />
spell guard and melee guard both are on same line as spell casted versions, so if if you have some bot or something dedicated to casting it proc is going to waste.....<br />
<br />
and even with warrior changes proc aggro is still very nice, beacuse it dosent rely on you pressing buttons it just happens automatically....<br />
<br />
As a paladin i still like weapons that have a somewhat aggro proc (SEWS, VDD etc etc) when tanking because its a lot less work when half the time you are holding aggro throught taunt and melee... cause well... it just gets old constnal casting stuns or provoke or whatever...<br />

ya i'm lazy sue me =p</div></div><hr />

You're shortchanging yourself on a lot of aggro by not putting it in.  If you want to do damage, BoW really isn't the weapon you want to be using anyway.  Even unaugmented it'll probably get you killed in the wrong times more than once if you use it solely for DPS, unless everyone else's aggro is way better than you (i.e. time level weapons).  For a DPS weapon, I'd recommend SEWS with a damage proc, and it's cheaper than putting 2 damage weapons with 2 damage procs too.</div></div><hr />
