<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have been thinking of picking up some piercers if what they say is right about GoD.<br />
cant really decide between a 2hander or a DW set up.<br />
for 2 hander was looking at the Crow footed lance <br />
The other option is an ifir and one other 1 hander…<br />
Not sure if any parses have been done as to which is better dps..<br />
<br />
Was wondering what kind of set up you guys are thinking of wielding..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dagger of Distraction looks like a good choice for piercing?  For that matter, it's the only piecing weapon Warrior can use in Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cept that DoD has an aggro reducing proc....<br />
<br />
<br />
About the only good piercer I can think of with an actual aggro proc is a WillSapper....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ifir duh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">100 pt nuke is *not* an agro proc. I can say this for sure, having used several items that proc pure nukes and almost never pulling agro when the proc went off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But it's not a deaggro either. Also augmentable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if your MT, i'd assume you'd still use your agro set up. you may not do alot of damage, but as MT your job isnt to do the damage anyway. countless phrases before have shown that your potential damage is what is looked at as far as agro. it's all going to depend on how the weapon type damage is coded. if it works like emp/seru, where it caculates potnetial DPS into agro there shouldnt be any problems with using your normal agro weapons. i would wait and see how agro is effected my the use of non favorable weapon types verses favorable weapon types. <br />
i think (hope) that the most the new combat systems does is make melees get several different weapon types for DPS, instead of warriors getting several different types for tanking in addition to their DPS weapons. <br />
reguardless, i think the best option would be to get a 2h weapon of each type instead of having 2 single handed waepons (6 total)for each type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe im out of the loop but why would piercers in GoD be a good idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some of the mobs have resistance/immunity to certain types of melee damage.  So you might need a specific weapon type to actually do damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Who cares if DoD is an agro debuff? You'd be using a piercer primarly for damage, and damage only.<br />
<br />
If you're tanking, not a chance in hell you're using ghetto piercing weapons; you will use your standard slashing Anger/EB proc setup.<br />
<br />
You need to be doing respectable damage to hold agro? I don't think in all my billion Emporer kills, or Seru kills, that I ever used a bane weapon to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>magnes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">old school warriors on a budget used &quot;Bloodpoints&quot; with a life tap type proc. Mad agro......<br />
guess ill break mine out again.</div></div><hr />
