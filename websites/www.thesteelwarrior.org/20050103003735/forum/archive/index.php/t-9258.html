1: 	Defensive Proc(6202)<br />
<br />
Bazu Bellow <br />
1: 	Increase Hate by 600<br />
2: 	Increase Hate by 100<br />
<br />
Savage Onslaught Discipline - Guessing its on the offensive clock. <br />
1: 	Chance to Critical Hit(270)<br />
2: 	Increase Chance to Crippling Blow by 100%<br />
3: 	Critical Damage Mob(100)<br />
<br />
Aura of Runes Discipline (on the Furious timer, I'm told?) <br />
1: 	Add Proc: Rune Effect - 400 pt.  yippee. <br />
<br />
Don't know what &quot;1: 	Defensive Proc(6202)&quot; means but the other two look totally fucking useless.  I can't think of a situation where I'd blow my furious timer to get a 400 pt rune.  Or where anyone will give a crap about my doing a bit more damage.  Does anything actually get stunned by crippling blows anymore? The Bellow looks great.  <br />
<br />
Looks like they keeping with the tradition of making one in three or so warrior disciplines actually useful.  <br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?  Can someone pop in with what the 70 does?  Sorry if this is all posted somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

Really eats your endurance, but with very high endurance you can chain all your defensive disciplines, and all your offensive ones and just barely have enough endurance to support them all back-to-back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the timer difference on the rune disc it makes it usable.  Could be interesting depending on how often the proc goes off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lvl 69 is our only useful disc<br />
<br />
lvl 68 disc is kinda fun if you get lucky and get 1-2 high cripples, more of eye candy than anything else. but still kinda useless<br />
<br />
lvl 66 disc aura of runes disc cancels out your clickie procs, hardly ever procs and eats your endurance =\<br />
<br />
unless sony decides to make our discs better, none of them are worth getting but lvl 69 one.<br />
<br />
imo they should give warriors an ancient disc, like a longer lasting defe disc or *cough* a better bellow</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get sick of hearing this crap.<br />
<br />
Aura is good disc. Clickie procs? I have no clue what items even have them so obviously isn't a concern of mine.<br />
<br />
Aura of Runes' best uses are when ya get swarmed with a handful of greenies (read as, bunch of killables that i dont want chewing my hp needlessly) or normal ldon's when it's a better alternative than furious/fortitude (faster refresh).<br />
<br />
I've been doin a fair bit of soloin in Dranik Scar (farming pp mostly, few augs), and the mob procs there can get pretty draining. Makes it easier soloin the dark blues there too.<br />
<br />
And, like any other procs, the Aura disc can proc steadily or be spotty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a little curious if Savage Onslaught is more useful if you have Cleave II or III. As it stands, the most cripples I've gotten is 4 or 5 in a few uses (I haven't bothered to use it more since IMO it just isn't worth the endurance).<br />
<br />
Has anyone parsed the number of cripples per use with and without Cleave?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only problem with Aura of Runes and Savage Onslaught is the endurance they require.  From a pure defensive point of view, using Stonewall as soon as it refreshes is obviously more effective than using Aura of Runes, and Fellstrike likewise is better than using Savage Onslaught.  This means you'd never use either of the discs unless you've so much endurance you can use both of the offensive or both of the defensive discs.  Given the lack of endurance regen, a lot of time you simply don't have that luxury.<br />
<br />
From eyeballing (it is hard to parse the exact benefit of Savage Onslaught) I'd put Savage Onslaught at about 100 DPS, compare to 200+ DPS using Fellstrike.  I think it's fair to have Savage Onslaught cost as much as Fellstrike.  I understand Savage Onslaught isn't meant to be Fellstrike 2 but currently there is almost no compelling reason to ever use it unless Fellstrike is down and you still have 5K+ endurance sitting around.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Aura of Rune could use a significant endurance cost reduction.  The proc nature of it prevents it from being a reliable damage mitigation.  I certainly can't imagine Aura of Runes ever beating Stonewall in terms of damage mitigation in any serous scenario so it should cost less than Stonewall (per second).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aandien</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Savage Onslaught is useful when your not the tank (or if you are, you don't need defensive or other endurance...) and you want to use offensive disciplines on the mobs.  If you have it, you get to use 2.  If you don't have it....you only have fellstrike.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the option of being able to use two of them....the DPS may not be that significant, but, any DPS increase is useful when your objective is to just kill something faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aura of Runes has proved to be the most min or max random thing I've ever seen in this game so far.  I've never seen it in the middle, only all or nothing.<br />
<br />
The very first time I ever used it was while tanking XTC.  Stonewall was down, so I decided to hit this for the hell of it since I just got it that day and wanted to see how well it worked.  It proced constantly.  It was up for every other, near every, round the mob threw at me, mitigating 400 damage way from nearly every round.  I praised the disc.  I shouted into guildsay at how wicked the new disc was.  The &quot;rune effect&quot; buff was constantly flashing in my song window, the second it would come up the mob would knock it down, then it would proc right back up again.<br />
<br />
Next time I used it was on some low 100 damage hitting mob.  I thought, &quot;Hell, with how much this thing proced the last time, I'm gonna be near invulnerable to this little guy for a full minute&quot;.  It did not proc once.  Not once at all.<br />
<br />
Next few times I used it, it proced once in the entire minute.<br />
<br />
Few more completely void of a single proc uses at later dates after that.<br />
<br />
One time in Grieg's end helping my friend powerlevel his little mage, I used it and was completely invulnerable to the mob for 1 minute.  Proced constantly again like it did the first time I used it.<br />
<br />
I've used it a lot off and on since then.  Everytime I've used it, it either didn't proc at all, proced once or twice in the entire minute, or proced constantly.  Never in between.<br />
<br />
I've seen it proc constant, almost every round, while having 129 DEX.  I've seen it not proc at all, not once, while having 315 DEX.<br />
<br />
The proc hasn't averaged well for me at all.  It's either been all or nothing.  Constant procs, or hardly any procs at all (far more no procs at all than hardly any procs).  It doesn't seem to be tied to DEX at all like normal procs are either from what I've been able to tell so far.<br />
<br />
This proc is nice when it actually procs, but it's a horrible &quot;gamble&quot;.  I'd never use this proc if I had furious or fortitude available.  It's a complete gamble whether it does anything at all.  It's a last chance, the very last thing you'll want to fall back on.  While it could save your life one time, the next it could do nothing but drain endurance.<br />
<br />
The drain it takes on endurance isn't really that big of a deal I don't think.  I mean, after all, I'm never gonna use the thing unless I have no other discs left to use with my characters life on the line.  So it could use my entire endurance bar for all I care, cause if it actually works I've been saved and have no discs left to use endurance on anyway.  But if it doesn't proc at all (which has been often) I'm gonna have whatever endurance that's available after a rez anyway... so it's endurance cost is moot as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />

XTC is the one who flurries like a ninja on speed right?  Could be worthwhile using this on that kind of mob...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait a minute, do I have how Aura of Runes works completely backwards?  Is it my hits that proc the rune?  Or is it the mobs hitting me that procs the rune?<br />
<br />
If it's the mobs hits to me that procs it, this would make the &quot;procs constantly&quot; and &quot;never procs&quot; constant streaks I've been seeing totally make sense.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This isnt a bad disc. It procs enough so that for that minute you mitigate a fair amount of damage (I'd say on average 2800 points). Also, self runing traditionally draws aggro. I'm guessing this disc increases aggro, ,but I have no idea if it does. If so, it makes it more useful.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I'd like the proc rate to be gauranteed high, with less endurance used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah based on what I've heard about the new discs I plan on getting Bazu Bellow ASAP and only getting the other ones if a rune is going to rot.  I can't see even rolling for them against people in pickup groups unless it's another melee type.  Savage Onslaught could have been nice if it was better than Fellstrike but it's not.  I rarely have enough endurance to use Fellstrike consistently so there's no way I'll have enough for both Fellstrike AND Savage Onslaught.  Savage Onslaught should have been a combination of mighty strike or charge and auto crip.  Then it would have been cool and an actual upgrade to Fellstrike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corpsed</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Savage is not a bad disc.  I use it every day on raids for when I am not the MA and fellstrike is down, extra DPS every 10 minutes or so is great for something easily acquired by a pick up group in WoS.  If it was really hard to get I wouldnt bother,but  risk versus reward I have no problem with it.  Less endurance use would be nice but in current state it is still useful.  Keep in mind these  droppable runes will be 5k in a month or two, they just seem more valuable because everyone needs them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most procs I've seen from Aura of Runes has been 6. I only use it to absorb some AE damage, and then not if I'm going to be needed to tank anything big in next 10 minutes or so. Seems to eat about 35-40% of my endurance pool.<br />
<br />
Savage Onslaught is a disappointment for the cost of it. Costs signifigantly more than Fellstrike, and My max crit while using it has been less than my max crip with Fellstrike, though that may just be because I have not hit a great roll on the RNG. Should have saved the Rune and given it to my g/f's Cleric</div></div><hr />

Yeah I got mixed up there thinking the disc was based on the mob attacking you and mixed up the mob.  Never mind.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.</div></div><hr />
