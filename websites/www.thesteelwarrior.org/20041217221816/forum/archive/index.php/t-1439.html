<br />
He attacked for like an hour.. but he's kind of a wuss, which it really had to be to make the test long enough to be meaningful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh,<br />
<br />
I ment &quot;Did you clear aggro between each AE taunt or did you do them all from one spawn w/o killing the mob or using the zone line?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess the answer is no then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No,<br />
<br />
It was a single mob, I didn't attack (I'm KOS to seru mobs), I simply taunted over and over and over and over, counted the # of attempts, the number of success messages and reported them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those con blue to yellow to a level 28 twink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, just under 60% success against a green con mob.  I believe it's reasonable to assume that a blue or even con would have had a lower success rate.  Which means that taunt really is undependable, as we've always known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you really think that taunt rate vary's by level? I seem to get the same percentage to blue and even red mobs. This is a matter of feeling as I have never parsed it, and yes I do use taunt :) some habbits die hard hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you really think that taunt rate vary's by level?<br />
<br />
It's reasonable to believe so, because of course taunt is skill based, which means that as you go up in level the skill increases in performance.  It's somewhat doubtful that a level 28 Warrior would have the same taunt success rate against a level 28 mob that a level 65 Warrior would have.  And I find it even more difficult to believe that a level 28 Warrior would have anywhere near the success against a level 65 mob that a level 65 Warrior would have.<br />
<br />
Additionally at one time it was not possible to successfully taunt a white, yellow, or red con mob at all unless you were already level 60.  So a level 59 Warrior could not taunt a level 60 mob successfully, period.  Which seems to indicate that they have a means in place to consider the level of the taunter.<br />
<br />
Therefore I would believe until shown otherwise that a Warrior's success at taunt varies to some degree depending on the level of the mob he is taunting in comparison to his level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bah jsut read the last line again hehe<br />
<br />
but there i would disagree as I belive tuant sucsess or failure is dependent on player skill level not mod level I could be wrong but untill shown otherwise I would be the oposite of you :)<br />
<br />
oh and I have been wrong before actually I am wrong a lot just saying I seem to taunt a mob about the same no matter what level the mob is. but my taunt skill a bit lower then yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah but I would reason that the only check is can player have a chance at a sucessfult taunt of mob? if yes use skill level if no ignore taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your skill in taunt was max Im assuming as well, Frodin?</div></div><hr />

<br />
*However*<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong the majority of problems seem to be in the PoP, and in my experience (with lower taunt cap) Taunt works much more then 40% of the time there. Taunt might be zone, or mob specefic, it would be interseting to see a test in PoP about taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, skill is maxed.<br />
<br />
Apothes, yes, there's a level based difference, but i don't know where the cutoff is.    I know that many moons ago it went from 30ish percent success on blue con mobs to 8% success on even con mobs or higher.    Since the changes I can't presume to say that I know what that is, but there has definitely been a level based difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Madrone,<br />
<br />
One cannot do a functional test in PoP because of a lack of a successful taunt message on any mob.   You'd have to do a &quot;taunt/get aggro&quot; comparison and on mobs that are doing that kind of damage, there would be too many factors (i.e. Heal aggro, slow aggro etc) to make a reliable test.   The *only* valid way to perform a taunt test is to have a success message.     <br />
<br />
I think that saying &quot;in this expansion taunt is harder than the other&quot; isn't really adequate because there's no evidence either way, but from my &quot;feel&quot;, I'd say it's about the same, just can't really prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In combat it's difficult to tell wether the mob turned to you because of taunt working or if it was simply down to other factors like proximity or your aggro output... I wonder how many times taunt seems to work but it was some other factor?</div></div><hr />

I stand corrected :) as I said it just felt taunt was workin close to the same never actualy parsed it.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, for some reason that would make me feel more comfortable lol, even better make it spam out where the group can see it that way they see me try to taunt the mob off the chanter 243233 times without sucess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We should never fail taunt at a higher rate than fizzles...<br />
and if we do it should have a seperate fizzle reset rate...<br />
<br />
If no one can prove its broken, then they can claim it is working.<br />
<br />
With no pass/fail message there is no accountability</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice test Frod.  Kinda sad taunt only works 60% of the time on low green mobs.  Personally, I too would love it if they would give us a different message for a failure.  Though, they may not do that simply because they don't want us to know how much it sucks =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One part I have wondered for a long time: Does taunt have a  max number it can add to your hate, or possibly that there is a partial landing, like a partial resist to a DD?  (if so it would negate the ability to make a fail message) I am pretty sure AET doesnt, but does regular old taunt?  I have done a few groups with a SK or Ranger that I could not turn the mob to save my bloody life.  5, 6, 7, taunts.  I refuse to believe I failed that many times (hope is all that keeps us going).  I know it could have put me at the top and him just gotten ahead of me that fast, but the mob did not even TURN to me (I always fight facing casters to see turn).  Might have been a fluke and failed that much (if my shm can fizzle cani 4 in a row /shrug).  If anyone knows if there is a cap to the amount of hate Taunt can add to you to get you to the top or if it may just be partially resisted, I would be much obliged to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incidentally, most of the success/non success was together... I'd have 4-6 successful taunts in a row, then it'd be on/off.. then all of a sudden, 4-5 failures in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60% is about around what Taunt's speculated success rate was during a post I saw in Velious age.<br />
<br />
Sad they won't upgrade it isn't it.  At least it didn't go down.<br />
<br />
Once again if Enchanters performed CC at a 60% success rate people would gradually stop relying on just it and work around it with their own stop gap measures.  Its not reasonable for any class to work under this kind of failure rate.</div></div><hr />

100 attepts<br />
42 successes</div></div><hr />

That reminds me of a lil' something called a &quot;streaky&quot; RNG~<br />
<br />
Taunting a level 65 Valorian Guardian (non kos to start).<br />
<br />
Everytime it agro'd, I zoned.<br />
<br />
100 attepts<br />
42 successes<br />
<br />
So~ 60% for a green mob and ~40% for an even mob would make it be in the low-mid 50% for a blue mob?<br />
<br />
Well at least it's not 5% :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do it 50, someone else does it 50, someone else does it 50, so on we can get a good batch of numbers.<br />
<br />
Where is there a non kos red con near a zone in pop?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is that suit of armor in the pov Graveyard.I am pretty sure he is red to 65...<br />
<br />
<br />
Askr in bot would be optimal but I believe he is blue to me...<br />
<br />
I spose maybe if you had a bored Enchanter friend along you could have him MemBlur?<br />
<br />
A Shadowknight could test this indefinantly by simply FDing on a succesful  Taunt,While that is not a measure of Warrior taunt I would be interested t osee what SK taunt skill is like..</div></div><hr />
