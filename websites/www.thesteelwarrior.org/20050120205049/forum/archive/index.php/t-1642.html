    * You drop DM500 (about US$250) on games in front of about 12 kids and then say &quot;I remember being that age and saving for two weeks to buy a mini and hating the adults that came in and spent a couple hundred dollars on game stuff.&quot;<br />

I still laugh about that.  I had a very similar incident when my friends had talked me into playing D+D a long time ago.  We came across a sarcophagus and it wasn't described to me very well.  Being the adventerous type who liked discovering new loot I tried to open it with no success.  Then I tied a rope around it intent on dragging it out of the dungeon.  Apparently I upset some NPC's by my attempts to remove it.  Needless to say I could have wallpapered a room with versions of that character, LOL.  He was much like a kunark era ranger, good for taking DT's.<br />
<br />
My friends and I still get a chuckle sometimes out of this story.</div></div><hr />

I was and am an anti-more-sides-than-normal-dice-need game guy.  Yeah.  I've hated all that crap as long as I can remember.  But then I slipped up about 5 years ago - I broke down and played friggin Car Wars.  Bleh.<br />
<br />
So then I started making fun of my friends and some family members about EverQuest, man, I used to just tear into them.<br />
<br />
Now, I play EQ, I dream EQ, and I say shit like 'Your Faction with Wife_01 could not possibly get any worse', or 'You've become better at 2H TYPING! (2)'<br />
<br />
Yeah - I need to either slash my wrists or quit EQ.<br />

Damnit, I can't seem to do either - my skill at Wrist Slashing is Awful and my skill at quitting EQ is still only Feeble.<br />
