<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stinginfool</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  I inherited a 65 War from a friend who has retired.<br />
I've been 3 boxing LDoN &quot;solo&quot; with a bard and cleric.<br />
I was using Evasive, but I just found out about Stonewall, so will be using that now, since it only reduces movement and gets rid of crits.<br />
I haven't had any agro problems with plain old taunt, so doesn't look like I need to worry about Incite.<br />
So my main question would be regarding offensive discs.  Any reason not to use Aggressive, or another one?</div></div><hr />

I've been thinking about trying some LDoN normals with my 65war and botting friends 65 cleric and shaman but dunno if I would have the dps to really win them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stinginfool</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've won 2 of the 4 I tried.  They were all collections of around 25 items.  The two I lost I were purely because of gating mobs that resisted bard mez too many times, and brought back friends.  Only needed 2 more on one I lost, so finished that one up for consolation points.  The other I lost had 4 wizards in one room, so I decided to pass.  So definitely doable, just need to figure out stratagies for adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stratys</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that can help when doing LDoN's with a small group: if you have the healing power to do so, don't slow the mobs. use the best DS you have access to and have the cleric MoR the mobs when possible to add to the damage taken by the mob. You will burn through more healer mana this way, but if you can do so without adding down time, the added DPS can be a very significant factor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have the plat, toss in a Kilva DS potion also...between the potion, bard songs, and cleric DS, that's a lot of dmg every time the mob hits the warrior.</div></div><hr />

The kilva tip is an excellent one for groups were your dps is lacking (usually use 1-2 charges until decent progress into the Ldon has been made).  I usually hold the furious disc until it is absolutely needed and it will cause major difficulties to res (time runing low etc).  Usually a death in ldon is like a 30 sec recovery if only the warr dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stinginfool</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will definitely have to give that a try.  I was doing MoR and singing DS, but I was also slowing and didn't have potions.  Mana was fine without KEI and doing Condemnation at 20%.  Only problem would be snaring runners, since Bard snare = slow.  Maybe I'll just have cleric root at 20% instead of nuke.  Then it will continue to beat itself to death on the warrior.  ;)</div></div><hr />
