<br />
If you use say HP5 and AC5 is it a one time charge or does it deplete your points over time?<br />
<br />
If you're KOS to your hometown can you use any tribute master?<br />
<br />
How many hp's does HP5 add?  Same question for AC5?</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP5 is 100hp but stacks with effects like nd3 so I thin if you have all the aa's it's 150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's more around 117 hp with all the aa's. If we got 50% hp boost fromaa's I'd have over 6000 hp unbuffed right now :P<br />
<br />
ND3 - 10%<br />
PD3 - 4.5%<br />
PE - 2% ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morimoto</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP5 gives 150hp, and costs 21 tribue points per 10 minutes.  Think I've had it on non-stop since GoD came out and have only gone through about 30k tribute on it (Its the only one I use).<br />
<br />
Best, most efficient method I've found for keeping tribute points up is to farm plat, then search through bazaar stuff to find items that sell for less than their tribute value.  Lucy includes tribute worth on item profiles so I just kinda click through until I find something with a good markup.<br />
<br />
A few regulars:  <br />
Prelates Lantern, sells for 4500 or so on Lanys, tribute value just over 9k.<br />
Architects Bejewled Chestplate, sells for 12kish, tribute value over 24k.<br />
<br />
Between stuff like that and handing in just about every crappy item I win from normal difficulty LDoNs, I've been able to maintain a comfortable buffer of points all the time without much trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bought 1 for 10k last night and got 27k in Trib points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use tribute HP at all times. The tribute alone gives 150, but it raises my hp by 175. So it is not a flat amount. My magelo is accurate to my HP's, if tribute is off. Magelo shows 6531. In game I have over 6.7k. can't remember exact number. So I would asusme the tribute HP are affect my aa.</div></div><hr />

On zeb I have bough Bp's for 5k, then gotten over 20k tribute. Seems to be the best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as your tribute points last.  For instance, if you have 5000 points banked, and have HP5 &amp; AC5, for a total of 60pts (rough estimate).  Every 10 mins you are going to be charged 60 points.  <br />
<br />
So in one hour, you will be charged: <br />
<br />
 60 x 6 = 360 pts.  <br />
<br />
For 5000 pts you have total in tribute system remaining, these 2 effects would last you approximately: <br />
 <br />
 5000/360 = 13.88 hours.<br />
<br />
Hope this explains tribute system.  Its a nice way of getting effects/bonuses/zists, but you have to keep it going by giving loot away.  LDON hard loot can really help in this aspect.</div></div><hr />
