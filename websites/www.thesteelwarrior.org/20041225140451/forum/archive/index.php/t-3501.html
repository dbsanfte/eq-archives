<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thinking about it, I don't think it is good for the game for _anyone_ to have &quot;insta agro lock from range&quot;.  People talk about how they can nuke harder, slow on incoming, debuff instantly and generally play sloppy and not have to watch their agro.<br />
<br />
This is bad.<br />
<br />
Playing sloppy should always have repercussions.  In the days of yore if you overnuked, your caster got creamed.  There shouldn't be situations where this has changed.  Why? To me, it would take the fun, excitement and challenge out of the hunt.<br />
<br />
The hunt being the pursuit of the best way to fight, eeking the most out of your abilities to find more ways to do damage without grabbing agro.<br />
<br />
It just seems to me that no one should have &quot;insta agro lock - be it at range or up close&quot;.  Overall just seems bad for the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
Does this mean Knights need to be nurfed?  Probably.  Do Warriors really need to be buffed up in terms of agro management? I would say not.  The EQ team sucked it up with the Mod Rod nurf and Manaburn (and dare I say Monk mitigation nurf), just suck it up again - but try not to swing the damn bat too hard and throw things out of whack the other way, ok?<br />

<br />
It takes the sense of adventure out of the game. Looking at it from a warrior's perspective, and not generally paired with a knight, I sometimes enjoy the ping-pong and chasing of mobs. I know, I know, it's not ultra-productive but it does make me stay on my toes. It makes me feel like I might not win 100% of time as long as the right support classes are around.<br />
<br />
Now most people look at it as a bad thing because other classes can trivialize this aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
If you never died it wouldn't be a game. Well, it might be a game like the Sims or something.</div></div><hr />

Ive got a very good friend who has a decent Beastlord,and I may as well give up trying to take aggro from him if he wants it..Taunt doesnt even work vs him and his warder</div></div><hr />

Then the only change needed would be to scale down the aggro generated from some Hybrid tank spells so that they would use the Taunt button and aggro weapons as well. See, I don't favor aggro lock by anyone 8).<br />
<br />
Seriously - there are about a half-dozen high level encounters that are usually MT'd by Paladins who use stuns and root to hold aggro. It's only fair to preserve these and the Paladin's alternate method of doing aggro.<br />
<br />
However, the alternative method can't be vastly superior in experiance groups. That's the only real issue.<br />

Some how Knights are too good, Warriors aren't good enough, and the game will be much better off if Casters not only ran circles around Melee but completely replaced them.  There can never been strong melee centric tactics in the game because that would gimp out EQ.  But hey caster centric tactics are a-okay!<br />

Casters don't overnuke because they have strong tanks.  They over nuke because they have large mana pools and super efficient spells.  Freed from the original limitation, their mana poo, efficiencyl and regen, a Caster sees that they've dished some serious damage and yet only spent less than 10% of their mana.  Why should they hold back?<br />

Casters gravitate towards Knights because we now complement their huge capibilities.  We didn't enable Casters, they were already that powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Groupset A: Warrior tanks.<br />

 Groupset B, as has been demonstrated by personal accounts from ALL classes, casters get MORE freedom to use big spells. Do you agree or disagree?</div></div><hr />

Casters overnuke because they can.  After dishing a lot of damage, seeing that they only blew 5% of their mana, why should they hold back?<br />

Death by far is the stupidest mechanism for cost.  Death can be avoided you know.<br />
<br />
But hey, there is that correlary with Knights helping Casters do that so it must be true!<br />

Why should they hold back?<br />
<br />
This is true.  SoE has systematically increased caster mana pool, mana regen, and mana efficiency through focus effects and improved spells.  I would make the analogy that casters have gone from being a corvette to a porshe.  Their top speed is much higher than before.  While pure melee are pretty much the same beat up old chevy they've always been, with very few enhancements.  And the enhancements they have gotten haven't kept pace at all.  Giving casters huge potential over three expansions and then requiring them to maintain the same relative effectiveness as prior to the enhancements is like owning a porshe and being told that under no circumstances will you go over 55 miles an hour.  Any wonder that the casters frequently want to go off by themselves and put the peddle to the metal?<br />
<br />
Groupset B, as has been demonstrated by personal accounts from ALL classes, casters get MORE freedom to use big spells. Do you agree or disagree?<br />
<br />
And this is also true, Groupset B allows the casters to open the throttle up and reach close to their full potential.  Now the question really is this.  Should casters be allowed to use most of their new potential?  Or are those going to be empty enhancements that really only count when soloing?  Because nerfing Knights and not improving Warriors will do exactly that, make all the caster enhancements look good on paper, but make most of them unusable at anywhere near full effectiveness.  I imagine that casters won't like owning a porshe and not being able to go over the speed limit of 55, what do you think?<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, increasing Warrior aggro control to some degree is really the only viable option that doesn't cripple someone.</div></div><hr />

Where are your figures on this? How many casters are saying they can't use their spells with a warrior tank? They are saying they cannot use them with no concern over aggro, that's not the same as not using at all.</div></div><hr />

Whatever.  It seems to be some this is plain old class envy.  You guys aren't even choosing the right target to be envious over.  <br />
<br />
The thing is this Aeka...<br />
<br />
Casters have always solo'd, they still do...<br />
<br />
Warriors have always needed to group, they still do...<br />
<br />
Casters getting more power hasn't prevented warriors from grouping...<br />
<br />
KNIGHT-ONLY AGGRO-LOCK HAS prevented warriors from grouping.<br />
<br />
I dont like aggro-lock, i think it completely and overly trivializes the experience game. But then since Luclin, exp has become trivial for all classes except pure melee...<br />
<br />
The game has evolved, it is no longer meant to be a challenge, the nexus, PoK, respawn with equipment etc.. it is an easier and easier game at the lower levels. I dont like aggro-lock, but I guess I would have to learn to live with it.<br />
<br />
The solution.. Give warriors a new skill, this skill would have the same range, and reset time as long as a paladins stun spell, and woudl add +hate equal to a normal paladin stun. <br />
<br />
Force of Akilae  Stun(4.00 sec/65)   Casting time: 1 Recast Time: 12 Range: 200 <br />
 <br />
So the warrior would would be able to use this + hate ever 13 seconds up to a range of 200...<br />
<br />
Problem solved..<br />
<br />
Any comments Aeka?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll provide them when you provide figures showing that in fact Casters can reach close to their full potential with a Warrior tanking.  I mean come on Valeris, if they could, why would they be taking Knights all over the place?  Logically the very fact that Paladins are preferred implies that with Warriors casters aren't getting their full effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you define as full potential Glatius? Full burn every time?<br />
Aggro is a cost associated with spellcasting for a reason - so that casters must exercise some judgement about applying their power - they are not supposed to use their 'full potential' without a large amount of personal risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you define as full potential Glatius? Full burn every time?<br />
<br />
I define as close to full potential when you can use a DoT or two early in a fight and not be tanking as a result.   I define as close to full potential when you can actually use your mana rather than having your mana bar always stay at 80% or above because you can't really dump any damage.  I define as close to full potential when you can actually debuff a mob, as many times you must, without getting a beat down most of the time.<br />
<br />
I think casters should be able to use their mana, not necessarily abuse it.   Dropping 5 big nukes one after another on a single mob is abuse.  Dropping a slow on a mob, or a dot near the start of a fight, or trying other debuffs, is not.  Why should having a mana bar and wanting to use it within reason be something people are penalized for?  After all, with all the mana enhancements SoE has made, they must want people to actually use all that extra mana, right?  Otherwise they've pissed away a lot of time making improvements which are next to worthless unless soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea is that if Knights didn't exist, Casters would be just as powerful and Warriors would still be in the same mire they currently inhabbit.<br />
<br />
A Caster sitting at 90% mana, with their caster regen, is going to put up with working with a Warrior tanks?  The answer is no they wouldn't.  In fact they would use Rangers and charmed pets instead.<br />
<br />
Keeping Casters in check with a threat of dying due to poor agro control is a backwards tactic at best.  It depends on something that might happen instead of a direct consequence.  Remember Casters can avoid dealing with it all together with soloing.  No, if you want to control Casters you tune the effects.  The possibility of dying is a hollow threat and avoidable with just the spells they have.</div></div><hr />

Why, you can argue. But it's obvious that aggro is a negative factor in battle, has been since day one. Of course, now that people are looking at a Paladin ability that is obviously overpowered, you want to change that. Bit late, dollar short, old man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the other great fallacy, that death is too inconvenient a penalty and should be removed from the game. Without penalties for mistakes where is the reason to play? Personally I want there to be risk of death and if everything is fully predictable where is the chance of that? Death with a warrior tanking isn't really that random actually, it's simply more of a challenge to gauge when you can afford to cast. You can argue that taunt from the baseline provided by a warrior needs some improvement from where it is now and I'll agree with you, but removing aggro as a check from the equation entirely? No way. <br />
<br />
In any case a mob beating on someone it shouldn't is one of the few occasions when parties have to show some small amount of  skill and react to a threat, but lets remove that too huh? Why the hell do you people play? <br />
<br />
What Sony needs to do for people like aeka is provide a patch whereby a little pop up box appears on your screen as a mob is incoming to ask you wether you wish to fight it or proceed on automatic, that way she can go back to the important business of watching the TV while the mob dies without any of that pesky inconvenience of pressing a few buttons and *shock horror* loosing full control of the mob. :p<br />
<br />
I have to agree with Aeka to a degree here. The only way to fix aggro so everyone is worried about aggro control is to nerf all aggro from all hybrid spells which I do not think is a realistic thing to ask of them now.

<br />
I don't give a shit personally :) They should fix their goddamn game. <br />
<br />
Even if they don't change things across the board (probably best from a theoretical viewpoint) and limit this to plate tank classes and even if elemental clad, fully AA'd, Lvl 65 beastlords and rangers do fine tanking and you don't notice a mana drain from healing with 'em tanking I would speculate that that is not going to be the basic group make up for most people for a long time yet. Are beastlords tanking in elemental planes? If a Beastlord or ranger has put that much time into his toon I personally reckon good luck to 'em if they want to tank in Valor. Bet level 60 rangers with full AA's in luclin tanked pretty well in Maidens eye? Did that remove a demand for plate tanks to tank?  Same difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just going to re-emphasise this paragraph for Glatius before we get another ranting diatribe on how terribly awfully random it is that taunt fails on him occasionally and that not enough means are provided for him to gain it back.

<br />
A Caster sitting at 90% mana, with their caster regen, is going to put up with working with a Warrior tanks? The answer is no they wouldn't. In fact they would use Rangers and charmed pets instead.<br />
<br />
You've already stated that casters are overpowered compared with melee is it not possible that they are out of thier design limits for the environment also? The conclusion that because lots of highly equipped FT15 casters have more mana than they can use they are supposed to be able to use it to the full is not quite as firmly based as you think. If the cost of letting them use it to the full is removal of all checks upon their power then that is not a game balanced choice. <br />
<br />
At this time a mob can have its attack speed reduced to a fraction of it's full potential before it even enters combat and, with knight aggro, the caster of that spell faces 'no' threat at all (not even the threat of inconvenience - because death is far from a certainty with a vaguely competent group). Waffle around the issue as much as you like, that isn't 'working as intended' or why on earth place an aggro cost on the spell in the first place?</div></div><hr />

 I see no way to take that other than as a personal criticism.  So take your &quot;Read it whatever way you prefer Glatius&quot; and blow it out your ass. <br />
<br />
You think the game is too easy given Knight aggro generation?  Great.  Bully for you.  So freaking what?  Yours is not the only opinion in the universe.  Nor is it the only valid opinion in the universe.  And frankly, I don't see large numbers of threads on other boards talking about how horrible the game is now with Knight aggro generation.   Instead what I see is people saying lose the Warrior and get the Knight.  Because it's more challenge?  No.  Because it's easier.  So your opinion doesn't even seem to be the predominate one.<br />
<br />
People play the game so that at the end of the night they feel something positive about having played it.  What you consider too easy, lots of people consider just right.  What you consider too boring, many people are fine with.  But please, lets change the game to suit Valeris, because of course his is the only perspective that has merit.  Bullshit.<br />

I don't need to tell you which ones pays better exp.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of logic I'm trying to break in Warriors.  If Warriors want to be perceived as &quot;group friendly&quot; then you guys need to stop trying to push the idea that people need to be punished for taking any tank into their group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why on earth do people group warriors as main tank at all at this time if we're so amazingly 'group unfriendly'? <br />
<br />
The reason why I find this logic funny is that it boils down to this: If you use a tank no one in your group can ever be safe.<br />
<br />
Nobody is 'safe' when they're soloing either. <br />
<br />
Why do casters group up at all? At least in part it's because when the chips are down the only mob control that counts is a solid body to take the pounding. Should that tank have unshakeable aggro control? Hell no or what is there for the tank or the group to keep things interesting?<br />
<br />
 You've told me in the past that exp in your opinion should be trivial, you just want to watch the TV while whipping through the AA points so you can get back to the real game - raiding. My real game is exping (when i play at all) should it be trivialised to suit your particular viewpoint? People moan and gripe already about people in LDoN adventures that do not understand or play their characters well, without some penalty for poor performance why should they bother to learn their character at all? <br />
<br />
 Cold hard truth is penalties must exist to give any meaning to the experience or it becomes exactly what you've previously stated you desire - a pointless dronefest. To stretch the point, it can be argued that 'dumbing down' the game devalues the 'skill' of good players. <br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting there's anything too leet about me or my playstyle or that there is a massive amount of skill required to play but even so there is more to a 'good' warrior than mashing his taunt button and the thing that makes this difference visible and valuable is how he deals with imperfect aggro control.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough in parallel to this point,  part of the reason paladins secondary healing and etc is not greatly valued is because of the player base breaking down the challenge level of any encounter via single pulling and similar tactics - has it benefitted the enjoyment factor of the exp game? To my viewpoint the answer is no.<br />
<br />
It may make for great exp but last time I checked that little blue bar didn't provide me with massive amounts of satisfaction on its own, frankly grind groups in the planar dreadlands are boring enough without reducing tanking to 2 presses of a button and watching the mob stick to me like glue.<br />

<br />
 You seem to have an aversion to this whole 'death' thing. Why?<br />
<br />
 You accept risk with ANYTHING you do in life. Hell, sitting at my computer, I may get flash fried from dousing my monitor reading one of Chavr's comments. (Sorry, unserious moment.)<br />
<br />
 Anyways, death should be known and understood as a part of the game from the very first time you got beat down by a moss snake. You can minimize the chance of it happening by grouping, you can minimize the loss with rezzes, but shit happens. It only happens more often when you do stupid shit you're not supposed to, like pulling 5 when the chanter is OOM or throwing Starfire on AoW on incoming.<br />
<br />
 Aggro lock covers for stupid shit. What you're telling me and people on this board is that being a Paladin makes it OK for your groupies to be stupid. But then, you say that Warriors getting that aggro lock makes the game TOO easy. Maybe it needs to be LESS easy, and weed out the stupid people. Like in the old days, when they all rolled druids and quadded at zone lines.<br />
<br />
 To sum up: People being stupid is NOT a good reason for aggro lock. Come to think, NOTHING is a good reason for aggro lock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You started this exchange, so don't try and take the high moral road.  Hypocrit.<br />
<br />
Tens of thousands of people play EQ these days.  And they play in certain ways.  Most of them seemingly enjoy it.  To advocate detrimentally impacting the playing experience of not only every person who plays a Paladin and a Shadow Knight, but also every person who groups with them regularly, based on the opinion of Valeris and a hand full of other Warriors is the height of arrogance. <br />
<br />
And it smacks of being a poor business decision on SoE's part, if they were to entertain such a measure.  Pissing off tens of thousands of customers to placate a small hand full of other customers just can't be good for business.<br />
<br />
You think the game has been made too easy?  Fine, you're entitled to that opinion.  You have options.  You can find another game.  You can find a group of like minded people and group with them, adding more challenges to your play.  You can do a number of things that are under your control.  And while you may have the right to voice your opinion that everyone else needs to adhere to your standards of challenge and difficulty, you don't have the right to impose it on them.  They're paying customers too.  And have the right to be left the hell alone to play the game in a way that's enjoyable to them.  The very way SoE has made it available to them.<br />
<br />
People talk all the time about &quot;for the good of the game&quot;.  You know what's good for the game?  Not having a vocal few rain on the parade of a huge number of people who are doing nothing more than exactly what they're supposed to do.  Grouping up and killing things for experience.  We're not talking AE groups.  We're not talking DC Enchanters who go around taking out mini-bosses.  We're not talking Bards who can take down an entire zone.  We're talking a group based on a tank, a healer, a slower, and 3 others, going out and playing the game exactly the way it's intended.  Claiming this is too easy, when there are so many other approaches to the game that are even easier, is pretty asinine.<br />
<br />
I've always advocated Warrior improvements, in hopes of improving my playing experience and the playing experience of those who group with me.  I don't advocate detrimental changes to Knights just because a few people think they have it too easy.  I want parity, but would prefer it not come at the expense of other people's playing experience.  I'm looking to improve my situation, not ruin other people's.<br />
<br />
But I can see that I'm beginning to be in the minority in that position here on this board.  And I also see that I'm beginning to be sniped at because of that position.  Oh, of course, they'll claim that it's because I can rant on occassion, but if they agreed with my rant they'd applaud, rather than taking pot shots.<br />
<br />
So I'll be taking my unwelcome opinion elsewhere.  Apparently here on TSW nerf is the word of the day.  And anyone who thinks Warriors should be improved but Knights not penalized, in order to generate reasonable parity, is now a TSW pariah.  So be it.  Good luck on the nerf campaign.  I'm sure everyone will thank you, if you're successful, for making their playing experience so much more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

Guess what fraction of that 100k it cost a knight to get his 60-65 spells in the bazaar (assuming he didn't pic em up off the ground as he was grinding to 65) ;) Whilst I'd never throw away my BoC (gotten the old fashioned way off AoW :p) it is by no means as reliable an aggro producer as a pally stun eh?</div></div><hr />

Maybe Im the only warrior that tells Paladins and SK's to knock stuff off but it seems to work well ;)<br />

<br />
Some things mentioned are wierd.  When a Warrior achieves agro lock its good.  But when a Knight achieves stability that is bad, evil and wrong.  Somehow relying on Taunt + procs is some level of desirable skill compared to what Knights field. *shrug*<br />
<br />
The other idea is just plain masocistic.   The idea that you should be in constant threat when using a tank.  By definition, what purpose is the purpose of the tank if he or she isn't there to keep the casters safe?  I honestly don't get it.  You might as well just root the monster out there and nuke it down.<br />
<br />
Everyone forgets that 5 other people are in the group expecting you to pull your weight in keeping the group going forward.  Why are Warriors expecting the 5 others in the group doing the Warrior's job for them?  You guys can think its the lazy caster that is causing problems.  Would they be just as right in saying Warriors are just ineffective?<br />
<br />
When I am tanking I am doing my job by keeping the monster from wandering around.  Some of you talk as if you don't want this at all.  If that isn't the case, then what in the world is your idea of tanking?</div></div><hr />

I'm not in favor of a nerf. I am in favor of snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro for Warriors. No one has been rude to me because I'm opposed to a nerf.<br />
<br />
The problem with this debate is that SoE's actions tells us their position - we just don't want to hear it and they feel it's better not to come right out and say it.<br />
<br />
We've written 1,000,000 or so words on class balance. SoE repeats the same future plans message for months on end with no mention of Warrior aggro control. In responce to our 1,000,000 words of concern how many words have they managed to reply? 100? 10? Utter silence?<br />
<br />
They will not nerf Paladins. They will not make Warrior aggro control competative in groups. These are not the droids you are looking for.<br />

 In a group, everyone props each OTHER up. If the slower does HIS job, the mob has much less chance to kill the group. If the healer does HIS job, the group survives encounters a lot longer. If the crowd control does HIS job, overpulls don't kill the group. And, likewise, if the tank does HIS job, the folks in the second rank don't take the beating he absorbs and allows them to do their job.<br />
<br />
 However, the tank, if he does NOT have a spellbook, can do the damnedest bit of tanking you've ever seen, and fail because the RNG does not smile on him. No, we DON'T think Taunt + procs is a skill level. Taunt should work better, for one. Secondly, I don't know a Warrior in game who really WANTS to be slave to a proc. All the ones I know want to do their damn job WITHOUT a crutch.<br />
<br />
The other idea is just plain masocistic. The idea that you should be in constant threat when using a tank. By definition, what purpose is the purpose of the tank if he or she isn't there to keep the casters safe? I honestly don't get it. You might as well just root the monster out there and nuke it down. <br />
<br />
 Aeka, that's what tanking IS. It's not a Root spell, it's the tank holding the mob in position so the rest of the group can 'nuke it down'. Right now, Paladins can do this. SK's can do this. Warriors cannot without prayers to the Gods of Dice Rolls. That's why we're all for Taunt to be fixed. Get rid of the damn ChoS's, BoC's, and BoW's. Let us be like Knights and use weapons we WANT to use because we like the effect or like the ratio, rather than be tied to the damn EB millstone.<br />
<br />
 With Paladin stuns, my contention is they give up too damn little for aggro. They give up less than SK's for it, certainly. And if you want bonuses, there should be penalties. The penalty for being a Warrior is you don't get a spellbook. The penalty for SK's is they are demonstrably more fragile than Warriors. Paladins, OTOH, get much more durability than an SK and give up NO aggro generation to do so. That's not 'balance'.<br />
<br />
 Everyone forgets that 5 other people are in the group expecting you to pull your weight in keeping the group going forward. Why are Warriors expecting the 5 others in the group doing the Warrior's job for them? You guys can think its the lazy caster that is causing problems. Would they be just as right in saying Warriors are just ineffective? <br />
<br />
 Pretty goddamned insulting, aren't we.<br />
<br />
 Yes, Aeka, Warriors ARE ineffective at aggro generation. As you have said before, we always HAVE been. Despite that, though, we brought to the table in olden times simply the best 'getting beat on' ability that there was. THAT was our hook for getting groups, that we were MUCH lower maintenance tanks than any other type out there.<br />
<br />
 Nowadays, in the days of screwy itemization, better buffs, and defensive AA's for all, that argument is gone. Combined with the changes in the game on the NPC side, aggro generation is the key to tank desirability.<br />
<br />
 If you bump Warriors up to aggro 'parity' with Knights, you have the trivialization of large amounts of content.<br />
<br />
 If you reduce Paladin 'getting beat on' ability, you take away any gains they've made to become viable.<br />
<br />
 If you bump Warrior 'getting beat on' ability to counter the aggro advantage, you not only trivialize raid content (Where everyone is happy, I'll note, to watch their aggro. I'm not sure how people expect the base idea to be different in XP groups.), but you also do nothing to fix the reason WHY they're not getting groups.<br />
<br />
 Therefore, if you have 4 options, and A and C are gamebreaking, and B nullifies 2 1/2 years of work on the game.......and most importantly, D (Reducing Paladin 'aggro on demand') neither breaks content NOR reduces the ability of Paladins to get groups, while ENHANCING Warrior ability to get groups, then I'll go for D.<br />
<br />
 Fortunately, option D doesn't require much beyond getting Paladins to end casting low level spells they KNOW aren't sticking solely for aggro generation and using level appropriate spells. It doesn't even involve recoding more than that classes' spellbook. And with the ideas I presented to Romidar, they get a tradeoff of MORE raid utility AND an improved INNATE NON-SPELL based ability to hold aggro. Goddamned unreasonable, ain't it?</div></div><hr />

Some of you talk as if you don't want this at all. If that isn't the case, then what in the world is your idea of tanking?<br />
<br />
Yes, warriors should be able to do the job themselves -  as Myst said they can even now without requiring unbreakable aggro control.  <br />
<br />
If the tank has full control of a mob as soon as it comes into sight with nothing breaking it loose ever, where is the 'skill' for casters to exhibit or the trade off for casting however? Aggro is there because casters are expected to balance their power output (power includes debuffs, slows etc)against the aggro they generate. If the tanking character can garantee the mob never reacts to this then that limitation, designed into the game, becomes meaningless. For the game to reward a character for being played well, there has to be a possibility of failing to play well causing a problem. A tank cannot have an infallible hold on a mob without preventing the conditions that would cause this deliberate limitation to exhibit itself.<br />
<br />
 In order for the game to reward good play from the rest of the group the tank cannot be allowed to 'carry' the rest of the party due to his sublime control. Tanks should always seek to control the mob as much as possible obviously, however they should never have a simple mechanical control of the mobs attention. It's counterintuitive perhaps but the fact remains. in order for a caster to play well the possibility of lost aggro has to be a real threat. Tanks having full control is antithetical to that and whilst knights don't have a full lock, they have something close enough that it is extremely difficult for a 'poor' caster to overcome. That is not acceptable whilst retaining any 'balance' in caster power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeka,<br />
<br />
Myst has said a BoC with an Anger III augment holds aggro just fine. He didn't say it was aggro lock.<br />
<br />
I know being a Paladin you don't understand (or want to be honest about) the finer points.<br />
<br />
1. You have to get aggro before you can hold it. Paladins universally cast a stun on incoming (usually a couple of stuns). Even if they are resisted, these spells cause substantial aggro. They allow casters to start debufing and slowing on incoming without any danger. When the mob gets to camp it's already less dangerous.<br />
<br />
Warriors shoot an arrow and pray that it hits and that no one casts a spell on the incoming mob. The mob is not slowed and dangerous when it gets into camp. Should the mob start hitting someone (and btw undead mobs will hit the nearest person) the Warrior needs the Random Number Generator to give him a sucessful Taunt or two and a Proc or two. There is no message indicating when the Taunt button has worked and half the time it doesn't.<br />
<br />
OVERWHELMING PALADIN ADVANTAGE<br />
<br />
2. When a Warrior gets aggro, he holds it by staying in close contact with the mob, striking it (subjecting him to repostes and damage shields), getting ocassional procs at random times and using the Taunt button sparingly so that it is available when needed. All of this is tied to the ever fickle RNG.<br />
<br />
When a Paladin establishes aggro lock, he presses a button activating a macro that tries his stuns and automatically cast the first one available. He is only subject to the spell fizzle rate. A Paladin does not have to be in close contact with the mob in fact, he does not even need to swing his weapon.<br />
<br />
OVERWHELMING PALADIN ADVANTAGE<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes despite your best effort you lose aggro. Paladins need only to continue using their macro. Or, if they are VERY concern they can cast Wave of Marr which not only heals the victim of the mobs attentions but producess tremendeous aggro re-establishing their hold.<br />
<br />
Warriors have to re-establish close contact with the mob by chasing it (quite a trick given Gravel Rain, etc) and either pray for a proc or successful Taunt (with no message indicating the Taunt button did anything) or use AE Taunt which will now be unavailable for &quot;awhile&quot;.<br />
<br />
OVERWHELMING PALADIN ADVANTAGE<br />
<br />
4. When breaking mez - Warriors approach it, hit the Taunt button (with no indication ...), wait for it to refresh, hit the mob, and hit Taunt again (should their weapon fail to proc in the first couple of hits). Did I mention the RNG?<br />
<br />
Paladins can build up aggro with a couple of stuns, break mez with a stun that does damage, and have the mob come running halfway across the zone after them. Should someone foolishly interfer with this its a simple matter to cast a root or a stun and correct the matter.<br />
<br />
OVERWHELMING PALADIN ADVANTAGE<br />
<br />
Now concidering you yourself have posted your agreement that Warriors need snap aggro and ranged aggro, it's very very strange indeed that you come to life everytime a Warior with an aggro weapon and an Anger III proc says he has no trouble holding aggro.<br />
<br />
If the Warrior method of handling aggro is so fine then why don't you use it (you can you know) and why do the majority of posters on class boards disagree with you Aeka?<br />
<br />
I'll tell you what. I'd settle for Deepwater Bracer being PAL WAR/ALL. Do you support that Aeka?<br />
<br />
You know snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro is a sick advantage and you want Warriors to be the only tank class without it.<br />

<br />
Well first off a BoC doesn't help with initial aggro unless you get lucky.  Second very few people if any have 100k by level 47, especially from groups in Seb where lvl 47 warriors aren't really that wanted and even if they did somehow save up 100k on most servers BoC's either aren't for sale that often or sell for much more than that.<br />
<br />
Taunt needs to be fixed, it needs to add X aggro(I don't know what X should equal) everytime you mash it regardless of success.  Until thats done warriors will never be balanced at all levels of the game.  They may be balanced end game without it, but most certainly not at the lower end.  Taunts top of the hate list function as it is today should never be improved as it would break the raiding game. <br />
<br />
Nerfing knight aggro generation won't ever work, you can get them to nerf cease and desist, you can reduce aggro on resists and even remove it on cannot effects but you can never nerf the aggro on the other stuns when they actually land, they would just be too powerful as low aggro spells.</div></div><hr />

I can deal with inferior tanking ability, I can wait for one of the 3 aggro weapon upgrades in the game, I can sit /lfg trying to get a Anger III aug, and I can deal with the raid role of a #6 or 8 Warrior on raids. And when I can't, I won't.<br />

Casting a group heal - i'm not clear on this - is the aggro based on damage healed? If not why not? If you have to take some damage in the first place for a heal to be effective then again no real problem. You are not bypassing the initial 'shock of impact' which is often the determiner between knight and warrior aggro. At the moment stuns provide a mechanical, reliable, risk free and cheap form of ranged aggro insurance that is too damn good for it's own good. <br />
<br />
Why are paladins that are close combat specialists getting long ranged stuns etc in the first place - stepping outside the RP context and looking at game mechanics it seems strange to me that a warrior with spells doesn't have any of the aggro restrictions of the base warrior class. We are by design (and as a plate tank melee you should mirror that to some extent) designed to affect a mob up close and personal only (unless you count minor bow aggro). Aggro at range is a caster trait because it is supposed to be UNdesireable to gain aggro and they want running room :p.<br />
<br />
Hey keep the stuns, make them taunt range only, and you can keep em as is because then building that aggro is not so trivial in practice. There's lots of ways to circumvent the system , the problem is it's far too easy, game breakingly so, at this time with your current tools. Sorry if that sounds like a nerf, I don't see that it ruins your class though - far from it. it could be argued that with less sure control, your secondary abilities are actually that much more valuable for damage control etc.<br />

 Root, as has been noted, is available to more than Paladins, and carries with itself it's own penalty of proximity aggro. Undead? You're SUPPOSED to be better with undead! Heals? Been there, done that, seen too many casters fall over dead from too much of it. :D <br />

 You still have yet to come to us, Aeka, with a valid reason WHY stun aggro can't be changed or 'retuned'. You've built so many damn strawmen to fight against it looks like the Miller Farm.<br />

 It's not the system that placed us in misery. It's the addition of content that broke the system that has us in misery. You and Glatius are arguing from the same point that XP needs to be easy to be attractive in a group form. My counter is that XP in and of itself is enough attraction that people CAN and WILL and HAVE in the past taken reasonable precautions about how they play their characters in order to get that XP.<br />
<br />
 Put it this way - I don't mash my Taunt every time it pops because it's counterproductive. Casters mashing their biggest nuke should be the same way. I'm sorry if the idea distresses you that actions should have consequences. ;)<br />

 No, what I advocate is that when I do my job, I have a reasonable chance of being successful at it without depending on a random number to the degree I do. I also advocate that actions have consequences - NO caster should have complete freedom from them.

What is the purpose of a tank that doesn't tank? What is a class that can obtain aggro, hold aggro, and watch a mob die without ever having to swing a weapon? Do ya wear a Fungi Tunic, get a regen buff, and a big damage shield when ya &quot;tank&quot; like a Bard twisting AE damage and heal at level 24? Ya really think it would be ok if he could use the same songs at level 65?<br />
<br />
/cast 2<br />
/cast 3<br />
/cast 4<br />
<br />
That's not only skillful it's clearly not broken.<br />
<br />
You repeat the same arguments endlessly. There's &quot;no point&quot; in preventing Paladins from being able to get aggro with low level 15 mana stuns. Restricting them to their 2 best obtainable stuns at any given level and insuring there are no 0 damage stuns past level 56 would just cause them to use Root and heals to gain aggro.<br />
<br />
Even though stun level caps should be put in place, you're still fundamentally right. Nothing short of making FT, KEI, and Bard mana song not work and returning the mana pool penalty would &quot;make&quot; Paladins tank like Warriors. Alternately nerfing Knight chaneling would probably accomplish a lot.<br />
<br />
The funny part is, I've consistantly said that SoE should not nerf Knights. They should just give Warriors equivilent ranged aggro, snap aggro, restore a real HP and survivability advantage, and give some of the combat AA Abilities a much faster refresh to give Warriors some flexability. All three tank classes would then have the same fundamental ability to Tank (using different means) while retaining special niches.<br />
<br />
Finally many encounters would have to be retuned so more powerful Tank aggro abilities by all 3 tank classes and not just 2 out of 3 didn't trivialize the game.<br />

<br />
If I may, I'd like to provide another perspective on aggro control - the perspective of a healer.<br />
<br />
Healing is essentially different from nuking. The nuker's skill depends on his ability to do damage WITHOUT over-aggroing. he is expected to stop doing damage when he would pull aggro.<br />
<br />
The healer is expected to keep people alive.<br />
<br />
Aggro, for me, is not a skill issue. When I heal is dependent solely on how fast your health is dropping. Delaying a heal for aggro control means the MT (and the group) dies. For me, aggro control is completely in the MT's hands. It is based on his agro-grabbing ability, his DPS, his HP and his AC (fewer heals = less aggro).<br />
<br />
A good Warrior is going to hit Taunt when the heal bomb lands. An excellent Warrior is going to do the same thing, except he will have better gear. Neither he or I can affect how often the mob beats me into a pulp. It's all predetermined by his gear.<br />
<br />
That's why I believe burst aggro is good  for gameplay. It allows the MT to have some realtime effect on the outcome of the battle, without his raiding prowess being the primary factor.<br />
<br />
I DO agree that 100% aggro lock is no thanks, but it's hard to tell what situations would produce that. A Wizard twisting Conc could easily go full bore with a Pally MT. No Pally on Norrath can hold aggro with a full-dps Druid (snare, debuff, DOTs, nuke nuke). I think 100% aggro lock is more a function of the caster than the tank.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just my 2cp.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well...true and false.  In addition a great warrior in an exp group will usually know exactly where his healer is at all times...know the quickest path to them (even knowing where to back up to them w/o looking) and set them selves between the healer and mob on the same facing quickly.  They will also be aware of that healers habits and get a gut feeling on when a heal agro pong is going to take place.  These are some of the things a warr can do....I don't disagree though that there are some facets outside our control though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But why do you believe they should be out of your control?  If your a tank, you should have the skills necessary to do so.  That means being beefy enough to take the damage as well as hold the attention of the monster.

<br />
If Enchanter mesing only worked 50% of the time no one would really depend on their CC skills unless there is a crunch.  Now why would anyone expect to put up with a tank that runs the risk of failing 50% of the time at the moment they need it?  I'm stumped on where people got the idea that failing half of the time for doing something right is just the way it is supposed to be.  No other class in EQ would stand for a 50% failure rate on their skills.  Why do Warriors believe they must?</div></div><hr />

 We HAVE said that not failing at any time is NOT the way it's supposed to be.<br />

 It takes, to break Knight aggro lock, stupidity of the highest order. It takes things on the order of a Necro blowing out his biggest DoT, biggest undead nuke, and undead slow on a mob at 95% type stupidity. Now, we understand you're all for watching TV while 'XPing', but that's not the way the game was designed nor the way it's supposed to be played.

Taunt has come up a lot with players in regard to this. It is not the warrior's job to control all the aggro of the group. It is the group's job to control the aggro of the group. I'm certainly misunderstanding what I'm reading, but I get the impression from the comments that have come in on this issue that warriors want to be able to ensure that the NPC(s) in question never decide to attack anyone but the warrior. Obviously that would make for a silly and boring combat. <br />
<br />
 Replace Warrior with Paladin, and guess what you have? :rolleyes: <br />

 Retune taunt so it works more than half the time and get rid of 'silly and boring' aggro lock.</div></div><hr />

Or should I bring up &quot;All classes are balanced&quot;?<br />
<br />
The fun in combat is beating environment not having the environment beat you.  Are you a masocist?  Masocists like to do painful things to themselves.  Do you find failing fun?  Do you find you have too little do to and want to spend time sitting around waiting for the half of your group that died to recover?  Do you believe people will &quot;rise to challenge&quot; after the 15-30 minute wait for their corpses to pop at the graveyard?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, you have a funny definition of tanking and fun.  You want tanking to fail randomly &quot;just because&quot; and believe people will just accept it.  You want people to spend more time managing their corpses instead of going against the zone.  You want players to huddle in the easy zones instead of adventuring out into the riskier areas.  You will excuse me if I don't want to play your version of EQ.<br />

If you think a Warriors job is to fine 5 other people to help him tank his then you will end up with a system you have now.   Partha, you should be extremely happy with the way things are now because that is exactly what many groups end up doing.  So embrace the system of your dreams.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My alt is a 52 Paladin. Since he was my first main, I'd like to think I play him very well indeed.<br />
<br />
I do a lot of things that a Warrior can't. The ability to root park a mob, stun another and engage it, and toss someone a heal is very powerful. But I do not achieve full aggro lock or full control. There is an element of risk, but part of my my job to help minimize that risk and I have the tools to do it.<br />
<br />
When playing a Warrior and MTing. The best I can do in a nasty situation is pop Defensive, stand in the mass of mobs, AE Taunt, tank the right mob, watch for mezz messages or roots and try to pull the still active mobs out of the mass and away from the casters. If a couple of mobs aren't under control I can try to tank 2 or even 3.<br />
<br />
But often the RNG bites me. I can be playing perfectly and have the Cleric get attacked and killed, have mobs ignore me and eat the Shaman. I do not have sufficient control. I do not have the tools with aggro weapons and a half broken Taunt button.<br />
<br />
There's risk and then there's stupid risk. A Taunt button that fails half the time and weapons that might (or might not) proc 4 times a fight is wrong.<br />
<br />
The LDoN augs will help (I have Anger II on a BoC and Strike of YKesha on a SEM). But I know the difference between tanking confidently and waiting for something to go wrong.<br />

 You'll notice I'M not the one championing risk-free experience and lower-skilled casters who know how to /cast 1 over and over. Maybe you do because it mirrors your playstyle as a paladin? Dunno.<br />

 Anyways, your harebrained ideas about people, risk, and reward are invalidated every day. How, you ask? Because Warriors still get groups.<br />

<br />
Yes, I like losing to the environment, it makes beating it next time that much better.  You say you want to be &quot;adventuring out into the riskier areas&quot; but you want to do it with out risk?<br />
<br />
I don't want EQ to become formulaic which is what I see tanking with knight agro as being.  My girlfriend plays a 65SK and we group together alot.  Last night we did Plane of Earth and I was 2boxing the slower so she tanked.  The monk would pull, she would hit clinging darkness, I'd hit tash, send in the DC pet, hit slow, move the warrior into melee range and turn on auto attack.<br />
<br />
/yawn<br />
<br />
Previous groups we have done there have usually had me tanking and the XP would be coming in at the same rate but the chanter would be summoned every 2nd pull and I have to work to hold agro and its fun.  Its a challenge for me as a warrior to tank there.  No one ever dies, no one runs out of mana, my gf prefers not to tank as it lets her pull or use her mana for DPS which she enjoys, everyone is on their toes, paying attention and having a good time getting XP.  Make the knight tank and suddenly its a yawn session.<br />
<br />
Thats my experience anyway, inc the recently overused acronym: ymmv<br />
<br />
Just for the class balance and itemisation enthusiasts, both of us are in VT/Ornate level gear, I use a BoC and SEM, she uses an ornate greatblade. With only a cleric to buff in the group I had about 300 more hps due to her self buffs and about 50 more AC.  We both have max defensive AAs and the tanking difference isnt visible.</div></div><hr />

BB, as i hope i made clear I'm not suggesting that warriors couldn't use some more ability to affect the outcome of aggro loss, however I will never consider aggro (as practiced by lvl 65 paladins especialy - who have a number of additional means of making the mob stick to em better than your 52 paladin and much less of a mana restriction to boot) acceptably challenging to the group as a whole. The other group members have to have a realistic chance of outaggroing the tank to reward them for not doing so and/or for good play by them and their tank when it does happen. To do otherwise devalues the whole experience moreso than it has been already by pacify, single pulls and dreadland-style zones etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My problem with nerfing Knights is that I have guildmates that are Knights and I've played one. In a way, they have felt a bit ripped off - during Kunark especially and to a lesser degree those who have become ubah.<br />
<br />
Right or wrong, most Paladins thought what they were getting was a Warrior with spells. When the game settled down to MT's being healed by Cleric/s they discovered their desired role was group and (at least ocassionally) raid MT.<br />
<br />
In higher level raids Paladins are getting to raid MT for perhaps the first time. This is almost entirely because of stun and HP's as high as many Warriors.<br />
<br />
Things can go to far as Furor contends and most of a guild's Warriors can find themselves with a vastly dimished raid role while they get to watch Paladins MT much more frequently then they do.<br />
<br />
But still, I favor all three tank classes having rough equivilence with only occassional preference because of class abilities.<br />
<br />
Yes, stun can: get aggro on incoming, provide snap aggro on demand, hold aggro, make a running mob pause a bit, build up aggro on a mezzed mob, interrupt gating and mob spell casting. It's very very powerful. It is probably the most important spell line differentiating Paladins from Warriors. It allows them to do almost every thing differently than we do.<br />
<br />
Are 10 methods to cast stun (including DW bracer) at level 65 excessive? I think so. Is the ability (although paladins claim to have deleted them all from their spellbooks) to hold aggro with very low level cheap mana cost stuns at level 65 a bit much? IMO yes.<br />
<br />
But go beyond changing the patently ridiculous and actually nerf stuns and the Paladin class is truely injured and their opprotunity to MT some higher level raid mobs is gone.<br />

And to call that 'nerfing' - well, hell, it's a lot better than Manaburn.<br />

 Of course, it goes without saying that Taunt should be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got a confession to make, I came to this thread late and only read the last page before posting so I didnt realise you'd already responded to Aeka's post about how only masocists would dare to risk someone dieing to make the game challenging (fun?) and how people will sit on zone walls rather than going to more risky areas because in the risky areas they might die.<br />

<br />
/shrug <br />
<br />
Even if the aggro instead of the range was nerfed i would be EXTREMELY surprised if the other elements of their role (stuns for mitigation, self sufficient healing, root etc etc)that contribute to their success as offtanks didn't leave them with that role. Aggro as it stands lets them be 'lazy', it provides a totally predictable, totally mechanical way of sidestepping aggro issues. <br />
Removing it doesn't destroy the role just requires them to work at it in a more close approximation of what warriors successfully do at the moment. Not forgetting that I think warriors need a mild boost and, if the scenario requires it, i would suggest the knight should have this 'improved taunt' at an equal level (can't see that being neccessary if the aggro isn't nerfed).</div></div><hr />

A Caster sitting at 90% mana, with their caster regen, is going to put up with working with a Warrior tanks? The answer is no they wouldn't. In fact they would use Rangers and charmed pets instead. <br />

Translation:  You don't get groups now because you suck and casters are vastly overpowered and won't use you (true that) but if Paladins are nerfed, you still won't get groups because you will still suck and they will just use a ranger, beast or pet.

<br />
My real curiosity was that I have never ever seen or expeirnced a group saying no to me or any other tank I know for an exp group. <br />
<br />
Well, that's a lot better than most paladins through all of kunark and well into Velious. But I digress. Let me address the situation as it exists today rather than churn up acid about playing my paly in the dark days of Kunark.<br />
<br />
Let me start with a question to ask yourself. Should warriors have the same ability to taunt as a paly or SK? Should paladins and shadow knights ever be a viable alternative to warriors as a group's main tank?<br />
<br />
If warriors ARE to have the same ability to generate aggro, what role are the knights to serve? Sub-par damage dealers? Sub-par healers? The distinction between warriors and knights is that warriors are the better TANKS while knights have better aggro generation. <br />
<br />
Realize that knights do not own the realm of aggro generation. Any ranger, wizard, enchanter, necro, mage, etc. can pull aggro off a knight at will. Of course, they choose not to, usually. There is a sliding scale: the more aggro one CAN generate the less they can deal with the consequences. Recall when groups in Velious and especially luclin used monks and rangers to tank? Why waste a slot with a warrior or a knight when the job could be done by someone dealing far more damage.<br />
<br />
If you think that your tanking superiority is not enough to make up for your poor aggro control just consider the margin of safety popping defensive or evasive on a MOB affords the group or raid killing the MOB. <br />
<br />
I am quite amused that the warrior community thinks that paladins all have a macro that we chain cast to generate aggro. Honestly, that's something novice payers do. Most good players adapt their spell casting needs to suit the circumstance. For instance, I have not seen one person here mention damage shields for the generation of aggro. In fact, with a bard, druid, or mage in group the difference in aggro for the tank is huge. And anyone that cares to debate that DS contribute no aggro feel free to ;tell me in game and I'll explain to you a very simple test that you can run to prove otherwise. Even my 10 points Dain ring damage shield cuts down my need to cast spells during combat by about 50% to hold equivalent aggro in a group (damned you druids that regen me!). <br />
<br />
Finally, as long as warriors are required tanks for most raiding guilds I don't feel that knights being slightly preferred for exp. groups out of balance. Sure, Kruegen might be able to tank most of the Time bosses. But I seriously doubt he tanks Quarm. But even if he does, that's not the case for 90% of raiding guilds out there from Vindi on up. Even the poorest-equipped warrior in my guild will require FAR less healing than me when he's got defensive on. Sure, we might be able to have me or another paladin tank Reparn, but the healing resources required would be far too much for my guild to handle.<br />

<br />
 Not true. Were this the case Paladins would not be tanking today - simply because they give up too little tanking ability for the amount of aggro they generate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was going to reply point by point, but I'll be brief (OK, I lied).<br />
<br />
A Tank is both survivability and aggro control. A Paladin with 4000HP's can not tank Vindi. A Warrior with fine steel weapons to generate aggro can't either.<br />
<br />
According to SoE's Class Descriptions (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp), Warriors &quot;....are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; and make &quot;....themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks....&quot; This is what players mean by tank. Tank = survivability + aggro control = Warrior.<br />
<br />
Since Knights are a hybrid based on Warriors and Clerics or Necromancers, they are not intended to be as good a Tank as a Warrior or as good a Healer as a Cleric. However, as they are predominately Warriors, they should come close. Their deficiencies as a Tank are intended to offset their ability to buff and heal or do non-melee damage respectively.<br />
<br />
Warriors are supposed to be the better TANKS while Knights also perfom Clerical or Necro functions as well as tank and melee. Knights need to be Warrior - (some meaningful Tanking capability) + spells.  Otherwise Paladins become Warriors with spells.<br />
<br />
This is exactlly what has happened in experiance groups. With what amounts to the same survivability as a Warrior and better aggro abilities, the Paladin is a better Warrior (survivability + aggro control). Add in buffs, Root, and heals and we aren't talking a slight preference.<br />
<br />
Finally, as long as warriors are required tanks for most raiding guilds I don't feel that knights being slightly preferred for exp. groups out of balance.<br />
<br />
And this is our fundamental difference. Some enlightened guilds realize that players do not spend years playing their character to never MT a mob in raids. They try, to let all Tanks tank regardless of their Class. I am among the first to suggest having a Paladin tank a mob when in my view they are more suited to the task (not that my suggestions carry a lot of weight [or should]). And Paladins ARE MTing more mobs at higher level raids.<br />
<br />
I wish the difference in the fundamental ability of Warriors and Knights to Tank was less, not more. And I would never say &quot;Paladins have an advantage in experiance groups. Why should they MT on raids?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not every Warrior is in a guild, much less an MT in raids. Why should they have this &quot;slight&quot; disadvantage.<br />
<br />
I agree the Warrior disadvantage is slight (/wink). Slight enough that ranged aggro and snap aggro on demand should be given to Warriors to make them competative Tanks.<br />
<br />
This is a real class balance issue - so says many Clerics, Enchanters, Warriors, Shaman, and even Paladins on their class boards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harlan</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins can tank some raid-level MOBs, sure. But you tell me how well we'd do if a paladin were tanking General Reparn. Answer: it cannot be done. Without defensive, Reparn can one-hit any paladin in a guild at that level. Hence the NEED for a warrior to tank this MOB. <br />
<br />
Advantage (requirement): warriors.<br />
<br />
The same thing applies to MM, Bertox, and Quarm. Any guild killing these MOBs for the first time NEEDS a warrior to tank.<br />
<br />
No group NEEDS a paladin for exp. If they don't play like a horse's ass any group can handle a warrior as MT. There are trade-offs to having a warrior tank, sure. You have to be a bit more careful of aggro but benefit greatly in group durability (assuming equally-geared warrior vs. knight here).<br />
<br />
Now, were warriors to gain the aggro advantage that the knights have now, there'd be no reason whatsoever for a group to add a knight. Let's see: better tanking, same aggro control. Hell, the group would have to be braindead to ever choose a knight. If all 3 are tank classes, each should have a legit shot at being chosen for a group. Giving warriors snap- and range-aggro would simply eliminate the utility of having knights around. Nobody would want them to tank. And certainly nobody wants them to join a group just to do the 80% melee damage of a warrior with equal weaponry and AAs.<br />
<br />
Warriors have their energy focused all wrong. The real imbalance isn't between warriors and knights, it's between all melee and casters.<br />
<br />
When I hear wide-scale reports that ALL warriors, regardless of gear, cannot find exp. groups then I'll start to believe that there's an imbalance. In fact, you'd have the exact reversal of the situation paladins faced entirely through Kunark into Velious. Trust me. Paladins know exactly what a true tanking imbalance feels like. However, warriors are getting groups now the same as the knights. When everyone can get a group, that's balance my friend.<br />

<br />
Whoops, there goes your credibility again. Are you truly this dumb or just wilfully ignorant? The difference in tanking durability between warrior and knight is even being conservative about a maximum of 800-1000 hps (ignoring the 300 odd hp self buff, the possible use of symbol, and at later levels AoTC that you can stack to reduce the difference). What does that equate to in terms of mobs that deal out enough damage that a plate tank is required to tank (hint: not LdoN normal for any but the most casual player) approximately 2-3 swings from a mob. If the warrior has to dual wield aggro weapons that'll be eaten easily by extra ripostes and you can even remove that difference with a stun per C/heal. Yes that's a substantial durability saving all right isn't it. Bleh. Casters may outshine melee in addition, but that does not mean that we plate tanks are balanced by any stretch.<br />

<br />
When I hear wide-scale reports that ALL warriors, regardless of gear, cannot find exp. groups then I'll start to believe that there's an imbalance.<br />

He's unguilded, level 57 and has the copperhammer/bloodsworn weapon combo and 1270ac 4700hp unbuffed. So 8 hours lfg without a group. Does that mean, by your definaition, that the classes ARE imbalanced?<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, my bard, beastlordand cleric have no trouble at all getting a group, usually within 30 minutes on a bad day.<br />
<br />
As a cleric main I see the imbalance, as a beastlord dealing max damage with a knight yet getting agro with a warrior I see the imbalance, and yes to keep it going as a bard bring home the bacon I see the imbalance. <br />
<br />
Is is really only your holy mount that has blinkers? Look in the mirror and be honest. Caster classes are balanced. Hybrid classes are blanced. Heck knights can no longer be considered hybrids but they too are balanced. Pure mellee? Do bards and rangers (chanters and clercs at times) make a better puller choice than monks? Rogs are great dps, no doubt there, but they do loose out slightly to classes with dps and other skills but out of all pure mellee they fare the best. <br />
<br />
On the opposite end of the spectrum you have warriors unfortunately. As a cleric I don't expect to loose out on exp groups because I am the best healer there is. I would not expect rogs, wizzies, beastlords, mages or rangers etc, etc to take a dps hit because they are great dps on raids. Why do paladin trolls keep on insisting that warriors should be the red headed stepchilds of norrath because they MT on raids ( read the big guild messge boards, its not a warrior only treat any more all the way up the range).<br />
<br />
Warrior agro unless you have ungodly weapons and an admirable amount of aa will always be worse than a naked knight. The hp imbalance has been flogged so much thats theres no point in mentioning it other than to say even I was a little surprised when a paladin from the largest guild on druzzil ro remarked to me recently that he topped 10k hp with group buffs (cleric and shaman). Don't get me wrong, he has played from before I have ( I got eq the first week it went on sale in the UK 3 or 4 months before kunark went live), but that is an impressive hp tally.<br />
<br />
The points the original poster made I have to agree with mostly and hope that the people who are the movers and shakers of EQ can filter out the uniformed, the blatantly wrong and the people trying to cling the the present imbalance fpr personal gain long enough to make things right. It really does hurt the game for so many good people.<br />
<br />
Sorry this has turned into such a long post, I really am, but after the most instantly enjoyable expansion (for me at least) in a long time and a year of little but with retrospect enlightened improvements I cannot see how the dev team can fail to redress the balance given the wealth of opinion and fresh ideas over all the class boards.<br />
 <br />
One thing I will say in leaving is please take the time to have a look at the paladin and shadowknight class boards. The calibre of people posting there really is so different to the majority of people professing to be from those classes posting here ( not all mind, we all know full well who the genuine people are regardless of class)</div></div><hr />
