<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shih00</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More of a request for opinions than a Question. But I am interested in doing some LDON's Here is my line up.<br />
64 BST Mostly Bazaar Gear enough AA's to have Paragon and Hobble.<br />
65 WAR mostly Velious armour A few no drops from the planes for weapons. AA's concentrated in hp's and some defensive<br />
66 Necro A couple ornate pieces and the rest Bazaar stuff. About 60 AA's spread around.<br />
<br />
Heres my plan:<br />
start out doing strictly MM ldons until I can no longer stand it or until I have them all upgraded in all spots possible, along with some augments in things that cant be upgraded there.<br />
<br />
Pull with the Necro, either FD or pet pull.  Use root and BST warder as Off-tank for adds<br />
Send War in to take aggro and position the mob<br />
Send in the Warder, Slow and debuff with the BST<br />
Then to the Necro to strt the ghetto heal on the WAR, and drop in a few dots.<br />
Then back to the BST for nukes and Melee, as long as the positioning on the War is holding. Or start with the Heals from the BST if things get rough. <br />
<br />
With this line up I &quot;think&quot; I can handle the MM ldon's since they are mostly undead and the necro will excell there.<br />
<br />
I guess the question I have is, Are the levels to close together? Should I look for a 59 to help lower the average level of the mobs or will this be ok?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No healer would probably make it rather slow+boring though, even if you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can 3box ldons with 69 war, 66 rog, 65 cleric easily. The key is getting single pulls and just kill kill kill. I usually don't have to heal for about 4-5 mobs so I just chain nuke with the cleric. I have found MM to be the easiest followed by EF, then EC, then NRO, then Guk (god I hate targeting in those zones).<br />
<br />
Pacification helps a lot and I don't bother slowing since that kills my dps. Rogue has a Fabled dagger from lower guk (forget the name, but it procs a 1:04 snare+dot) that is 14/27 so I use that for snares on the mobs that aren't undead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this doing hard or normal LDONs? I have a similar group of all 70's characters and would like try completing LDONs for my warriors Anger3 augs. Guess I'll try the hard tonight and let you know if it works.</div></div><hr />
