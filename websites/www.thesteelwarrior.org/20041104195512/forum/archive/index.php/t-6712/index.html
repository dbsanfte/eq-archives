Now, I haven't been around as more than a lurker for a great long time, not since before the move away from EzBoard really.  Nor have I spent much any time in EQ for the last 2 years.  I think I did about 15 LDoNs last fall and I spent some time camping the fableds after I heard about the 5th anniversary stuff.  Call me a dork if you want, but I take a small measure of pride in knowing that my staff of endless adventure proc is &quot;Nagafen Fire,&quot; and that my Magelo profile number has only 4 digits in it.  But, enough old timer bragging, that shit is tired.  I'm ready to play again.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I haven't been a raid calibre tank since late Velious/Early Luclin.  I have crap for flags (as you can see in my profile).  If I get back into the swing of things with my warrior, I want to go all the way back to the top of the game.  What is my question?<br />
<br />
Check my profile.  My finances are, well crap.  I have no real tradables (I won't sell my earthshaker).  I have less than 10k liquid.  What do you all view as the most efficient path to get my AA and gear in line to app at least a &quot;just getting into Time&quot; level guild?  I imagine I would need at least 100 AA (finish tanking AA, WA, and ambi or flurry) and one aggro weapon worth a flip to contend, not to mention hp/ac gear.<br />
<br />
If I can avoid spending time in a mid level PoP guild gearing up beforehand, I would like to.  I don't mind paying dues and all, but I hate the notion of using a middle tier guild to gear up and then bolting.  Then again, Innoruuk seems to be a much more mercenary server than Xev where I used to live.<br />
<br />
So,  Thoughts?  hunting grounds? pickup raids I should look out for? good cash generating camps?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.  I look forward to being able to contribute to the community again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Does Innoruk have an open raiding organization? If you can get flagged for elementals on your own you can get some decent drops and sell tradeskill stuff from elementals to gear and AA up. <br />
<br />
A lot of content is a lot easier now, are many friends left on server who would do content to gear you up?<br />
<br />
Doing Dozekar can get you a few good items too, although doing Tormax or AoW for helm, Va'Dyn or that 85 HP tradable neck for neck, two 90 HP earth rings from drops there if you can farm yourself if you get flagged, Tormax for boots etc, another tactics earing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korak Sarathai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Amazing what one night can do sometimes.  Five Miragul's wins, new boots, Weapon Affinity 1, a dex aug... 13 more Miragul's and I can get my anger III aug.  I hadn't played around much with the fabled ssoy since I got it, but it is a good aggro proc.  I just need to get my dex up and buy up some more weapon affinity I suppose.  That will take care of the aggro I believe.<br />
<br />
I'll look more into the server situation concerning open raids.  AoW and even Tormax would still be a big upgrade in the hat department, that's for sure.  I almost managed an open raid on Fennin Ro, but there were not any open slots for unflagged folks.<br />
<br />
Does the slime in CT still drop crys acid bracers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe he does,  I havnt done the ring in ages, so cant say for certain.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the amount he dropped was changed a long time ago, I remember farming him as a guild raid and he had lots and awesome drops, then it semeed to drop less, so getting bracers etc were more hard. Not exactly sure whether you remember the JackPot$$ version of the ring or the current version of the ring (same difficulty) still awesome RvR, just not as good as it once was.<br />
<br />
Do you have GoD? While your time is probably better spent atm getting caught up AA etc, there are some really good single group drops avaiable. If you can gather up a few friends, espcially if you have some in Ele+ guilds and doing &quot;Sewers&quot; for drops (They get spells you get loot or something) you can get a few nice things also.<br />
<br />
**Edit** Checked your profile again, thought you had TS arms but you have ToV, so Pitted Vambraces would be a very solidu pgrade, and would make it so you dont have to spend PP on armor<br />

**Edit** <br />
<br />
http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/ is a good database site if you want to look up some drops, its more oriented towards raid drops, but it has a good amount of single group stuff in it to (although it doesnt really state if its single or raid or small raid etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">holy shit what rock did you crawl out from under :D ? nice to see ya again<br />
<br />
on any type of refrence to gea; weapons; and anyhting relative to helping you out game-wise....i'm no help-i haven't logged int EQ for quite some time.<br />
<br />
If you were willin' to move to terris I could hook you up though :D</div></div><hr />

My guild farmed it like crazy when the CT revamp went live.  I think we ended up with 8 bracers, but I was unlucky on being online.  I think I made about 14 kills and saw 5 of the bracers drop, but was out ranked by more senior warriors.  Anyway, I remember rumors of a big drop in the bracers drop rate, but the guild wasn't killing it anymore.<br />
<br />
TS arms? look nice... however, I have to tell you I am not familiar with the abbreviation TS.  Who or what is it?  I'll check alla's for info.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
Shik... over 4000 more posts since I left /boggle<br />

You must be thirsty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shik padded his post count when he got married, he's technically lower than me now  :p <br />
<br />
In your situation, in wanting to app for a Time guild, I'd highly suggest doing LDoN and farming the living fuck out of armor.  Some of the profiles I've seen around here with fully upgraded LDoN armor are absolutely ridiculous...far beyond what I could hope to do anywhere else.  That's the only way I can see being able to make up a couple expansions worth of lag in your gear aside from joining an elemental guild and putting up with their retarded bullshit for awhile when you gear up.  I'm sitting right about where you are now, plus 100 aa's or so, and I know for a fact I wouldn't be ready to tank any elemental yard trash, let alone any of the bosses.  <br />
<br />
If there is a way you can pound out LDoN victories quickly, you can probably start upgrading your equipment that way, and in the meantime, perhaps start making some connections with the higher end guilds on the server to let you &quot;sneak&quot; in while you're still on the low end of the requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">TS would refer to tradeskill, Helanic Tundra Armor in your case, may be worth looking into for your arm slot.  Your gear really isn't that bad, you just need a whole lot more AA points to be competative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yah i meant Tradeskilled armor, sorry shoulda just typed out the full name</div></div><hr />
