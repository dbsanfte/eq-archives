<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okies.. dis no flag thing.<br />
<br />
Assumin mobs be same level in zone.. Dey hit as hard an blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
Will caster spells o'lower level folks be able ta hit da mobs?<br />
<br />
Will melee be able takes da hits? M'no can picta melee witout da HP lastin too long dere. <br />
<br />
How successful will folks in deir 50's be able ta group in dem zones dat will be opened up? M'sure dey gonna try. Outside guild groups dunno how successful dey will be.<br />
<br />
Wot m'picturin is da grave yard ta be overflowing fer a bit. Is gonna certainly be interesting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Run down:<br />
<br />
People will die by the thousands the first few days ( possibly a week or two ). <br />
<br />
Then most of them will travel back down to where their exp flow is positive, a few will quit, and some will bitch the mobs need to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
Higher end people will bitch about back in the day everything was harder ( not like they don't now it will just be more common ). Events will be blown high end people will bitch about it. SOE will do something about it, a few months down the line.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would rather have loot drop in lower tiers exp groups alongside parchments myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I want to wait and see about how they could imrpove drops for gear in first and second tier.<br />
Not all guilds have access to elemental luvin etc.<br />
However what this will improve for flags is small guilds being able to go to planes and raid them for a change.<br />
I'd like to see a change. Remove need for PoV PoS, sure. But have minuim group requirements of say 18 if not flaged to be able to get into tactic's.<br />
<br />
(i.E if not flaged for tactic's you would have to have a minium 18 person raid force to get in) <br />
Not only will this allow said lvl 47's or so to get in with their guild. It will allow guilds a chance to raid the tier 2 or tier 3 zones. <br />
<br />
I know its not the best of what we could hope for but its better then sitting and hearing train to wherver by some 48 or 49 assling that wont stand and die and let their body go to GY.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh those that are in their 50s like myself should know better right away. I can not tank the mobs in these zones and will not attempt to enter the zones until I can. I think you are right though there are idiots that think they will be able to own high end XP in these zones and they will die en masse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but you're normal though adzar; you're not like the ubertwink_1.0Ex100 who thinks their collective and/or proverbial dicks are 20 feet long and can do anything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i might give it a try. but only with a great cleric that i know and good enc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a level 61 monk, I'm confident I can do my job in ANY of the zones listed.<br />
<br />
And that's only because I don't get hit.<br />
<br />
Neener neener neener!<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
In any event, the first few days will be fun for some (sorry but I'm going to get a kick out of the level 47 bard selo'sing through Tactics and going SPLAT ... it's just GOOD ole fashioned slapstick!) ... others will get frustrated (some people just aren't social enough to be able to handle large groups of mouthy malcontents filling up their /ooc channel even though they turned off /ooc's AGES ago).<br />
<br />
In time everything will calm down, people will find their safe spots, and their XP sweet spots and life will return to normal.<br />
<br />
Boss mobs will spawn, guilds will raid, and the beat will go on.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, it's going to be hilarious to watch a solo 60 druid try to kite something REALLY mean in a higher tier zone, that after a patch or two suddenly summons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wubao, your monk doesnt need to be hit to die in Tactics for example.<br />
You take a wrong turn moving from graveyard and pull your first red con mob (nothing unusual in tier 3 as probably everything cons red to you - just that these mobs con red to 65 as well).<br />
Harmtouches for 1091 own, 800 unresistable AE's are teh win and when you manage to bring that mob to 40 percent life they split to 2 with full health and same abilities.<br />
Dont take me wrong, noone does exp on this kind of mobs, they are on the way to Vallon and Tallon Zek encounters.<br />
Safest will be to do /hidecorpse all when entering Tactics and avoid it for 2 weeks after this patch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh hell yeah, people will die in droves for the first couple of weeks.  Just like when they upgraded CT and everyone and their cousin decided to give the place a go.  However, the zone quickly seperated the cans from the can nots.  Within a month the n00bs were for the most part gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I personally dont care about newbs getting access. What really pisses me off is putting the work into those flags and then having that all negated. I guess if they give a respectable reward - in terms of RvR - then everyone will be happy. <br />
<br />
They wont do that however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still like the suggestion to make the new zones have a level requirement to enter.<br />
<br />
This will keep Cleric-46, Bard-51, Paladin-54, etc.  from being able to go to zones they have no business being in.<br />
<br />
Of course, I have enough sense to know that if you go looking for trouble you're gonna find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah, stupidity knows no level limit or has an aa requirement.<br />
I often duo CoD entrance when i have only very limited time.<br />
Yesterday a level 65 paladin from the servers number 2 guild trying to solo trained me.<br />
On the other hand, a small group of a 61 ranger, 52 shaman and a 56+ cleric (was blue con to my cleric, but had hammer of many procs so had to be at least level 56) did quite well, although they took quite a bit longer to kill a mob than myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh they do, and will more often.</div></div><hr />
