Self Righteous is a casual guild despite the name. <br />
<br />
Two weeks ago we got bored waiting on Ixilblat trigger mob to repop (cleric epic) and we had just an insane number of overkill (24 people avg lvl 60) for the trivial encounter so we decided to check on Vindi. This would be our first time ever on the bigboy and I expected doom, but didn't let on.<br />
<br />
 With me the only warrior, and a 65 and 64 paladin, we set up right at the icewall. I tagged him and had the paladins offtank his 2 pets. The shaman Crippled on INC and I AE Taunted off, and had solid aggro until 5 seconds into /enrage, when it ate a guild rogue (/laugh Balator). Vindi was down before /defensive wore off. Our first Vindi BP went to a shaman who won the roll, but I didn't mind because I was exstatic.<br />
<br />
Last night we foolishly decided to try Xanamech with about the same force, 25 ppl avg lvl 60. After 3.5 minutes of chain CH and quickheals when they were stunned our 2 clerics were OOm and they joined in the melee with their proccing hammers, Xana went down ~10 seconds later ( go cleric powa ). I lost the roll on the Cord Hilted Spike Driver to the only other warrior, but he will wield it proudly for a long time and I was happy for him. BUT, against 4 other melee I WON the Woven Shim Choker! Thats right, both of Xanamech's top loots dropped!<br />
<br />
Anyhow, this is longwinded, but for my guild these accomplishments are great, and pulling off a WIN on the first attempt of both encounters with only 25 people, we were stoked!</div></div><hr />

One of my fondest memories is of taking down Vindi for the first time.  Dark only guild on Tallon Zek.  Was quite an accomplishment for a single team guild back in the pre-pop age.  We had to kick another xteaming guilds ass before we took down Vindi.  :p</div></div><hr />
