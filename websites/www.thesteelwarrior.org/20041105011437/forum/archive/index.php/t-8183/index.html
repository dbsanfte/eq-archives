<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, <br />
<br />
I have been checking out this board for a few days now, and I have decided to pick up my warrior again and have a little fun.  I have a 65 Necro and decided to take a break from him and get whacked around by the enemy and join the ranks of the warrior again.  My warrior was 56 at one time but I had sacced him down for EE's long ago.  (I know I deserved to be burned for that one.)  Well, I was hoping to get you expert opinions on my gear choices, most of which I have acquired here researching on the steel warriors.  I did my first Ldon last night and had a lot of fun taking hits again.  With gear advise keep in mind that I am not currently guilded, I like doing Ldon, pick up groups etc.  PP isnt too hard for me to come by yet Im fairly thrifty with what I like to spend. I am also not a big fan of paying for MQ as they are not re-sellable, and are more fun to earn.  I do not ebay and I have been playing since the release of Kunark.  I have fond memories (gay I know) Of playing my ogre warrior back around Kunark's release. <br />
So I am looking to have some fun again.   Please let me know as to how I am coming along gear-wise, Im really into &quot;bang for the buck,&quot; type gear.  <br />
<br />
Keep in mind I am agnostic deity (kinda stinks)  used to not matter much<br />
And I am 47 Level<br />
Magelo:<br />

<br />
Some of the gear is from my Rogue (also sacced)  so I switch back and forth slots<br />
PS.  Being sacced has kept my skills to where they were at 56 (235defense,off,etc.)  Though magelo blocks me from setting that high.   <br />
<br />
Thank you much and greetings to all,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't look too bad at all, honestly. 1ac = 6hp = 1sta until sta capped unbuffed. Go to the bazaar and have at it! When you get to 50, replace the Wavecrasher with a Copper Hammer of Striking. It'll be more DPS and at least similar aggro. I'd suggest working towards an anger 2 or ykesha augment as you go, and sell it back when you can afford anger 3. It'll take a while to get that many points, though. 55 is minimum level for ornate, as I recall, which will last you a long time once you can get it (even if it's not resellable). Otherwise, it looks like you're on the right track. Just keep it up and soon j00 will be ubah 4 realz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for the quick response, I will have to work on the anger augments.  <br />
Now at 50, which hand gets the chos and the bloodsworn sword and why? <br />
Would the wavecrasher produce the least amount of aggro out of the 3?  Thanks again!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, Wavecrasher is inferior to the droga combo.<br />
<br />
As far as which one to mainhand it really just boils down to personal preferance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I main-hand the Hammer, but mainly so the 179 dd portion of the proc occurs a little more often (it's nice to see the proc crit now and then...one thing I was disappointed with on the Anger 2 augment that upgraded a cheap dd aug proc from was fewer spell crits since afaik, you can't crit a hate proc).</div></div><hr />
