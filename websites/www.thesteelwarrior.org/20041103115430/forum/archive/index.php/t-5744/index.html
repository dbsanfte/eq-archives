<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sowy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If there is already a thread burried in this forum answerng my question please throw me the link, I couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the dmg to hate ratio?  For nukes/procs/melee dps?   Is it 1 for 1?  1 for 2? etc<br />
<br />
Also is there a set amount of aggro a stun gives or is it mob specific or stun specific?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think we exactly know what a DD equals in terms of hate.  I believe it is thought to be 1:1, at least in terms of comparing it with other, more known hate methods. In addition, I believe some nukes, spells, and/or AA's have a hate reduction modifier, which would reduce the hate from a DD spell to less than 1:1. <br />
<br />
For melee DPS, I remember reading that it is not only the damage dealt, but also the potential damage from that weapon. That's how a big 2H weapon can be helpful in holding agro, even if you're in front of a mob.<br />
<br />
Stun is thought to be approx 400-500 points in hate, whether landed, resisted, or immune.  Ykesha procs are said to be between Anger II and Anger III in terms of hate output (400 and 600 respectively).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely less than 1:1 on DD  procs.  4-500 sounds about right for stun but it's hard to say anything definitively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My opinion is that you get a certain amount of agro for casting a DD, modified by your class + some agro relative to the maximum non-crit damage the DD could have done.<br />
<br />
I think stun is ~300 agro (which is more than Slow and that's what's really important) and with Ykesha you get some agro for the DD too.  You also get a knockback which reduces agro due to the extra distance, but that's easily compensated for.<br />
<br />
That said, I don't understand why people drool over Anger ll rather than Ykesha for the same points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sowy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well at least I don't feel so bad for not knowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the easy answer to yk vs. anger is when the chips are down you grab the proc that adds pure agro, and put the toys away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vladymir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think we exactly know what a DD equals in terms of hate. I believe it is thought to be 1:1 If it were, then my delightfull orb would (325 base proc) would clearly beat my Hooked Soshar (250 hate add), but the consensus is no...<br />
<br />
But when you take into effect a stunning weapon like the copper hammer, or any stun proc,  or augs like the ones from guk, who knows?<br />
<br />
Your closest competiton for hate other than 'anger' type augs or effects will be stun... so I would *think* the copper hammer's innate effect would be more anger than the delightful orb's even though its only about half the damage in DD terms.<br />
<br />
Then of course, plain old fashioned speed matters; most agree that being hit 5 times for 100 damage is superior aggro to getting hit 2 times for 250 damage each time.<br />
<br />
In  the old days, before bows were da bomb for Rangers, they used to carry 2 handers to keep down their aggro, even if the damage was about the same, or more than their 2 1 handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sowy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How much aggro would a 750dd be then?  (ala Infamous ED from time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Qest, I'm almost positive that slow is more than 300 aggro. When I duo with my shammy, and slow a mob at the beginning of each fight, I would be able to get aggro back onto my warrior with just incite, since it is 400 aggro. This doesn't happen though. Incite plus maybe 5 seconds of melee, or a weapon proc, is enough to get the mob off the shammy, so I'm thinking slow is 425-450 aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm still experimenting so no definitive answers yet, but here's what I have so far:<br />
<br />
In a normal LDoN a while back, I hit auto-attack but was slightly out of range so I just got the message &quot;you're out of range&quot; a bunch of times.  The mob got slowed and immediately afterwards, I procced a stun without ever actually making a valid swing at the target (including misses), yet the mob turned on me.<br />
<br />
That's my only evidence for Stun &gt; Slow.<br />
<br />
I'm testing, and I don't have enough data yet, but it's my impression that Incite gets a negative modifier if you haven't damaged the mob yet.  It's still some agro, you can pull with it, but it seems to me to work better if I do some damage via an arrow before hitting Incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the easy answer to yk vs. anger is when the chips are down you grab the proc that adds pure agro, and put the toys away. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure the answer is that easy.  I played with a BoC for a couple of months and ended up dumping it because SoD/Copper Hammer just fucking destroyed BoC/SoD for DPS, and I wasn't experiencing an aggro deficiency in either setup.  Why gimp your DPS on pure hate procs when stun procs clearly seem to be of a similar quality?<br />
<br />
I'm also not sure exactly how to test slow vs stun.  I've had stuns lock aggro on me over a slow, and I also remember one occurance where a planar strike proc off a bloodsworn DIDN'T hold aggro thru a slow.  This doesn't happen often tho, so I'm not sure what caused it, but we definitely can't rule out other factors in the aggro consideration.  I'm also hesistant to put a number as low as 300 on stun aggro because in my opinion, a proc works much better than incite does.<br />
<br />
How much aggro would a 750 dd be?  Probably miniscule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">IMO, the hate generated off of pure hate and stun procs seem to be close enough to make going with stuns a better option for the added benefit of interrupts and such from the stun.  I will probably save up and put stun augs in weapons that already have pure agro procs (or visa-versa), and have some of both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agro is obviously modified by the target.  Look at AoW for example, he's got so very many hitpoints, that most anything you do is not going to establish agro lock.<br />
<br />
I play an enchanter and I've learned that generally, Tash agro is in relation to the target's hitpoints, so Tashing AoW will probably be an instant death while tashing a Normal LDoN mob is a lot less agro.  If slow is the same way, and I'd be surprised if it wasn't, that would explain the varying results.<br />
<br />
Then there's always distance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">back when i had CHSD in mainhand which was 450 hate proc i was in ldon which the shaman pulled with a slow, i crushed once then proc'd and mob turned on me, so im guessing slow is around 400 hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sowy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wonder if damage based aggro is determined by the HP of the mob aswell.  It would make sense.<br />
<br />
Would be easy to test on green mobs.   Have someone else do a 1k nuke on a mob with 1.5k hp then a warrior try to incite it.  Or something.   Then repeat on a higher hp mob.<br />
<br />
Though I have a feeling all the answers I need are hidden on an old thread (though I was unable to find it with search feature--and I did try)</div></div><hr />
