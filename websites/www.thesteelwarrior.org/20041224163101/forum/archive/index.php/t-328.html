<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I finally made it to level 60.  From the looks of things ill be 61 in a evening or two.   I am currently unguilded but I have a core groups of freinds that are also unguilded.  Right now we are just having some fun EXPing/questing, etc.  Group consists of me, 60 Druid, 59 Pally and 59 Ranger.<br />
<br />
My question is...since levels seem to be coming alot quicker these days I am concerned that my gear/weapons will soon become outdated?  <br />
<br />
I would appreciate any suggestions for upgrades..either low budget (10-20k) or something my friends and I can get on our own.   <br />
<br />
<br />
We have been doing the Enforcers in PoJ the last few nights and the cash has been pretty nice as well as the EXP.  Its a relatively easy camp.<br />
<br />
We have done the Benevolence quest a few times for the Druid and Paladin.  The bracers look nice but im not sure I wanna sacrifice AC atm since my AC is not all that great?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice,</div></div><hr />

Grats on 60 from a fellow Torv. It is hard for an unguilded warrior or a warrior in a casual guild like mine to achieve better weapons than what you have.  Your equipment is pretty good atm, you might want to work on some AA's to get your hp's inline, also check the Fine Heraldic VS. a couple of your visible slots.<br />
<br />
I really cannot say enough good things about ND3. Get it. It gave me around 350-400 extra hp. Our equipment is very similar, my Fierce Heraldic adds a few more hp, but the real difference is the AA.  Play with your Magelo and see the difference between no-ND and ND3.  <br />
<br />
Keep doing enforcers camp for coin. Hit OS some, most of the equipment is outdated there, but you can score big with Hiero Cloak, Cobalt Bracer, Fungi Tunic, etc etc.<br />
<br />
I'm flagged for PoV/PoS/Factory atm. I am not going back into Teir 2 until I finish my last point for AE Taunt and then ding 61. My aggro is a liability due to level.<br />
<br />
Set some goals and grind them out. Seeya in the Planes bro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd most definately get new guants.  Thurg or SS would be the best bets.  Other than that, I'd grind some aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">unless you got max stamina i'd say go for the beno bracers....they are hard to beat. i was ready to toss my 2 SS bracers for 2 beno's and shikarii's AC was barely 1230.<br />
<br />
gloves..try to hit the manor up in kael ( that is if you're on dorf faction ) and get them champs pieces filled in.. so easy to do with 1 group of 60's in the manor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks so much for all the advice.  :)<br />
<br />
Currently my AC is barely over 1200 so i think ill hold off on Beno bracers abit until I can get some AC upgrades in other slots (i.e gaunts,legs...)..<br />
<br />
I have struggled with what AA's i should go for.  I am trying to do what is best for my group of friends.  <br />
<br />
If I am totally mistaken on this please tell me, but It seems a casual group EXP tank such as myself would benifit more from better mitigation/avoidance (i.e CS/CA) than from more HP (ND)?  I know getting AE Taunt is a no-brainer :)<br />
<br />
Also would it be best to stick at level 60 and get some AA's along with my friends or get 61 then AA?   My Ranger friend is planning on sticking in 60 until he gets AM3.   I just don't want to lock myself out of any EXP camps my friends might wanna do.  We don't plan to get flagged for tier2 and such for awhile.  We want to make sure we are prepared (gear/level/aa wise) to effectively function in Tier2.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for all the advice :)</div></div><hr />

If not get ND3, totally worth the 12 aas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe I guess im going for CS/CA then cause my primary healer is the absolute best Druid around :)   /hug Chadoe</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you dont intend to get to lvl 65 staright away, i would get aa's now.<br />
<br />
AA's at Lvl 60 is much faster than at Lvl 61 in tier one Pop zones. Also if you Lvl to 61 you will find out that a lot of the mobs in the old world zones will con either light blue or green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eeven if your primary healer is a druid lets say u have 4.5k hp buffed druid max heal is 75% of that and that with ND3 u'll be 5k+ ez less liablity on druid. He wont have to start healin you when u way low around 1 buble to get most bang for the mana. Go ND3. As for equipment I wouldnt warry about it much. A year ago this would be great stuff a year from now it will be outdated as hell. The point is get equipment as you need it. If you are starting to feel you can tank the shit in place where u want to xp start looking for ac/hp upgrades, but as other mentioned since you are unguilded AAs will be probably easier to get.<br />
<br />
If you get yourself to 65 thing will be much easier to tank I guarntee you but on other hand you will want to be fighting much harder mobs lvl 60 at minimum to get xp bonus.  So this limits you pretty much to poi factory where golems are lvl 60 or pov/pos and beyond for good xp.</div></div><hr />
