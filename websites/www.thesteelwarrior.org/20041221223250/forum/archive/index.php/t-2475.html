<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowyn01</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading this board I was wondering what taunt actually does.  I was under the impression it generated X points of hate but posts here have said to save pushing the taunt button until you loose aggro.  That would seem to imply that if you are at the top of the aggro list already taunt does nothing for you.  <br />
  Could someone clarify this so I know whether to go on mashing taunt all the time or if I can give my finger a rest until I loose aggro to the overzealous casters in the group.<br />
<br />

But yes, don't mash till you lose aggro</div></div><hr />

<br />
or if your taunt skill is not maxed &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
BTW, I went through 8 straight fights in PoV without mashing button one time. 9th fight, i kept aggro through shammy malo and slow, cleric cheal, *and* ranger snare then druid pulled aggro /boggle. So I push taunt button and got aggro back.</div></div><hr />

Think you did not make it thru all 22 pages of brutul's taunt test thread.  Current thinking as I understand it is that aggro = Hate + HateBonus and the skill Taunt gives hate. It does not give any hate bonus. The amount of hate it gives is enough to match whoever has the highest hate value of the Taunted NPC, plus a marginal amount.  So even tho you succesfully taunt, you may not actually get agro.  You do gain enough hate to be highest hate.<br />
<br />
Note I stole a great deal of that explanation from Arantius excellent post in Brutul's taunt test thread.  You can find his post here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=33240#post33240) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally speaking it's expected that if you are attacking the mob the hate generated near instantaneously overcomes that hate bonus after a successful taunt - still a few anomolies that're not quite full explained but they could be just that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, good point Val, I probably should have mentioned it.  The Hatebonus for the most part is very small(sitting and frenzy agro I think being the exception), and basically, if you are attacking the mob, you will overcome it pretty much immedietly.<br />
<br />
All you really  need to know is a successfull taunt will give you more hate than anyone else, plus a small amount, and that therefore it is best to save taunt till you loose agro(in most situations, I have heard some good arguments for mashing against big raid mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it's probably a good idea for raid mobs because Hatebonus is negative for all those maddog wizards (range), so it might give you a leg up on hate amongst the melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was essentially the argument, tho I am finding myself having a hard time adjusting to that.</div></div><hr />

You are correct, i am too lazy to read 22 pages =((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lazy nothing...all 22 pages of that in one sitting would be enough to make me scream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never mash taunt in exp groups and ALWAYS mash it on raids, precisely because of what was pointed out here, that hatebonus, or neg hatebonus from ranged attacks can, and likely does give you a substantial leg up from those in the immediate neighborhood.</div></div><hr />
