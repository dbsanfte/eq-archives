<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the biggest reasons the aggro question is a problem is the high population of tanks all competing for one spot in a group. Most other classes stack in groups much better than Plate Tanks.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see to truely address this issue is to continue the 'generalisation' (druid, shaman CH etc) of abilities into the arena of the Tank classes. In it's most radical form I feel it should be possible for a mix of Tanks to group together without requiring a 'supporting' healer/slower class. It would always be more efficient to have such a class in group but the option to do without should be there. Nothing is quite so irritating as LFG and being stuck sitting on the sidelines because you CANNOT do a thing without a certain class. When groups all have their one tank the extra's should be able to make their own way...<br />
<br />
Warriors obviously currently have least Utility and thus the lions share of my suggestions pertain to my class. All the figures are basically educated guesswork as to what seems fair to me in relation to other classes competancies. All abilities should be considered as maximum at lvl 65, if balance requires and the abilities are deemed neccessary before the lower 60's then these abilities should be scaled down as required. Here's some that sprung to mind. The first will probably cause a stir...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior Ability : Cripple<br />
<br />
The Warrior attacks a creature crippling it's ability to attack, in so doing he leaves himself exposed to attack.<br />
<br />
A successful Cripple will SLOW the mob by a certain percentage  (around 50%) for a short duration (1-2 mins). Reuse time of 10 seconds between retries.  Use of Cripple will give aggro similar to a similar power slow spell and penalise the warrior with 1 minute of mitigation penalty equal to that caused by use of /disc aggressive.<br />
<br />
The slow effect is fairly generous as it needs to be to make a tank group effective, the high aggro and increased damage the warrior will take if he remains the centre of the mobs attention serves to prevent casual useage. Defensive and evasive would probably need to be disabled during the period of vulnerability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior Ability : Storm of blades<br />
<br />
The Warrior becomes a whirlwind of steel relentlessly attacking the creatures defenses.<br />
<br />
Duel wield, Double and triple attack success chances would be significantly raised for the duration (3 mins) of this ability (someone with a better knowledge of the actual numbers atm would have to determine how much :p ) with a 6(?) minute reuse time. Activation of any /disc during this period automatically cancels this ability. Nor can the ability be used during the active period of any disc's operation. I believe it should be activable during the cooldown period however.<br />
<br />
Serves pretty much as an alternate /disc aggressive and a means to up the average DPS of a warrior in a group without making a blanket change in balance. The low reuse time means it can actually be used during exping. The ability is balanced by the additional riposte damage the tank would be exposed to if the mob is facing him/enraged during the course of the ability and the inability to use emergency defensive measures without loosing the dps . Would primarily be used as a rogue type rear attack (i.e. not tanking)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior Ability : Berserk Fury<br />
<br />
The warrior builds himself  into a fury, shrugging off blows and returning them tenfold to a variety of opponents. By the end of his fury he is weakened and exposed.<br />
<br />
Activable at any time. /discs in operation and other abilities are immediately disabled. For 30 seconds the warrior may attempt to riposte all attacks directed at him in a 360 degree radius. His riposte chance is increased by 50 - 75 %. All attacks that successfully hit the warriors current target (including ripostes) are considered criticals and are applied as AOE damage to mobs in melee range. For one minute after the effect wears off the warrior suffers the negative aspects of both /disc precise and /disc aggressive (Hit more for more damage). Reuse time of 20 minutes. No other abilities (except /shield) may be used until the cooldown has expired.<br />
<br />
This is primarily just a fun idea :p . Practically there are many reasons that this ability will not see widespread use in normal exping and it's doubtful anyone would consider it appropriate on raids :) But for general coolness factor when it all goes wrong i think this is worthy of inclusion :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior Ability : Surge of Adrenalin<br />
<br />
Adrenalin surging the the warrior ups the pressure on his attackers defenses.<br />
<br />
Short term Haste (40% at lvl 65 for 5 mins with a 10 minute reuse), stacks with item haste but not spell, song haste (except Battlecry/Warcry lines). Stacks with all other warrior abilities except group haste (see below - Timers linked).<br />
<br />
Minor DPS advantage gained when no other haste casting class is available. Adds a little flexibility for minor soloing etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior Ability : Call to Arms<br />
<br />
The warrior encourages his allies to greater efforts.<br />
<br />
Short term group haste (20% for 5 mins with a 10 minute reuse), stacks with item haste but not spell or song haste (Except Battlecry/Warcry lines). Stacks with all other warrior abilities except personal haste (see above - Timers linked). <br />
<br />
Minor boost to all group members in the absense of a haste caster. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other tanks : Paladins<br />
<br />
Paladins in a non-efficency based group are very well equipped at this time as they stand, however they cannot at this time support an entire group in an exp situation. To address this I think it would be acceptable to extend the CH spell to the Defender/Healer class. Perhaps limit it to the druid incomplete heal if the clerics scream over loud. Druids themselves stack in too many roles for me to consider this a nerf of their grouping capability and the new spells in pop available to clerics reduce the importance of this Level 39 spell to their own attractiveness. <br />
<br />
It hardly affects soloing at all since the likelyhood of getting a 10 second cast off uninterrupted in melee is particularly unlikely and in any case when a bard 12 levels lower than myself can kill multiple (blue to them green to me) mobs in a fraction of the time i can kill them with a fraction of the risk i think worrying about soloing is pretty dumb :p .<br />
<br />
Paladins could perhaps gain other minor perks to aid them in specialised situations (AoE Undead nukes etc) to provide a little more flavour.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Tanks: Shadowknights<br />
<br />
I really know too little about Shadow knights to make suggestions concerning them. Although one option did come to mind when visualising the all tank group...<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Line : Waking Nightmare<br />
<br />
The target is trapped in a waking nightmare, unable to react to the outside world until such time as it fights clear of the nightmare or the trance is broken by external stimuli (getting hit).<br />
<br />
A short term (45 second ? ) moderate mana cost Mez which can be used in emergencies for crowd control. Would require heavy maintenance costs in terms of concentration and mana to hold mobs for a long period.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many other ways in which we could allow warriors to tweak group performance via special abilities that should probably be explored. I've primarily concentrated on filling gaps left by lack of another class but it should also be possible to provide options to mildly augment a group that already has the key classes. <br />
<br />
The concept i kept in mind when envisioning those above abilities themselves was that they should not be more efficient than a specialised classes ability in that area, that they should not take the balance too far wide of whatever SoE's current idea's of balance should be (i.e. all abilities cannot be applied for permanenently and most of the powerful ones require the warrior to be operating in a support role with another tank taking the hits).<br />
<br />
In some ways the psychological impact of these abilities and the fact that they are activable and are thus noticeable to other party members is more important than their ultimate effectiveness. When a warrior activates an ability he is making an active contribution to the group, not simply hitting attack (not many people bring a parser to an exp group) and the group can see him making that action - the sense of making a contribution of that shouldn't be underestimated.<br />
<br />
These idea's should not be considered a complete solution, i think this type of generalisation alongside some of the other idea's put forward would provide a greatly needed freedom from the one shot role currently 'enjoyed' by plate tanks in general and Warriors in particular.<br />
<br />
Given that warriors would still be the most group dependant class ( I can't really see a rationalisation that allows warriors to heal themselves or solo effectively since they're all about being in the mobs face) something would still need to be done to offset the current knightly advantage (yes i still want rid of aggro lock :p ). Not least because the trivialisation of mob control would make the idea of these warrior abilities less likely to fly -  but i guess i could live with playing second fiddle so long as I now had some meaningful role outside the MT spot.......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While we're noodling around with fun stuff, I want summon. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will not evade me a crystalline golem!&quot;<br />
<br />
Flag a few mobs unsummonable, have it leave a debuff flag on the mob so warriors can't ping pong it, have it have a sort of limited range, and have it add 500 hate or something. Put it on a 3-5 min timer, so that it or AE taunt would be available almost every pull.<br />
<br />
For that matter, take rampage off the AA list, give it to warriors for fun, and put that on a 3-5 min timer also. Then we'd have /shield, /ae taunt, /summon, and /rampage. Heck, make warcry free too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go Tugurok go. ^_^<br />
<br />
I think Disciplines are functional but ultimately too clumsy to be effective.  The fact that the timers are tied together and have way to long downtime means most are rarely used if used at all.  Going with more independant, triggerable effects should have been how SOE should have implemented them.<br />
<br />
Some of the effects found in /disc are good.  They just need to be more accessible.  We know that Tanking doesn't stack.  As a Paladin can I do something else if I'm not tanking so adding me to an exp group that already has a tank isn't such a loss.  Doing stuff mentioned in this thread helps Warriors because adding two Warriors to a group isn't such a detrement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our warrior DPS isnt too shabby.  Might not be as high as monk and rogues, but we dish out some decent damage output.  Why not take that to another lvl?  <br />
<br />
Add /offensive disc similiar to /defensive where we do more damage output and take more hits.  The current disc now only lasts a couple seconds.  So /offensive should be mirrored to /defensive in ways of damage output increase compared to defensive decrease.<br />
<br />
I personally love /defensive and /evasive and would like to see a similiar /disc for damage.  Splitting offensive and defensive disc's would be wonderful too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just in case I wasn't clear unless otherwise stated my idea's are not timelinked to each other like discs, they're seperate abilities like Aeka said... unlocking current discs would be helpful but I don't think the abilities as they stand make enough of an impact on their own - the ability to ghetto -slow for instance is a much more major advantage than getting critical hits for 12 seconds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Psst, Lorre, you have that already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lorre, we have an exact offensive analog to defensive in our level 60 discipline Aggressive (except that the refresh for some reason is now 30 mins or so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Valeris, its a great idea but I failed to mention it in the post. ^_^<br />
<br />
This is the kind of stuff I think Warriors should push for.  Thinking outside of the box.  SOE has pushed &quot;basic melee&quot; about as far as it can go.  Its time for Pure Melee to get some serious &quot;advanced melee&quot; skills.  Stuff like this can solve the agro problem plus solve the utility problem.<br />
<br />
Divorce the effect from the spell.  Things like &quot;snare&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; make a lot of sense as melee moves as well as spells.  If SOE is clever they can monsters to be immune to one type or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some nice ideas there :)<br />
<br />
But I don't really agree with boosting the knights up.<br />
We're trying to boost ourselves up to their level, why boost them further?<br />
<br />
As for the SK mez.. well 45 seconds is a bit long :), considering that necros only get a mez with shorter time. (Screaming Terror)<br />
<br />
<br />
But giving warriors group abilities sounds like a nice way to go.<br />
<br />
For the group haste, I'd say it should stack with every single other haste out there. Since it's only going to be a 25% increase.<br />
<br />
Would love to see more of those group oriented ideas :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an element of truth to the knights concerns that their current utility isn't enough to make them stand out in any other role (pretty weak compared to warrior woes but even so).<br />
<br />
This isn't about 'us against them', a few additions to knights that increase their own secondary utility (and more important add enough flexibility that tanks together can be an effective group) isn't a negative in my eyes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple more idea's more general.<br />
<br />
special attacks - Each can be used once every 2 minutes and are mutually exclusive (cannot be stacked or activated more than one at a time.<br />
<br />
Hamstring - Snare - short duration<br />
<br />
Crushing Blow - Smashes armour - AC debuff (blatently nicked from Esvee :p ) *Note* Could be used for snap aggro.<br />
<br />
Artery strike - Cut an artery causing heavy bleeding (a DoT and useful for maintaining position on the aggro list - a la Furor's idea)<br />
<br />
CoupdeGrace - 5 times(? - numbers out of my arse) standard crip hit damage (a Warrior 'nuke') - Warrior suffers as if under Rez effects and snared until skill refresh.<br />
<br />
plenty more possible i imagine...<br />
<br />
If we assume this (heck even if we get nothing) I'd like to push for warriors to have access to the spell gems window and be able to activate disc's, Aa's and these abilities via the same mechanism as casters activate a spell.<br />
<br />
*Edit. Best if one spells the name of the person you're Plagarising correctly :p *</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like these ideas. They fit perfectly into the warrior roll. <br />
<br />
Here is my thinking.. A skilled warrior has a variety of tactics he uses but he doesn't have to wait 30 minutes to think about using them or switching from one to another.. he uses the mix as needed for the situation... <br />
<br />
perhaps make stamina more of a factor so that you have to have over 50% to switch tactics... <br />
<br />
We could use more discs, and more freedom in using them. And being able to burst increase on damage may be enough to help with the taunt problem. <br />

<br />
umm when tanking mobs that hit for 600+ I can get kilvs skin of flame off (spellin) that's a 10 second cast :) takes 1 or 2 tries sometimes 3 but it can be channeld</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the slow ability, but 50% is too much!  25% would be better.  Other classes that have traditionally been used as slowers (bards, beastlords) would really feel the pinch if warriors could slow at 50%.<br />
<br />
The offensive ideas are great, warriors need to stack better than they do currently.<br />

But pally CH and SK mez?  Pure craziness.  Stick to the warrior ideas!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part of me says why the hell not. There are still other factors that'd make clerics preffered over you anyway, much like a warrior as slower isn't the 'best' package if you can get a bard or beastlord.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to say that giving paladins any kind of spell/ability that allows them act as primary healer in a group would just be broken. A paladin can currently act as primary healer for a group killing trivial mobs. Any more healing power than that and we encroach too much on clerics abilities.  <br />
<br />
LOL, Graal, but you forget. If they &quot;Balance&quot; Paladins with Clerics like they have with warriors...<br />
<br />
SOE will say...To compensate for their lower mana pool, and other drawbacks, We have decided to give Paladins a new spell.<br />
<br />
Completer Heal - Will heal a single target up to 10,000 hps, but due to all of the disadvantages of being a paladin, this spell will only cost 100 mana and cast in 2.0 sec.</div></div><hr />
