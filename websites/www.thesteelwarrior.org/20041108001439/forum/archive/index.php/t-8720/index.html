It would appear that this movie is them saying goodbye to Everquest.  Probably the nicest that I've seen so far.  This is alot better than Altered Destiny's cleric one.<br />
<br />
Also check out their webpage, they've got some cool movies.<br />
<br />
Any time that I ran into these guys, they were super nice, even if I couldn't understand what alot of them were saying.  Sad to see such well orchestrated players move on.</div></div><hr />

This post was linked to my guilds boards earlier today and it seems to me that maybe the female character you see quite a bit in the last half of the movie is the one leaving.<br />

It's on your server, so is Mirage still around?  From the looks of it they do this thing every once in a while (saw another video on their website that was somewhat similar).  Makes me laugh how different this game was even 2 years ago when I started playing.  Would have loved to have been around at the beginning (stupid UO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Amie the druid is probably leaving, but the way that those guilds acted.. they did things as one, so probably the rest of them are to follow.<br />

I don't know the specificis, but the Jap's have some kind of alliance with other guilds like them, and then a larger raiding guild.  Liberty/Mirage/The Reign/Sacred Knights/Clan Divine Song/Song/and a few others are in a sorts of alliance from as far as I can tell.  I've only ever seen a handful of them on at a time.  All of them can be found doing stuff together, and when they raid its normally them + a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, and I got a flashback from watching those hehe.  I haven't played with sound.. in.. I can't remember.  But hearing those fire beatles scream brought back fond &quot;warm&quot; memories of Qeynos.  The wolves and zombies brought back thoughts of similar zones, such has Qhills and EC.</div></div><hr />
