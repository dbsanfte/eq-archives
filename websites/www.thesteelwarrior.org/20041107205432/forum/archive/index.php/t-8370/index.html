<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else noticed this?  Other night, we are killing a named mob in Qvic, it enrages, and I watch my chat box literally fill up with strike through messages.  I was not tanking, but was meleeing on one of the mob's flanks at the time.  Normally, I would have expected none of my attacks to land in this position, enrage doesn't riposte attacks when you are on the mobs side, but it does prevent them from landing.  In this case, though, it seemed like my 13% strikethrough was causing every attack to land.<br />
<br />
Makes me very curious about the exact mechanism involved.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">tm allows you to casue damage through a riposte. it will not however stop the riposte from hit/miss you.<br />
<br />
unless on the side as you noted were you wouldn't be hit anyway.<br />
<br />
i think the time mod strikethough works differently though. have to ask someone else on that.</div></div><hr />
