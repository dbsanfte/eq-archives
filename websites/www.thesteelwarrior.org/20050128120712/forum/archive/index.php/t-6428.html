<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharse</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all.<br />
Just getting back to EQ from a VERY long time ago. (I remember when they announced a players name when they dinged 20 and got a last name). I want to start a warrior. (Probably Wood Elf- love the plate helm Graphic)<br />
Anyway the only person I know who played this game is/has quit (was a Nec) and left me 4 Weapons as a starting up present.<br />
<br />
13/24 (I think) Blade of Green Dragon<br />
9/19 Defiance<br />
14/22 Black Acrylia Blade (I think)<br />
19/30 Ornate Rune Sword.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can use the Rune sword for 2hs, so Ill keep that one, but what is the best combo of the other three for when I get dual wield?<br />
I would assume Defiance (main) and Acrylia (offhand).<br />
But I can also sell the acrylia for more money to afford better gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Also at such low levels ( everyone on Bertox seems to be 65+) it's going to take me a while to level. Am I right in assuming that for the moment I should go with HP items over AC until 30-40 or so?<br />
<br />
And finally (if you're still reading this). Are there any good tanking guides about how to maintain aggro /be second tank at low levels? All the guides here seem to be about 60+. As I don't have a guild or a bunch of friends to play online with I'd like to ake sure I can do the job properly from the start so that maybe I'll be a welccome addition to groups.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">defiance to start with because it has the lowest delay and even though you say you will gain levels slowly you will actually gain levels a whole lot faster than people did in the old days when they used something like a 4/28 slasher through their first 10 levels. you need a low delay to even come remotely close to keeping your weapon skill up to par with your level. also high damage output weapons are pointless before level 20 where you have a damage cap working against you.<br />
<br />
if i had to do it over again i would practice the full spectrum of 1h skills at low levels where its much less painful to skill them up than it is at level 65.<br />
<br />
im about to switch to 1hb main hand soon as i get points saved up for an anger augment and its just slightly a bummer that my 1hb skill is at 137 now. but thats not the biggest bummer. what really hurts is having a 2hb at about 105 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharse</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply- actually I have one more weapon that I didn't mention. Can't remeber what it was called, but for a lvl 1 it was a 1/18 ratio. (at best I think it's 7/18 for lvl 30+)I figured I'd use that as it would take me longer to kill things and that would give me more practice time. I'm in no particular hurry to hit the high levels. <br />
I just want to make sure I know what I'm doing so that groups will be happy to have me.<br />
Brings me to another question is it NECESSARY to have everything maxed? I know it's nice as it means if you can get the big dps weapons thats great,but if I just want to use 1hs and 2hs will that be enough? Or will groups not want me as I won't have the &quot;uberest&quot;  equipment?<br />
I'm not playing this game to make sure my character has the latest and greatest weapon. I'm playing it to try and have some fun. <br />
<br />
So right now I can sell the 14/22 weapon. (which is kinda useless at my lvl anyway) and buy some gear. I' leaning towards the cheap HP gear over a 35 or so AC BP (which I'm guessing won't do that much until I'm alot higher anyway).<br />
Or should I forget about the HP gear and go AC from the start?<br />
<br />
Also when I hit 13 should I leave the defiance main and use Green Dragon offhand or vice versa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it is right now, due to really good gear (crafted, crustacean shell and better) being really cheap/easy to get, the lower level game is ridiculously easy now.  Get yourself a combination of crusty, gothic steel,  and crafted, stick with the weapons you have now until you need better, and if anyone gives you a hard time about your gear they're most likely a jackass.  That kit should last you into your 40's, at which time you'll want to start thinking about  saving for cultural/ornate/ldon type armors.  You'll also want to upgrade your weapons a time or two so that you have a decent aggro combo.  Frostbringer and veno axe are kinda nice for that level iirc.   <br />
Search the forums and you'll find everything you wanted to know and some stuff you probably didnt about what gear is available at what levels. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you correctly identify the best weapon set-up among your choices.<br />
And I think you can fairly easily hold agro with that set up until your late 40s.<br />
The basics of tanking haven't changed. Get agro, position mob, kill mob. Do not let mob kill your casters.<br />
Work on all your skills.<br />
<br />
Some things have changed though. You have a new tool to build hate: the provoke/incite line. It's very very nice.<br />
<br />
You will find (perhaps you've already noticed) that many old-school zones for leveling are pretty much empty now, and you might want to look around on this site for suggestions on that. You can also do /who all &lt;your level&gt; lfg to find out where most folks are experiencing.<br />
<br />
If you stopped playing before Luclin, go to the bazaar. It's the place for shopping for gear. <br />
<br />
If you stopped playing before the Planes of Power expansion, you'll find travel stunningly easy and that a good many faction issues at lower levels moot.<br />
<br />
When you're able, start doing Lost Dungeons (LDoN) fighting. You'll find it different from the old Kunark days.<br />
<br />
Here's a thread on &quot;basic&quot; positioning when you're main tank. Some of it is not so basic, but do look at the pros and cons of positioning yourself with respect to pets and whether you're going to face toward your caster or away from them: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4690&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1<br />
<br />
since you'll get to level 30 far far faster than folks did in the old days, here's a thread on the /shield ability that you can use at that point: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6067<br />
<br />
here's another thread, on PC. I'd ignore what I say in this thread about South K. If you want a group in your mid 20s, go to someplace line M. Seru then HHK or maybe LDoN. PC really is kind of a mess--there are lots of dirt ignorant players there, and groups fight more like streetbrawling than with any sort of organization. If you need a break from it about level 20 go to Neth. Lair. Not very many folks there, but very often they know how to play. After a couple levels, you can get groups in M. Seru, then HHK. By that time you'll know folks and be more sorted out: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4906<br />

Good Hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you asked if its really necessary to have all skills maxed. absolutely not. as long as the weapons you currently are using are maxed thats all you ever actually need. reason is simple. if you get a different weapon at high level you can always spend a week maxing up the skill required for that weapon.<br />
<br />
of course you will hate having to do that. you will be all bummed out. you will regret your past. you will muse on how you would do it if you had life to live over again. but in the end its still only a wasted week right?<br />
<br />
life is simpler though if you at least make a modest attempt to keep MOST weapon skills progressing at least somewhat. i mentioned my 1hb and 2hb are at about 137 and about 100 each. well at least i didnt have to say zero and zero right? now THAT would be scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharse</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I agree and see your point about keeping the skills maxed, my question is more of-will groups still accpet me (I don't really see myself ever joining a high end raid group) if I have *less* than the nest dps weapon out there.<br />
<br />
I see my Warrior using 2hs (sword) 1hs (sword,maybe an axe).<br />
Probably will do piercing. I can't really see using a 2hb or 1hb weapon, even if they do have a small advantage in dps over what I'll have.<br />
<br />
Also anyone noticed a real lack of low lvl chars these days? I got Kharse up to lvl 10 and decided to try and find a group. The only people I found weren't looking for a group as they were being leveled by friends or two boxing.<br />
<br />
Is this going to be the same until 40 or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that you may or may not know is if you're making a wood elf, be nice to yourself and make him worship Rallos Zek, you'll have a lot easier time as a casual or starting up player worshiping Rallos than you will being agnostic or worshiping some other diety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer to another of your questions--will groups accept you if you don't have the best dps weapons--is yes, they will.<br />
<br />
Warriors are gear-dependant, and better gear will make it easier for you to do your job. But a large majority of players know that the role of warriors is to tank and they also know that tanking is important. That will get you an invite to groups looking for a tank.<br />
<br />
Some warriors have a problem getting invited *back* into groups with people they've grouped with before. But those warriors are probably not being ignored because their gear is substandard. They're probably being ignored for one of the following reasons:<br />
1. They're immature, annoying human beings who are no fun to play with. Often, they feel compelled to demonstrate some sort of unresolved psychological insecurities that they have, and these insecurities almost always involve bodily wastes, human sexuality, and male and female primary and secondary sexual characterisitics. Nor do they find interesting or unusual ways of demonstrating these insecurities--no, not only do they have distasteful emotional problems, but they manifest these problems in predictable, boring ways. Even their typos fall into predictable patterns. They make other people feel like unpaid babysitters.<br />
2.  Without demonstrating that they know how to play their class, they start telling other people how to play. They bitch the exp. is too slow. They want to endlessly ramp up the risk the group faces because after all they routinely solo harder mobs than this. They make decisions that get other characters killed, and they don't even know they've made the mistake.<br />
3. They never ask about mana levels and when casters say &quot;LoM&quot; or &quot;OOM&quot; the warrior completely ignores them. They explain to shaman that buffs don't do anything; they ignore &quot;a &lt;mob&gt; has been slowed&quot; message from enchanters; they tell druids their healing sucks; they tell rogues that monks are better because they can pull; they tell the monk that rogues do more damage. Well, you get the picture.<br />
4. They simply fail to notice that a mob or mobs is killing the casters. <br />
5. They loot far more than their share.<br />
<br />
My guess is that you won't have these problems, and thus won't have problems getting groups and finding people who want you as their tank.<br />
<br />
In fact, if you are cool to hang out with, if you learn how to tank and pull when necessary; if you're smart enough to learn spawn rates and the characteristics of the mobs you're hunting; if you take the time to compliment good play when you see it; if you learn what other classes actually do for a group and then do what you can to make your group fight better--if you do these things you'll have no problem finding other good players who will go out of their way to help you get good gear.<br />
<br />
Your ability to increase the dps that your group does by increasing the dps of your own weapons is surprisingly flat. Your ability to increase the dps of your group by playing your warrior really well is exponentially higher than increases in the damage you'll ever do.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong--gearing up is a major concern for a warrior. Ultimately you have to hold the attention of the mob and you have to be able to take a punch. But for quite some time your gear will not be the critical factor in your ability to get groups. By then you should have a lot of friends who want you to tank for them so badly that they'll spend a lot of energy helping you fight the mobs you need to fight for better gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well put brabble.<br />
<br />
(heh .. grouped with a guy like that yesterday.)<br />
<br />
yesterday i put my split blade away and replaced it with a copper hammer. my 1hb was at 137 and we had just completed a ldon and agreed to stay the remaining 30 minutes. i asked if i could practice 1hb and they said sure.<br />
<br />
well im practicing it because i plan on selling the split blade. i want an innate proc. now the blade has an augmented damage proc but thats it. the hammer i plan on augmenting with anger 3 after i win 11 more missions.<br />
<br />
ready for the amazing thing? the hammer at 137 skill held taunt better i think than the split blade did at 250 skill :(<br />
<br />
... and i havent even put the hate aug on the hammer yet.<br />
<br />
and no one but no one (including myself) was even cognizant of the fact that my dps went down :(<br />
<br />
so i guess groups really arent going to care about your dps the way some of us wanted to believe :)<br />
<br />
and apparently yes its no big deal practicing your skill whenever you darned well get around to it :)<br />
<br />
40 skillups in so far 1 1/2 hours. yeah .. it goes pretty quick triple hasted :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ready for the amazing thing? the hammer at 137 skill held taunt better i think than the split blade did at 250 skill <br />
Weapon with agro proc at 0 skill doing no melee damage &gt; higher damage weapon without agro proc at 250 skill<br />
<br />
Proof: Gnoll Hide Lariats/Silken whip of ensnaring<br />
<br />
Damage agro really is worthless, the only things that matter on agro for warriors is swings and procs.  If you depend on damage to hold agro at higher levels, you're going to end up with the slower sitting when the mob is at 0% health (after slowing at 95% and doing nothing else) and he STILL runs after him/her.  Happened to my adventure group last night several times.<br />
<br />
As a healer, I don't care if you stand there with attack off and only do damage when you riposte the mob, as long as you can hold agro through everyone else debuffing/killing it.  Your DPS doesn't matter to me, nor to almost anyone unless you're soloing it...only holding agro and having enough hp for me not to burn my mana down chaining CHs constantly to keep you alive while the rest of us kill it.  Once you get your agro abilities up to snuff, THEN you can start working on getting more DPS output with my blessing (I'll even find you groups so you can get AA/gear).</div></div><hr />
