<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bodvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a lvl 50 barbarian warrior who follows The Tribunal and was wondering what I should get to get him back into action.  I have no armor or weapons but I have about 100k to spend on him.  I was also working on my epic before I sold all my gear before I went on a hiatus and have everything cept for Chardok Blade.  I also was wondering what clicky items or weapons of each skill type I should get to keep all my weapon skills up.  Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">as much of the deity armour (helanic tundra?) as you can if  you don't plan on raiding/guilding yourself...a haste item....and some halfass weaponry ( maybe a greatstaff of thunder if they're less than 10K pp ); a frostbringer....whatever coin you have left to do a /quick bazaar search and see what looks good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What Shik said.<br />
<br />
The Trubunal armor is very nice, lots of HP and STA and good AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also for Fingers I'd suggest looking up some Gallantry rings they are pretty cheap now.  Maybe for wrist Silver Chitin Wristband or if you got a few friends and good CoV faction Bracer of Benevolence quest however it spelled :p.  Earrings I suggest Bloodmetal earrings but they are still fairly expensive but if you have the left over money I'd say go for it they will last you a long time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I would get a full suit of Helanic Tundra (minus belt or cloak) and a nice haste item.  New belt from Veskar seems to fit that bill, name escapes me atm though.  Fairly inexpensive for the stats and 31% haste I believe.<br />
<br />
Then I would do some simple ones like Velium Fire Wedding rings (6ac/65hps) and black sapphire electrum earrrings (2ac/35hps/25mana).  Hopefully you will have enough for a decent aggro weapon, Frostbringer or new Smithed Ykesha (Honed blade of the ykesha I beleive is what you could use).<br />
<br />
After that, level.  When you get to a level of being able to use a GreatStaff of Thunder I would look into buying one.  I got one recently from a guildmate and am quite impressed with it for DPS and aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Helanic Tundra is the stuff. Priorities on pauldrons, legs and bracers. <br />
Helm of Raldukan. <br />
Valorium rings are dropping like rocks (4Kish now on Veeshan) and are nice. <br />
Mosquito leg earrings are down in the 10K range. <br />
Soulscream belt, Silvery belt of contention or RBG for haste I would say. <br />
Weapons, Greatstaff of Thunder if you have enough cash, or Frostbringer and xxxx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Strauf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Those Honed Yaks seem to proc a lot during a fight. They are  going for 5-6K right now. Not sure how much aggro they generate, In never used a Yak before but its 75DD and a 0 second stun so it seems like it will do well.<br />
<br />
Another very nice armor peice is the Tundra mask, 12AC 60HP and some melee stats. The boots are a great peice too, almost like a Boots of the Storm Lite.</div></div><hr />
