<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kissfart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Will this combo last me up to lvl 65?<br />
I'm doing adventures so I can add an angerII aug to the CHoS.  But am wondering if I should wait for a better weapon to augment. Thanks for your time.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It certainly will, and easily can be your weapons at 65. It's not the end-all be-all of warrior agro weapons, but there's no denying that combo's effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I use a SoBS/CHoS combo with AngerII on the SoBS (I bought it in the bazaar pre-aug'ed on FV for a very decent price), and it works just peachy for me for xp'ing.  With the provoke line, I have no real agro issues in groups.<br />
<br />
Excluding some potentially amazing and easy to get GoD drops, the CHoS/SoBS with augments is more than your average warrior will need for a very long time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kodyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also use this weapon combo when I am MA and I use the WMBS when I am not.  Is there a better DPS weapon than the WMBS for use when I am not the MA?  Or should I still use the SoBS or CHoS with some other 1h weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have better luck with the GSoT usually than I do with the Droga wpns.  Even with the recent price inflation due to tribute points, it's still 1k or less in the bazaar most of the time.  Also, you'll get less ripostes with a 2 hander.  (yeah, I know...maybe it's only 6 or 8 more dps from the mob, but it's the spikes that kill ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is there a better DPS weapon than the WMBS for use when I am not the MA? <br />
<br />
If I recall from parses posted on the old EZBoards, for droppables I thought WMBS was number one. I know it beat the WB.<br />
<br />
Anyone recall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kxorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree, the WMBS is the best droppable DPS, at least pre-GoD.  I've seen DPS charts at the Paladins of Norrath boards (ack don't flame me :D), and it beats the WB. <br />
<br />
Not bad for a weapon that costs 1/10th of a windblade.. that ugly overpriced axe.  In fact, the heavy windriders lance was also about equal to the WB DPS, again at a fraction of the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kodyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am currently using the SoBS and CHoS, both with Anger II augs.  Is there a better dropable combo out there for me when I am MA?</div></div><hr />
