<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're working on this quest, don't wait around once Valdanov spawns. He de-spawns 10 - 20 minutes after popping.<br />
<br />
My wife and I were hanging out in PoK doing tradeskills when we got a tell from an acquaintance asking us if we had been looking for an NPC named Valdanov? We just about fell out of our chairs, then raced to the bank to get the bane weapons we bought a few weeks ago. Our plan was to engage the guy and keep him occupied while the rest of our group formed. <br />
<br />
We got to Tenebrous and ran to the castle with a train of coterie in our wake. When we entered the place, Valdanov was on the ground floor and aggro'd on me immediately. The guy who popped Valdanov in the first place may have trained him down there; we're not sure. Anyway -- I started doing the warrior thing while my wife attempted to heal me. Unfortunately, she kept getting interrupted by the 3 vampires beating on her, and I soon went down. She managed to evac out. <br />
<br />
We regrouped as rapidly as we could in PoK and returned within 6 minutes, this time with a group of 5. Valdanov, however, had de-spawned. Grrrr!!!!<br />
<br />
Moral of the story -- just camp the guy. That's what I'm going to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KermeyKhazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just buy the ashes in the bazaar its 1000 times easier. I got lucky last week guildie had them up for sale and just gave em to me. The item rocks in the back slot. 0 complaints only problem was what i should replace my CoF with. Ended up goin with Spiked Seahorse lost 2% haste but used the extra 200k i would have spent on the Belt of Raging nature to pick up a crystalized acid bracer to replace Rock Molded. This quest is well worth any effort to complete.</div></div><hr />

I'm curious -- how long did you camp the bazaar before your guildie turned up with the ashes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a lucky frog, first night i decided to do the quest I logged on and Mithlandir (Guild Cleric -I owe him big time) had them up and just gave em to me. Since i didnt have to kill big V the rest was simple only time sink was waiting for a few mobs to spawn  they were lvl 46-52 ish i believe. Trivial at 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only problem with buying the vampyre volatis ashes in the bazaar is that there are two items with the same name: one that identifies as &quot;Ashes of Valdanov Zevfeer&quot; - which is the one you want, and one that doesn't. Since they are LORE, if you already have the fake ashes (from Heratius Grolden) you can safely buy the ashes in the bazaar because if the trader is trying to pass of Heratius' as Valdanov's, you won't be able to buy it. If you don't have the fake ashes on your character I would strongly suggest NOT buying the ashes in the bazaar unless you find the trader when they're not afk and have the ashes identified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Gharghael!<br />
<br />
I have Heratius ashes on my trader so that I don't get taken by the folks selling the wrong ones for 10kpp or more. I bought mine for 50pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mady</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agree also.<br />
<br />
Found some ahes in Fennin Ro bazaar for 2k, trader was afk (or not responding), but not being a gambler didnt even want to bet 2k on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can distinguish the right ashes from the wrong one without identifiing them.<br />
The ashes from Valdanov are stackable, you will see the &quot;1&quot; on the image of the item. The ashes of Heratius Grolden are not stackable so you wont see the Number on them.</div></div><hr />

I verified this yesterday, they must have changed it. Im 100% sure that they weren't stackable before.<br />
So no way to distinguish Heratius Ashes from Valdanovs Ashes without identify anymore. Have that in mind when you buy from a bazaar trader.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You know you can spawn him, right?<br />
<br />
How exactly?<br />
<br />
I've been doing this quest and this spawn has been seriously killing my weekend sleep time heh.  Last Friday I was at this camp from 11pm till 7am, no spawn.  Then later that Saturday night, I was at this camp from about midnight till 5:30am.  No spawn again.<br />
<br />
Any insight into how to get this bastard to spawn would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">can anybody give me a realistic estimating of how tough valdonov is? is he tougher than BoT mini-bosses, for instance?

<br />
Friend of mine gave me the skinny on him.  He only hits for 200-300s, but has a 1000 lifetap which he rarely uses luckily.  Supposedly he has around 100k hps, but I think that's more of an illusion due to the fact that you're forced to wield 10/23 weapons against him.  He is immune to melee, unless it has bane vampyre on it.  He will eat nukes just fine, so any casters you have there will speed up the kill by leaps and bounds.<br />
<br />
Stakes are sold in Katta, as well as a few quests that can be done, but the Katta stakes are the same and in some cases better than the quested ones.  The stakes have a 23 delay, and bane vampyre +10 on them, for a whopping 10/23 &quot;piercing&quot; weapon (our skill cap in piercing is lower than our other skills, so here's another form of DPS loss).  At least we can wield two of these, the poor SKs and pallies get stuck with only one 10/23 weapon.... that sucks.<br />
<br />
As long as he's slowed, you'll be fine.  It will be easy, just lengthy.  Just make sure you never let yourself get too far down in health before healing.  If you're low on HPs when he decides to give you a 1000 point love tap, you could be in trouble.<br />
<br />
I've been barrowing my friends shaman for this, which is what he used to do it.  My warrior/cleric/wizard combo won't work for this guy.  The cleric would run out of mana long before I'd be able to kill him without reliable slows.  When slowed, the shaman will be more than enough to keep me healed.  I plan on starting the fight with my regular weapon setup to gain a lot of aggro first, even though I won't be doing damage, before pulling out the stakes.  Probably a good idea since I don't think the 10/23 weapons will aggro for shit.  Just like on Seru without Seru bane weapons, I'm sure aggro will still build even though you can't do any damage.</div></div><hr />

Well this sucks.  Only ashes I have seen for sale in Stromm bazaar were the non-stackable fake ones with someone trying to rip people off by selling them for 20k.  What an ass.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll have to buy a piercer and work on my piercing skill.  It's only at like 50.   :(</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info. I've got a bunch of those 10/23 bane stakes from katta in my inventory, and have been planning to set up camp, but a friend of mine was saying a full group of 65's would be necessary to take him out. I'm inclined to get a KEI on the cleric and give it a shot. I'll probably have a 58 shaman with me too, so she may be able to upgrade my ToD slow and will have some extra heals too. I'll be sure to have her cripple him as well, hopefully it'll cut down on the taps.<br />
<br />
Hopefully horatius won't take forever to pop!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">FYI there is a mind numbingly simple quest you can do to get a 16/21 vampyre stake. Talk to the guy just outside Katta to start it (he spawns every 3 hours) and you follow him and kill ~9 green con vamps in under 11 minutes and follow him back to Katta and he gives you the upgraded piercer.<br />
<br />
P.S. How do you spawn Vald? Please don't post 'you know you can spawn him, right?' and then not give any details :( I've been camping him for a long time and he has never spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Payn: Thanks for the info about the piercer quest. Are you talking about one of the guards just inside tenebrous?<br />
<br />
To my knowledge you spawn valdanov by clearing the castle until heratius groldan shows up. When you kill him, valdanov will spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Talk to Jonathan (sp?), he spawns right next to the gaurds in the archway. You can look at my magelo, I have the piercer in one of my backpacks. I have another of the stakes in the bank that I grab whenever I pass thru Katta omw to the Coterie castle.<br />
<br />
Right, I knew about Heratius, but the other poster came across as there might be a trick to even getting Heratius to spawn.<br />
<br />
Edit: Heratius only spawns on the balcony on the top level correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm guessing he's assuming nobody knows about heratius. Clearing is the only trick I know of, maybe he'll come back and enlighten us. It sure would be nice if I could just waltz in, spawn valdanov, and kill him. I could actually bring a crew with me that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">can vampire be kited :)? does he summon?<br />
it would be sweet if this guy is 2 boxable. I mean I can either kite him with warrior when lom or choose not to mele at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My understanding is you can take him out behind the castle and kite him until the cows come home. I haven't done it yet though so be careful if you try :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Valdanov does not summon, but will gate on low health and will regen to full if you let him do that and don't re-agro immediately. It's possible to kite him right off the balcony and if he's close enough to spawn or out of mana he will not gate.<br />
<br />
Remember:<br />
<br />
Mob_01 begins to cast the Gate spell.<br />
Mob_01 beings to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
...means they are casting gate.<br />
<br />
Mob_01 begins to cast the gate spell.<br />
Mob_01 tries to hit YOU, but misses!<br />
<br />
...means the script to make them cast gate went off, but they have no mana to actually cast it. If that happens then they will not attempt to gate again and you can continue kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Since he is kitable I dont understand how any 2 box with ok gear would have any difficulty killing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Good question. I guess my only concern would be possibility of his regen being too fast for the amount of dps my 2-box combo could do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">regular mobs dont regen when engaged or if they do its something like 1 a tick. There are some mobs that regen insanly, but I dont think this guy does at least not from what I read here. Plus I've heared twice about two different bards soloing this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ah well that is good news. I will duo pwn him this weekend, hopefully!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You are forgetting that luclin era mobs have massive regen. Just look at greenies in marus seru. My cleric can melee them, but after a couple hits they are back to 100% health and he is level 54. Kunark and Original eq mobs have almost zero regen even when non agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">masive luclin regen? on non raid mobs? when mob is agroed? never heard of it. Whatever dps I do on lucling mobs be it tanking or druid kitting I never had them regen more then whatever dmg I am doing to them currently. Like in ME when camping VT shard I was root/doting about 10 mobs and since my mana regen is not insnae I had to use clickies to kill them. Druid epic does 55 dmg a tick which works out to about 9 dps and mobs hp were always going down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Holy crap, I need to look into that 16/21 stake, hadn't heard about that before.  Is it 1handed?  I'm just taking a guess here, but I'd assume it's a 2handed weapon, which is why I probably passed it over when looking for better stakes on the web.  Seems to me a weapon of that calibre (Blade of Carnage is 15/20 for example) wouldn't come from killing 9 greenies.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure it's only a 16/21 because of the bane damage, and therefore only on vamp's.</div></div><hr />

Here's you stake info. Johanius Stake of Slaying (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1522) You recieve the 12/21 stake and also see a 10/23 for your efforts. They are 1h pierce, prim/sec weapons, and droppable, however they are LORE. It is a very simple quest.<br />
<br />
Damage values I listed were just Bane DMG: Vampyre. This bane will only work on Luclin vampyres BTW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">So I was talking to someone in game the other day about Heratius's rarity and he said that you don't have to kill anything in the castle and that he's a random pop? I'm not 100% sure about this because everything I've read so far says he spawns on the balcony so I've just been clearing the 2 up there and then the level 50 named for cash loot. Can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
P.S he said he's killed Valdanov 5 times and each time he was just up when he got there and not a spot where a normal coterie spawns on the 3rd floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Payn, I'm really dubious about the report you've heard that Valdanov was &quot;just up&quot; when your acquaintance arrived. Could they have mistaken Heratius for Valdanov?<br />
<br />
I ask because in my experience Valdanov despawns 10 - 20 minutes after he pops, even if he was engaged at some point in that window. <br />
<br />
I really would love to hear that the person you spoke with is correct, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Sorry, I should have been more clear. He was saying Heratius was up when he got there, not Valdanov. Each time he would kill Vald as well once he spawned upon death of Heratius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">OK. So I ran out and camped the castle for a couple hours this weekend. I had a group of 4 and we pretty much kept the entire castle cleared the entire time, including the 3 named pops. Heratius Groldan never popped. Does he pop in place of any mob in the castle? Any named? Purely randomly?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">3rd floor pop only and has his own (heratius that is) spawn point from what I've been reading. Has 60 hour window in which he can spawn at 3 hour increments. Don't quote me on this, but it's the most I've found so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">This camp feels like Stormfeather 2.0... other than the nice bonus of getting some nice cash drops while doing it.  Loaded myself up on gems and the assorted armors that drop there.<br />
<br />
First time I was there it was for 7 hours straight, no Groldan, but at least I got to take home a good 2kpp in sales to a merchant.<br />
<br />
5 hour camp the next night, no Groldan again /sigh, 3kpp in sales this time cause I knew what armor pieces went for more and filled up on those instead heh.<br />
<br />
3 hours another night, no Groldan, but I got these nifty 3sec cast right clicky shadow step boots off one of the named.  Totally didn't expect that.  http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7725<br />
<br />
3 hours last night again, still no Groldan :(<br />
<br />
This particular week I don't have to be in to work quite as early as normal, so I'm gonna have many many more hours logged at this camp with no Groldan to show for it.  At least I hope not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Valorie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">When I did this with my guild we went to the top floor of the castle and cleared the whole floor, then kept it cleared after around an hour Groldan spawned.<br />
<br />
So I think its probably worthwhile getting a few friends , buying some stakes from Katta and clearing that top floor to spawn Groldan.<br />
<br />
PS: Forgot to add, the balcony was the camp spot.<br />

I'd suggest taking a tracker when camping him cause I am pretty sure when I did it, when he spawned he was wandering from Grimling Forest zone toward the vamp castle.<br />

Or, if my memory is playing tricks on me again, that might have been a different mob for the quest... but I don't think so</div></div><hr />

I took a druid with me on this one, tracked from middle of zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Kerzar spawns near Grimling zone, seems to take about 20 minutes after you do turn in to the guard. Then he paths to right down the hill from the Castle entrance and stops , at least for a while. So you can just sity outside the castle and wait for him.<br />
<br />
Heratius spawns on the balcony and is a seperate spawn from the regular Vamps up there. I have a Lvl 20 ranger sitting on hill behind castle watching for Heratius last couple weeks. Logged on to check yesterday morning and a guildy was just starting to clear the castle. I sat around working on the rangers skills and suddenly there was Heratius. So I logged the tracker and ran the warrior and shaman there and we killed him. Then I did the whole quest as I hadnt started it yet.<br />

Logged for dinner and when I got back on last night the same guildy was just logging on with his Paladin. Since nothing was going on we decided to clear castle for the heck of it and when we got up to third floor, there was Heratius again. So we killed them again and he got his shield to. Was a pretty productive day</div></div><hr />

<br />
I invested an additional 4.5 hours into the Heratius/Valdanov camp last night. Heratius never showed his pointy fangs, darn it. My guildmates are starting to think that this is an elaborate practical joke I'm playing on them.<br />
<br />
What we did:<br />
We killed every thing that moved in that castle as soon as it spawned for 4.5 hours. That means we covered the theory that Heratius is linked to the nameds. That covers the theory that he's tied to the trash. That covers the theory that he is on a 4 hour timer.<br />

I've heard from people who have said they killed everything and he spawned, I've also heard from people who just entered the zone and there he was prior to any killing at all.<br />
<br />
This spawn is pissing me off.  I'm past the point where I'm willing to sit at the camp and wait for him anymore, cause I know that's just a waste of time.  No amount of clearing will help or equally not help.  Just bound my wizard on the mountain side overlooking the balcony there and check the spot everytime I log on and just before logging off.</div></div><hr />

You can MQ the final turn in with the badge and token (both no-drop) and then the person you want to recieve the shield turns in the ashes. The badge and token need to be done the hard way though.

<br />
The ashes are a biotch to get.  I am of the opinion that there is a pain in the keister part to each quest.   Be it a rare spawn, a time consuming camp each one seems to have a part that is not wholly pleasant.    Well, on this one, its the ashes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try this guide.  It got me and my buddy thru the quest no problems :<br />
<br />
http://www.rpgexpert.com/466.html<br />
<br />
Only thing is its dated on some of the fight info.  We used 4 non elemental 65s for most of the fights and it was overkill.  But the walk thru is excellent .    I hope it helps you out and answers your questions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I know it isn't bugged. <br />
It's just a pain.<br />
<br />
But I'm still willing to undergo the suffering for that back item. ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Well, it is bugged. I did the Kerzar encounter atleast 6 times. He likes to despawn before you have a chance to question him after the fight. Also, I've noticed that whenever I've spawned him, I waited for the changing of the guard, and then I would see 4 kerzars spawn instead of just one. Maybe it was just a side effect of having had to do the beginning over so many times. Its really annoying, if he despawns without giving you the key, you have to start all the way over.<br />
<br />
Finally beat him and had the final response hotkeyed with a target command and the chat message to get him to give me the key. Hes despawned to fast for it work any other way for me. he would only stay up for about 2 seconds before going poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Did Kezar on CT Sat, 7/9.  Worked fine.  He did self invis though, casts that vampyre invis on himself.  And he does despawn and forms 4 leather clad vamps.  <br />
<br />
You should have the key after you say &quot;who is Valdanov&quot; and then &quot;what abilities&quot; .  The last line will make him disapeear, you get the key, 4 vamps spawn.<br />
<br />
Did the MQ with the token and badge.  Also, I would say this quest is the reason I like EQ.  What a great dialog this has.  A well thought out story and plot and I love the conjuring block for the shade.  Hands down my favorite quest in EQ.<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Yeah, my problem wasn't know what to say, but having time to say it. He simply would despawn too fast for me to type the dialog, never mind read the text. I'm not slouch behind a keyboard either, when I say he despawned too fast, I mean it. I wold kill him, he'd despawn and respawn full life quest version for you to dialog with, but then would despawn after 1 or 2 seconds. Thats why I say that it is bugged. You didn't even have time to target him and type &quot;what abilities&quot; because he would despawn too fast. Followed by 4 generals spawning and me running for the zoneline.<br />
<br />
Finally had to make a hotbutton to<br />
<br />
/tar kerzar<br />
/pause 1<br />
/say what abilities<br />
<br />
and hit it as soon as I saw the death message for the first kerzar.<br />
<br />
Yes the quest works, but I don't think this is how it was intended to work. Maybe others haven't had this problem, but I sure had enough experience with it (6 times) to say that I definitely did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Its not bugged, but you got to know what your doing to succeed.   When he gets low you have to ease off when fighting him.  The mob will not surrender if you keep bashing him when you ask for parley.  You will see his script and he will resume his fight if you stay on him!  I used bash to finished him from 4% down.<br />
<br />
Vik's right on the money with the hotkey.  The keys are let him surrender and have the hotkey ready.  It works.  <br />
<br />
When he gets low on HP and I mean under 10% ease off and take him down slow.  Once he surrenders .  Stop attacking.  Hit your hotkey and viola its done look out for the coterie generals.   I have helped 4-5  on this and it ain't broke.   <br />
<br />
This happened to me my first time I did it.  However, each time after this I succeeded using the above method.    The quest was not bugged .  I simply didn't back off as I was three boxing.  Also, if you flubb it up .   Do not repeat the beginning of the quest!   Have a porter friend bind in Katta and do the entry part of running to SH and talking to get the  orders for Falion with Nathyn.    That way if you mess up and it happens you can redo it fast and furious.   It doesn't matter who spawns Kerzar afterall!<br />
<br />
I got my friend a shield on 7/11/04.   It 's not bugged but it takes being careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The initial Kerzar dies like normal and respawns (untargeted) full health after you kill him, he give the submission message when he respawns. You actually did kill him, it just that another version spawns immediately on top of him. You needn't worry about attcking him after he submits, because when he does, you've already killed him and its another kerzar that you are talking to.<br />
<br />
On the redoing the begining part, if someone else does the begining over for you and hands the note in to spawn kerzar, that personm MUST use their badge to hand into kerzar to get him to try to attack you. The one he gives back isn't actually the same one (cast identify to see what I mean) so you can't use the one you previously used on kerzar (in fact he won't even accept the one you used on a previos attempt and will hand it back to you) to initiate the script. As far as I know, you can't just attack Kerzar to get him to do his little death scropt and respawn the dialog version so you need the 2nd badge, not the 3rd from the failed attempt.<br />
<br />
I hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Sorry you've had those problems, Vikken. :( <br />
That part went smoothly for me. Where I ran into trouble was being too eager on a couple of things (spawning Ajeea before I had a group in place, for example -- DOH!).<br />
<br />
All in all, I /agree Faederya about the quality of this quest. The dialogue is good, and the story is well-thought out so that the running around you do actually builds up the plot. The part that annoys me is the rarity of the Heratius spawn. Oughta be some way to trigger him, darn it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>jakazzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">i camped ashes in bazaar for 9 months and tried all sorts of elaborate strats to catch him up or get other ppl to send me tells if they see him, but he always despawned, and i never once saw the real ashes in bazaar.  i ended up camping him twice for about 5 hours each time, first time we left after 5, second he popped on about 5 hours in, we killed him and now i have my shield ; )  lets see, about the toughness we had 3 groups of non-VT/ele geared players, tank was a pally with full undead bane AAs and that nice 2hsword for vampbane,  7.2k hp,  cleric and 3 druids had absolutely no trouble healing him, and it took approx. 2 minutes to kill him, he was only lifetapping the tank, he never got turned.  so yeah he has a lot of hp.  our dps was i think a 62 wiz, a 65 mage, 3 65 bls, and a bunch of pallys and rangers.</div></div><hr />

I had tried just kiting him to begin with, but he has a very very short aggro range, and WILL regen to full quickly if oyu run out of it even an inch.<br />

<br />
Depends on the cleric's mana regen I'd imagine.  He's said to have a good 100k hps.  While his melee unslowed is a relatively low danger to you before needing a heal, the length of the battle could be a higher danger to the cleric's mana.  Slowed, heals would be needed so infrequently that the cleric should have no probably keeping his mana up.  Unslowed, I'm not so sure.<br />
<br />
You and a 65 shaman would have a much securer chance at success I'd imagine.  That's what I've already prepaired for, barrowing my friends shaman.  I don't trust my Truncheon of Doom to always perform (on top of the mob regenning HPs while I'm doing absolutely no damage trying to reslow).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Took maybe 20 minutes or so, lots of hps.  Hits like a gimp (at least with LR2 and slowed).  With ferocity I think I only took 2 or 3 lifetaps the entire time with 200ish MR.  My BL does have maxed regen (+35 from gear) so didn't have to heal all that much.  Max hit was maybe 350ish.<br />
<br />
Easy duo mob.  With a warrior tanking it would have been a true joke.   Just remember your stakes and bring at least one decent dps class to make it less of a yawner.<br />

KILLING the guy seems to be the easiest part. Being there when Heratius spawns is the part that is turning me into a gibbering idiot.<br />
<br />
I've spent over 12 hours in that castle following various strategies. Those include killing everything, killing only the 3rd floor, killing only the 2nd and 3rd floor, killing passersby who ask for camp checks, killing nothing and just waiting around, etc.). <br />
<br />
The only time I've seen Valdanov was when somebody sent me a tell saying that he had just killed Heratius and now there was this uber vampire kicking his ass and wasn't I looking the guy who had been looking for some nasty named in Tenebrous..? <br />

My wife and I got there as fast as we could to engage him, hoping to keep him in play while the rest of our group got there. He killed me because the adds kept interrupting my wife while she tried to heal, and by the time we got back to the zone with 2 more people, Valdanov had de-spawned. Whee!<br />

HOW TO TELL THE CORRECT ASHES BEFORE YOU BUY THE WRONG ONES<br />
<br />
Type &quot;;&quot;&lt;insert item link&gt; press enter to send the message<br />
<br />
It will return an error saying it couldn't find &lt;item tag parse to full text&gt;<br />
<br />
Look at the first few numbers on the giberish that the command returns...<br />
<br />
if it says &quot;0031751&quot;, those are the fake ashes, they are useless.<br />
<br />
if it says &quot;0007397&quot;, those are the correct ones.<br />
<br />
What you are seeing is an error returned by the /tell shortcut &quot;;&quot; because it couldn't find a player by that name. That's because you specified an item link not a player name. The error returns the internal item link code. (Which actually is the reason you can make fake link socials, see  The Sekrits: Revealed! (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5430) thread for more info. Anyway, each item has a unique code, the first number in the item link code is that unique code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
simple way to do it, make a toon and level it up to where it can cast see invis on itself, park it on the hill behind the balcony.... he will spawn and fly around the balcony in a small pathing loop, basically paseing around.<br />
<br />
If another named vamp pops there, call in your friends, one of which with lev, and head over off the top of the hill while looking up, keep killing gimps till ya pop the pimps :D<br />
<br />
Once him or his PH pop, pull him over the balcony and kite behind the castle, have someone that can stun watch out for his gate.<br />
<br />
Big part of this is his place holder is invis, and does not show up on track without see invis in effect, and he himself spawns on the balcony when the PH dies 50% of the time but he has invis up to start with, so dont go poking around alone and get jumped :D</div></div><hr />

I've had a ranger camped there for checking every now and then. I need to get him see invis somehow.</div></div><hr />

After killing the named and trash (or just sitting afk if I got bored) for 11 hours Heratius (sp) spawned. He does not seem linked to any other spawn, he is on his own timer. When he pops he does NOT move, he is a static spawn like Zeefer. The only thing that moves is the lvl 50 1 hour named on the top floor. Heratius is level 58 and absolutely easy to solo kill by most lvl 60+ classes. My 65 shaman kept agro on him for 2 hours while I waited for backup to arrive for Zeefer, all this time I was killing other trash and named while Heratius poked away at me. The only danger with Heratius is his invoke fear may stick and throw you through the wall downstairs for multiple agro, even that was trivial when it happened.<br />
<br />
Zeefer is tough, no doubts, I could not do it with my 65 war (25AA) and my 65 shm (160AA), his 1000 tap and dps take a lot of mana to heal. He finally died when a 65 druid, 65 SK and 63 shaman turned up to help. He can probably be duoed with a war and cleric/shm if the war had 250+MR to part resist the 1000 tap.<br />

other notes:<br />
<br />
As an agnostic ogre I was dubious and couldn't start the quest, illusion human potions fixed that and I got my shield.<br />
<br />
Kerzar is bugged he doesn't spawn everytime, I was on his spawn point and got him second time round or maybe he has more than one spawn point.<br />
<br />
I got the shield with pottery skill at 0, it is at 2 now after the quest, you do not lose the quest items ever.<br />
<br />
Other than Heratius / Zeefer the whole quest can be soloed by almost anyone, heck even a warrior with regen could probably do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Klopo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Does heratius despawn after he spawns, or does he stay up until he is killed?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Ummm sure cast, i just did the damn quest so trust me, he does pace around in a small loop. (not to mention I've helped others do it recently and plan to do it again for my brother)<br />

The fake vampire with the bad ashs does have a chance to spawn the real vamp on death, I know this from first hand, it is not linked to mass killing eather as I only spent 3 and a half hours waiting on his PH, and on death it spawned him.<br />
<br />
The correct vampire can pop on his own as well, both he and heratius despawn if it kills everything it has aggro on (meaning it has to be aggro'd in the first place and you all have to die/gate/evac for him to depop)<br />
<br />
they both stay up for 4 hours if left alone I think, never took me that long to get a group in.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Kerzar is bugged he doesn't spawn everytime, I was on his spawn point and got him second time round or maybe he has more than one spawn point.&quot;<br />
<br />
He spawns at the GF zoneline and runs north to the castle, out of the 3 times I have helped with this quest and the 1 for myself, it seems the guard you hand the item in to has to despawn before kerzar will spawn(that has taken up to 2 hours for me before)<br />
<br />
I have also noticed the grimmling runner seems to spawn right before or right after, as just about each time i have done this i have seen his runty ass running away... may be a link to them so try killing the runner if you have a bad run of luck.</div></div><hr />

I did the Part with Kerzar twice. First time i got him at GF Zoneline 30 min. after handin. 2nd Time i didnt see him at GF zoneline. After 35 min. i OOCed in zone and he had been seen near the castle. When i got there he was just standing there, in North-East Corner of the zone. Maybe i missed him at his spawn and he walked there or he has a 2nd Spawn point. In every case have a look at the north-east Corner of the zone (somewhat north of castle)  if he doesnt show up at GF zoneline.<br />
Got my Shield some days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Kerzar always spawned exactly outside the GF tunnel a few feet to the right if you are looking out of the tunnel, at the very botton of the hill that the tunnel digs into. He will spawn after guard you turned the note into despawns and the guards repop. They change guards once a game day. Kerzar will walk very slowly to the vamp castle and stand around there for a while.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the quest will get bugged and multiple Kerzars will spawn if several people have turned in the note to the guard. If 4 people turn in the note to the guard, the next gaurd change 4 Kerzars will spawn. I saw this a few times on my many attempts as usually there were others there waiting for to do Kerzar. Usually running around all over the zone, /oocing looking for Kerzar, despite you atempts to tell them otherwise.<br />
<br />
Have a button up to to say the final quest trigger as soon as you kill him, he always despawned too fast for me to type it, and I'm a fast typer, he only ever stayed there for maybe 2 seconds after you kill him. Don't worry about trying to stop attacking when he gets low health, beat him dead and a new versio you can talk to will spawn at full health, he won't let you talked to him until after you've killed him and he respawns with the &quot;yield&quot; text. He respawns untargeted, do worry.<br />

I do have a question about Zeefer, what is his &quot;invis&quot; PH, what name, my druid, with see invis soe, never see's any mobs standing in the center on the balcony, just the 2 by each doorway and &quot;trix-a-whateverhisnameis&quot; flying around from time to time. NO mobs standing in the center, ever. Is the PH supposed to be standing there?<br />
<br />
I haven't even seen Heretus up, whats his PH? i assume his stands there in the same position, in the center of the balcony. I've sat my druid there for hours and nothing ever pops there, just centi's by the doorways and the named flyer making rounds.<br />
<br />
I assume when you mean on the balcony that that is the one on the back side, where you climb up at the zone wall on the hill and can see onto, and the mobs are supposed to spawn on the outside of the castle...<br />
<br />
Really getting frustrated with the mob...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">So, noone knows the PH for heratus or zeefer?<br />
<br />
Been camping for weeks, I still haven't seem him up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">So, noone knows the PH for heratus or zeefer?<br />
<br />
Heratus is the PH for Zevfeer, and Heratus does not have a PH.  He is just a rare spawn (days) out on the back balcony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">The method above for determining the correct ashes didn't work for me so I did some poking on Alla's and found this:<br />
<br />
<br />
OK here is how to tell them apart.  All of the credit for figuring this out goes to the Paladins of Norrath Message board.<br />
<br />
When checking to see if they are the correct ones do a ;t and then past the link of the ashes with no spaces between the t and the link. The HEX code will appear for the item you linked.<br />
<br />
Here are the HEX codes for the ashes both bad and good:<br />
<br />
t0007397-00001-00001-00001-00001-0000128E219BAVampyre (Good)<br />
<br />
t0031751-00001-00001-00001-00001-0001B04FC7F5Vampyre (Bad)<br />
<br />
If the HEX code does not match the good one listed above then they are the fake ones. This method has been proven and tested.<br />
