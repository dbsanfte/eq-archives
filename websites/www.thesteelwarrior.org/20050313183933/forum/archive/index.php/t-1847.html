<br />
<br />
dunno quite what to think...<br />
<br />
i would have liked to see a bit more AC/HP on it... but it is pretty in balance with how raex was vs. other ele plate armor.. will be interesting to see how much that effect helps with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now this item excites me.<br />
<br />
Waaaaaaay more than the rz 1hs.<br />
<br />
The shielding seems low but the effect is pure own.<br />
<br />
The HP is nice, but it's tainted by the fact that can now be 50 worn HP over a paladin.  GG!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorokFV</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, after lookin it over a bit i'm pretty impressed. the effect is 3% more than voice of thule, plus its permanent. i do think it needs more shielding as i think i've seen a couple other Time items with a bit more shielding than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that this Breastplate needs more shielding. Other than that, it's 'fine.' I'd have rather seen 300 hps and 150 ac on it considering how much we've given away to hybrids in every other goddamn slot, but what can you do - monkeys run this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the Breastplate, agree that it needs more shielding. Only thing that I think might present a problem, once a guild has two or more of these on warriors is the 15% agro modifer, a warrior that isnt careful, could find themselves getting agro at the wrong time, taking the mob off the MT, would have prefered a right click, than a worn effect, but overall pretty satisfied with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, a war thats not tanking is probably either going to wear something low agro, or swap out a vindi bp or something when they're not up to bat. Not that big an issue I'd say. And most likely the guy with Raex bp would be the one tanking, anyway, just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your not tanking, get out that  Fire 2HS , or Emp 2HS<br />
<br />
As for the BP, good ownage (well i'd like more hp/ac &amp; shield)<br />
But if u compare to Wizcrap, i can say its really nice.<br />
<br />
Small question : Whats the actual effect of shield ?<br />
Max hit reduction ?<br />
Min hit reduction ?<br />
Min/Max hit reduction ?<br />
Actual hit reduction ?<br />
<br />
I know its insanely rare &amp; hard to parse, but it would be overly<br />
stupid for me on the long run to bag Raex greaves for CT ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure its min hit reduction only atm. Meaning it'll cut 2% off the min hit of a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to wait and see what the Knight BP is like before commenting.   If it is like I expect it, and is like 20-30hp difference, then it's, like all other warrior gear...<br />
<br />
Good only in a vaccuum, but crap as usual in terms of making a warrior meaningfully different from a Knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pino</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">knight BP is 87ac 210hp 175mana like bard one and effect will probably sucks.<br />
<br />
for once i am happy with war bp, everything is perfect imho except for shielding . 2 % is a bit low, maybe 5 % would be perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parv</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Effect is good, more shielding would be nice, hp and ac is weak shit.</div></div><hr />

Will the worn effect stack with spell effect just like other buf , that is DS, reg , haste , atk ?<br />
If it does, it's really a super taunt-effect item.<br />
And it can simply avoid that two warriors own the BP get aggro chasing because the MT will have the SK buf permantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since it is a worn effect, it does stack with SK's voice, which would net a +27% agro modifer, which is very nice. I, personally, would prefer the effect as a click, because during a raid, I wouldnt want to be wearing a perament 15% increase in agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does shielding work?<br />
<br />
Does it reduce the min hit of a mob?  Does it do this on every swing or is their a roll for success on shielding?  Is it a percentage reduction?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If items are all itemized like Raex, the gap would've been fine.  All we really need is 10% more HP and 10% more AC than our Hybrid counterparts, since to a rough approximation that's like being able to tank 20% better even before discs, which is certainly meaningful.  Actually, seeing Raex items clearly are designed to have ~10% more HP and AC than Knight counterpart, this leads me to believe even the designers agree we should at least have 10% more AC &amp; HPs.  So why not make warriors innately get 10% more HP/AC on all plate or warrior + Knight items?  It's a cheap way to fix things but it'd put that ~20% difference in tanking back.  You obviously can't have warrior only loot for every slot (too much stuff will rot) but is it too much to ask that we maintain the same edge out of the all plate items than the Knights like we should?</div></div><hr />

Peramently 15% aggro modifer shouldn't be a trouble for any one. For clear way , war meets a lot of situations that needs to TM , that need good aggro. For big mob, you can simply switch out your taunt weapon or normally stop attack a while. Aggro control to 2nd MT or other MT is a topic to learn too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kildace</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's a very good BP myself. Shielding should be 5 or 10 obviously, but the rest is pretty great and it's the first worn effect that i see on an item that strikes me as inventive.<br />
Thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that kind of effect should be on all warrior quest breastplates, with increasing strenght the harder it is to obtain of course.</div></div><hr />

Min hit reduction ?<br />
Min/Max hit reduction ?<br />
Actual hit reduction ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Shielding is a straight % decrease in damage bonus of a mob.<br />
<br />
For instance, Fennin Ro's Damage bonus is 1000.<br />
<br />
With Shielding 2, then 2% of 1000 or 20 would be taken off every hit.  So every hit by Fennin would be 20 less than it normally would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That effect is pure own.  Stack Voice of Thule on top of that and nobody's gonna get aggro off of you unless they're really trying to.  <br />
<br />
As far as the AC/hp goes, well it's in line with the rest of the Raex's gear.  Expect the Knights to get at least 220 hitpoints and 85-90 AC.  The ac/hp gap between knights and warriors is history.  The 20 more hitpoints warriors get on this breastplate will be the only slot where warriors will have *any* advantage over knights.  In every other slot the highest ac/hp items can be worn by paladins and shadowknights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthious</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lucy shows Roamars Robe was changed, lets hope Raex was as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 10% HP and AC advantage Raex has over Knight elemental is more than enough to establish warrior's edge in tanking.  The problem is that the all plate items are the best for all plate classes so we lose that 10% advantage.  Having 10% HP and 10% more AC is quite a significant advantage, even before discs.  If you estimate each displayed AC is ~5 HP, and say a top of the line Knight has 10K HP and 2K AC, then if warrior has 10% HP/AC advantage he'd have 11K HP and 2200 AC which, normalizing AC to HP, means it's like having 12K HP and 2000 AC, which is more than enough.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately itemizing doesn't quite work like it's supposed to.  Besides the all plate items in Time, they apparently decided that to compensate for this 10% AC gap Knights no longer face, Knights should be able to use a shield and maintain roughly the same DPS, and of course they certainly don't have any aggro problems while using a shield.  I wouldn't be surprised if Knight AC is actually higher than Warrior AC because they can use a shield without any penalty to aggro or DPS (well, some, but minimal).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksar_Overlord</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors do get more hit points / stamina point than Knights do.. but it's not really enough. I'm guessing VI thinks 10% is fine and that Defensive should be enough to keep a Warrior ahead of the game. But i would rather not always have to bring up the point that i have a better disc so i'm a better tank when people start mouthing off. I would prefer i have 2000 more hit points and 200 more ac than you, so im a better tank. But this just isn't so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Small question : Anyone remembers insane Min/Max or ATK Mobs ?<br />
Exept RZTW / FRO i dont remember any, i know they arent<br />
in time but i'm willing to bet there are a lot more 600-3000<br />
than 1500-2000 in time. (I'm not in time yet)<br />
<br />
This actually drastically recudes the worth of the &quot;shield&quot; focus.<br />
<br />
It is indeed great, but due to way PoP mobs are the effect isnt that groovy.<br />
Its a lovely complement to defensive however because it mitigates<br />
the part defensive does not alter.<br />
<br />
Shield 4 should give on average 20-40 hp reduction per hit.<br />
Considering we get 1-3 hits per second on most bosses that<br />
20-120 DPS reduction on 1 item, which is absolutely amazing.<br />
(I know BP aint 4, talking about the legs atm).<br />
<br />
Now if they stack like Furor says, and it is possible to reach<br />
20-25 shield, it will become THE mod to go after because <br />
i can surely forsee 3000-5000 hitters in the next expansion<br />
that will probably require a max shield warrior to tank.</div></div><hr />

Shielding from 2% to 3%<br />
HP from 240 to 250.<br />

<br />
Are hits across the board are reduced by the mod? Thats what im gathering from recent posts but i havent seen anyone that actually has a shielding item come out and confirm it...<br />
<br />
easy way to test it would just be to sit and get hit by a mob w and with out the mod and see if the max hits are different...<br />

Thoeretical results tally with parsed evidence.<br />

2% shielding = Quarm hitting for half a percent less per swing.<br />
