I know I may seem like I am trying to cause some hate, but I know this parse is not fair, doesnt even post a file to back it up.<br />
<br />
I would like you to go thru that thread, and if it isnt valid, rip it apart, I'd hate for the dev team to look at this and take it as true if it isnt.<br />
<br />
I just find it funny, they want spells, they want damage, they want discipline tanking, they want more raid targets they can do, its just like a knight to want to do too many things at once /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Defensive warriors take less damage than paladins?  Is this news?  <br />

<br />
It reminds me of smegaul grabbing for his ring, they start by complaining we do more dps, but dont provide a log, then about stunnable(we cant stun em with kick or weapons guys, the gaters piss me off just as much) then about disciplines, then say we want to be just as good in single group content(they are just as good, they just are imply its not so they dont close off any handouts) be the raid tank on undead(which is fine with me, you can have that undead zombie vomit on you) etc. etc.<br />
<br />
It just seems each thread i read to try and figure out what they truely want and need becomes a roundabout where it become all inclusive to all areas of tanking.<br />
<br />
Knights, listen to me.<br />
<br />
Pick out your worst problem and stick with it, if you ask for alot of changes at once you will never get them, if you focus your data, your thoughts and your logic on your biggest offender, you will see it change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What, you think Dagny is making up the numbers? The parses are short, but it is doubtful that a longer one would change the results. The amount of DPS reduction that the warrior got from defensive looks right. What is it that you think that should be disputed. You can argue that what Dagny is asking for isn't appropriate, but the data doesn't look out of whack at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok got it now<br />

look at the min hit 94, and 95<br />

unless the di is 1 it shouldn't vary unless the war had 1% shielding possible in a aug.<br />
<br />
so were seeing made up numbers. or guard proc, or shielding or not the same mob.<br />

also the difference between 135 dps and 141 dps is small the other stuff is fluff used to make the numbers look skrewy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kind of doubt developers would do anything based solely a player parse anyway.  There are too many unknowns in player parses and the developers have access to the actual internal formulas.  The worst that could happen is the parse would make them curious enough to do their own test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Doesn't matter. Parse for &lt; 10 minutes in EQ and you can show exactly nothing. The random number generator is really that bad. Within that time, DPS can vary by almost double. We could have seen the knights DPS taken be double that of the crap warriors, or halved, or who knows. Regardless of how reasonable the numbers seem, they simply aren't accurate and reproducable enough to be relied upon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Dps seems off, another part of what they are saying in that thread is that the warrior is doing quite a bit more dps then the paladin, i know there was a gap between our damage, but i dont think it is that large.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oooooh ok, now it makes a bit more sense.<br />
<br />
warriors take less damage? no shit :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To me all that thread really shows is that even with a lot of good gear, you still don't mitigate a great deal of the mob's damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conclusion: This clearly shows that a warrior with 1193AC, which is well BELOW bazaar gear level at this stage of the game, takes 17% less damage than an Elemental/Time geared paladin with 2042 AC when using defensive on Elemental level trash mobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
While that may be true, if you go back and compare the crap-gear setup to the normal warrior gear setup, you get pretty much the same results (crap war defensive tanks about 14% better than normal war without disc), and I don't think you get many warriors complaining about how lower level/crappily geared warriors can tank just as good as they can.  <br />
<br />
It's not really a suprise that the damage defensive mitigates is in the same ballpark as the amout your gear does, if you've ever hit defensive you shouldn't need any parsing to realize that.  And like others have mentioned, just looking at the DPS done alone on one mob doesn't take into factor, well, pretty much everything that isn't exclusive to that one mob (and then some, the parse ignores that the crap war has a lot less hp, is still a lot more likely to die, and that even with that crap gear the warrior still has all the same mitigation AAs he has when he wears his normal gear.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would have assumed this is the case anyway. If a warrior is there, and defensive is up, they tank the 'named' (well unless they are wearing bronze).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I chose not to have a spellbook and abandoned a lvl 50 Paladin in favor of a level 46 Warrior when Defensive was introduced. I chose to be a class focused on MTing, played that class for 4 fugn years without self-buffs, heals, self-res, RC, stuns, root, pacify, DA, LoH, exploiting a resisted or mob immune level 9 spell to get aggro lock, all based on the fact Warriors have Defensive/Knights don't and a simple crystal clear promise:<br />
warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles<br />
and to be<br />
taking the point in battles<br />
I was well aware that<br />
Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play.<br />
When Knights become a viable replacement for Warriors in a raid MT/red mob offtank role in cutting edge content, substantially matching the Warrior's unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles, and have powerful spellbooks then I will no longer be playing or paying.<br />
<br />
Being able to MT PoTime after getting PoP end expansion gear isn't enough for Dagny - he wants to do it now.<br />

<br />
Yea I think he had the warrior using the BoW the whole duration, becuase if you look at the max hit on all the parses they are the same. Timeless Coral Greatsword isn't going to produce the same max hit as a Blad of War obviously. <br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: The DPS in that post is not the DPS that the tank is putting out, it is the DPS that the tank is being hit for.<br />
<br />
guess I'm wrong :)<br />

Also the pally doesn't have DR, where the warrior has DR(maxed) and FoS(1). I hope these parses where done ducking or with thier backs to the mobs...</div></div><hr />

Its a little upsetting how often both sides play the extremist cards.:p  Its not like you guys are any better when it comes to asking for unrealistic things.  And we are just as guilty of it.  But don't pretend your record is clean.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Quote from the thread:<br />
That's the DPS of the mob. As a matter of fact, we both tanked this mob without turning attack on. First off, I didn't want ripostes to cloud the results and I also didn't want the mob to die because I wanted to use the exact same mob throughout all 5 tests.<br />
Keep reaching....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Trilith,<br />
<br />
The answer to your question is actually simple to understand. No tank has a game-given right to MT anything. Who gets to MT has always been based on who will best survive and who is available.<br />
<br />
Who will best survive is based on base stats, equipment, and abilities. Knights want to change their abilities. The reason is so that they can MT more mobs that would otherwise be tanked by Warriors.<br />
<br />
They started by stating they couldn't tank in normal experiance groups nor get mandatory individual flags - thus they claimed they needed Defensive. SoE addressed this by tuning content and no longer requiring everyone to complete the Ikkinz trials.<br />
<br />
Knights then changed the arguement. They stated they didn't have a raid role. Some warriors replied they tanked adds just fine.<br />
<br />
Knights then claimed they customarily off-tanked. Nod, yes I supose in some cases they did. BUT, it was mobs they could handle given their base stats, equipment, and abilities. Yes, came the reply - Knights need Defensive.<br />
<br />
I frankly do not remember any Knight anytime offtanking any red mob in a raid if a Warrior was available. And certainly not a red mob that the class had domonstrated that they couldn't handle.<br />
<br />
And we've evolved to an argument by Dagny and some others that Knights should be perfectly viable raid boss mob MTs. Some Warriors might have a prefernce, but a Knight could do just fine.<br />
<br />
The Warrior class description states unmatched survivability in the most brutal battles - not vs. raid boss mobs only. Guild Warrior #3, 4, 5, .... have a perfect right to expect to MT mobs based on base stats, equipment, abilities, and availability. Not to see their raid role eroded by Knights eager for an ability upgrade that allows them to expand their roles in raids bt victimizing Warriors.<br />
<br />
And that's exactly what is being asked for, an expanded role.<br />
<br />
So yes, Warriors MT red splits. Ya don't think so? Then you MT one. If ya can't then we have the answer. The fight was brutal enough that you, a level 65 tank died. A fight is brutal if it takes a Warrior using Defensive to tank it OR the mob is not correctly tuned.<br />

<br />
 At any rate, no, I don't think /defensive is needed for Knights, although I personally think more mobs should be tuned for Knights to tank, ala Cazic. There's no harm and great benefit to giving all three time in the spotlight.</div></div><hr />

We all know Defensive is a big three minute advantage compared to a Paladin stunning mob after mob, Procing Hopebringer, casting heals, etc.<br />

What I didn't know was that there were guilds where Paladins were equipped so well and in contrast Warriors so poorly. Hopefully they'll stall long enough for that unfortuante Warrior to become equipped where he should be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sounds to me like the point of the thread is that Defensive gives warriors an unfair advantage over knights in the tanking department.

That could be me reading that into it based on my past experience with such threads, but then again Hitler could have been a compassionate humanitarian that was just misunderstood by the world too.  Typically I'd say that if someone posts a well  known fact like that as if it's news to anyone then they have some sort of agenda in mind or they wouldn't bother.</div></div><hr />

/boggle. It's apparent that you didn't actually even read the thread. That or you are uncommonly dense. Please do tell how the tank performing &quot;a few riposte higher then normal&quot; would skew the DPS TAKEN? Or are you referring to the combined dodge/parry/riposte rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Personally, I think the parse is pretty close to reality, and it's silly to argue it. On average, defensive is going to cut out about 1/3 of regular morb damage (just ballparking it, I know it varies), and not only that, but it is actually more effective at lower AC levels, since the DI makes up a larger percentage of the damage. Going up 1k in AC isn't enough to cut the DI damage by 45%. Duh, I mean, is this really news? Comparing a disced warrior to an undisced knight is unfair and pointless. Why not compare a knight to a naked ranger using weaponshield? They take infintitely less damage.<br />
<br />
You can disagree with the point being made (I do), but I see no reason to think the figures aren't on the up and up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yep, I agree Gimmel.<br />
<br />
It makes as much sense as comparing the Defensive Wariror to a Paladin under DA, or having Blinded the mob, or Rooted it. The point is that it's possible for both classes to avoid damage, but in the case of the Wariror it is with a class defining ability that will not be shared, Defensive, that provides the &quot;unmatched&quot; suvivability while MTing that is central to the class.<br />
<br />
Some Paladins are wannabe MT's. They never rolled a Warrior because they wannabe MT's that can cast 5000HP heals in 0 seconds while meleeing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">If we are testing how much damage is taken and then compairing the two, then one having more reposites would make one of them look like they take more damage(i am talking about mob reposites) and if the warrior or paladin reposite a hit, it makes them look like they taken less damage, it is very important to control the 2 veriables here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Especially on such a short parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">those numbers do seem right, if you apply defensive to IgneousKB parses you obtain :<br />
dps on paladin : 241<br />
dps on war : 229<br />
dps on war with def : 169 (assuming warrior has defensive up all the time)<br />
<br />
If you check the damage distribution, graph1 you notice that it's pretty much flat after 1, going from 70 hits 2 to 40 hits 20, in the end dmg 10-20 account for A LOT of damage, which should not happen with such an high AC, this end up with DI 10-20 representing 50% of the damage (graph 2, cumulative dmg)<br />
<br />
This is a problem for both war &amp; paladin, ie, a warrior with far lesser gear &amp; defensive will tank better than a warrior with much higher AC, because no matter the AC, you'll get hit quite a lot for high DI. (Valorian guard are shitty mob, not supposed to be tanked by 2k3 AC people)<br />
<br />
A possible solution would be to change the distribution of the hits, to something continuous, like an exponential decreasing, this would lead to defensive being only 'overpowered' when the warrior is really 'underpowered' ie tanking with very low AC for the encounter, in this case the warrior would still get 50% extra mitigation under defensive, read : defensive would still be about as usefull against raid boss mob, but would be far less usefull against lesser stuff, ie offtanking, xp group mobs, you can check effect of this on graph 3 - 4, the defensive 'bonus' vs trash mob is only 25% now, vs 50% before.<br />
<br />
Basicaly the distribution would be something  like p(DI=x) = k*exp(-ax), AC vs atk affecting a (and therefor k, to be a  probability), if your  AC &lt;&lt; mob ATK then a would be 0 that'd flat distribution, if you AC &gt;&gt; mob atk, then a would be big, and you'd only be hit for min hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">There's really no point in arguing with a Dagny, Gilfalas, etc.<br />
<br />
From as far back as I remember in class balance discussions their attitude has not been that Paladins should be acceptable as experiance group MT's and have a raid role.<br />
<br />
It's been that there should not be a single one groupable  mob in the game that a Warrior can kill that a 7500HP unbuffed Paladin like them can't. Let's pretend that Warriors haven't had a exceptionally hard hitting one groupable mob advantage in every expansion until Knights &quot;gear up&quot; in it. In others words the Warrior tanking advantage is to be entirely confined to raids while Paladin advantages should not.<br />
<br />
Having eliminated any reason to prefer a Warrior in any group vs. any mob while preserving their prefernces, they mount an assault on the Warrior raid role.<br />
<br />
In their view, either Defensive must be removed, nerfed, or shared with Knights. Please note they don't say that they want SoE to adjust adds and mobs Knights are intended to offtank to put them in line with the capability of Knights at the proper level of equipment progression. This is NOT about having a role. It is ENTIRELY focused on tanking like a Warrior. Each of them has at one time or another opined that Warriors should not be raid MT's - that task should be shared by the three tank classes (sorry Rangers, there's no room for you in PallyQuest) with Warriors enjoying a &quot;preference&quot;..<br />
<br />
With AO showing that well-equiped Knights can MT PoTime, it's pretty clear the raid MTing capability of Knights is not hugely out of whack.<br />
<br />
With Knights protesting that auto-selection of trial difficultly amounted to &quot;baby trials&quot; despite the fact that we now know much of this content was designed for level 70's AND<br />
<br />
changing their complaints from getting experiance groups, mandatory individual flags, and having a raid role in GoD raids to wanting to offtank red-splits (sorry raid Warrior #3, 4, 5, 6) and to be viable raid MT's (even if Warriors are slightly prefered) after SoE adjusted content to address their original complaints....<br />
<br />
they reveal their goal is not the staus quo pre-GoD. It is in fact as much as possible Tank Parity (and Spellbook Superiority).<br />
<br />
Lately they have been altering the stated purpose for the &quot;remedies&quot; they demand:<br />
<br />
We don't want Defensive, just a moderate duration mitigation ability. How about Weaponshield for 4 ticks? Should be perfect for a hybrid that doesn't want to take over the raid MT role. It will be overpowered when the new stuns become available next month, but overpowered hasn't bothered them for 3 years why should it bother them now?<br />
<br />
We don't want to replace Warriors as MT's. How generous!!! Concidering how little a Warrior uses Defensive while addtanking or in a normal experiance group I guess WS for 4 ticks would more than address your needs, even if stuns, roots, and 1500HP 1 second heals already make you superior to Warriors vs. virtually every blue mob in GoD.<br />
<br />
No Gimmel - there's no room for debate. Both of these Paladins are well respected in their online communities. They have their goal and virtually every sub-6500HP unbuffed can't MT a red raid brutal mob and never could Paladin is cheering them on.<br />

Oh, and don't think for a minute that I'm down on Paladins - I'm not. There are many Paladins I want to see reach Nomilus's level of achievement and EARN the ability to outtank me in almost every facet of the game - except - I do want to be in the MT order when we get to that new raid boss mob and MT that red add when we finally beat Uqua. That's why I rolled a Warrior.<br />

<br />
  I'm a warrior. I believe some very serious tuning would be required afterward, including a permanent and significant mitigation bonus added to warriors. I frankly just think defensive is indeed too powerful and is, in and of itself, unbalancing. Just like CH has been for a very, very long time. There's an entire thread on this subject, however.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the parse is pretty close to reality, and it's silly to argue it. On average, defensive is going to cut out about 1/3 of regular morb damage (just ballparking it, I know it varies), and not only that, but it is actually more effective at lower AC levels, since the DI makes up a larger percentage of the damage. <br />
<br />
  It doesn't matter what you think. YOU CANNOT GATHER STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OFF OF THIS PARSE. A 6 minute parse, in EQ, is basically worthless. It can feel right to you, it can seem ok, and you can pretend it's accurate. I'm not trying to say that the data is really far off, what I'm saying is that we just don't know. The knight could have taken a bad round. The crap warrior could have gotten lucky. Who knows? Not us, there's not enough data to draw a statistically significant conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion he is reaching off the data is unsupported by the data. It doesn't matter if his conclusion is wrong or if it's right. He is basing it off of numbers that are very likely wrong.</div></div><hr />

I understand that completely, however, I think you know that whatever tuning took place afterwards would not be sufficient for losing it.

I'd also be down right pissed off if knights got defensive. Whoring out unique, if broken, abilities is a stupid, stupid idea. I would be ok with them getting an innate DI modifier or something, but only if we got boosted by the same amount as well. I'd personally prefer that all non-tanks got bumped up to DI+1, knights stayed even, warriors stayed at DI-1. But that's not what knights are whining about, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

I almost agree, except that in every expansion there have been rare one group mobs that did hit exceptionally hard. There are mobs that move from raid status to one-group status if a Warrior MT's them. Warriors have enjoyed a preference when hunting such mobs for a very long time. It should continue.<br />
Warriors having a complete monopoly due to an unbalanced discipline while knights are no more than a grease stain is not balance, it's broken.<br />
I disagree wholeheartedly. Until we face a hard hitting raid mob, we are relatively equal - Warriors are Knights without spellbooks. BUT when a Warrior faces a brutal mob that has no special tricks, that's when his defining class ability and the entire reason for him to be without a spellbook comes into play. Warriors are unmatched. Unmatched sir. Taking the point when facing a brutal mob and using our unmatched ability to survive is what Warriors have that Knights do not.<br />
<br />
Complete monopoly? SoE can have a boss mob fear anytime it wants to - automatic Warrior not prefered. It can put a huge unremovable damage shield on the mob, the mob can blur, charm the MT, etc., etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Complete monopoly? There are very likely 2 dozen mobs in the entire game that Knights can't (for the moment) MT.<br />
<br />
The broken discipline phrase is just a dishonest way of saying many Knights don't want the central defining Warrior ability to amount to a hill of beans. When you are a grease stain on the floor sir, it's because you are exceeding your equipment level and/or role (or SoE has improperly tuned the mob).<br />
<br />
You can't MT like me and I can't heal like you. Want to MT like me? Petition SoE for a class change or re-roll.<br />

While Warriors are gear dependent. they are somewhat innoculated against the need to have the very best equipment in order to tank. Defensive gets us past newly encountered guild progression mobs earlier than otherwise possible.<br />
<br />
Knights are also quite gear dependent and lack a major way of trancending this except for their ability to still cast spells when underequipped.<br />

I don't think any Warrior begrudes Knights the tools they need to have a raid role.

What he is saying:<br />

1) It is assumed the Warrior/Paladin were looking at the mob.<br />
2) It was assumed the Warrior/Paladin were wearing the weapons in their profile.<br />

Unless you want to say #1 or #2 are false, you must conclude the PC may have some successes at dodge, parry, riposte.  If you assume they have successes, then the DPS of the mob on the PC will be lowered.<br />

On a six minute parse, this could double the dps taken if you are unlucky on your (the PC) riposte, dodge, parry rates.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">In terms of parse duration, it's easy to get an accurate, long duration parse without having to worry about defensive. Turning on /disc defensive does a very specific, quantifiable thing. We can use our knowledge of what defensive does to figure out the difference between ANY warrior using defensive and not using defensive. The only point to parsing is to find 2 things: 1) average hit in terms of DI, and 2) the percentage of attacks that end up hitting the tank. Once you have those 2 pieces of information, you can figure out what the damage taken would be under defensive by simply modifying DI the exact same way defensive does.<br />
<br />
Test Warrior - Crap gear - 1193 AC - No disc<br />
Test Duration: 7:40<br />
Total Damage: 78,561<br />
DPS: 170.78<br />
Hits: 307<br />
Miss: 216<br />
Hit%: 58.7<br />
Max Hit: 496<br />
Min Hit: 95<br />
Avg Hit: 256<br />
<br />
All you have to do is figure out the average hit in terms of DI and you can find out how much damage this tank would have taken under defensive. <br />
<br />
<br />
DI=21.1<br />
DB 74<br />
Abg Hit: 256 (8.6*DI)<br />
<br />
Under defensive that means his average hit would be <br />
<br />
raw DI is 22.2<br />
DI under def is 11.1<br />
(11.1*8.6)+74=169<br />
<br />
169/256=0.66<br />
<br />
170.78*0.66=112 DPS under discipline *in that exact same situation* That is the difference that *would* have been manifested if he had hit defensive then.<br />
<br />
EDIT: that 112 DPS number just happens to (coincidentally!) be very close to the reported DPS for when he actually did use defensive. You can basically take the modifed parse and average it with the actual defensive parse for an average of 114.66 DPS from a 13 minute, 48 second parse.<br />

In your opinion. It [ed. 70% of the Warrior's Defensive ability] is completely unreasonable...in your opinion.<br />
 <br />
What I consider to be completely unreasonable is that only 1 class has anything approaching a reasonable chance to tank many, many encounters in game.<br />

<br />
McBash, who was a vociferous supporter of Knight Defensive in the past, at least has the decency to observe elsewhere in the same forum that since SoE's GoD adjustments:<br />
Cant reliably tank boss in Tipt [? says he can below]. <br />
Can reliably tank name in vxed/tipt <br />
<br />
Can reliably tank named in KodTaz <br />
<br />
Cant touch named in ikkinz 6 man trails, [not a required flag]<br />
<br />
Can tank trash in ikkinz raids fine <br />
<br />
Cant tank splits from bosses on Ikkinz raids reliably <br />
<br />
Cant soak ramp reliably on bosses in ikkinz raids <br />
<br />
Can tank adds reliably in Uqua<br />
So, basically he can get experiance groups in GoD, all required individual flags, and has a viable raid role.<br />
<br />
Either the Graal's and Dagny's of this world are strangers to the truth, or they are the Little Tanks That Can't despite the fact everyone else that ought to be capable is succeeding.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I responded, pretty much showing the various flaws in the analysis of the data.<br />
<br />
It turns out that the Paladin was a better tank than the warrior in crap gear, even when the warrior was using defensive.   <br />
<br />
While a time ago, I was in support of a Knight burst mitigation disc, things have changed dramatically in the content, AND Ikkinz trial bosses are ALSO being changed to make defensive irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Offtanking isn't an issue any more.<br />
<br />
Routine tanking isn't an issue any more.<br />
<br />
There are 9 mobs that there's an issue with, and at least 8 of them are being adjusted.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, and the MOST important aspect is this:  <br />
<br />
OOW is coming out in a month and a half.   The level limit is being raised to 70, new spells are also being released, which will allow Paladins to stun up to level 70 mobs.   <br />
<br />
The power of stun mitigation is extreme.   You'll never see a parse from a Paladin which considers stuns because the results would destroy any complaint that they have.   The pont is, content fixes PLUS new stuns in 45 days PLUS a disc would be far far too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I have been xping quite a bit in Qvic recently and it just boggles the mind they'd even allow anyone to stun level 70 mobs on demand.  I remember when I was doing Ikkinz trials, part of our strategy was to use Time Rend to reduce the amount of damage we take, and that's a proc.<br />
<br />
Even at a low, low estimation of 500 DPS on 66-70 mobs, that puts a single stun worth 2000 HPs of damage mitigated, and it comes whenever you need it, too.  And for just 80 mana?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">With Paladins stunning and Monks stunning with their SoT's, Enchanters charming Pookas, and Rangers using WS on named if it came to that, trials as released were hard for Knights, but doable.<br />
<br />
But in responce to a campaign for Knight Defensive, SoE finally decided to adjust some mobs and in the process fessed up that GoD was designed for level 70's. Oh my goodness! You mean Knights weren't as successful as they should have been because the content needed to be adjusted??!!<br />
<br />
Two Cleric groups are now a thing of the past except in Ikkinz. Bards, Druids, and Shaman are all perfectly capable of being in these groups and utility is at least as important as a Warrior's ability to hit Defensive for three minutes out of every ~15. Everyone knows Kod'Taz exp groups are doable by all tanks.<br />
<br />
With the content adjusted, the case for Knight Defensive has evaporated. So the issue has been changed. In Graal's words it's now:<br />
What I consider to be completely unreasonable is that only 1 class has anything approaching a reasonable chance to tank many, many encounters in game.<br />
The many many encounters are cutting-edge raid boss mobs, exceptional and rare one group red named mobs that do not give flags required of individuals, and the ocassional brutal raid red split.<br />
<br />
What Graal, Dagny, Kether, et al find unreasonable is that because Warriors have Defensive and unmatched survivability vs. the most brutal mobs in the game they are prefered raid MT's for cutting-edge content.<br />
<br />
They'd like 75% of Defensive or 50% of Defensive plus 30% spell damage reduction AND as Frodlin has observed stuns effective to level 70 AND of course new heals like that 1500HP's in 1 second AND AND AND AND.<br />
<br />
Their problem is they have absolutely no case for getting these things except their ability and willingness to aggitate might make SoE see a need to feed their greed. That's what they are hoping will happen.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Even after all their misrepresentation intended to give them a &quot;share&quot; of MTing duties (I'd like a share of that flash heal, group heal, Res, and Root kplsthnx ^_^), I still support a WS ability for Knights. A 15 second auto-parry or auto-reposte discipline for those Rut Roh situations is not unreasonable - and neither are Warriors.<br />

The sad part is that the Paladin community has allowed Dagny, Gilfalas, Graal, Kether, et al to be their defacto spokesmen and provoke SoE into saying things like:<br />
Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that will not be shared.<br />
Like it or not, warriors are supposed to be and will always be better able to tank than Pallys and SKs.<br />
Their argument that GoD revealed a Paladin class problem was rejected when SoE adjusted the content and was debunked thoroughly when SoE revealed much of GoD was designed for level 70's.<br />
<br />
Very early on I (among others) suggested adjusting content, spellbook revision (including stuns, heals, and lifetaps), and after that was done, a modest WS-like ability for emergency &quot;burst mitigation&quot;. Give it another month or two and I suspect most Paladins will agree. The Tank Parity (and Spellbook Superiority) people don't have much of an argument. And the one argument they do have (which I once generously pointed out) they are too $#@^ to make.<br />

<br />
When /shield initially came out I was in favor of it being for all plate tanks.  But the reason it wasn't given to all plate tanks is that it was a &quot;gimmick&quot; given to Warriors at the beginning of PoP in an obvious attempt by SoE to get them to STFU about being systematically screwed in the area of enhanced abilities since Kunark.  They did it specifically in hopes of distracting us from the fact Warriors were grossly falling behind in their capability to perform against the newest content.  While the other plate tanks got upgraded spells, Warriors got /shield.   And it was the only bone Warriors got for nearly a year and a half after PoP.<br />
<br />
And Knights pointed to /shield all through the dark age of PoP as the Warrior fix for poor aggro control.  Oh, just use /shield they cried!  It's not that hard!  Dumbasses.  Shield can be useful, if the character getting beat on stands perfectly still and you are basically within melee range of them.  Otherwise, it's useless unless you spend a ton of AAs on it.  How many base abilities are there in the game that are almost, but not quite, useless unless you pour AAs on them?  Not many that I know of.<br />
