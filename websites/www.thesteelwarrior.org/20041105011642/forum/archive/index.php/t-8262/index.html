<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hatebrood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently aquired the Archaic Shield of Stone, and it has the effect Furious Bash 3. According to lucy it increases Spell/Bash Hate by 30 percent. Will this add hate if i use slam instead of bash? It sounds like a stupid question, but i would really like to know if anyone has the answer... thanks, Brethren Hatebrood of the Nameless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont know as i dont have slam ... but i know you wont bash for as much if you use slam vs bash.<br />
<br />
That said, the hate from any FB shield is pitiful at best.  Its only real use is the ac in a pinch after defensive falls or for increased mitigation after  you have secured aggro via procs solidly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorereaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well peronally I agree that the aggro from the bash is rather mediocre at best.. and the shield I use has FBII, but bash is very useful against casting mobs, and can seriously make all the difference in the world when dealing with them. The number of times you will interrupt offensive spells and heals and gating can be well worth the absence of aggro depending on the situation... If you don't believe me, make sure you have the skill up where you can connect fairly consistently, and go solo a caster that you can handle, but one that can still give you a decent fight... try one battle with and one without using bash, I can really notice a significant difference in the outcome of these battles when I do this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got a neat fb3 shield in a god sewer the other night.Weee I promptly equipped it and pulled out the a3bf.Sniff it was sooo sad.I was froggy illusioned and well I was a handsome type toad with the shield and BF.Unfortunately,I could feel my aggro drop huge...it sucked.I could tank with it ,but, not like with my BOW or BOC in offhand.The sewer was pretty easy so I gimped around with it a bit then pulled out the BOW so the chanter could have fun too.Frogs with BOWs look kewl too tho. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorereaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, well just out of curiosity... caster's realm says. (and yes I know they aren't always right)... but they say that kicking won't interrupt casting. It doesn't seem to for me right now anyway, if I'm interrupting at all without bash, it seems to be from stun procs. I'm going to look at this a bit closer, because I've heard there was a stun effect added to kick at level 55.... but I'll have to parse the log file and see how much difference there is between the two. I do know for a fact though that bash will without a doubt interrupt casting, I can see the message over and over in the battle spam when I use it.  That's cool though, will definitely take a look at it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kick has a chance to stun on a successful hit at level 55. It's not guaranteed, but it does work quite often,atleast up to 58 where I am. I'm nearly always successful in interupting a caster when they try to cast a cheal. Combined with stun procs, and the melee push, you can nearly always interupt a caster unless you have a bunch of pets making it difficult or idiotic groupmates that don't understand why you shouldn't push a caster against the wall when they are trying to cast. I only ever have a problem with interupting fast casting spells.</div></div><hr />

Thanks! I have a warrior, but i looted that shield on my monk when it was going to rot. I have often had to tank once the warrior dropped and in Illusion Ogre (which i actually cast on myself from potions quite often) i can slam, so the effect would actually work, I was hoping the hate on the shield would actually be enough with my fast primary just for a few rounds that i could keep a bit of aggro over the healer as the rest of the group is dying off ect... just something to play around with i guess... I appreciate the input from all, thanks again, Brethren Hatebrood of the Nameless.</div></div><hr />
