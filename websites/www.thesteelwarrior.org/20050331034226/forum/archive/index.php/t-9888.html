<br />
the low hp/ac on honed trinket of protection is easily replaced by a non-shielding earring with 30+ ac.  Earhoop of the Eighteen Eyes for example, would be a good replacement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you do MPG trials?  There are a couple of good ears you could pick up there also.<br />
<br />
Earring of Mental Incursion, Stud of Focused Aptitude, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
If those arent available i would shoot for the earhoop of eighteen eyes like Aonodorus said.  30 ac and 10 avoidance = the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I would upgrade to 18 eyes, but not so sure about something without any type of damage-lessening time-mod.<br />
<br />
18 eyes of course, for the 10 avoidance.  I'd only upgrade my 140hp shielding earring if every other item I had was 200+hp (and from my Magelo, you can see that I'm far from that).<br />
<br />
It's definately upgradeable, but other upgrades would surely take precedence over it.<br />
<br />
Unless you have an abundance of DKP you can spend without much worry, that is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd seriously consider buying a decent pair of legs before you even think about replacing a 140hp + shielding earing.<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic at your level of play is just plain silly!  :p<br />
<br />
You could probably pretty easily buy huge + to ac, hp, and shielding for a lesser cost.  Looking at the rest of your gear, i would place your earring as a &quot;should be replaced soon&quot;.  Even with shielding, it is somewhat beneath the calibur of the majority of your other gear.  From what i've seen browsing, shielding doesn't seem to be incredibly rare these days comparatively.</div></div><hr />

How does it compete with other Warriors' weaponsetups in your guild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naerron</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well bone in main hand is better agro, but i use epic in main when tanking high end mobs because of the high dly.  but as far as agro goes, i steel agro from DBotW/1.5. DBotW/EoE, basicly any darkblade combo.  we dont have any fleshbiters, not sure if we will do uqua much more or again, but i doubt we will see any.  bone-reddening is a great weapon</div></div><hr />
