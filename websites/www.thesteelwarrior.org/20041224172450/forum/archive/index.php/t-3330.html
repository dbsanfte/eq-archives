<br />
I have played a Paladin to 52 and a 62 SK. Either of them are capable of insuring the slower can do the job on incoming and not get himself killed. Either can get back a ping ponging mob (provided I ever let it get away in the first place) with no effort at all.<br />
<br />
The only thing that ever prevented a Knight from completely out MTing a Warrior is HP's and now they've got them. They're happy with the result and so is apparently SoE.<br />
<br />
And without competative aggro control we are consigned firmly to the dustbin of inferiority (except as Raid MT's) with SoE hoping over us to reassure Knights they won't be nerfed.<br />
<br />
Well I'm not in favor of a nerf, but I haven't seen anyone from SoE coming in here to reassure us about anything at all except -<br />
<br />
&quot;Classes are not that out of balance.&quot; - Absor<br />
<br />
I don't know that BS is any better than ranting.<br />
<br />
If people want to dismiss what's been said about this issue as ranting, then so be it. I believe the truth is that it wasn't a rant, most players know it wasn't a rant , and it's easier for some to call it a rant than deal with it.<br />
<br />
A Paladin posts that he heard they'll be nerfed - immediate SoE responce.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights winge about a nerf - immediate SoE responce.<br />
<br />
Nearly every class board on the internet agrees Warriors have an aggro problem and we get &quot;Don't ask about class balance.&quot; at FF and a dismissal of our concerns expressed here as rants.<br />
<br />
Pfffffft<br />
<br />

&quot;Don't start reading rants from players as facts from SOE.&quot; - Absor<br />

The ones I knew had no tanking ability, dps ability, or pulling ability.  I don't think they need to be nerfed in the slightest, though if I met more of them that were more competant players and had better gear, I might change my mind.  I really do appreciate the &quot;nightmare&quot; aggro spells and the group attack buffs.  I also have several friends/guild mates that are SK's, and they do fine, but I also rarely ever see them tank or pull, in fact, never really.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about SK's too much, they get their disposition from the necro side.  Instead, just think how fun it is to be on the bottom, with something to look forward too.  I thought everyone liked being on bottom anyways?  *grin*</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt want to get nerfed either, but aggro, itemization, Utility Roles, are so far out of whack they must be blind not to see it.</div></div><hr />

He made your standard Absor BS post, with no substance, no content and barely even an acknowledgement of what the thread was about.<br />

<br />
We gotta stop with the class-wide paint brush. It only makes us look bad.  From reading that thread I could see that several if not most of the SK's understood the problem and a few even had some pretty good ideas on fixing it.<br />
<br />
From the mouth of one SK:<br />
<br />
1) Put all discs on separate timers. This would give warriors something to do during battle and allow them to fully use some of the more fun abilities they already have. With this, a warrior could take different roles during battle depending on what type of disc they currently have up. <br />
<br />
2) Get rid of defensive and give warriors inherently better mitigation abilities. Wariors are the arms masters of EQ doing nothing all thier lives but focusing on thier ability with arms and armor. Why shouldn't they be noticeably better at it than anyone else? Asmuch as a 20% mitigation advantage over all other classes doesn't seems far out of line and would help minimize the retuning required after the loss of defensive. This would give warriors a strong advantage in tanking over a knight. This mitigation advantage could also be pared down depending on any snap taunt abilities given to a warrior. i.e. more aggro control = less inherent mitigation advantage and vice versa.<br />
<br />
3) Give warriors some fun discs that are valuable to a group all on seperate timers so warriors aren't stuck using one all the time. An abilitie like group shielding where a warrior gives his entire group enhanced mitigation abilities for a limited time would make a warrior very desired in LDoN runs where adds come fast and furious and would balance them with the group abilites of SK and paladins. Another ability that would work well is a gorup atk bonus simulating the tactician role of a warrior directing his group in thier attacks. There are obviouly a lot of idea that could fit here and would make a warrior valuable in any group even when they are not tanking.<br />
<br />
4) Make warrior abilties scale throughout thier lifespan. Right now, there are very large and obvious parts of a warriors's career where they gain nothing. Levels 40-50 are just chaff for a warrior since they only gain level inherent bonuses while other classes get new spells etc.. Levels 61-65 are the same way. Why not during these levels warriors gain some of the discipline abilities previously mentioned? This doesn't mean that a warrior would get a new abilities every few levels since some of the discs could be simple upgrades of a previous one. However, to make the class fun the more new and unique abilities added the better.<br />
<br />
5) Warriors need some utility and fun to do abilities just to make the class more useful when a group isn't immediately available and just plain more fun for the player. Just giving clickies does not cover this area since why should a warrior have to do a long boring camp or pay an exhorbitant amount for an item that any caster could buy at a vendor? How about enhancing warrior regen out of combat? Say if a warrior has not engaged in combat for a set period of time, say a minute, they begin to regen very fast. They could not use this ability if they have attacked or been attacked within the time mandated. With this, warriors could solo for experiance or gear with some effectiveness.<br />
<br />
6) Along this same line warriors could be given the ability to root or snare on a limited basis. Obviously these abilites could be overpowered in some ways in the end game if taken as they are now but the root and snare warriors get could be modified just for them. These abilities could be discs and would follow the same outlines as the abilities previously mentioned. An ability like AE grapple could represent the warriors tactical control of a combat area and would effectively AE root or snare (with no aggro component on the snare possibly). These abilities could be balanced with reuse timers or damage components on them such as how shaman dots and pre-61 druid roots are balanced now. <br />
<br />
Take for example the situation where a group suddenly gets a lot of adds, the warrior could AE root for a few seconds to give the group's CCers time to work. However the root just damaged all the adds so a resist could very well kill any overeager CCer. Care would have to be used to balance how fast true CC can be achieved with how much damage the warrior is taking. The resist rare on the root could be a further balancing tool of this ability. AE or single target snare would follow the same lines though removing the aggro component of the snare would be suggested to limit its insane aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
7) Give warriors the real ability to rampage and flurry like warrior mobs do. The PoP AAs warriors currently have are a waste of time and don't present any AA customization option for warriors. Right now, warriors above all other classes have a set AA path with little to no deviation possible. Warriors absolutely have to focus on defensive AAs to be useful Nothing else mattters with the exception of AE taunt and that only because it is guaranteed taunt. How about rampage as an active ability on a set timer or maybe just as an ability that could be switched off and on? On adds this would give the warrior and his group the idea on whether to CC adds or just take them and possibly raise the group's DPS with the warriors possible ramp damage. With this, warriors could gain some appreciable situational dps. In particular, this ability would be of value during some LDoN runs and disatrous during others. Warriors just gained some customization and required intellect to play.<br />
<br />
True flurry as an AA or given ability would not be hideously unbalancing for a warrior since it serves only to increase thier dps with aggro only affected by damage and possibly more swings per round. Having this ability on a timer seems silly since warrior mobs in game alway have it on naturally. Why shouldn't warriors, being the truly ferocious combat masters they are, be able to flurry inherently or as a passive AA? The check for rampage could be dex based the same as mobs and could be balance tuned by the proc rate.<br />
<br />
And the bottom line is I understand that SKs don't wish to be relegated to gimpiness like they were in Kunark.  I also understand that warriors ought to given an advantage in tanking that just isn't present right now. Again, I don't know exactly how to fix it.  But at least the SKs are offering up ideas, whether bad or good.</div></div><hr />

Nerf them back to the stone age. I want every paladin to wake up one morning to find their plus hp/mana gear magically transformed into tarnished deepwater armor. I want the computer to spark and cough smoke everytime c3 is cast on them. I want every sk to go to feign death and come to the horrifying realization that their feign death will only work one out of four times if their lucky. I want their spellbooks to burst into flames. I want every twenty five mana per cast spell to be tucked away in Rydda Dar's underwear with a drop rate that makes the Bloodfrenzy look common. I want their mitigation transformed into the survivablity of a Pinto versus Semi Truck. I want them to try to attack a froglok only to have the froglok point and laugh at them. And I want to go back to being the uncontested gods of martial combat like we're supposed to be. <br />
<br />
I hate coffee. I've never liked coffee. You think coffee's funny? Tell you what. When they finally getting around to reducing your overpowered asses to what you deserve to be I want to laugh long and hard as your broken bodies mass up in graveyards like cordwood. <br />

Mabey not, but quotes like this, by asshats who apparantly have little to no clue...<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember, the majority of Warriors are button mashers. They have almost no clue how taunt even works, so who are they to say how it should be improved? <br />
<br />
<br />
Is what sparks some warriors to call for nerfs.  Even I have passing moments when a knight makes a retard commment like this that makes me think all knights should be nerfed.  Kunark 2.0 you say? Think again, you'd be lucky to tank an orc pawn at 65 with max AA and time gear~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the slower SK's who came here and didn't bother to read most of the posts, 'Knights' is the alternate term for 'Paladins'. Treat it as a 'ya'll' type regional dialect.<br />
<br />
 That being said, my 'nerfs', once again, are:<br />
<br />
 1) Level cap the smaller Paladin stuns at, say, 35 or 40. Make them give no aggro if attempted to cast on a mob above the cap.<br />
<br />
 2) Retune Paladin stuns with smaller aggro generation. If ANY of the three classes should BE able to lock aggro, it should be the most fragile of the 3.....which is the SK. Of course, that may still be game-breaking, but ATM SK's are not the problem in tank balance.<br />
<br />
 3) Unchain most Warrior /discs and lower refresh times on them.<br />
<br />
 Three very simple ideas which wind up with 3 classes who all tank relatively well, have different skill sets, and can all contribute equally in XP groups WHILE having places in raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nerfing stuns does not fix Warriors.  Tweaking them will help the raiding Paladin and screw the weaker ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense, but reducing aggro on paladin stuns may help warriors be more preffer for tanking, it doesn't solve the issue of warriors' aggro issues, and only unbalances the game by allowing paladins to stun mobs more often when not MTing, thus making life easier for all.<br />
<br />
Instead of reducing paladin stun aggro, kick/slam/bash aggro should be increased, as well as the stun/interrupt component of said abilities be increased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nerfing stuns does not fix Warriors. Tweaking them will help the raiding Paladin and screw the weaker ones. <br />
<br />
 Ya know, isn't part of the Paladin bitchfest that they're weak on raids, and therefore should be king of the XP group? :p <br />
<br />
 No offense, but reducing aggro on paladin stuns may help warriors be more preffer for tanking, it doesn't solve the issue of warriors' aggro issues, and only unbalances the game by allowing paladins to stun mobs more often when not MTing, thus making life easier for all. <br />
<br />
 Then recode them to not land as often, as well. That way, the least survivable of the plate tanks has the best aggro generation. And before anyone starts on the kick 'that just makes it hard for anyone to control aggro', I say GOOD. About fucking time fingerwagglers learned a skill besides chain casting, anyways.</div></div><hr />

These abilities could be balanced with reuse timers or damage components on them such as how shaman dots and pre-61 druid roots are balanced now. <br />
<br />
Take for example the situation where a group suddenly gets a lot of adds, the warrior could AE root for a few seconds to give the group's CCers time to work. However the root just damaged all the adds so a resist could very well kill any overeager CCer. Care would have to be used to balance how fast true CC can be achieved with how much damage the warrior is taking. The resist rare on the root could be a further balancing tool of this ability. AE or single target snare would follow the same lines though removing the aggro component of the snare would be suggested to limit its insane aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
7) Give warriors the real ability to rampage and flurry like warrior mobs do. The PoP AAs warriors currently have are a waste of time and don't present any AA customization option for warriors. Right now, warriors above all other classes have a set AA path with little to no deviation possible. Warriors absolutely have to focus on defensive AAs to be useful Nothing else mattters with the exception of AE taunt and that only because it is guaranteed taunt. How about rampage as an active ability on a set timer or maybe just as an ability that could be switched off and on? On adds this would give the warrior and his group the idea on whether to CC adds or just take them and possibly raise the group's DPS with the warriors possible ramp damage. With this, warriors could gain some appreciable situational dps. In particular, this ability would be of value during some LDoN runs and disatrous during others. Warriors just gained some customization and required intellect to play.<br />
<br />
True flurry as an AA or given ability would not be hideously unbalancing for a warrior since it serves only to increase thier dps with aggro only affected by damage and possibly more swings per round. Having this ability on a timer seems silly since warrior mobs in game alway have it on naturally. Why shouldn't warriors, being the truly ferocious combat masters they are, be able to flurry inherently or as a passive AA? The check for rampage could be dex based the same as mobs and could be balance tuned by the proc rate.<br />

It amazes me that an SK is able to see that we have some serious problems, and that he's willing to accept many of the same fixes we've suggested as viable and not aimed at gimping knights.   I'll be damned, I wouldnt have thought it was possible.  Maybe all the inflammatory bullshit I've read on PoN (and in some cases posted by knights here) was coloring my perception of knights too much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Believe it or not, there are many knights that want to see pure melee restored to a properly viable option in any group or raid.  Or at least, that's the way I see things reading through Sk.org. Further, we know what it's like to be attached to our characters. Hell, standard advice when the inevitable question 'Should I start a Pally or an SK?' gets asked is 'Go start a Paladin, if you were an SK, you'd know.' The number of us that were playing SKs at some level of the game during Kunark is probably disproportionally high compared to other classes. Now, I'll admit that I wasn't high enough that the raising of knight defense caps affected me, but I sure do remember the day that my mana bar almost tripled between patches. I certainly remember the day they fixed it so I wouldn't have to work half again as hard to build a character, which, at the time, was much less effective than an equivalent warrior... the day after I hit 46. So, many of us do know what it's like to be useless. We're certainly glad we got the boosts, and don't really want to return to that. But, that's past. Us being bitter about the past and reflexive screams about nerf calls doesn't solve today's problem.<br />
<br />
We watch our warrior guildmates, our friends, scream in frustration at the game. We watch our slowers and priests gib under the massively inflated damage output of PoP mobs. We watch our monks and rogues curse openly or weep silently over the fact that they're at the bottom of the totem pole for damage. All of a sudden, once again, it's not a fun game for us. <br />
<br />
Fix warriors. Please. Let them be functional and fun. Let us watch them rip and scream in berzerker fury and revel in fields of gore as gods slam up against him. I want to see the gleam in a rogues eyes as he sinks daggers into the back of a dragon like the fangs of a serpent. Just please don't try to banish me to the sidelines completely because I chose to dabble with things that are best left under the bed in the nightmares of madmen while becoming the vanguard for my Hateful Lord. That's no fun for me, and that's no fun for my friends, the warrior, the monk, the cleric, the enchanter.</div></div><hr />

In all seriousness, I just wish that everyone, be they knight, warrior, priest, fingerwiggler, or other, had a similar clarity in their view of this situation.</div></div><hr />
