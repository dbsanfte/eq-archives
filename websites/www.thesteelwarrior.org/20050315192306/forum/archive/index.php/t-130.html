I agree..<br />
<br />
Guild's done 23 Ring of Slimes. I've been on every one. Not yet have we seen one drop.<br />
<br />
However, I was lucky enough to pick up a pair of bracers for 160k (80k/ea)</div></div><hr />

Good items seem to be crazy rare... out of like 30 kills I've seen 1 acid-pocked mithril blade and a buncha garbage.</div></div><hr />

We've killed it a number of times and have never seen a bracer or gloves.  Though in the last 9 months or so we have heard of 1 bracer and 1 pair of gloves dropping.</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen a single rogue blade, and only 2 pair of gloves (none since the third kill).  However, my guild was lucky enough to get 6 of those bracers.

Those bracers are dropable and should have been returned to the guild, thats usually s.o.p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does not spawn when the server/zone comes up it's same as most stuff comes up randomly and atleast way back when, it was a 5 day spawn.<br />
<br />
Bracers at first were common, as were gloves, then at some point the event was changed and a few things were added to the drop table and the chances of bracers/gloves plummeted.<br />
<br />
We got 3 bracers on one kill one time before the change, don't think we got any bracers after although they were still dropping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guild property rule is/was in our charter.  That doesn't matter much to many people though.  In fact, such a large percentage of the mid to high end population seems to be indifferent to this behavior that I don't know of anyone who has suffered serious repercussions for not returning droppable guild loot.  Three or four of the ones we lost were on characters that moved to Maelin.  There surely aren't any consequences there.  If a rule is effectively unenforcable, then it isn't much of a restriction to those likely to break it anyway.<br />
<br />
I don't want to bring up or start any drama, so names are absolutely withheld.  That point is non-negotiable.  I just wanted to mention that in case someone wants more specific info.<br />
<br />
As Coray says, the bracers seem to be exceptionally rare in recent times, I think we got all but one of the bracers in the first 10 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah - I always wondered about returning gear to a guild. I sure would do it if for some reason I had to leave my guild - but my only droppable loot the guidl got me is my SoD. I have a Bloodfrenzy now for my primary and I have a primal WS, stormrider carapace, a 41dam/31del 2HB, and a primal battleaxe plus various bane weapons.<br />
<br />
Losing the SoD wouldnt be a terrible step back for me BUT even though our guild has this policy (return droppable items) I seldom see anyone make a huge deal out of it when they dont. I mean, we don't expect someone to be equipped like a newb just because they left us.<br />
<br />
The area's we have had problems is the obvious greed. We had quite a few members take advantage of /movelog and they have looted whatever came their way - drop or nodrop - and then took off. Some of that was dropable but a guy with only one SOD he's had for 6 months then no big deal. The guy with 2 SoDs and knows we got warriors using a fleshgrinder - that's cold hearted. But so is looting the FT 5 chest (no drop) off the burrower and also sweet talking the first HoV spell (no drop) because your the &quot;most active cleric and its for the best of the guild&quot; and then hauling butt (phuck you Runesteel) - that's pretty rough.<br />
<br />
Oh well - /rant off</div></div><hr />
