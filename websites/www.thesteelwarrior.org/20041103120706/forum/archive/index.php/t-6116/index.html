<br />
Just dinged 65 last night, and I wondered how I was doing on gear.  Our alliance is working on the Rallos script right now, as a reference to what I am going to be doing.  I'm not the MT...I basically got to 65 as fast as I could and will work on AA now.  <br />

Here is my magelo:<br />

Thank you all very much in advance.  Your input on an upgrade path is very much appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Whoppa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if you are VT enabled, but there are a number of upgrades you could get in VT. Since you are on Firiona Vie you could buy VT drops as well (not sure on the market for them). If you are VT enabled, there are 4 great drops from Aten that you should set your sights on. You'll want Great Shadow Platemail, Crimson Runed Mask, Earring of Eradication and Soul Essence of Aten Ha Ra (turn in for Talisman of Vah Kerrath). Those 4 items will last you until Time. There are a number of other VT items that would be upgrades for you, but you should concentrate on jewelry/non-visible slots. Belt of Mastery from Aten Blobs is a great item you should look at picking up. The rest is up to you, there is a horde of rings/earrings you could grab.<br />
<br />
Once you enter elementals, obviously you will be after Raex. Since your Haste is in a Raex's slot, I would recommend trying to get the Earth Bracer (Bracers of Earthen Energy) as it is not much worse than Raex's or going after the Flowing Moss Mantle which also drops in Earth. There is also a Haste ring from PoA (Band of Swirling Air), but it has low AC, and there are definite better options for rings. The Bracer is probably your best choice as the WAR-only Puresteel Mantle for shoulders is a great item to have and easy enough to get.<br />
<br />
As for Weapons, Stone Etched Warsword is a nice DPS weapon, and can be a great aggro weapon with Anger 3 Aug'd. An obvious choice would be Blade of War but if your not MTing I wouldn't bother.<br />
<br />
All in all though, your current gear is fine for pre-elemental. I was in mostly Cultural with spatterings of other stuff (very similar to yours) when I entered elementals and I survived and even tanked things. AAs will be huge in upping your tankability too, so look into maxing those out ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GroovinFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, we are VT enabled and have just gotten to the point where we farm it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say you need to hang up the raiding hat for a while and get some AA's, your gear is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I notice you are VT keyed.  Just out of curiosity why are you wearing a valorium ring of gallantry instead of your ring of the shissar.  It is more hp's.  I would also suggest you look into the strength of the elements quest as that will increase you shoulder item by 45 hp.  You may also look into a Crimrose cloak of the werewolf ( I think that is full spelling) it is 80hp's instead of 50hp and very cheap on my server atleast.  Other then that you look good.  AA's will do alot for ya!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For a quick upgrade, I suggest getting the mask from Lcea Katta.  40ac, 100hp, pure and simple.  Can be single grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, kill Lcea Katta 100 times and maybe get the mask once.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">*shrug*  It's a 100hp, 40ac item that can be obtained by a single group.  Shouldn't be too common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malikae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For just dinging 65 you got some wicked gear. Must be nice on the FV server, 'cause it aint like that on Inny.</div></div><hr />
