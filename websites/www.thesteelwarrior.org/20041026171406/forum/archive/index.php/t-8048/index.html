<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a regular group, at a set time each week, and we've begun to challenge ourselves. We're a crack squad at what we do, and some of them are pretty well equipped.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we recently found that we could *possibly* take Vindi - this was a group of war, clr, dru, dru, bst, nec, and it required killing his two linked guards prior to pulling him.<br />
<br />
(note that after 3 failures in other methods, we devised this, but never completed it - we were weary of the place)<br />
<br />
My question is, having achieved this, what do you all think about us trying the listed targets in the subject: Dozekar, Yelinak, Doomshade, and Rumblecrush?<br />
<br />
group is almost always war, clr, dru, bst, nec, with the 6th person being a choice for us - usually a mag or dru, sometimes a brd.<br />
<br />
For rough power estimations:<br />
war (see my profile, pre-EP warrior, 8khp with good group buffs, all def AA)<br />
dru - about the same as I am, equipment-wise<br />
bst - also about my speed<br />
Clr - heavily equipped, post-time guild<br />
Nec - super equipped, post-time guild (member of most powerful guild on the server, Magister), has more hp than *I* do.<br />
<br />
Comments? Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Bear in mind we're not really doing this for the equipment - in fact, we have a hard time finding twinks/alts/friends to come loot the stuff. We're just looking for some interesting challenges, and since I lead the group, I don't want to jump us in too far beyond our means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've taken things like Va Dyn, Lendi the Keeper, Doomshade, Rumblecrush, Klandi, Zlandi, etc. With me tanking, we don't need a rotation for any of those. I just use my bot cleric to keep me alive, w/ a healer watching spot heals (although rarely needed). I fully buff out to 9.3k hp, however we rarely have full buffs. Since you have all of your defensive AA, I don't think the difference in HP between you and I would make all that much difference. I think you could prolly tank any of what I listed fine without a rotation.<br />
<br />
Only things to keep in mind are things like Rampage, AE's, slow immune mobs, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yelisnatch is probably a bit out of your league yet.  But all the most listed previously can be one grouped with relative ease.  Have fun!<br />
<br />
My last go at Zlandicar while 4boxing, he wasn't slowed and I didn't need a heal the entire fight =(   Soon the shaman will have solo'ed him!</div></div><hr />

Something that might help on vindi fight, requires a high level bard tho: get the adds tash/maloed and the bard can easily highsun them back to their spawn loc.  Works great, can keep both tied up till vindi's dead, or till one killed, etc.  Hit it with Oos on inc (longer range than highsun) for even fewer resists.  Still a fun fight tho.  With rumblecrush/davynn/etc (i.e. luclin mobs) DPS gets to be the limiting factor, those mobs mitigate damage a LOT even now, so keeping healer mana up while grinding down the mobs is the trick.<br />

An easier way to handle vindi + pets is just have the necro pull Vindi, kite him around arena, pick off the pets, then bring vindi in when they're dead.  Of course, you'll want to clear the the pops in arena before doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">or do vindi with enchanter pets ;p forgot that</div></div><hr />

Dozekar is easily done if you have an insta clicky and a Warrior with defensive AA maxed. Before he is slowed, he hits pretty hard, but after that he is gimp.<br />
<br />
Problem is, between a couple of crews on Emarr, he's kept pretty dead :) Trust me, I know :P<br />
<br />
I think your HPs are a little low for Vindi still with the single group you are talking about. Also remember you have to deal with the rampage.<br />
<br />
Rumblecrush, doable. Doomshade, doable. Yelinak, not doable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This sounds like something I've recently started doing with some of my friends.<br />
<br />
Me and about 9-10 friends have been raiding(and Clearing) NToV latly, and Sleepers. Everyone but me is Post Time Geard, except another friend I invited.<br />
<br />
We have Done All of NToV(minus Vulak),Dozeker,Sontolak,Statue,AoW,Idol,Tmax,Vindi,All 4 Ancients,Prog,Master of the Guard,Zlandicar,Klandicar,and a few SSRA mobs.<br />
<br />
All I can say for you, is get a few more hp, and you can easily do Vindi.  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, our difficulty wasn't in me tanking Vindi - I could do that just fine. The problem, at first, was how to handle the adds (you can't really split them anymore, they keep coming back). On our final attempt, when we did what someone has suggested - kiting - we took out both guards, and rushed into the vindi fight. We ended up having a lot of repops at once because of this, and that killed of 2 of the dps members almost immediately. Had we allowed Vindi to go home, re-cleared, and re-pulled, we would have been just fine.<br />
<br />
Rampage is easy for us to control, since the necro ended up being the RT, and, as I stated, he's got more hp than I do (and all of the defensive mitigation you could want).<br />
<br />
Looking at the DI/DB for the Statue and Idol, I don't think we will mess with those. I don't quite have it in me for that kind of encounter yet. However, we will be playing with Zlandi/Klandicar, and most likely UP named. It may take us a while to catch Dozekar up, but we'll give him a shot, too. I have a score to settle with that guy.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Try Yelinak...if your DPS &gt; his regen no worries.  With decent AAs his common hit is about 125...hardly as worrisome as posted.</div></div><hr />

For some REALLY old school nostalgia, do posky with one group; very do-able but requires 2 rezzers (we use a pally and and a cleric) since all the boss types after island 3 have DTs (and yes, they are still lame after 4+ years).  There's not much up there that you'll probably want, but it's actually a lot of fun, in a masochistical kind of way.  There is a quest for war shoulders with 3 charges of spirit of cheeta (rechargeable), a shammy FD ring, etc., but be prepared for multiple clearing to get the pieces needed for the quest turn ins.  The good news is that the keys don't poof after leaving the zone anymore, so you can bypass content you don't need.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The large concern for your group combo is resist debuffs, alot of mobs are hard to slow without malos/malosinia or atleast tash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">omg someone sugested going to PoS for FUN! For me and everyone I know PoS is not fun, but FUn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keizer Soze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I usually go out and do things like this with a friend of mine.  I'm a 65 warrior with about 70 AA, approx 6200 unbuffed HP, and I also 2box the cleric for our group.  My friend is a rogue and he 2 boxes a shaman.  We then usually have a 65 beastlord or Paladin to come with us, along with his 2boxed shaman(depending on the situation).   Keep in mind the cleric has FT15 and lots of AA's.<br />
<br />
We've been able to do some pretty hard stuff with just us.  We've done Doomshade, Innoruuk(in Nadox, hard as hell with 1 group, but doable.), haven't had a chance at Rumblecrush yet, but easy.  Va'dyn is easy, Itraer Vius is possible, same with Grieg if you know the fight.  Rhag's in Ssra, the Glyphed Covered Serpent, you could maybe do  Xerkish the Creator,  Ring of Slime with a bard, Vindi is doable, Statue of rallos zek for sure.  Thought Horror Overfiend may be possible, if you have good DPS and can kill his room fast enough.  Pretty much all of BoT, minus a couple key named that are a bit rough. Quite a few of the named in Sleepers Tomb are doable.  I know there's a few others that i'm missing, but i gotta get some food.<br />

I've done the vindi pull several times as a bard, which you say you sometimes have access to.<br />
<br />
Trick is to clear a hunk of the arena, pull Vindi and his guards, FACE vindi and his guard, /disc deftdance, Highsun (gate) Vindi to his spawn point and hit Fading memories.  Then pull the guards to your kill group, then go back for Vindi.</div></div><hr />

That seems like alot of trouble when all you have to do is kite vindi and his 2 guards in a circle while you chain snare song on vindi and then the group just peels the 2 guards off of you.</div></div><hr />
