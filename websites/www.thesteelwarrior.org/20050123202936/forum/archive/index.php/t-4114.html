<br />
Some stuff you could maybe look for on the cheap in bazaar:<br />
<br />
Brellium shoulders and Brellium pants (dwarven cultural). They'd be a bit of a boost to what you're currently wearing in both AC and hit points.<br />
<br />
Helm of Raldukan would be an upgrade to the helmet, and they're running pretty cheap these days in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Solstice earring packages are pretty cheap these days too. Could probably, with a bit of patience, totally make a killing on one.<br />
<br />
Those would be my suggestions for things you could look for at your liesure. Your gear's fine for now, so don't feel like you have to go upgrade like a madman.</div></div><hr />
