<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all..First off before I jump feet first into this I want to thank everyone who has helped me out in the past few weeks..My Warrior, raid buffed has more the 1200 AC and over 5700 HP at level 50.  Thanks to your help, I know how decent weapons and am quickly getting the reputation as being a class A tank..<br />
     Now to the meat of the matter so to speak.  I have been chatting with a few warriors and yesterday, most notibly, I was talking with a 62 warrior and the subject of HP and AC came up.. She had decent gear, but her ac was well below mine, maybe 1000 ish and her HP were only 4700...OMG!  How is that possible..She said it was because she hadnt chosen a diety and thus didnt get the perks of having diety armor..WEll, Im pretty damn happy I have a Barbarian Warrior who follows the Tribunal.  Allthough Im really suprised that I dont take diety hits when I hunt in PoJ..what gives there?  Anyways, it seems that unless you have a chosen diety your kinda of hosed.. Is this true accross the board?..WEll, gotta run, Uncle Sam Beckons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It hasn't always existed, and you can bet the number of Zek and Tribunal worshipping warriors would be a lot higher right now if it had. If I had started my warrior after the armor was in the game I wouldn't have gone agnostic. Why not chose one? The downside is near non-existant.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the person you were talking to has been playing long enough to remember when faction actually made a difference? Way back when, you had to run through enemy territory to get to the zones you wanted to hunt in with no place to sell stuff when you get full. Nowadays you can simply by-pass the whole faction thing with a click of a book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol, reason why i did not make a troll or ogre because i did not want to run half way across the world to just buy some food  :eek: <br />
<br />
but the deity helps out but that war that you talked to either cannot afford high end items, dont have the time for getting high end items or just lazy at getting what is needed to get those hp also war could might not be going for the stats they need but deity does not really matter. i am agnostic and yes i wish i choose a deity but at 65 with AAs no real difference with armor since you will be replacing it soon for ubah stuff anyways. like they said before deity does not matter for anything nowadays execpt for cultural armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought this the moment the new cultural stuf came out.  I chose agnostic to be more neutral because faction mattered alot back when I started in 2000.  <br />
<br />
I was just playing on magelo to see if re-rolling would be much benefit.  In my opinion it is not enough of a difference for me to correct now that I am dusting off and gearing up, too many no-drop pieces as well.<br />
<br />
The stats can be seen in these profiles, the top is my current, the 2nd is if I had put 25 into stamina instead of strength to start, the third is if I replace all but my haste belt with FH armor.<br />

Basically I would end up with,<br />
<br />
+ 358 HP<br />
<br />
+ 61 AC<br />
<br />
- 108 ATK<br />
<br />
- 59 Str<br />
<br />
+ 3 STA  ( yes only 3 hehe)<br />
<br />
+ 20 AGI<br />
<br />
+ 19 Dex<br />
<br />
wis/int/cha who cares..<br />
<br />
- 17 Poison <br />
<br />
- 9 Magic<br />
<br />
- 10 Disease<br />
<br />
- 16 Fire<br />
<br />
- 23 Cold<br />
<br />
<br />
Just seems like too many negatives to me, but for a newly created warrior it may make more sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">with ldon stuff avialble diety matters not anymore. by the time you hit lvl 30ish were the red numbers realy start to add up enough to matter you could just buy a full set of ss as a agnostic. and realy only the trib and zek guys get any real advantage in hp. since agnostics can were the non diety versions witch just half the hp and add +mana.<br />
<br />
either way close enough not to matter.<br />
<br />
but you do get that advantage from 30-55 ish. when the guys who saved and didn't buy curtal buy ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I didn't even know about Tundra Helanic armor when I started this warrior. I just didn't feel like having an agnostic character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A 62 warrior with 1000ac and 4700hps is pitiful.  My warrior was agnostic and I FAR exceeded that at 60 in Velious so I don't know what the 62 war's problem is but its not the lack of a deity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ornate is non deity specific.<br />
Im glad Im agnostic. Enjoy your armor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ac was well below mine, maybe 1000 ish and her HP were only 4700...OMG!<br />
<br />
Before I comment, is that buffed or no? cuz if that's unbuffed then that's not bad, if that's buffed then omg that's bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>WarSheol_EM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I chose Agnostic because my character refused to be a puppet for some Deity.<br />
<br />
Ahh yeah its DEITY thats one of those things that gets to me so many people worshiping diets heh.<br />
<br />
Mainly the choice seems to effect weather or not you can some day travel safely through a few newbie towns, and at this stage im well beyond the cultural stuff I couldnt wear any way.<br />
<br />
Cobalt BP and Greaves rocked for the levels they are intedned for, sure AC may be a tiny bit lower but the effects are priceless.<br />
<br />
I also felt the need to be one of the rare Dark Elf warriors as I dont like the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; pattern of Ogre Warrior Cultural armor bla bla bla bla, bla.<br />
<br />
Higher up it really dont effect any thing at all any more so best bet is to pick whats fun for yourself and go with it   :) <br />

im not uber but have fun playing heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>beeafraid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cultural armor is very nice.  I don't think you can find more bang for the buck in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
The only class I know of where being agnostic is a bonus is enchanter.  Mine is a dark elf and I made it follow Inny.   Wooo..... that made things a bit harder.  It's really lovely trying to buy a spell from vendors who hate you and they are the only ones who carry the spell.  Yes, enchanters can get around that.  But try training from the guildmaster.  They don't want any part of my little game <br />
<br />
 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was RZ when RZ was uncool. When the first diety armors came out, though, I admit that the bracers I got were guaranteed wear-to-50 pieces. As far as FH, I was too poor when they first came out, and too in love with killing mobs for upgrades to worry about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i went agnostic as a warrior, but then i also chose a halfling.  am i sorry i didnt choose a deity?  hell no.  once you get above 55, ornate takes over, the same with LDoN armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, it seems that unless you have a chosen diety your kinda of hosed.. Is this true accross the board?..WEll, gotta run, Uncle Sam Beckons.<br />
<br />
do i think i got hosed?  no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ugnok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Felt slighted 10 lvls ago...did some major gear work and Im certainly not looking back.   In fact in your cultural armor you &quot;might&quot; have as many hps as me when your 54 but I still think youll fall short.   :p</div></div><hr />
