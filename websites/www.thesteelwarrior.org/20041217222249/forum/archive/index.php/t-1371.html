<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Needs an &lt;all of the above&gt; option which everyone here should know is the correct answer and therefore its a pointless poll.<br />
<br />
Otherwise its just going to be an opinion poll with skewed results depending on where you post it.  A warrior will think &quot;if I could hold agro better I could tank effectively&quot; while a ranger would think &quot;If I could mitigate like a plate class I would be a great tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
Agro control doesn't make a tank otherwise we'd have CH chains on our enchanters and warriors wouldn't be needed at raids, but the truth is that Tanking is about all of the above, and when you take away the things determined by the player and not the class (eg. timing and positioning) and look solely at the benefits of the class the one that performs the best across the board will be the prefered tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't believe no one voted for positioning. <br />
<br />
So I did.<br />
<br />
It's still a very important aspect of tanking. And once you reach a level of the game where certain classes of tank are interchangable, positioning skill becomes one of the deciding factors on who's the better tank, imo.<br />
<br />
Some people can do it easier than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dobbo,<br />
it's called timing. <br />
<br />
You learn through deaths most likely that this is when you are supposed to taunt and when you are not supposed to taunt. It's like when you have 2 doors and one of em has 100$$ behind it, and the other is connected to an electric supply. You learn to not touch the door with the electric supply behind because it's going to hurt.<br />
<br />
Hitting the taunt button after I see a slow message is not skill.<br />
<br />
When you don't have agro due to a slower or a cleric getting agro, you shield. If it's a wizzy or a druid, well I don't bother (unless the druid is healing) It's not that complicated.<br />
<br />
Positioning... again it doesn't take skill, it takes knowledge.<br />
<br />
I think that you are confusing the word &quot;skill&quot; with the word &quot;knowledge&quot; dobbo. It takes skill to play a guitar, it doesn't take skill to play everquest.</div></div><hr />

Its skill. Its not that Instinct training like they did with the dogs and the bell by Pawlov.<br />
<br />
You learn it. When is the right point to match taunt. When is the right point to match /shield. How can I stand for the most benefits for the group - now in lots of PoP zones not so important as in the past cause of missing enrage. <br />
<br />
In the time befor laying hands on an EB .. weapon the question What Mob which resists .. depends on Weapon A or Weapon B.<br />
<br />
Its the part of looking at your group an deciding to prefer your 1hers cause they seem to - hm be a bit nasty on aggro in the beginning - or to bag your 1hers for your aggro 2her cause group knows very well what to do.<br />
<br />
Its the part of bringing out your AE taunt in time and some more stuff.<br />
<br />
Thats skill.<br />
<br />
Having a successful taunt when needed or an early proc thats luck.</div></div><hr />

 You learn it. When is the right point to match taunt. When is the right point to match /shield. How can I stand for the most benefits for the group - now in lots of PoP zones not so important as in the past cause of missing enrage.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Save the all the extra part, thats nearly the exact same thing I said.<br />
<br />
So heres another real life example:<br />
Your out there mowing the lawn and BAM the mower runs over a root or something a little too high and hits the blade, thus scaring the shit out of you. The next time you mow the lawn, you avoid that root because it sure as hell ain't going away.<br />
Same exact thing with taunt. It's not skill to KNOW when to hit a little button.    When the Mower hits the root- thats when the slower lands his slow, or its resisted. When you learn to go around the root- thats when you learn to taunt when you see the slow message.<br />
<br />
It's not skill. It will never be skill. It's about being smart while you push the buttons to make you taunt, or shield and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Knowledge is not skill. A bad warrior won't have this knowledge, making him a bad warrior that he is. A new warrior wont have this knowledge because he is new. A good warrior WILL have this knowledge because (s)he has played the game long enough to aquire this knowledge. You know what skill is? Being able to do something some people can't do. Being able to play the tambourine is a skill.  Being able to draw exceptionally well is a skill. Pushing a button when you don't have agro, well I hardly doubt that you could train a monkey to play EQ at its lowest form (read: when there isn't red words going then you hit the &quot;1&quot; button. If you can't see the mob then you hit the &quot;-&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;-&quot; buttons etc etc).</div></div><hr />

A good warrior has very little trouble holding agro, sure the mobs will move around but he will get agro back before the mob does much damage.  For a bad warrior a slower always and I mean always has to root the mob and keep it rooted.<br />
<br />
If a warrior is good he will get a rep and be asked into grps a lot fasters then a lazy warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">friss</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many of the people who answered agro control only play a warrior at the lvl 65.  Unless you play a lvl 65 slower or cleric who has a lot of power to decide what type of tank will they invite, then you are not qualified to answer this poll.<br />
<br />
The type of tank greatly depends on what zone you are going to be experience in.  Another concern is the type of grp, being formed if the grp has a lot of dps casters then you have to have a shadow knight or beast lord for the mana regen.  The biggest benifit a SK brings to a grp is not agro control it is mana regen. A SK could have zero agro control and still will be asked into grps for zones where his mana dot works.  I heard that a SK mana buff adds around an extra 10 mana/tick that is better then pot9.  A caster goes even more nuts over mana regen then a melee over atk numbers.<br />
<br />
Once tanking becomes easy that most melee classes can do it, then people start looking for other abilities that might bring more to a grp then straight up tanking. Why pick a paladin into a grp, easy one word &quot;RES&quot;.  With a pal in the grp you can either use a druid as a healer or a weak cleric.<br />
<br />
Agro control plays a role but not the biggest role in picking a tank, many other concerns come in first, and I know because my main is a ench  which means I have a lot of power to decide on what type of tank we are getting.<br />
<br />
Now a weak ench or cleric that have a hard time doing their job, will always look for a strong tank, either a lvl 65 warrior with AA's and eb weapons or a hybrid. But the fault is not the warrior it is the ench that experience in pop without  SCS 3,  the most important AA ench can get for pop.  No ench should step a foot in bot pov pos without this AA, the trouble is to many do.</div></div><hr />

All the chanter has to do is stick his tongue out at the mob to get agro.   And all we can do is /shield his squishy arse and pray for a proc/taunt or a caster to root the mob so he can run 2 steps so we get proximity agro.<br />

<br />
<br />
Absolutely NOT true.  A SHD is a tank that primarily brings good agro control to the group.  He is generally not brought into a group for the purpose of providing uber DPS, nor does Zev's bite tip the scales in his favor either.  You could completely remove Zev's bite from a SHD spell lineup and they would still be desired in groups.<br />
<br />
Since you brought it up--Zev's bite is NOT a dot at all, NOR is it a buff--its a 200 pt DD, 200 pt group heal and a 100 mana regen all wrapped into one, with a re-cast of 60 seconds.  A frequent problem with this is how often it gets resisted and how often I have to un-mem it.<br />
<br />
In regards to the poll, I believe that HP and AC - mitigation should be combined into one category called something like, &quot;TAKE A BEATING&quot; because HP and AC/mitigation go hand in hand so much.<br />
<br />
Also, the *take a beating* aspect, I believe, is by far the most important attribute of a tank.  And I already know the comment that will come back--&quot;Well, how good is that if I can't get the guy to hit me?&quot;  I hear this so often, I begin to scowl at the mere mention of it.<br />
<br />
Agro does not make a good tank.  If so, just have a chanter chain cast tash over and over then.  I am willing to bet, however, that that strategy is not going to work too well because the chanter cant take a beating.  You have to be able to take the beating before you would even want agro.<br />
<br />
Ability to take the beating first, then applying it would be next in line (agro control).  The rest, while important, are pale in comparison.<br />

I'd say Aggro and HP go hand in hand.<br />
If you only got one of the two, you can't tank.<br />

<br />
Ench have been taking beating for as long as this game as been out, and now it is even easier to control that agro with AA's a lure type root, a kick ass rune plus a hate reducer.  Even if they give warriors more taunt casters will still pick a SK to tank in easy zones for that mana buff.<br />
<br />
Many times a pal is picked for grps that do not have a cleric, or only a weak cleric. A pal  heal spells are good enough that a pal can heal himself for a few mobs, while a weak cleric med. <br />
<br />
In the end what type of MT you pick depends on what zone you are experience in and how well you know that zone.  Nothing beats a warrior for stopping a train, hit AE taunt hit defence disc, now you give the ench time to mez and root the 4 plus adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many of the people who answered agro control only play a warrior at the lvl 65. Unless you play a lvl 65 slower or cleric who has a lot of power to decide what type of tank will they invite, then you are not qualified to answer this poll.<br />
<br />
My main's a 65 cleric, so presumably that qualifies me to answer this impartially.  :)<br />
<br />
Being on a different timezone to the majority of my guild, I do a lot of exping in pickup groups; I've achieved level 65 and over 100aa with random bunches of people.<br />
<br />
I don't often have a choice of tanks, is the truth of it; or I get real hard choices, like unguilded 61 war with Baron title and a pair of Defenders Lightblades -v- 65 pal with Duke title and some wierd-looking 2hs with a particle effect. <br />
<br />
I tend to choose to group with the first tank I find, unless I know for certain they're a retard, without regard to the warrior/knight debate. If the warrior's having aggro issues, as is sometimes the case, I'll get out the roots.<br />
<br />
But setting aside the gritty realities, let's imagine some perfect world in which I have the choice of paladin, shadowknight, or warrior. All are level 65, all are in reasonable but not exceptional gear, and all have reasonable reputations; I don't know any of them personally; and I'm in the fortunate position of having to choose one.<br />
<br />
I'll group the SK first any time.  The paladin can tank and hold aggro, but there isn't anything else she can do that I can't do myself... and most exp groups contain a cleric.  The shadowknight brings different abilities to the table which the group doesn't possess &quot;by default&quot; (snare, FD pull, FT10) as well as formidable damage output.<br />
<br />
The exception is if I'm going to one of the undeady bits of HoH or CoD, where the paladin trumps the SK.  But under those circumstances, I think I'd try to take both of the knight classes.<br />
<br />
Usually life isn't like that, though.  I do have a good friend who's a 65 SK, but if he's not on or doing something else, I can't group with a SK, because there are a such tiny number of them on the server.  So it's paladin or warrior, and as far as I'm concerned, that's just a matter of who's available.<br />
<br />
In a regular exp group environment, the art of grouping with a warrior is very straightforward:  Some warriors can hold aggro, and others struggle.  If you're grouped with one who's struggling, well, clerics have a fast cast, low resist root line.  Mem it, use it, learn to love it.  For a hundred mana or so, your warrior will get two or three taunt checks after slow and before root breaks, and that's really all that's needed.<br />
<br />
(Sure, the knight can hold aggro without costing me a hundred mana, but I'd spend that extra mana anyway, keeping the knight standing during the fight.  Warriors do tank noticeably better.)<br />
<br />
That breaks down with unrootable critters, but then, the Train of Valor Wasteland isn't a place where I would choose to group anyway.<br />
<br />
The correct use of root will enable a monk to tank in PoP.  I've done that more than once, at times when we just couldn't find a tank at all.<br />
<br />
Part of the relative downward movement of the warrior relative to the knight has been the change in PoP itemization in favour of two handers. That's meant that at the lower end, knights have caught up with warriors in terms of DPS; or even overtaken, where the warrior's having to use single-handed weapons with procs for aggro but the knight can hold aggro with spells and swing a Windblade too.<br />
<br />
The answer to that problem may lie with adjusting the damage bonus for single handers, and possibly with adding a damage bonus (smaller than the primary hand bonus) for a weapon in the offhand.<br />
<br />
Any offhand damage bonus should be warrior-only, of course. Rangers, monks and rogues with offhand damage bonuses would be scary!</div></div><hr />

<br />
AC and HP mean dick except the ability to handle an ass beating.  I've seen pretty high HP and AC warriors who completely suck at their class.<br />
<br />
Skill is more important then you realize.  You have the common blinders on that exist even within the warrior ranks.  Let me try to make this clear, using simple words:<br />
<br />
Warriors.. do more.. then TAUNT.<br />
<br />
A SKILLED warrior can also pull (high defensive capabilities make us excellent pullers.  If you know how aggro works you can pull singles in a lot of places without the need for FD).<br />
<br />
We can do the same or even more damage then other plate wearing classes given the right weapons.<br />
<br />
Positioning if you are tanking, is more then just knowledge.  You have to adjust the mob against the push of the other 35 melee pounding away on it.  You need to know the exact amount in which to turn him on Enrage, thereby killing the rogues and laughing with a dark glee.<br />
<br />
All you people who are pissed off that knights taunt better are pissed off because those blinders your wearing prevent you from seeing what else a warrior can do.<br />
<br />
Change your play style and get skillfull in doing something else then smashing taunt, and you might get groups easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Positioning... again it doesn't take skill, it takes knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some people, nay some tanks, just naturally know how to position mobs and raid forces better than others.<br />
<br />
Knowledge of an encounter plays a part. But you notice the skill factor crop up when you're taking on brand new content and KNOWLEDGE is at that point low.<br />
<br />
There isn't much SKILL used in this game at all. But in this tinsy instance, it is one of the things that is affected by skill.</div></div><hr />

This is off the topic, but what you typed above is vastly incorrect.<br />
<br />
Zefeers Bite is NOT a buff and it is NOT even one of the primary reasons a SHD is picked into a group.  You are talking to a SHD with a hair under 200AA--dont tell me that Zev's bite is one of the primary reasons because it just isnt true.  It MAY be true in some rare situations, but not even close to the majority.<br />

Do I care you can taunt no I have root, and boggles, do I care you can  fd  pull no I have  lull.  All I care about is experience and if I can make a grp that gives me an AA an hour then that is what I try to do.  The extra mana allows the slower to DD more, the extra mana and healing allows the cleric to DD more, all of which increases the dps of a grp.<br />
<br />
The only problem with SK is finding one to grp with in the first place since they are so rare, which is why I found a well equip BL even makes a better tank for tactics and down, thanks to there buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You find you're skillfull?<br />
Placing the mobs well, taunting at the right moment, getting close to the mob, using the right weapons, pullling......<br />
you find those skillfull?<br />
<br />
Once you know Taunt doesnt boost your aggro, but only bumps you to the top of the hate list, it's easy to be a good tank.<br />
Single pulling also doesnt demand any great skill lol...<br />
<br />
Being able to do all those, is having knowledge...<br />
having skill no the other hand, is only possible when you have a wide range of tools to choose from. And knowing which tools to use when, and always being on the tip of your toes, using all your tools at maximum capacity.<br />
<br />
<br />
With a warrior, <br />
you equip the best aggro weapons you have, <br />
you attack the mob asap, chain arrows on it when you see it etc...<br />
When it comes in, you dont taunt immediately, you will get aggro by just attacking it.<br />
You stay closer to the mob, then all the other players.<br />
And when you see it run towards someone else, WHAM! you hit Taunt....<br />
<br />
now if Taunt fails?... you wait 6 seconds, letting the mob beat the shit out of whoever got aggro, while you're on your knees praying for a proc.<br />
Taunt fails again second time and still no proc???<br />
then wait 6 more seconds, and hope your healers is good enough to keep that shaman alive...<br />
<br />
That is the problem.<br />
Wether you are skilled or not, we have nothing else other then Taunt, to get the mob on us.<br />
And Taunt is a tool even rangers have....<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter what,<br />
if taunt fails, it fails... and a party member may die, and people may say you suck...<br />
<br />
<br />
saying you have to be skillfull to see theres no problem with warriors is such bullshit. And you know it very well...<br />
but I guess you imagine that BoW or Bloodfrenzy gives you skill as a player eh?</div></div><hr />

Warriors.. do more.. then TAUNT.<br />
<br />
Change your play style and get skillfull in doing something else then smashing taunt, and you might get groups easier.  <br />
<br />
What exactly more can a warrior do to maintain aggro?<br />
<br />
Kick? Disarm? Slam? Bash?<br />
<br />
and these are exclusive warrior class SKILLS?<br />
<br />
IF any single person in your group or raid DO NOT cooperate with you, NONE of your L33T SK1LLZOR  will do a damn thing to keep the mob on you...<br />
<br />
Skilled warriors do not exist, we have nothing to be skillful with. Now a monk single pulling king tormax to EW zone, without using warping.. that takes some skill. <br />
<br />
Dont assume your BoW procs mean you are a skilled tank..</div></div><hr />

First off, I don't even use a BoW.<br />
<br />
What exactly more can a warrior do to maintain aggro?<br />
<br />
I wasn't talking about taunting you idjit.  Read my post.<br />
<br />
You find you're skillfull?<br />
<br />
Yes actually, I find I'm very skillfull.  I can generaly get pickup groups within minutes by flipping my LFG tag on.  Why? Everybody (or most everybody) knows me on my server, because I have a reputation of being a SKILLFULL player.  I got that way because I learned how to do more then just smash taunt.  <br />
<br />
I grew up pulling Fear when it was still hard.  Delevel yourself to 50 then go try to single pull fear as a pure melee and see how well you do before you start mouthing off about &quot;pulling takes no skill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now a monk single pulling king tormax to EW zone, without using warping.. that takes some skill<br />
<br />
No, any idiot with faction in kael can single Tmax.  We used to pull him to WL zone single.<br />
<br />
Finaly,<br />
<br />
Skilled warriors do not exist<br />
<br />
Its that thinking that probably makes you not get groups.</div></div><hr />

Do I care you can taunt no I have root, and boggles, do I care you can fd pull no I have lull. All I care about is experience and if I can make a grp that gives me an AA an hour then that is what I try to do. The extra mana allows the slower to DD more, the extra mana and healing allows the cleric to DD more, all of which increases the dps of a grp.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this is just silly.  What you have just posted basically suggests that taunt ability is essentially worthless to tank classes because you have root and boggle.  /what??<br />
<br />
Im quite certain that many of the WAR here would love to have a chat with you about that.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, root is a poor substitute for good aggro control.  Not only are you wasting mana rooting the mobs that otherwise could be used nuking, root doesnt stop the mob from summoning you and an unslowed mob that summons the overzealous DDin chanter or other robe class is going down fast.  <br />
<br />
Agro control buries mana regen in terms of group efficiency.  Nothing kills XP faster then a wipe and groups wipe to poor agro control far more often then all relevant caster being OOM.  <br />
<br />
Im really glad that you see the usefullness of Zev's bite.  Keep it up.<br />
<br />
But dont tell me that Zev's bite is the *primary* reason that SHD are desired in groups.  They could delete that spell from our spell list and SHD would still be very desired in groups.  Please consider that, as what you are saying is just not correct.<br />

When all you you really mean that playing a warrior has nothing to do with skill, why do you think there are good and bad warrior in the game?<br />

When you think that there is no skill to play the game why are there DrOOds and Druids. Why ppl. say that most Druids never learn the group play ?<br />
<br />
There is lots of stuff around in the game you can learn -- when you want to learn. With each part you learn to be better in the way you can do your job in game youre more skilled in playing your charakter.<br />
<br />
Skill is not to have the Infos about the mob ... the position .. the pullways ...  Skill is the best to make out of all of these possibilities to gain the maximum effects out of them.<br />

Beeing a warrior that knows all means nothing. Beeing a warrior who does the right thing at the right moment is all.</div></div><hr />

Sweet mother of fucking Christ do you read?  I havn't mentioned anything about taunting, period.  I'll try a different tactic:<br />
<br />
PALADINS AND SK'S CAN OUT TAUNT US, DEAL WITH IT.  FIND SOMETHING OTHER THEN TAUNTING TO EXCEL AT AND YOU'LL GET GROUPS.<br />
<br />
It takes skill to pull effectivley (read: not just singles but combination of singles/multiples to maximize exp).<br />
<br />
I joined a group in the elemental planes a few weeks ago and my job was the puller (in the field of gib) with a paladin as the tank.  And the exp rolled right on in, because I was skilled at what I was doing.<br />
<br />
If you want to get groups, learn how to PLAY A MELEE, not just PLAY A WARRIOR.  Warriors can do so much more then just taunt, but you apparently are hung up on that fact.<br />
<br />
Once you realize that you aren't the best tank for a group, Jesus himself will decend from the Heavens and say &quot;you stupid ass, adjust.&quot;  And all will be good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;omg omg taunt taunt&quot; while smashing your taunt key spastically if theres a more suitable tank in the group won't help your cause.<br />
<br />
Learn to pull, get some high dps weapons (even if they don't aren't &quot;taunt&quot; weapons as a general term), improve your offensive AA, whatever.<br />
<br />
But stop bitching about your role or inability to find groups because its HOW you play your class thats the problem, not the class itself.<br />

Many factors go into that decision, a lot more then how well that class can hold agro.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Several thoughts here.  <br />
<br />
Firstly, your initial comment stated nothing about SHD vs PAL.  Your original comment was as follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;No, one of the biggest reasons to pick a SK is for that mana buff, an extra 100 mana every 60 sec rules, and can really inc the dps of a grp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your comment directly above is not correct at all.  The biggest (not only, but biggest) reason people seek out SHD/PAL to tank for them in XP groups is due to agro control.  If not, ask yourself why there are all these threads on this board about *broken* agro for WARs.<br />
<br />
Now, however, you have introduced PAL into the equation, which is a different ballgame.  The reason that is it a different ballgame is because PAL can hold agro damn near as good as a SHD can, rendering that benefit almost neutral.  Now, certainly, you can move onto other things that the classes offer, one of them being, Zev's Bite.<br />
<br />
<br />
This will sound rude, but Im not intending it that way, so dont go overboard with this next comment..<br />
<br />
Your question as to why a group would pick a SHD over a PAL if Zev's bite was out of the picture pretty much reveals that you are really ignorant in regards to SHD/PAL.  I dont mean that mean or rude, but I dont think you really know what each class brings to the table.<br />
<br />
Without going into a ton of advantages / disadvantages of each class, perhaps the single biggest reason a group might pick a SHD over a PAL is due to much larger DPS.  PAL are perhaps the lowest DPS class there is and SHD will exceed their DPS fairly easily (all things equal). <br />

Pulling does require skill and I love it when I wind up being the puller, but the warrior class was designed specifically to excel at tanking to the exclusion of everything else.  We ought to at least be tied for #1 at it.  We're not.  I find that insulting.<br />
<br />
The past several times I've gotten groups a paladin with less AC and HPs tanked because he could lock aggro and I couldn't.  And the bard was better suited to pulling than I was for that area so basically I was a gimp rogue.<br />
<br />
And while we're on the subject of pulling, any player who's experienced at pulling can do at least as good a job at it with any other class.  In most cases they could do a superior job compared to a warrior all else being equal.  The only advantage a warrior has when pulling is when it's not possible to pull the mobs back without taking a massive amount of damage.  In that scenario it might be hard for other classes to survive the pull.  Very few xp groups involve that scenario.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isnt this thread about how being a &quot;tank&quot; is about Mitigation + agro control + HP's + DPS etc.  We are not the #1 tank with a taunting issue, we are #1 in HPs and damage mitigation.  To be the #1 tank you need to excell in all of the above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taunting/aggro and damage taking ability are both core to the entire concept of tanks and tanking. There is, after all, absolutely no point to being a guy with foot thick armour and a million hitpoints, if the other guy can't be bothered to try and hit you.<br />

False.<br />
<br />
Show me a paladin or SK that can routinely tank Xegony, or Rallos Zek, or any of the PoTime Gods.  <br />
<br />
Yeah you may do it once or twice with sheer luck (a ranger tanked AoW back in Velius for like 2 mins straight!) but you won't have near probability of success as if you had a warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm judging by your Magelo that your guild isn't in the Elemental planes yet.  I could see a paladin tanking Agnarr or Bertox (which, judging by magelo, seems to be your level (Not a bash, just an observation)).  But in the End Game(TM), the hybrids just won't cut it.  Boss DPS in Ele planes and time increases over their teir two counterparts dramaticaly.</div></div><hr />

We transition only on deaths.  We tank through without discs until its up again.  Because transitions are fucking stupid and can cause needless deaths and wipeouts if not done correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, so Looking at the sheer mathematics...<br />
<br />
 IF, and I do mean IF you have 1500 more hps than a paladin, and you have 10,000 hps, and CH's do only 7500 hps of healing... <br />
<br />
Lets not go into the fact that If CH's actually LAND for 7500+ HP's your healers are doing something wrong here...<br />
<br />
And you say that you can tank thru no discipline....<br />
<br />
There is no way a paladin cannot do the exact same. If the CH rotation is 2 seconds then they need to speed it up to 1.8 seconds?... <br />
<br />
not that much difference...<br />
<br />
Of course, you use the TOP 0.00000001% of the game as your reasoning why warriors are needed to tank, when this discussion is about warriors at all levels of PoP and Experince groups in particular. <br />
<br />
So unless you are in a PoTime guild as a warrior you should just suck it up?  This is the standard Uber-Guild mentality that is preventing SoE from seriously looking at our situation.</div></div><hr />

Being skillful- or having skill at playing your character is having knowledge whilst executing that knowledge.<br />

<br />
It was stated in this thread already (I think, or another one), but I'll restate.  Any cleric that is keeping up a 10k tank on raids has enough AA that their CH's rarely do just 7500.  Most of my CH's are in the 8k range.<br />
<br />
You'd be surprised how much 1500-2000 hp will make a difference.  <br />
<br />
Coupled with that, paladins also don't get Stalwart Endurance, which if your tanking a mob that bashes like a motherfucker, is a godsend.<br />
<br />
Casting while tanking a mob thats kicking the ever living tar out of you at 1k+ a pop every half a second isn't as easy as it sounds.  And warrior weapon procs are &gt; Paladin procs, regardless of what it is.<br />
<br />
So, go tell your guild to throw a paladin or SK at whatever uber mobs you'll be doing this week.  Then come back and tell me how it goes. k?<br />
<br />
There is no way a paladin cannot do the exact same. If the CH rotation is 2 seconds then they need to speed it up to 1.8 seconds?... <br />
<br />
Lowering the CH delay causes two problems.  First, mana.  Your clerics will get lower faster in a faster chain. Second, the faster your cast CH, the more clerics you have to have.<br />
<br />
Also, unless your cleric heavy (we're not) a fast chain means that druids and shamans (which we also have few of) are the only assist healers available.<br />
<br />
Which means fights like Xegony would be intricantly harder if all your clerics would be in the chain trying to keep up a tank with only 8k hp as opposed to 10k.</div></div><hr />
