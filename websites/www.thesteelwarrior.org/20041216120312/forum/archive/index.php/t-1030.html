Some classes are unbeatable in PvP and warrior is one of the worst classes for PvP cause of no utility.<br />

You ever try dueling a decent SK? If he has anywhere near the gear and level you got you are history no matter what you do. I was dueling a friend of mine a while back before pop it didnt even come close and that without using HT. Now he told me he can do 7k HT...</div></div><hr />

They WILL find you, they WILL gang you, and they WILL make you stand there and take it.  Then come the tells like &quot;pwned joo, noob&quot; and &quot;u suxxor&quot;.  I swear, after 1 month on Vallon Zek, my ignore list was full... :mad:</div></div><hr />

However, as I was standing there rooted, plinking him with 1 dmg arrow shots, I was thinking, &quot;If I was a ranger this guy would be toast&quot;.  I kinda want to play a high-level ranger just to kick ass in the arena.</div></div><hr />

Next you'll be skipping thru the trees hugging bushes and loving on fairies! <br />
<br />
Dont take it personal man but any warrior that works at it can beat any other class you just have to raise your resists insanley, and know how to play your class. Mush luff though these are just the opinions of a Paladin/Ranger hater!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea yea so what's the difference?  I dunno, I guess I wish I had an alt ranger that was level 65 with 50 AA points :).<br />
<br />
Also, Shikarii is actually a druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont see warrior winning against mage either at least at my lvl the fucking pet will own you while you are trying to run around and catch mage and if you stop to kill pet a couple of nukes and you can say buh bye or  welcome to new pet. Plus nasty dmg shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*edit*I have won duels against a equal warrior SK and Mage i 'am telling you it is in your resists and gear...... I 'am not saying everytime but it can be done!</div></div><hr />

*goes back to her therapy session*<br />
<br />
Now tell me the urge to hug trees does it stem from a lack of breast feeding when you were a baby?<br />
<br />
And what is with all that $#%@# singing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming that you're both unbuffed or self-buffed, I think you would have a pretty good shot against a mage.  They have crap for hitpoints and the DS won't hurt you too bad if you're using a 2-hander.  <br />
<br />
A ranger though...they run faster than you, and if they stick snare on you, it last 14 minutes if you can't pumice it off.  Ensnare is also a 35 mana spell with a 1.75s casting time, so it's pretty easy to try it 10 or 15 times if they really want to get you snared.  On top of that, they can do damage from half a mile away and never run out of arrows.  It's like dueling a wizard with instant-cast nukes that never runs out of mana.  <br />
<br />
If you can regularly kill AM3/EQ rangers in a big open area you're a better PVPer than I am.  Course that's not saying much hehe.</div></div><hr />

I think it is all in the person playing the class and most rangers are stoopid. *nods* <br />
*runs off to eat chocolate*<br />
<br />
*edit* Wrong Wood Elf warriors don't give a fink about trees! We want chocolate beer and nakkid drunken boxing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno last time I tryed to duel mage mind you that was ages ago when I was like lvl 55. We both had jboots dueling in freeport he just was doing circles around the arena I was getting &quot;too far away&quot; &quot;cant hit target&quot; messages all while pet was cicking my ass as soon as I turn to try to kill pet he nukes me. I can imagine now this beeing worse with new AA pets those lil fuckers do a lot of dmg. I parsed them as same dps as me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha wtf brutul i see wurmy and chitin shell shield..OMG high elf paladin with a wood elf illusion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if it's been fixed or if it was only Bazaar Arena, but last year a friend was over my house and showed me something completely sick...<br />
<br />
As a L65 ranger with AM3 and EQ he was running around the outside of the arena shooting his oppenent:<br />
<br />
a) Without LoS<br />
b) Without facing him<br />
c) Without autoturning to face him when shooting.<br />
<br />
So basically he just had SoE up running at full speed shooting behind him...<br />
<br />
Needless to say most opponents didn't do well...</div></div><hr />
