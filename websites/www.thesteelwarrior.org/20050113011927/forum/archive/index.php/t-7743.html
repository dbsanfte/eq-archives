<br />
Did this encounter last night trying to kill the bosses.  We always got one of them to 3% and then riposte would run out and heals wouldn't be enough to keep me up.<br />
<br />
The best strategy we came up and the only thing that worked to any sort of degree was kill all the ghosts, zone out, go back in and target da warrior, warrior runs in gets both aggrod and positioned,  calls assist for everyone else to run in and hits riposte disc.  Kill one of them before they both kill you.  Once one is dead it is cake just easily kill the next one before he resses his buddy.   I had 11.7k hp's with the buffs I had but its insanely hard tanking both of them after riposte disc wears off using stonewall and chain casting holy light.  It would have been trivial most likely with a 2nd healer but we didn't have that convenience.<br />
<br />
They also have 2 ae's one is an unresistable 750dd and -100 stamina debuff and the other is unresistable -150 hp per tick for 20 minutes.  They both also cast some sort of 1500 dd so be prepared to be hit for 3750 every so often.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any info on this trial so just wanted to post some up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">had you got two pure melee in your group when you tried ? if yes, then let the other one agro, position them, and call for assist. and when his disc fades hit ae taunt and then furious. thus your group will get benefice of two successive 'furious like' disc, which should give him the lacking dps and more important the lacking time (you save them before getting stonewalled istead of running out at the end).<br />
<br />
note :<br />
War : Furious discipline , lvl 56, increase chance to riposte by 10000%<br />
Mnk : Whirlwind discipline , lvl 53, increase chance to riposte by 10000%<br />
Rog : Counterattack discipline , lvl 53 , increase chance to riposte by 10000%<br />
Ber : Reckless discipline , lvl 56 , increase chance to riposte by 10000%</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does the stonewall change affect ikkinz2 as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malkar</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No stonewall wasn't affected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slow? Are the 2 Priests slowable now? I thought only DD was made slowable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I did trial-2 with 2 x warr, 2 x cleric, 1 x rogue and 1 x bard (thats me!). Let rogue finish off the last ghost while 1 warr + 1 cleric team up and pretarget. Let bard pump up most possible DS (about 110) and then rogue kills last ghost. Autoriposte on both warrs and Rogue disc on 1 st Priest to kill it quickly, then you have 2 clerics available on the last priest. Also, pop out to KT for a DS buff from mage/dr00d and dont forget Kilvas and clicky DS.<br />
<br />
200++ DS on 2 unslowable mobs that quad is peak 1600 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i'd presume the mobs you need to kill in trial2 other than the priests are slowable, no?  For the final fight, no, but leading into it, I would say a slower is worth having (and to me, that's chanter/shaman/bst/bard, so you count as a slower!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The priests are indeed slowable now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biggpudge</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The two priests can be slowed  now. Stonewall/defensive is not affected by the nerf.  My group passed this with war, sk, rogue, chanter, 2x clerics.  Both dots can be cured by several cast of RGC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually there is way to tank only one high priest<br />
try to find it out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooooh...I want to try this...<br />
<br />
FD monk pulled out to the front of the room, wait for split?<br />
<br />
That would make this encounter MUCH easier (not that we need it, but would make it so I don't need to bring two healers), spill it!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malkar</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't tried again since I posted but everytime I entered the room and got aggro on either of them the other one automatically summoned me so not sure how you'd get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, they don't summon now. At least to me</div></div><hr />

<br />
nah .. dont put yourself into an envy tower<br />
as I said, you can only tank 1 high priest which does not mean you need a monk to split it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't have to tank the Priest that does not summon, though I thought they made both summon a while ago.<br />
<br />
Anyway that trial is actually pretty straightforward.  You have to tank both at some point, though doing stuff like switching riposte discs etc can minimize the time you need more healing.  If you can kill one, you should be able to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried this tonight... and damn did it suck.  The first time we were being lazy and got some respawn while on the bosses.  The second time the mob had 100life and it wasn't going down -- fail, although it was single.  Our group consisted of war wizx2 clericx2 and druid.  With this group make up.. is it even possible to win?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can win with that group, warrior just needs to be able to tank both, and burn one down really fast.<br />
<br />
Priests go to 100% if you leash them too much.  Just blur or camp until they reset, they'll be back to 11%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menia</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Priests get to 100% if you leash them too fast, we always used 1 Warrior (me) for that trial, and I never tanked both at the same time.<br />
<br />
Just make sure there's no LoS line between the priests while you keep one occupied and kill the other. After killing, med up a bit while occupying the other priest, position and let him have 2 or 3 ticks of &quot;downtime&quot;, after which he'll be back between 11 and 13%. Slaughter, loot, party. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not the first time I've heard of only tanking one at a time...<br />
<br />
how is this done?  We tried it with War, Clr, Shm, Mnk, Enc, Nec and our dps was horrible, but I bet had we only gotten one at a time we could have won easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there is one that dosen't summon, you can just have one guy keep on aggro it outside of leashing range by casting random high aggro spells on it indefinitely.  I thought both priests are supposed to summon but it's been a long time since I last did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our best idea to tank one at a time was to put the clerics outside just beyond the leash point, that way they'd pick up aggro from heals and it'd chase them.  This was a really good idea in theory but it didn't seem to work.<br />
<br />
I suppose if you can get it out of the LoS of the other after one has been leashed...  I can see how to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinterdir</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">did not see either of the 2 summon on Saturday...<br />
<br />
did it with Clr, Dru, Shm, War (me), Brd and Mnk, 2nd came in for a visit when we rushed in but soon went for the healers and since we moved out of LoS did not come back after he leashed.<br />
<br />
be carefull when medding up between fights though, twice he agroed when our shm sat down after first priest died. takes a few trial and error runs but it's not to hard to figure imho.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw timer is a bit funky, 1 time we had well over 5 minutes till the other one got rezzed, twice he was back up after not more than 30 seconds</div></div><hr />
