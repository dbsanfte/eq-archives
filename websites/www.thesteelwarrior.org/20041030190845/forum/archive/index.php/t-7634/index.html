<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Marduka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally i wouldnt pay that much.<br />

1492 LDON points and think of a +40 hp aug :)<br />
<br />
On the other hand the Ornate BP has a neat click effect which can be usefull when u have no shaman in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pends if you're rolling in plat,LDON points,or DKP hehe.More fun if you can get it to drop for ya though,I still wear mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A 1 groupable named in BoT drops up to 2 of them fairly often.  Get a few friends together for a favor.  I wouldnt pay that much for it, not because it isnt worth that much, but because it can be gotten fairly easily.<br />
<br />
IMO i would save the buyable ldon gear points for things like bracers as they are some of the hardest slots to upgrade before and even after you hit the EP's.  If youre rolling in points, though, i agree that the tak BP is very nice.<br />
<br />
300hp/30ac/30MR clicky buff is nothing to scoff at ... especially when there is no shaman around.<br />
<br />
i personally use the clicky buff over bstlord kragg buff (100 less hps) because of the nice lil ac/mr boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont wear mine anymore but I still carry it around  to this very day. There are times when you cant always afford the luxury of a shaman in group and one isnt nearby to toss out buffs and the bp will help offset that lack of Focus nicely. Its been more than worth the price I paid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well some of it might depend on what is available to you. I got mine for 80K, I guess there was a sale that day but at this moment if I did not have it I would pay 150K for it yes. The clicky is REALLY good if you normally do not play with a shaman which for me I never do unless on a raid. I have a normal group of personal friends and one is a chanter so we never have a shaman. Just like you can aug the LDON with 40 HP so can you the ornate one. It is trade off of 6AC for 15HP. But the clicky is really good. And it depends what else you can get to. I am not in a big raiding guild and we random so if I get a raid drop it is by luck. I have only one raid item at all at this time at least that I use and the rest I got on my own or bought. So it depends on what you can get and if you use shamans or not. For me 150K is worth it.<br />
<br />
Now I have a question. The guy you refer to Apolyon I would assume is Eindride Icestorm in the Tower? is he one groupable really? I want that sword to replace my CHSD and if he really is one groupable I would like to try that. Is there a strat for a one group to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, the rumour is Eindride is one groupable by mere mortals. I'm planning to hit him this weekend if at all possible, so I'll give you the report. See previous discussion at http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7395 and theres a detailed thread about bot bosses in the library.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just looked at your magelo. If I can do it in any way shape or form, you can own it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Kizrak BP may not be the absolute best BP on the face of Norrath, but the clicky is virtually unbeatable.  In fact, I used the clicky just the other day while I did a Vxed mission.  We had no shaman, so I used the buff on the BP instead.  <br />
<br />
Until OoW comes out and another BP is introduced with a stronger click buff of the same line, this BP will always be a keeper in every warrior's inventory.</div></div><hr />
