<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widjit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
     This is my first post here.  I just found the site.  Everything I have read so far has been great.  I am curious tho, on my weapons.  I know low delay in the main hand and ratio in the off hand is the way to go.  So I would appreciate any advice I can get on my weapons, what to look for in upgrades and the sorts.  I'm in a small non-raiding guild so we cant take down many high end mobs.  I am on the FV server, so there is the no no-drop rule, which means if needed I can buy alot of the higher end items.<br />
<br />
What I'm using so far is this combo:<br />
<br />
Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Slashing  Atk Delay: 16<br />
DMG: 12  AC: 15<br />
Magic DMG: 1<br />
STA: +10  SV MAGIC: +20  <br />
WT:  0.1    Size: TINY<br />
Class: WAR RNG BRD ROG <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Augmented with:<br />
Warm Emerald Shard<br />
Recommended level of 30.<br />
Effect: Heated Blade (Combat)<br />
Which is a 50 DD proc<br />
<br />
I chose this one for the super fast dly.<br />
<br />
In my off hand is :<br />
The Horn of Hsagra<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: Piercing  Atk Delay: 20<br />
DMG: 13  AC: 35<br />
STA: +10  HP: +75  ENDUR: +25  SV COLD: +25  <br />
WT:  0.1    Size: TINY<br />
Class: WAR RNG SHD ROG <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
I chose this one partialy for the dmg/dly and partialy for the high AC.<br />
<br />
Is this combo good for a warrior?  Or should I not worry as much about the dly and look for an agro weapon for the primary, and better ratioo for the secondary?  Any help, suggestions would be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try to find an aggro weapon at least for your primary and then put your whip in secondary until you find a second aggro weapon.<br />
all the aggro weapons have an innate proc so check that it will fire at your lvl otherwise it's either a waste or your future one (ie you have to bank it 'till you get the proc).<br />
at your lvl you won't proc often so your primary weapon is not that bad untill you get a true aggro weapon. remember that DoT is shit for aggro, heal/DD and liftap are weak aggro. so look for slow/debuff/stun.<br />
some are smithed (honed blade of ykesha (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9784) : no requiered lvl) and so are good for low lvl players.<br />
<br />
the best aggro combo between lvl 56 and 65 is the droga one : CHoS (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62186) / SotB (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62188)<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
EDIT : seeing your magelo, I think you are very overpowerfull for your lvl except for your weapons so go for the best that can proc at your lvl and the ornate glove (cliky its da best) try to bump up your dex and you will be overthetop for your lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Widjit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Awsome, thank you for the ewply.  I am a major twinky.  On the FV server, you can only have one toon, so I rerolled my 65 necro, sold his stuff and twinked out a warrior.  I'll start looking for an agro weapon asap. Again, thank you for the reply!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am a major twinky. <br />
<br />
easy to see.<br />
<br />
but the surprise is that you are on the FV server. thus look for a Bloodfrenzy  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28855) it's available to lvl 51+, it's a very rare drop from Ssraeshza Temple and is the second best 1Her aggro weapon for warrior. if you ever see one buy it no matter the cost, unless you plan to farm Ssraeshza Temple. from the same zonne you have another excelent aggro weapon that is unmatched befor PoP drop which is Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7822) which have a req lvl of 55.<br />
<br />
they both have an increased chance to proc making them awsome for early aggro in a fight.<br />
<br />
their are only uneasy to obtain usually but maybe with some luck ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Widjit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is the Blade of Carnage a decent weapon to get for agro?  Does it have the increased proc rate as the BF or Exiled?  I have a chance to get one, but was wondering if I should hold out for the BF... Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bloodfrenzy is overkill at 47.  Go for the Blade of Carnage.<br />
<br />
Buy yourself a (much) better breastplate to use whenever you are not soloing, as the Fungus Tunic is total garbage.  And I'd toss out that belt; it has no hit points, and you have haste on your earring anyway, and there are better belts that still have good AC.  At 51 you can use the Rubicite Girdle, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">though talking about his belt and earring really has nothing to do with the original topic of this thread, keep the belt and throw away the earring. 35ac is so much better than 3ac/25hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yep you wont miss the 1% haste you lose from the earring, but you will love the 80+ hp you can stick there.</div></div><hr />
