<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A group of Altera Vita guildmates and myself just completed a 21.5 hour exp grind to ding us all level 70.  So i thought i'd post and share some data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect.<br />
<br />
First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle.  All mobs were level 68.  The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded to the nearest :05).  We killed 1255 mobs.  That averages to 0.3195% reg exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute.<br />
<br />
here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level.<br />
<br />
67 - 261<br />
68 - 291<br />
69 - 332<br />
70 - 371<br />
<br />
Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as compared to 5%/mob at 65.<br />
<br />
I hope this information proves useful and informative to those heading out this week to grind it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gratz dude! Thats some serious grindage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KermeyKhazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My impression so far is if your not EP flagged or Capable of handling Hard LDoN/EP type fights then dinging 70 isnt a good option at all as u will gain less AA exp and the grind with BoT mobs will take ages. Fortunately PoE isnt too terribly bad exp .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So with a little rough math it looks like 66 is roughly equivalent to 11 AA, and 69 is around 15.  66-70 is roughly equal to grinding 50AA.  Not too bad, but that's a hell of a long grind hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so you earn less aa exp at the higher levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Corpsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think maybe you get less experience because you dont get the bonus of mobs being white/yellow/red to you, but instead are all blue.  Not positive, but that is how I understood it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, you get a bonus for killing mobs that are higher level than you.  Once you level past the mobs that bonus goes away.  When the mobs are more than 5 levels below you, you lose another bonus.  Would be interesting (once they wake up hehe) for those guys to go grind a few AA in fire and compare how long it takes per AA compared to the time at 65.  You lose some exp bonus (10-20%)  but should be able to kill faster at 70 than they did at 65.  It sounds like it should be a good AA camp at 70 still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This reraises an interesting question on level &gt; AA.<br />
<br />
If you dont have access to EP and GoD 66+ rapes your ass and OoW either doesnt have enough high mobs or they arent accessible given your equipment then this could be a shift to the above paradigm. Especially as it relates to key AA such as warrior related defensive AAs<br />

Yeah, like when PoP was new... if you went straight to 65, you had very few places to fight that were L60+ mobs if you didn't have flags to higher tiers of PoP.  Now it's not a matter of flags but rather of gear, mainly on the tank.  You are definitely severely limiting the grind areas that will still be good exp for you if you don't have the raid flags.  You'll have to judge where you and your friends hunt and how that will work for you against the fact that L70 will be a significant power upgrade, especially with skills going up past 250 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mistersparkle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">awesome data. thanks man</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You played EQ for over 20 hours straight?!  Seek help.  Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am curious to know if there were any legitimate warriors to ding 70 before me or not.  I've had more than a handful of people ask me, but i can't honestly say either way.  Anyone know anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There was a warrior in the group that dinged to 70 in PoFire on AB as well.<br />
Rogue dinged around 18:00 CET, Warrior at ~19:00 CET i think, the entire group was 70 by 20:00 CET. You will have to do the timezone calculation yourself since I dunno what timezone you are in :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zannuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">is there a new title at 70 or is it still Overlord?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read here http://www.rpgexpert.com/3041.html that it would be Vanquisher.  <br />
<br />
I would prefer Overlord because it sounds like you are at the top of the food chain.  Vanquisher sounds like you are a peon that overlords order around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zannuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree, sounds lame... I still think Warlord was the best title</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Levels &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all else.  It's boring, but grinding out the levels first/quickly makes everything else aside from AA xp grinding soooo much easier... and anywhere you can grind to 70 is probably already a very good AAxp camp anyway.  Only about half way thru 68 here, but hoping to ding 70 by this weekend or early next week...<br />
<br />
Observation: xp in the proving grounds seems close to that in pof castle 2, perhaps a bit less due to increased mob level/difficulty + length of pulls/spawn rate/mob density.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Paladins are now [70 Lord]<br />
<br />
I was the first level 70 on BB, but it took me 28 hours.  2 others from my guild followed shortly after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>tah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks info.  Was searching for a better place to xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again that depends on where you hunt.  If say you're hunting all L60-64 mobs at L70, you're going to get about half the AA per kill that you did at 65.  Your kill rate at 70 isn't going to be anyways near double what it was at 65, so you'll take a major exp cut.  You have to move to areas with mainly L65+ mobs.</div></div><hr />
