The unknown and (##) numbers vary of course.  At least I think they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">#193 is a melee attack, the middle number denotes the damage base.<br />
<br />
For a (100/10/0) its a hit with a 10 damage weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where do you learn things like that?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage seems pretty obvious.  Make a L 25 character on test, and do a few backswings and flurries, you'll notice they look a hell of alot like 5 and 10 damage weapon swings.  You don't need no dev help to figure it out, trust me.<br />
<br />
I haven't done enough head bashes yet to figure out what the 2nd number means.  Possibly &quot;damage bonus*10&quot; (ie, 75 means a damage bonus of 7.5) as a wacky groundless theory.<br />
<br />
The one head bash damage I do remember was 30, which matches up with the damage-peak of a 15 damage weapon with no damage bonus, and makes the &quot;damage bonus&quot; interpritation less likely.<br />
<br />
The type of damage you do (ie, crush/slash/bash) is determined by the &quot;skill type&quot; of the &quot;spell&quot;.  So, flurry is crush, backswing is slash (for now).  Ideally they would be tied to your weapon.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wished they had tied it more to the weapon in your hand, but I can't figure out a way to do that and stay balanced.</div></div><hr />

Why start now?</div></div><hr />
