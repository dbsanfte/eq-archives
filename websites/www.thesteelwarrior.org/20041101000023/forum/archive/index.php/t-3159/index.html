<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tebasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">AT lvl 50 what should a warrors ac be at? My ac is currently 855, but I've been told that is realy low, for my lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your Gear is about 10x better than mine was when I was 50...I'd say you are doing pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think when I first hit 50 I had about that...and I have found that I liked having level * 20 as a min target AC. Then again life at 51 gets better because your defense skill starts climbing again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, i think with my indo at 50 i was a *little* higher in AC than that.<br />
<br />
besides; you level more that same armour pieces that ain't at max stats will get better.<br />
<br />
keep going. you're doing damn good :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had mostly crafted then, with a few pieces of indicolite (which never fell for me in many hate raids =/), and I was probably about 835ish AC at that level. By today's bazaar twink standards I guess that's low, but for someone actually earning more or less level appropriate gear, you're in the normal range I would say.</div></div><hr />
