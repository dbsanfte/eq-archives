<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm to the point that most of the things my guild is currently capable of killing do not present much upgrade opportunity for me, and I'm really starting to get frustrated with it. I have good friends in the guild and things are picking up in the raid department but I do not forsee VT in say, less than another 3-5 months. I stay pretty broke, as I have very limited play time (thus negating LDoN as a viable upgrade route for the most part) and I'm looking for ways to upgrade my current kit without having to blow much cash. <br />
<br />
I realize the folly this post must represent to most of you raiders/baz campers, and I know there are heaps of very nice attunable gear available atm, but again I have little/no cash (a few k, tops at any given time). <br />
<br />
I'm looking for any upgrades (20+hp, 10+ac or more) that I can farm with a group of similarly geared friends.  I don't mind long boring camps, I don't mind quests either.<br />
<br />
A few things I'm currently planning on include Golem Heart Ring (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22185) to replace the Djarns ring (-10hp +10ac +15sta +20str), and  Regal Band of the Bathezid (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12316)  to replace the other valorium ring. <br />
<br />
Beyond that, I have a friend looking out for a Mace of Memories and an ornate bp for me, but thats about it.<br />
<br />
My current hp/ac goals are 7k+ unbuffed and 1500ac.  If anyone has any quests or reasonable farming spots they'd like to share with me, I'd really appriciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's gonna take you a shitton of faction work.  Need to get ally with the Di'Zok, so unless you've already done that, I'd skip the regal band.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already been grinding the faction for some time and i'm not too far away from finishing it so its not an issue. the faction grind would take less time than finding the cash for a steel ring of earthen resiliance (sp?) so sadly despite the &quot;shitton&quot; of faction involved its about the best thing i can put on my finger atm.<br />
<br />
I've also been thinking about attempting to 1 group the gnome escort event in CT for an iron cog earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Such antiquated ways of altering your faction.  Try killing Korucust's guards in Chardok B *hint*. ;)<br />
<br />
The biggest beef I have with most of the new quests IS THAT THEY'RE ALL INVOLVED IN TRADESKILLING!  I freakin' hate tradeskilling.  What ever happened to the simple old fashion way of camping something and turning it in?  I actually enjoyed doing the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest because it took me to places I'd normally never go.  Katta is quite a cool city. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im thinking WoS and then Ruined City are gonna get you the most bang for your buck. Good attunable stuff that you can group for while collecting pieces for Omens quest armor (Armsmaster's).  Focused Flame neck from WoS trash would be cool. The nimble back from WoS is ok. 11/120 (Muramite Officers Ring) questable ring from RC. Bygone Butchers Cleaver is a possibility for ya.<br />
<br />
As more of those start to come your way, then things like easier camps in MPG will open up. Give ya a nice ear and a 10ac aug from Blindhunter. Mazrunner Ring and Mazerunner Mask off trash there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't mind questing, this quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1582) will provide you with an item you'll be using for a very very long time to come. Also, if you are just on for a little bit or sitting around looking for a group, you can head to Natimbi and camp the +20hp aug that drops there off of Tumia Leho. She isn't a very rare spawn, and you should be able to solo it decently enough. I've camped it for about 5 hours with my main and so far that has yielded me 4 augs (you can have up to 10) and a Shell Inlaid Collar that I sold for 45k. Not a bad camp I'd say. If you have low-mid 50's people you can bring them along to let 'em soak XP as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tumia Lehio is a meanie to solo; I tried her a few times with around 9k/1800 buffed, and would have got owned had i not trained to the wayfarer's camp and gotten help. I did however log on my shaman bot and got around 5 20hp augs in a few days.<br />
<br />
BHR/Odi camp in MPG is good for 20ac and 65hp aug, but you might need to make other improvements with gear before you can tank there effectively. But oow in general is probably the best spot to look for uprades as mentioned above, you can farm nameds in various zones while bumping up your dranik loyalists faction for quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd also suggest skipping VT as part of your guild's progression to avoid the time sink of the keys. It sounds like your guild could benefit more using that time to exp and gear up during non-raid times. Others will disagree about how much value VT has, but it has certainly been proven you can progress through PoP and GoD without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of suggestions:<br />
<br />
GOD trials:  Stonemite Carapace Mask (sp)  13 ac/ 90hp ?<br />
                 100 hp ring (in my magelo, aug on it from there too)<br />
                Possible 100 hp haste belt<br />
                Burnished Antique Greaves 40 ac/ 110 hps?<br />
                30 hp augs<br />
                Rare face off trash in vxed or tipt (forget)<br />
                Plate bracer 40ish ac/ 135 hps (in my magelo) tipt Jihru mob<br />
<br />
BOT Towers:  Einride Kizrak BP, 63 ac/ 115 hps ?<br />
                             GBOS   85 hps and aggro getter<br />
<br />
Walls of Slaughter:  Nice neck from trash mobs rare though 14ish ac/ 100 hp?<br />
                           100ish hp ring, Terror Chain (real common drop)<br />
<br />
I doubt Einride would be one groupable for you yet (unless you had multiple enchanters but it appears your guild can kill tower mobs and xanamech so he is an easy mob.<br />
<br />
As far as GOD trials, the loot doesnt exactly fall like rain but you said you were ok with long camps and the exp there is very good so it serves three purposes when you add progression as well as exp and loot.<br />
<br />
Getting groups in Walls is fairly easy as it has nice drops for the level of mobs you are fighting and something for everyone.<br />
<br />
On a final note, I would skip Regal Band as you will look at the 2 ac on it and cringe later :)  Personallly I would concentrate on GOD and Walls.<br />
<br />
