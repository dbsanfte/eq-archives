In reality, we'd have about 1000-1800hp more than knights pretty much since a lot of gear is usable by all, and a lot of gear is sought after by all.  We have an inherent near 1khp advantage with Sturd 5 and our sta conversion (taken down to about 650ish for paladins with AotC).</div></div><hr />

Actually, 5k IS 25% of 20k, or if you're going the other direction, 20k is 133% of 15k.  Not at all sure where you're getting 12.5% from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep thats the only way to make the babies happy, give them 100% warrior abilities AND a spellbook. Bottom $, Knights are SECONDARY tanks! You can't tank high DI mobs, give up the spellbook and then you can suffer all the other crap Warriors have to put up with and then you can tank high DI mobs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I don't think that my sorry ass could add much that hasn't already been said, other than to point out, first hand, what I, as an SK expect and have experienced for 4+ years now.<br />
<br />
First, I am a tank.  Any warrior that thinks i get picked for a group because of my &quot;utility&quot; is sadly mistaken.  My utility is always 2nd in value.  My ability to pull is rarely needed, and when it is, there are 4-5 other classes that can do it as well or better (LDoN anyone?)<br />
<br />
I do have good burst DPS, but it's only useful for one fight per hour.  I can provide some mana to my casters, but that is not what wins me a spot in a group.  What wins an SK a spot in a group is his/her ability to tank...to hold aggro and take damage reasonably well.  Period.  The same is pretty much true for Pallies, all LDoN-normal laugh encounters aside.<br />
<br />
When you are talking about RAID encounters, I have no desire whatsoever to be an MT with my SK.  It's not my job.  It's not my aspiration.  I want my warrior brethern to perform that role.  I'm pissed enough that rangers, monks, rogues, and even bards, for the love of God, can tank better than me on a raid boss, but that is another issue.  Warriors have their rightful place on raid encounters.<br />
<br />
But, despite all the claims to the contrary, 1-group trials are NOT raid encounters.  The may unlock raid content, but they are still 1-group encounters.  And to succeed at a 1-group encounter of the kind we are seeing in GoD, you have to pick a damn fine group.  And when the top knights on the top servers (NOT my gimp server) are complaining about the same damn thing, I find reason to worry.  I do NOT have the gear yet to be tanking Trials 7-9.  I am fine with that.  But my gear is on par with almost every warrior in my guild...slightly below some, slightly above many.<br />
<br />
When it comes to single groups, you have this problem.  No matter how much you like to point out the &quot;utility&quot; I and other knights bring to the group, that is NOT why we are invited.  If a warrior is tanking, knights are generally only invited because they are a) friends or b) nobody else can be found to fill that utility role that is better....i.e. spot healing, pulling, or whatever.  When you only have 6 spots, and you have a trial as hard as the Ikkinz trials, you simply can't afford to choose a gimp utility class to fill that role unless you are giving them a mercy spot (in order to advance your guild), they are your friend (really just a variant of a mercy spot), or you simply can't find anyone else.  Necros are better backup rezzers.  Druids, and even shammies, are better backup healers, with the other utility they can provide.  Bards, monks, rangers, druids, clerics, enchanters...blah blah are better pullers.<br />
<br />
I have not imagined that I am not being invited to Ikkinz trials.  I have not imagined that every damn knight in my guild is not being invited to these trials.  When I got my Tipt flag, it was a mercy flag.  I was invited because a group member had gone LD, and I MIGHT could corpse summon them if they showed back up later - they didn't and I reaped the benefit of a flag.  Pretty much every knight in my guild received their Tipt flag as a &quot;mercy flag&quot;.  They were invited to join along with a ringer group that was there for the sole purpose of getting our guild past the trial.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be in a mercy group.  I remember how warriors felt being invited under the same circumstances early on in the PoJ trials.  I really felt terrible for them.  Even when we'd take a warrior, the knight would tank everything until the Executioner.  I remember distinctly having this conversation with my warrior friends that were better geared than me....Joe, I know you have 2k HP on me, but I'm gonna be tanking the trash because I can hold aggro and your sucky ass can't.  It sucks, but it's the only way we can win these trials.<br />
<br />
We've done a 180 here now.  I hate it.  I don't want to tank every mob in the game, but content that was designed for 1 group I think I should be able to tank given the appropriate gear.  Yes, I should farm PoTime before I can rightfully tank a lot of stuff in GoD.  I have no problem with that.  But my PoTime geared SK buddes over at shadowknight.org are saying they can't even tank this crap without relying on a shit-load of healing and even more luck.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I hate the idea of a defensive-type discipline.  I am equally sickened by the idea of making the content EASIER.  I like it hard.  I loved doing LDoN hard missions even when I could barely handle them.  I actually like the fact that SOE put in some progression content that doesn't require 72 buffons running around like idiots pretending that they're doing something l33t and important.<br />
<br />
However, there is such a thing as taking things too far in the other direction.  Sure, 1-group trials SOUNDS COOL, but when you effectively render 98% of the other two single-group tank classes almost completely usless on those 1-group trials, something is seriously wrong.  And let me make myself clear.  In single-group encounters, knights are NOT add-tanks.  We are MTs.  Warriors and knights should both be equally-viable tanks in single-group encounters.  Period!   And here is why...<br />
<br />
On a raid encounter, everyone has a job.  The encounter is large enough that everyone can play a role.  Paladins can be effective spot-healers, and God knows they rez alot on the zerg-fests we call raids sometimes.  Knights make great off-tanks on raids.  And we are completely and totally happy with that role.  Our utility on raids has been great ever since the Luclin.  We have very few complaints.  (FYI, SKs do NOT want a raid MGB buff version of AoH, so quit telling us we do!)<br />
<br />
But on single-group encounters, we are not good enough at our &quot;utility&quot; roles to justify filling up a precious spot.  Especially when the group makeups are so severely restricted in GoD.  It's not like LDoN normal runs, where you can have a ranger be your primary healer.  Even warriors need spot healers in GoD.  You have, at minimum, 4 spots on these trials that are completely taken by specific classes.  You have a warrior MT, at least one cleric main healer, a spot healer, and a slower.  There are precious few classes that can fill the role of spot healer and slower.<br />
<br />
As an example of just how our gimp utility becomes in such a harsh environment, consider the fact that bards and beastlords can very effectively act as primary slowers in pre-GoD single-group encounters (LDoN hard/normal, PoP, etc.)  But how often do your special ringer groups bring a bard or beastlord for a slower?  They don't!  Because the difference between 50% or 65% slows and 75% slows on mobs that do 1000 DPS is HUGE!  Therefore, a bard that normally has utility value as a slower pre-GoD, has almost ZERO utility value as a slower in GoD.<br />
<br />
I am convinced that the real problem is not warrior mitigation, defensive, or any of this.  The REAL problem is that these stupid ass trials should not be tuned towards 1-group.  They should be retuned for 2 or even 3 groups.  This would allow knights to then perform what is basically a raid role, but in a smaller setting.  And I'll bet my life that the vast majority of us will be quite happy with that role.  No defensive needed.  No gimpifying the trials.  In fact, the trials would be harder, because they would be tuned for 2 groups.<br />
<br />
With two groups, you could have a knight or two along as an offtank, and benefit from their other utility value.  With two groups, you could really open a can of whoopass by requiring the 12 people to control several mobs at once.  An enchanter would still be required, but a bard could perform reasonably as a backup mezzer/slower.<br />
<br />
The problem is that they used the wrong damn model for GoD trials.  They used PoJ trials, which were tuned to be easily handled with lots of easily attainable gear and levels.  What they SHOULD have used as their model was.....drum roll....the hedge maze event in PoN.  In this event, you have 3 groups max that have to control multiple mobs along the way, with a final &quot;big&quot; boss at the end.  That big boss was not originally knight-tankable, at least not without overgearing.  Defensive warriors were badly wanted by the vast majority of guilds to tank that final boss.   But knights could very effectively offtank the rest of the way.  And I do not remember hearing any protesting by reasonable-minded knights about how we should have been able to tank the final boss.  Sure, even I can tank him now, through overgearing, but at the time I was trying to get flagged for PoNb, I could not have realistically done it, and I had no problem with that.<br />
<br />
So, fix the issue by retuning these trials for at least 2 groups.  No reason to make it a huge zerg-fest.  12 people still keeps things interesting and requires a lot of teamwork.<br />
<br />
Problem solved!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree, make the trials at least 12 person (24-32 would be better). But most of all, I am sickened by watching the other classes tank also! Change Knights and Warrior DI further and have either the mobs hit harder or refund the points for AA's that other classes should never of had in the first place! The tanking AA's given to non-Tank classes are the problem with EQ now. The ONLY choice for even an LDoN to fill the tank spot should be a Warrior/Paladin/Shadow Knight heck we should be a nice #2 spot as well! The &quot;lfg&quot; list is constantly filled with tanks and/or Dr00ds. We all knew from the beginning Dr00ds were not an end game class. Besides they CAN solo very effectively even at 65th level. Of course one will whine here about it, I will have my friend log her Dr00d on and kite 12 mobs just to shut them up!<br />
The hedge model is a GREAT idea, I BTW, did tank the final &quot;Boss&quot; mob, he isn't very tough. Initially we failed the Hedge trials because the Enchanters decided sitting while the mobs spawned was something they were going to do come hell or high water! But that is another story about sorry azz players, who can't follow simple instructions, given to them multiple times, that STILL made level 60-65 because they game has been &quot;dumbed&quot; down to far. (and for those wanting to claim that it isn't the Enchanters fault, we replaced JUST the two Enchanters, I was placed as MA with inferior gear to the previous MA (he had to go), and one Paladin replaced me as SA, and succeeded EASILY).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure you do, Mr. Warrior/Enchanter.  I'm sure you love having a total lock on your role in these groups.  Bard mezz isn't sufficient for much of GoD.  Shamans can slow, but with slow mitigation in so many zones, you slow just as well, AND you can mezz like no other.  I'm sure everything is just peachy-king for you and your class.  I don't see enchanters and warriors in my guild complaining that they can't get a group in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The thing ppl forget always is that knights have a knight's spell book... not  a necromancer's or a cleric's. So shut up about it lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>laedyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I play a paladin and before all you warriors get upset - I don't want defensive - I see defensive as being a class defining ability for wars. <br />
<br />
I think the best solution is to allow 2 groups for these encounters. The Hedge event is a good model.<br />
<br />
Failing doing something like that I think it's easy enough to retune the mobs to make them stunable. Stuns mitigate incoming damage the same way defensive done - the mechanics are different but the outcome is in some ways similar with overall mitiagtion advantage in the favor of the war. If the existing stuns don't work it's easy enough to drop a new stun tuned just for just this purpose in one of the GoD zones. That way you don't throw anything else already in the game out of balance.<br />
<br />
The same thing could be done by tuning the encounter using other things in a paladin's spell book - for example add a proc to the mob and reduce the melee output. Make it resistable via a tuned /new sanctification discipline or counterable with a group heal. You could also make them rootable so you can back off when needed, but make the duration that root holds short enough that there's plenty of risk, and opportunity for the paladin to patch heal.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying there's one right way to tune the encounter, but I am saying it needs tuning, and tuning it is achievable without giving paladins a defensive discipline and dramatically increasing their tanking ability elsewhere in the game - the more feedback SoE gets from disgruntled players, perhaps the sooner they will get around to it. <br />
<br />
Right now there's plenty of angry paladins over on the paladins of norrath boards, but I don't have my fingers crossed - looks like they are spending time on mage and rogue fixes atm...<br />
<br />
Either way - the encounters need work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The problem with fixing it by making it stunnable is that it only makes things easier for one of the knight classes.  Shadowknights are still left out in the cold, as they don't have anything along those lines.  To the best of my knowledge, every single spell they have works just fine on these mobs - and you can see how much good that's done for them.</div></div><hr />

Plain and simple, if you are a knight tanking trails you need to look at new strats, not to SoE to make changes to accomidate for a lack of imagination.<br />
<br />
The trials are made for EP (in the least) level players.  Other players aren't meant to pass them.  Warriors and Knights alike will not win with 8k HPs, it's a pipedream.  Any warrior or knight farming time for the last 6 months can tank the trials in KT though, and with resonable success.  It boils down to strats though, which means the thinking caps have to come out.  <br />
<br />
If you have a knight for a tank the rest of the group has to be perfect.  A warrior as a tank makes it easier to squeeze in just about any class in the 6th spot and you have a better shot of nothing going south.  As it should be.  GoD has gone a long way to remind everyone who is supposed to be tanking, but it didn't raise the bar so high that we are all left in the cold.</div></div><hr />

A lot of hot air and nothing else to keep the status that you are the only choice for tanking in GoD. If you think this is okay then keep it that way.

<br />
Swapping chars isn't a strat.  The Pixxt has been tanked with 2 clerics and a cle/dru combo both by SI Paladins.  It is completely possible, but I'm not saying it isn't a pain in the ass.  It is also 100% strat based success, we don't walk on water.<br />
<br />
We also have 4 or 5 knights that have tanked all the way through 9, including myself, with no warriors in group.  Trust me, there are strats.  These aren't typical encounters and you can't use normal pull/heal/nuke strats.  <br />
<br />
You will die.<br />
<br />
Arbosch - It isn't that simple.  Fast heals mean nothing if not timed correctly.  Do yourself a favor if you are tanking these and turn your /log on.  After wiping alt-tab to the log and look at the spacing the heals were landing on you at.  If you lose I would put 2pp up that the heals landed too close together which leaves a huge gap with nothing but the Pixxt beating on you.</div></div><hr />

Everyone which mae GoD know the problem that you don have enoug warriors to support one every groupe. If you have one of the best 20 equiped knight you can do some of the stuff to with him. But in our guild we sit arround and wait on warriors. It is that simple. When a warrior log in, he get atleast 3 to 10 tells if he will join this and that groupe for GoD. It is simple fucked up for us and many from us play less and less. That is the effect GoD have on us. We play less because the stuff we will do is not doable without a warrior and so we simple dont log in. If you dont have this effect in your guild good for you. We have this problem and it kill our fun. If you think this isnt a problem good. We gone from 6 activ paladins to 2 activ paladins and i will quit soon to if this dont get fixed.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Its handy to wander around other class forums.  There seems to be misconceptions on how Paladins work.  There seems to be this idea that there is something in the Paladin spell set that should make them survivable in Discord.  Let me assure you there isn't much of anything in there.  If there is please point it out to us.  <br />
<br />
Let me lay it out for you:<br />
<br />
-  There are more classes and groups that need tanks than there are Warriors in many guilds.  Its simply a logicistical problem.  Its easier to find 2 Warriors, 2 Paladins, and 2 SKs than it is to find 6 Warriors.<br />
<br />
- Warriors have (nearly??) always have tanked better than Paladins or SKs or any other class in the game.  There seems to be selective memory loss on this point of fact.  You'd have to seriously mess up the game to change this.  There is no amount of equipment in the game that can duplicate 45% mitigation.  No amount of farming lower Discord or Time will ever replace Warrior.  This isn't a bad thing because if it did then your high end player would be worth double the amount of a low end player.  The gulf between high and low players would be so wide it becomes broken.  The only thing that seems to replace a Warrior is another Warrior or borderline abusing of Charm.<br />
<br />
- There is a strange problem with some Warriors equating &quot;a Paladin lived through a fight&quot; with &quot;tanking just like a Warrior&quot;.  Seem my previous point.  No one tanks like a Warrior.  Here is a small litmus test: If a Warrior can tank something undisciplined then you can throw a Paladin or an SK at it.  There are rare exceptions but in general if you don't need a Warrior special ability then you aren't tied to using a Warrior.  This does not mean that Warriors suck at tanking.  Take Time as an example.  With enough farming a Paladin can realistically tank anything the zone has to offer including Quarmata the Pinata.  But a Warrior in almost every time does it better.  A Warrior will stay alive longer, consume less heals and generally be less risky.  The sad fact is that Paladins and SKs are used to tank major fights because a Warrior is unavailable (correlary to the first point).<br />
<br />
- What is going on in Discord?  You've got a place that is so driven by the HIT HARDER philosophy that it is very crippling.  Paladin healing (along with other classes) got boosted roughly 10% although hp/mana power remained the same.  It doesn't take a statistical genious to see that Discord monsters hit more than 10% harder than POP/LDoN monsters.  The gear that is dropping for lower to mid, the places that is supposed to prepare one for later Discord events, is not dropping anything to compensate against the DPS.  If a Paladin can't tank or can't backup heal then what does a Paladin do in Discord?  In many places in Discord Paladins and SKs just frankly don't matter because they can't contribute.  Paladins and SKs have a problem tanking monsters that turn that much damage nor can Paladins really help pick up on heals because of the same damage.  Who knows what SKs should be doing.<br />
<br />
As for the fix, beats me.  I think SOE is just dumb enough to do Defensive because they were dumb enough to make Discord.  I would like for them to come up with a real challenging encounters that go beyond riddles that open a door to another HARD HITTING monster (these aren't hard to beat btw).  But whatever comes its got to work well.  Paladins and SKs have to justify their reason in being in groups beyond their charming /g conversation.</div></div><hr />

I get tired of being beaten over the head about being able to tank in Time.  If you think about it, if a Paladin can tank something that just means its easy enough for a Warrior to do without disciplines.  They carry on and on like its some gigantic tragedy when they fail to realize these things have gotten easy enough they don't need to do anything special.<br />
<br />
Warriors have pretty much across the board always tanked better.  Getting Paladins and SKs to do something interesting in Discord doesn't mean Warriors suddenly suck.  It never did and never will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN.... hmmm 4 zones, lego brick zones(hmmm, how come each sand elf place has this 3 door room with the same book shelf, 6 or 7 times each!)<br />
<br />
and the same fucking 4-5 mobs over and over again.<br />
<br />
admit it, if GoD used just the noc durlok and kvy heartpiercer models over and over again you would be left down wouldnt you? and the augments didnt lend enough custmization, want me to tell you what they coulda done to make it better?<br />
<br />
certain combo's give special effects, or with the right tradeskill parts you could combine some of the augments, that woulda been a fine and fun thing to be able to do, even if it was over balanced and didnt give anything that great.<br />
<br />
face is, SoE under estimates what content casual people need, they think 3 reused mobs and lego brick levels are good enough.<br />
<br />
if i wanted lego brick zones i could just used some shitty mods with marrowind, the same old buildings, caves and tile sets over and over again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Okay so you sit there figure out how to tank a Pixtt Annihlator with a Paladin with 2 clerics or cleric/druid while I tank a Pixtt Annihlator and never come close to dying with a cleric/druid, and you congratulate yourself on a job well done because you have impeccable healing for the whole fight while my group just hits Sylyan Light/Holy Light nonstop for 100 seconds?<br />
<br />
You think that is balanced?  You think anyone in their right mind would use a Paladin or a SK over a Warrior in this situation?  Of course War should tank better but the disparity is staggering.  Like Arbo said, Warriors get perpetually asked for groups and it is annoying, while Knights don't go anywhere.  I am tired of getting asked in the middle of doing just about anything to tank even stuff like Flesh Hunters (which Knights tank better than we do) because everyone wants a Warrior in their group.  <br />
<br />
Yes Knights can tank almost anything besides Pixtt Annihlator or Kyv Heartsilverer in trials, but people don't have a pet Warrior to swap in for just those mobs.  Further given none of the fights in the trial lasts over 3 minutes and are typically DPS oriented, it gives very little incentive to use any other tank class.<br />
<br />
And SK burst damage?  Pixtt Annihlator was down to 85% before I even took damage thanks to Furious.  Show me a SK that can do 15% damage to a Pixtt Annihlator before even taking damage.  We didn't even mess around with anything fancy like monk Whirlwind and then AE taunt switch or anything like that.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between tanking and tanking well.  Warriors really tank too well for those trials.  If your group isn't using a Warrior to tank the trials, it's either because there isn't one on at all or you're just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Or because your guild has like most high-level guilds completed the trials except for some not terribly acive members weeks ago and you are happily doing raids.<br />
<br />
The silly trials aren't even a bump in the road concidering how difficult PoP flagging was. I'm sure there'll be more to it shortly, but I don't recall two months into PoP raiding, killing mobs, and getting loot better than the best VT has to offer.<br />
<br />
I think SoE believed the trials were going to be a much more serious time sink than they were. I can understand them making Ikkinz more, not less difficult.<br />
<br />
A normal experiance group/add tank has trouble with cutting edge named high DI mobs? I'm terribly sorry they rolled a tank/priest and not The Tank. Just like I'm sorry for every Druid and Shaman that can't heal for 8k HP's and do a 96% res.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The trials seem appropriately difficult.  Certainly if you make say Pixtt Annihlator hit any harder it'd start demanding some pretty irregular groups to go through it at all (i.e. 2 clerics, possibly more) which would merely be pointless.<br />
<br />
The trials aren't so much as a timesink problem as oposed to the fact that they absolutely demand a warrior in every group, even on the ones where they're not necessary (#2, #3 past Kyv, #1 past PA).  The margin of error is just so much bigger using a Warrior that you pretty much always want a Warrior anyway.  This puts too much pressure on Warriors and leaves Knights out in the cold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Soulflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">These trials were designed around the warrior tanking, not a Paladin and not a SK. These trials are meant for the very upper end of playing, the mjority of the server will never encounter this level of play. If an SK or a Paly does successfully tank the names in 7-9 congrats and well done. <br />
<br />
To even suggest that a Paly &amp; SK get a form of a warriors defensive, do us all a favor and just delete your toon. Might as well say &quot; We can't do this w/o a Cleric to heal. Maybe we should whine and see if we can get druids CH/SL/HL or maybe Shamans since you can't win w/o a Cleric&quot;. Oh and can't do the end of Trial 7 w/o a Enchanter to lock down the 5 adds, maybe we can petition for bards to have the same line of mez'ing as enchanters since they monopolize that position on the trial.<br />
<br />
<br />
IF, a Paly and SK had a easier time tanking this, guess what you warriors would be doing........ /gu Warrior seeking trial 7-9 flags. You have NOTHING to offer a group in these trials over a Paly for BSS / spot healing / extra resing or a SK for pulling, not to mention they can still hold agro over you even if you have the best agro set up.

Just because you're incapable of seeing the advantages of /disc furious, 5% mitigation advantage while non disced, a significantly larger hitpoint pool, greater aggro over time, increased melee DPS, and greater avoidance doesnt' mean I should delete my toon.   <br />

1. With 60ish people in guild, warriors have to do these things over and over and over and over and over and over again.  It gets REALLY old.<br />

<br />
Nope, doing these trails gets old quick, esp KoD 1..<br />
<br />
Since to make it a good attempt you need ..<br />
<br />
War, cleric, cleric, chanter, dps, dps.<br />
<br />
These leaves you eventually filling the dps slots with pallies, sk's, shammies etc.<br />
<br />
When you have done these for the nth time they get kinda boring, esp after you spent the last month wiping in uqqa while they finish the next zone.<br />
<br />
We have got sooo many knights quiting over this cos there are only so many warriors who log in during the day and doing KoD trials after uqqa is not really an option, you just wanna get drunk, esp when you get a shammy and a pally for dps.<br />
<br />
Knights get defensive? feck no, tune the bloody thing so a perfect group could do it with a knight tankin, ie knight, cleric, cleric, chanter dps, dps.<br />
<br />
I shit you not when i say we have warriors not logging on cos of the constant demands to do KoD trials all the bloody time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Gerick, its pretty sad you see the game this way.  Knights are fed up because they sit around waiting for groups to form up which they can't really fit into.  Warriors are sick of running the same trials over and over again.  Yet you want to cling to this system which generates a lot of misery.  These trials are not tests.  They are beatable complete with stereo instruction checklists.  The hard part is getting Warriors interested in doing the trial again for the Nth time.  You seem to delight in the misery generated by having Knights without groups but fail to realize you are driving Warriors bonkers.<br />
<br />
Although their heart is in the right place, it isn't easy to implement a knight version and a warrior version of an single group expedition.  The most obvious problem is what happens if you bring a Warrior and a Knight.  Another problem is the weakness built into the expedition system: once you start it you can swap out players.<br />
<br />
I would rather have a healthy mix of monsters.  There is nothing wrong a monster that screams &quot;a Warrior should be tanking this&quot; as long as there are monsters out there that scream &quot;a Paladin should be tanking this&quot; in other places.  This is where SOE went wrong.  Warriors are now carrying almost all of the burden in Discord.  If Paladins and SKs can shoulder some of the burden at different parts it makes for a healthier game and keep Warriors sane.  Somedays you want to just veg out in Earth but getting constant requests from guildies for help is enough to make you not log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Why not just make an easier version that requires turning in artifact of Transcendence, Righteousness, Glorification, and say a 5K vendor sold item to the trial NPCs?  There's no way a guild that cannot beat the trials at all can leapfrog to raids this way (and if an uberguild will let you tag along to loot the artifacts they could easily just get 1-2 guys from your guild through the trials anyway).  The trials will be an easier version that drops no loot, and you only get one shot like any other trial.  If you fail it's another 3 artifacts + 5K to try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">pretty sure lockouts are a set +Xhours/minutes from when you kill certain mobs in trials (first named and boss) its definatly not from when you enter, but anywayats thats mostly semantics its about 8 hours for first named and about 1 day if you win trial</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Lockout is from where you enter, because I've seen very different lockout times after even killing say the Pixtt Annihlator.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell it's 8 hours from when you enter for the first loot dropping mob, and then 24 hours when you win, minus what time you took to beat them.  So if it took you 3 hours to beat the first loot dropping mob, it'd be 5 hour lockout time.</div></div><hr />

Get the fuck over it, you don't get to tank everything in the damn game.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you have to actually Pay for that spell book you have. <br />
<br />
So warriors have to do the trials over and over again to get their guildmates through. Waaaaahhhhh...ow my pussy hurts.<br />
<br />
What's the problem here? You joined a guild...they outfit you...now get off your ass and help out. You think the Clerics like having to do the same damn trials over and over again to get everyone else through? Time to put in some time and pay your dues bud...warriors are a working class, not some friggin primadonna dress wearing class that shows up when it feels like it and AFK's half the time. We work for a living. You want to not be needed all the time, play a friggin mage or something.<br />
<br />
Suck it up and strap it on...<br />
<br />
And any knight who thinks they should get ANY form of defensive whatsoever can fucking hang.<br />
<br />
peace,<br />
Aielman<br />

LOL thats the best summarization of the whole situation ive read yet. :)<br />
<br />
And im still waiting for someone to explain to me how requiring a Warrior for something  is any different than requiring a Cleric?.</div></div><hr />

In an agressive guild you will standardly have twice as many Clerics than Warriors.  You only really need a handful of tanks to run raids pre-Discord but even non-tanking groups need healers.  No one seems to wait on CC because enough other classes are sufficient.  Most guilds are flush with Clerics.  Everyone seems to be waiting on Warriors.  Warriors are the main cog in the Discord flagging machine.  I hope you like to spin around and around in circles.<br />
<br />
Once again, I love that some Warriors are too eager to utilize &quot;The Woe Is Me&quot; Defense.  &quot;I suffered in POP so now it is your turn to squirm.&quot;  Excellent balancing strategy.  I could care less about Defensive.  What I do care about is getting it through some of your skewed view of the game how bad these problems in Discord are.  We don't ever have to agree to the fix but my god, at least acknolwedge the issue.  If you don't see it by now you either haven't seen it and are in denial or really want to see classes suffer.<br />
<br />
I've been very lukewarm to Defensive because it is just enabling SOE to be lazy about monster design.  The HIT HARDER School of Design has boring monsters that are easily defeated.  The only way to make HIT HARDER monsters &quot;difficult&quot; is to boost their HP pool which places more emphisis on DPS.  So SOE makes harder hitting HIT HARDER monsters to compensate.  The spiral continues to you have the cluster you see in Discord.  Warriors can keep Defensive.  Its been the thing that has really screwed up encounters in EQ forever.  Why do I want to give this thing out to more classes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow Glatius, thats what knights are saying about warriors right now...<br />
<br />
Would be kinda nice if they would actually make it even CLOSE to equal on both sides...<br />
<br />
One thing warriors...  I do not know a self-respecting knight who wants what they have proposed... <br />
I am talking about the whole nerfing the mob if there is no warrior... so basically EVERYONE in the party gets a mini-defensive... don't they realize they will BOX a knight in and use another class (berserker/ranger/rogue/monk) to tank it? (one that has a real tanking discipline)<br />
<br />
At least we have ONE thing to agree on. (that their solution sucks)<br />
<br />
Can we stop fighting now and focus debate on solutions and less on warrior jealousy over a spellbook that ISNT DOING ANYTHING IN RAIDS.<br />
(hate to say I told ya so, but I warned you LONG ago that this was going to happen and that we should get warriors and knights to align behind a solution that was hammered out with people that actually PLAY this game and parse.<br />
<br />
<br />
IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE DEFENSIVE<br />
-It can be a knight-only discipline that actually reduces/heals/reflects/etc damage based on mob damage output.<br />
-it can utilize a shield<br />
-It could be a spell (must be tagged uninterruptable though)<br />
-it can be an AA.<br />
-It could be a spell/discipline that uses Mana for HP for a certain percentage.<br />
-the Shadowknight and paladin &quot;tanking abilities can be different.<br />
-part of it COULD be shared with warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
All that needs to happen is that properly equipped knights become raid capable tanks or at LEAST not nearly as squishy in a raid environment...  (GoD trials and beyond have ADDS that hit for 1900... and thus even the best equipped knights are little tougher than casters and their platemail is little better than cloth... )<br />
<br />
In XP groups, things are pretty peachy...  All (or at least this one) knights want is some level of balance in raids... Most knights do NOT want the primary role of tanking the main mob unless its necessary (all warriors dead) or we out-rank the encounter.<br />
<br />
I know...  I know...  expecting the mob mentality here to even think about real balance is a pipe dream...  If the knights had only half the HP, did half the damage of warriors, and could do ANYTHING half as well as warriors; most warriors here would still declare knights as &quot;overpowered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Screw those people...  I'm looking for the people who CAN manage to put two brain cells together.<br />
<br />
What would YOU do to allow the knights to tank those 1900 quad hitters?<br />

<br />
Right, so basically all that needs to happen is that Knights can step into the Warrior raid role leaving Warriors standing around picking their ass.  I gotcha.  That's what Knights have been bitching and moaning about for 4 years, how they want to be raid MTs right along side the Warriors.  Oh, they don't want to do it as well, no Sir.  They're willing to leave the Warrior a tiny smidge of an advantage at it, so insignificant that it makes nearly no difference, so they can at least &quot;claim&quot; that Warriors are the better tank.  But for pratical purposes there should be no significant difference.<br />
<br />
So what else are you guys going to set your sights on once you have defensive?  Looking to jack beserk next too?  Because all those crappy little spells you have in your spell book are meaningless, so Knights should be identical in every significant way to Warriors and retain their crappy little spellbooks and the use of their mana, right?<br />
<br />
But what happens when SoE decides to do anything to that crappy little spellbook?  What happens when it suddenly becomes more valuable because they make some changes to the spells or add new ones?  What do Warriors get at that point, since Knights will have received defensive?  Shouldn't Warriors get something to balance things out if and when Knights get better spells?  Or will that spellbook still be crap regardless of what they do to it?<br />
<br />
Sounds like Knights, rather than going out and demanding that SoE fix their spellbook so it adds enough value, want their cake and to eat it too.  Once they've established the precedent of receiving defensive, they can argue that defensive will need to be whatever value gets them by.  25% doesn't work?  Make it 30%  30% isn't quite enough?  Make it 35% then.  Oh and by the way, fix our spells too while you're at it biatch!  And go in the kitchen and get me some pie!   I can hear them already.<br />
<br />
They &quot;claim&quot; it's about equality.  They &quot;claim&quot; it's about being given the tools to do their job.  They &quot;claim&quot; that it's because their spells are worthless, meaningless, and don't do crap in a GoD environment.  But once they have defensive and things are supposedly &quot;equal&quot;, they can never receive another change to spells for the rest of the game without Warriors getting changes at least as significant and what the hell will they give Warriors?  <br />
<br />
And tell me honestly, those of you who actually play Warriors.  How many of you will continue to play your Warrior once you realize that when you raid that the Knight standing next to you is higher in the MT rotation than you are and you don't even have the utility of his crappy little spellbook as you stand around doing mediocre DPS?  Think about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell me, Brik. You're a SK. What do you call a spell that adds to everyone in the group's atk, increasing their DPS, which makes the mob die faster? How could that possibly be &quot;not doing anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
How about a spell that adds 12% to a warrior's aggro, which allows the other raiders to increase their DPS without pulling aggro, which makes the mob dead quicker, and which dimishes the risk of a mob running over to someone else and smacking them instead of staying in position? How could that possibly be &quot;not doing anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Or how about your spell which returns health AND MANA to the entire group, which increases their ability to cast THEIR spells? I'd hardly consider that to be &quot;ISNT DOING ANYTHING IN RAIDS!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm constantly seeing this extreme overexaggeration and outright lies of the &quot;uselessness&quot; of your spellbook, all so that knights can get a free upgrade. It's ridiculous. I swear to god Knights have the biggest case of penis envy I've ever seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Taragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Glatius:<br />
<br />
Right, so basically all that needs to happen is that Knights can step into the Warrior raid role leaving Warriors standing around picking their ass.<br />
<br />
Haven't we had this discussion before?<br />
<br />
Let's try it a different way. Do warriors currently at all levels of play (meaning from the casual no guild to Uqua level guilds) die on raids? While MT'ing? The answer is yes.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at this<br />
<br />
warrior<br />
<br />
- Furious 12sec immunity<br />
- 45% defensive<br />
- -1 DI (5% dmg mitigation)<br />
- Higher AC<br />
- Higher HP<br />
<br />
This is the warrior arsenal and advantage over a knight currently. As stated above, with all these skills warriors every day die on raids. <br />
<br />
VS<br />
<br />
Knight<br />
<br />
- 25% defensive (Hypothetical #)<br />
<br />
Ok. So here we are with the knight arsenal vs the same mobs that kill warriors every day in raids. Tell me, HOW pray tell does a knight survive the encounter better than a warrior? Remember, for a knight to REPLACE the warrior there has to be a VALID reason (saying there's no warriors present is NOT a valid reason). <br />
<br />
Warriors would still<br />
<br />
- Have 12 secs of immunity which btw gives them that time to increase aggro, something a knight can't do since we need immediate healing. And no. 1 stun will not equal incite and you whacking at him for 12secs.<br />
- Have 25% more dmg mitigation (20% from defensive + 5% inate mitigation)<br />
- Have more AC/HP <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, do NOT come back with arguments like <br />
<br />
- Well a knight in full PoTime gear could outtank a warrior in a lesser gear vs AoW etc etc etc. That has absolutely no BEARING on the game. Since players don't downgrade their guilds JUST to take over a new role.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I ask you again, HOW does the knight become the prefered MT in the raid role? What POSSIBLE reason is there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Once you answer the above we can have a discussion of the implications in a group setting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taragor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Knight<br />
<br />
- 25% defensive (Hypothetical #)<br />
<br />
1.  You assume that 25% will be all that's necessary.  Yet if a Warrior, as you claim, has 12 seconds of immunity with furious, 20% more mitigation and more AC/HP is struggling, on what do you base your contention that with 25% Knights will suddenly be more successful?  And if with 25% they just go splat a little slower, what happens then?  Oh gosh, 25% isn't working.  Do I hear 30%?  Do I hear 35% Do I hear 40%?  Do I hear 45%?  Exactly when does it stop?  How successful using defensive do Knights have to be before it's enough?  And who makes that call?  You can easily make the arguement that Knights need more of a defensive percentage to make up for their &quot;inadequate&quot; tanking in other ways.<br />
<br />
2.  Once upon a time the Knight spell book was supposed to make up the majority of difference in tanking between Warriors and Knights.  Just one expansion ago, it did.  Suddenly it doesn't.  Now Knights have decided that rather than either having the mobs adjusted so that they can use that spell book to counter balance the tanking difference, as has always been the case in the past, or having the spells updated to deal with the new expansion, instead they need to gank the Warrior class' major defining ability?  Where exactly is it written that makes any sense?<br />
<br />
3.  Who said that Knights should be as capable of tanking anything in the game a Warrior can tank?  Where is it written that Knights should have a reasonable chance to tank any raid calibre mob in the game?  Why is it that Warriors can't be left their one small sliver of real raid contribution without Knights getting up on their hind legs about it?  And don't give me this crap about how Knights don't have a raid role and their spells are worthless and meaningless.  That's pure crap.  If the spells aren't adequate anymore, get changes to the spells! <br />
<br />
4.  And why with every expansion they release, does SoE have to make the common mobs hit harder and harder?  There is a big big difference between having challenging content and suddenly having to use an ability all the time which was intended to be utilized in unusual circumstances.  It is not good game design to require the use of defensive on a regular and common basis.  It shows lack of creative thought processes.  No other expansion has required that defensive be fired off every time it popped.  So why must this one?  And why, when people suggest that it makes no sense to have defensive as a requirement in a large chunk of an expansion, do Knights start whining about &quot;kiddie&quot; content?  Is every mob in the game that doesn't require defensive now &quot;kiddie&quot; content?  Have Knights been fighting nothing but &quot;kiddie&quot; content for four years?  And if they have, why should that change just because Knights have their hearts set on ganking an exclusive ability of Warriors?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Brik is biased towards Knights, any suggestion to supposedly &quot;balance&quot; shit is a flat out lie! He wants to play &quot;god&quot; mode and screw warriors out of raids AND groups! Take all the spells away from Brik NOW, make him a warrior, thats what he seems to want. No more FD, no more giving mana to your group, no more increasing aggro. You lose it ALL brik you greedy lying little shit.<br />
BTW, Brik is hated on the SK board too. Don't take his word as representing SKs at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've argued with Brik many MANY times. On some really innane topics too. And I have to say, that nothing he's posted or said has ever really demonstrated he wants to play in god-mode or that he actually wants to screw warriors out of &quot;raids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Groups, maybe. I've argued with him on that point a lot. But not on raids. And he doesn't want SKs to be gods. If he did, he'd be arguing shit on the concert hall, asking for bard abilities. Not mucking around with warriors.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how Knights are worse than Warriors on yard trash beyond the expected difference.  <br />
<br />
As for the stuff where discs are considered necessary... I don't know, you could have mini-discs, but it will invariably have to vastly reduce your aggro or casting abilities (you can't get things for free in this game).  But then if Knight casting/aggro is limited while in *disc* mode that seems like it'd just make Knights weak warriors, so what's the point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're looking at this the wrong way. Were knights requesting to tank equally % wise to warriors on the content 25% wouldn't be enough. The only way to achieve the same % would be to have all your tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
THIS is the crux Glatius. Kngihts SHOULDN'T have the same survival % as warriors. But *not the same* and *not at all* are 2 sides of a coin.<br />
<br />
You worry that a knight with 25% defensive will take over your role within the game. Which is a VERY valid concern in the sense that you don't want to be useless. You play the game because you enjoy playing it. Sitting around LFG all day is not appealing.<br />
<br />
You're asking what if 25% defensive isn't enough. Tell me. If 25% in whatever form isn't enough, how can you say that there's no issues in the game right now since we don't even have 1%? See where I'm going with this?<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Once upon a time the Knight spell book was supposed to make up the majority of difference in tanking between Warriors and Knights.  Just one expansion ago, it did.  Suddenly it doesn't.

Where exactly is it written that makes any sense?<br />
<br />
Once upon a time (2 expansions ago) warrior survivability compensated for their lower aggro capacity vs knights. Suddenly it didn't. Why? Because groups could afford waiting 5secs to let warriors get aggro control before doing anything (healing/slowing). In PoP this was not possible, the dmg output of mobs is too high to allow a tank to stand toe to toe for 5secs without a slow or heal.<br />
<br />
In every expansion knights were able to group tank effectively and offtank effectively upon the release of the expansion. We weren't tanking full raid mobs because that's the domain of warriors. Once the content had been beaten repeatedly by the same guild, classes surpassed the power of the content and what classes were unable to do before became possible. (Non warriors tanking full raid mobs). The issue with GoD is that knights are incapable of doing their role from the start (offtank). Saying now that knights will have to wait until content has been beaten repeatedly to the point of it being trivial before they can do their main role is unacceptable. Not only that, but there's no gear in the game that would even allow for that to occur at this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.  Who said that Knights should be as capable of tanking anything in the game a Warrior can tank?  Where is it written that Knights should have a reasonable chance to tank any raid calibre mob in the game?

And don't give me this crap about how Knights don't have a raid role and their spells are worthless and meaningless.  That's pure crap.  If the spells aren't adequate anymore, get changes to the spells!<br />
<br />
We're not talking about tanking full raid mobs are we. We're talking about the whole expansion. Knights are not capable of tanking adds in uqua for instance. Is this acceptable? To BB it is. Why? Because said adds are high DI mobs and thus only a warrior should tank them. That's flawed thinking. They're adds, not the main mob. Also, you're again saying we want to tank equal to a warrior. That's not the case. We want a % of survivability. <br />
<br />
<br />
4.  And why with every expansion they release, does SoE have to make the common mobs hit harder and harder?

And if they have, why should that change just because Knights have their hearts set on ganking an exclusive ability of Warriors?<br />
<br />
I'm not SOE. I can't answer you why they always do bigger and harder. If I were to take a guess I'd have to point to your defensive disc. Remember, defensive scales, This means that as a warrior acquires gear his hp/ac grow, combine that with defensive and you now need a mob that has to hit x amount for it to be a challange. Lowering the melee DPS of the mob and having half the damage for instance from procs would lead to warriors getting squished in seconds and content being unpassable since you have 0 defense vs magic. So how would you go about having a mob that *needs* to do 10k damage per melee round do it in such a way that a warrior could survive the encounter if not through pure hit DPS? And if a warrior can survive without really needing to mitigate alot of damage using defensive, wouldn't we conclude that a knight would be just as capable since there's not a huge hp/ac difference?<br />
<br />
No not all mobs tankable by knights kiddie content. But there's no content in the game that needs to be toned down at this time for a knight to tank it is there.<br />
<br />
Listen Glatius, I know you're not anti-knight. I know you want to keep your class within it's role, and I know you understand that knights want to be just as wanted. (Not speaking tanking term here, I'm talking overall).<br />
<br />
So what needs to be done is warriors and knights have to come to an agreement as to what roles both sides should have and to what extent. It also has to be done with the knowledge of what the game holds right now and the power of both sides within its realm. The most important part when stating these roles though is the removal of the bigoted attitudes (which both sides share) and pure logical reasoning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">You worry that a knight with 25% defensive will take over your role within the game. Which is a VERY valid concern in the sense that you don't want to be useless. You play the game because you enjoy playing it. Sitting around LFG all day is not appealing.<br />
<br />
You're asking what if 25% defensive isn't enough. Tell me. If 25% in whatever form isn't enough, how can you say that there's no issues in the game right now since we don't even have 1%? See where I'm going with this?<br />
<br />
I don't have 1% of any kind of heal.  I don't have 1% of any kind of buff.  I don't have 1% of root.  I don't have 1% of LoH.  Yet I don't think anything is wrong with the game currently because the mobs aren't commonly designed that I must have these things.  The problem is NOT that Knights don't have defensive.  The problem is that too many mobs in GoD are designed to require defensive.  You don't need defensive.  You've never needed it before.  The only difference between this expansion and previous expansions is that SoE has made mobs hit SO hard that defensive is a real asset through a big chunk of the expansion. <br />
<br />
And you can NOT, with a straight face while you're attempting to justify Knights being given defensive at all to begin with, claim that once the precedent is set that they have it that they won't whine bitch and cry that they need as much as is required to be as successful at they think they should be.  Once defensive is the criteria upon which Knights judge their ability to tank, you bet your ass they're going to work on getting as much of it as possible.  Guaranteed.  It's already happening in fact.  And you know it.<br />
<br />
Saying now that knights will have to wait until content has been beaten repeatedly to the point of it being trivial before they can do their main role is unacceptable. Not only that, but there's no gear in the game that would even allow for that to occur at this point.<br />
<br />
So your basic arguement is this, many mobs require defensive to be successful.  This is ridiculous.  Therefore give Knights defensive.  Yet my arguement would be this.  Many mobs require defensive to be successful.  This is ridiculous.  Therefore change the mobs.  Once that's done you can go back to doing your job exactly the way you always have, end of story.  And you won't have had to jack a Warrior ability to do it.  Pretty simple huh? Oh, but SoE won't want to be bothered to do that you claim?  But they're more likely to want to make more work for themselves by factoring in Knight defensive along with Warrior defensive for every encouter they ever design from now until the game shuts down?  Uh huh, right.  Sorry, no sale.<br />
<br />
We're not talking about tanking full raid mobs are we. We're talking about the whole expansion. Knights are not capable of tanking adds in uqua for instance. Is this acceptable? To BB it is. Why? Because said adds are high DI mobs and thus only a warrior should tank them. That's flawed thinking. They're adds, not the main mob. Also, you're again saying we want to tank equal to a warrior. That's not the case. We want a % of survivability.<br />
<br />
But we ARE talking about tanking full raid mobs.  Once you have defensive, it doesn't suddenly stop working because you've joined a raid, now does it?  If you can survive against the one group named mobs and the more common loot dropping named mobs, it's not much of a stretch to survive against the &quot;full raid mobs&quot;.  So while you can &quot;claim&quot; that it won't be used to allow Knights to tank full raid mobs, we both know that isn't true.  People will use it that way.  Particularly if they see advantages in doing so. <br />
<br />
See what we're talking about isn't just giving Knights a &quot;measure of survivability&quot;.  What we're talking about is giving Knights a &quot;measure of survivability&quot; in a certain very specific way.  One which will have extreme repercussions throught out the game.  One which could open the door to making Warriors obsolete.  Yet you attempt to play on our sense of fair play in order to garner our blessing on potentially signing our own death certificate as a class.  You don't know what will happen once SoE opens that door and hands out defensive.  I can't be certain what will happen either.  But I can be certain that the game has been played for four years successfully without Knights having to have defensive, and if the mobs and encounters were designed correctly, they wouldn't need it now.  Rather than opening a door that has been closed to Knights for damn good reasons, reasons which haven't gone away, instead the content should be adjusted and Knights should stfu about kiddie content.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I am missing something here but didn't warriors become warriors becuse they really Never had the natural affinty twords magic that both palidins and Shadow Knights share, IE your spellbook, Lay on hands or anything else you can offer us would be useless to us, gotta come up with something usefull!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">You can run a raid where the end target is are a few monsters with two Warriors.  You are going to have second thoughts about running that said raid with only two Clerics.  Its a natural reflection of the environment.  Tanking doesn't stack well but healing stacks semi-decently.  The game drives guilds to recruit more healers than tanks.  BTW, this is also one of the reasons why Paladins and SKs are exactly hot commodities either.<br />
<br />
What Arbosch is saying that many Paladins would gladly embrace their spellbooks as a way to justify their existence in Discord if there was anything there worth using.  The best spell a Discord Paladin currently has in these things is Resurrection Line and Root Line.  Everything else is too weak to be effective.  Buffs no one wants except Brells which I'll gladly give out for free.  Heals is easily outstripped by spawned monsters in Discord.  Stuns that only draw agro which if you can't tank is silly to use.  Something Warriors keep saying is something like &quot;If they get Defensive then I want their spells&quot; which many will point out that Warriors will get the shaft in the deal. ^_^<br />
<br />
With a little imagination there is a way for Warriors to keep their title as the best class that can mitigate melee damage while making these trial monsters still doable by Paladins and SKs.  I really don't see a need for SOE giving Paladins and SKs any type of Defensive but I have a feeling SOE is dumb enough to do it.</div></div><hr />

Oh its not that spells suddenly stop working once you set foot into the Annihilator's room.  It is just that most of them fail to make a difference.  Please point out where the power is in the Paladin spell book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that kind of the point?  Either A) The mobs are too powerful, or B) The spells aren't powerful enough for the environment.  How will handing Paladins defensive fix the usefulness of the spells?  Answer is, it won't.  So Paladins in that environment will be struggling to function without the real effective benefit of their spells.  Which means they'll be nothing but a piss poor Warrior.  Which also means they'll be angry that they're not more effective.  Which then means they'll piss and moan about needing to be more effective.  Which means they'll campaign for more changes.  Sounds like a circular arguement to me.  Trying to fix Paladins by making them more like Warriors is just going to give Paladins more reasons to complain about not being even more like Warriors. <br />
<br />
Change the mobs or fix the spells.  Making Paladins a watered down version of Warriors in an environment that takes all the Warrior's tools to be successful is not a good recipe for success.  Paladins should be able to succeed by being Paladins, not by being diluted Warriors.</div></div><hr />

You really wanna play the nitpick game? Fine.<br />

*Be warned, this is for demontrative purposes alone. The actual VALUE of the following is minimal*<br />

I don't have 1% of any kind of heal.  I don't have 1% of any kind of buff.  I don't have 1% of root, I don't have 1% of LoH.<br />
<br />
Heal: You do through gear and with aa.<br />
Buff: You do though gear<br />
Root: You do through gear<br />
LoH: No, but I'd say popping furious is close to equivalent<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The problem is that too many mobs in GoD are designed to require defensive.  You don't need defensive.  You've never needed it before.  The only difference between this expansion and previous expansions is that SoE has made mobs hit SO hard that defensive is a real asset through a big chunk of the expansion.<br />
<br />
I've agreed with you on this point Glatius. I specifically asked you if you had suggestion on how to keep the power of the mobs the way they currently are, but making it so that defensive is NOT a 100% must.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you can NOT, with a straight face while you're attempting to justify Knights being given defensive at all to begin with, claim that once the precedent is set that they have it that they won't whine bitch and cry that they need as much as is required to be as successful at they think they should be.

So druids then are continuing to protest their lower version of CH?<br />
<br />
Watch. Assume for a minute that knights get a defensive type ability. Doesn't have to be defensive, let's assume that any of the multitude of suggestions that have been made in the past 6 weeks is used. Now, let's say that the difference in success rate goes from *hypothetical #'s since nobody has the real data* <br />
<br />
Pre change success rate:<br />
<br />
75% warrior<br />
10% knight<br />
<br />
Post change success rate:<br />
<br />

50% knight<br />
<br />
Would this be acceptable?<br />
<br />
<br />
So your basic arguement is this, many mobs require defensive to be successful.  This is ridiculous.  Therefore give Knights defensive.  Yet my arguement would be this.

Uh huh, right.  Sorry, no sale.<br />
<br />
AGAIN, I asked you for a suggestion in regards to keeping the mob power equal to what it is now, but making it knight possible. Forget defensive for a min. Just tell me how you go from a mob that needs to do x amount of pure melee damage to be a challenge to a warrior to doing that same amount where defensive doesn't play such a defining role.<br />
<br />
And no, SOE wouldn't have to retune mobs to knight defensive. Mobs are tuned to warrior defensive. What they COULD do though for future content is tune mobs to the middle of the 2. This would leave warriors with an advantage since the mobs are geared let's say to a 35% defensive and would make it more difficult for knights since they only have a 25% defensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But we ARE talking about tanking full raid mobs.  Once you have defensive, it doesn't suddenly stop working because you've joined a raid, now does it?  If you can survive against the one group named mobs and the more common loot dropping named mobs, it's not much of a stretch to survive against the &quot;full raid mobs&quot;.

Particularly if they see advantages in doing so. <br />
<br />
Dammit Glatius. Knights can already tank all of PoTime. Yet when guilds do PoTime they don't use knights, they still use warriors. Why? Because, there is NO POINT to using a lesser tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
See what we're talking about isn't just giving Knights a &quot;measure of survivability&quot;.  What we're talking about is giving Knights a &quot;measure of survivability&quot; in a certain very specific way.  One which will have extreme repercussions throught out the game.

<br />
The same can be said about CH but that's not your point.<br />
<br />
Listen. I understand your fear. This is why I said at the end of my last post that both sides need to calmly sit down and discuss rationally what they expect for each side to be doing within the game. I don't want defensive because I want to take over warrior roles as MT on raids. This has never been my intention (though I'm sure BB will pop in and say it is). I want class desireability. period. The issue about class desireability is that though I didn't choose a warrior to tank and only to tank and to be the preferred MT, I DID choose a tanking class. A TRUE tanking class. This means that I DO expect tanking in my role. Tanking doesn't mean I want to be able to tank Quarm level mobs, it means that when I'm on a raid my primary role is in the tanking form (offtank/addtank) and on single group content maintank.<br />
<br />
All of this knights had in the history of eq pre-GoD. Now we don't. Is it more fair that from GoD and potentially any expansion to come afterknights now play very little in their tanking role JUST to minimize the possible loss of SOME full raid MT'ing by warriors?<br />
<br />
It's been mentionned that high DI mobs are the sole domain of warriors. Well, until GoD there was no such thing as a high DI mob that wasn't a named full raid boss mob that was not knight tankable. So we always had our place as offtank and addtanks. NOW BB says it's OK that we can't tank splits in Uqua. It was said that the difficulty level of the content would only get worse when GoD first came out and the first outcries started. Warriors told knights to STFU because the expansion was so new. Back at the beginning knights were STILL capable of offtanking adds in the content. Then uqua opened. OOPS, look at that, not an option anymore. The warrior reply? Well, it's a high DI mob so you shouldn't be tanking it. Guilds should have 6 warriors at all raids so they can splittank and MT. What happens AFTER uqua? <br />
<br />
Again Glatius. I DO NOT want to take over MT'ing my guilds raid mobs. I REALLY REALLY don't. I DO want to continue offtanking/addtanking FULL TIME the way I do now. The only thing I'd like that pushes me to wanting a defensive type ability, is that I WOULD like to be able to last more than 2 melee rounds vs raid mobs if I step in because of a mishap to allow the ST/TT and the chc to get back on track. <br />

There are plenty of ways to design encounters to check if a six player group is Time+ or Thunder/Bazaar level that don't involve trying to destroy the tank faster than the healers can heal.

Agreed. What kind of test is it to require Cleric only quality healing, Warrior under Defensive/Stonewall only quality tanking vs. a high DI mob. SoE proved with LDoN Hard that they know Assassinate is not the only valid definition of hard, yet they do this.<br />

Contrary to popular belief, aggro is not that hard in Uqua.  The only real aggro issue is when you've 5 or 6 mobs packed in one place, invariably one (or more) of them doesn't get targetted and happily goes around slaughtering clerics and causes low HP aggro and then warriors have this misconception that they're not getting enough aggro (of course you can't pull low HP aggro off someone 10 seconds into tanking a mob).  Snap aggro doesn't help at all since the problem comes from targetting the wrong mobs.</div></div><hr />

He may not have, I can't really comment since I don't know.  But there is a significant difference between taking the position that specific class abilities shouldn't be whored out to other classes just because those classes are experiencing some difficulties in a new expansion versus attempting to itemize and catagorize what those difficulties are as you argue those abilities should be whored out to other classes, even though you yourself have never experienced the problems you're using as a foundation for your arguement.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I believe that you're arguing in good faith, you honestly believe what you're saying.  But the extreme problems you believe Paladins are facing in GoD appears to be based completely on second hand information and not something you have personally faced.  Which is fine, my information with regards to the problems Paladins are facing in GoD is also second hand information, I've never experienced them either.  But it's a much more easily defensible position to take that as a Warrior I don't believe that there are any circumstances warranting the whoring out of defensive to Paladins than trying to argue that it should be.  Particularly since I know for a fact that defensive is something members of the Paladin class have coveted for well over three expansions and any excuse to acquire it is reasonable in their eyes.  While you may not be one of those Paladins, you're certainly doing their work for them.<br />
<br />
When trying to claim that the sky is falling it is usually best to have at least been outside to see if in fact there are junks of pale light blue atmosphere hitting the ground.  And if you haven't been outside, then be prepared to face serious scepticism.  Kind of one of the fundamental facts of life.</div></div><hr />

So your arguement amounts to &quot;some friends of mine have told me it's really bad in GoD, so I think the only viable fix must be A (whatever you feel A must be, in this case apparently defensive, but I supposed it could be anything).&quot;  You've rejected as not viable, infeasible, or unacceptable a ton of other options that have been suggested that aren't your preferred fix.  All based on second hand information.  What makes you so sure you know enough about the problem to reject so many alternatives out of hand?<br />
<br />
This isn't about defensive?  Strange, it seems like every arguement you've presented has been in support of Paladins needing defensive regardless of whether or not you've had first hand experience of the situation and can speak with confidence that it's true.  How about you take off the blinders and ponder other solutions, since it's all a theoretical discussion anyway?</div></div><hr />

Hate to be mean BB but my Guild uses Paladins to tank the named in Fire all the time.  This does not mean the minis, but stuff like the Captain of Fire.  We considered this stuff single group encounters so would send in groups to farm stuff like the Spear of Fire.  Since Paladins had the most to gain from this we were the Tank many times.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Taragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">So your arguement amounts to &quot;some friends of mine have told me it's really bad in GoD, so I think the only viable fix must be A (whatever you feel A must be, in this case apparently defensive, but I supposed it could be anything).&quot;  You've rejected as not viable, infeasible, or unacceptable a ton of other options that have been suggested that aren't your preferred fix.  All based on second hand information.  What makes you so sure you know enough about the problem to reject so many alternatives out of hand?<br />
<br />
This isn't about defensive?  Strange, it seems like every arguement you've presented has been in support of Paladins needing defensive regardless of whether or not you've had first hand experience of the situation and can speak with confidence that it's true.  How about you take off the blinders and ponder other solutions, since it's all a theoretical discussion anyway?<br />

No. My point to BB was that he keeps telling me to STFU I don't know what game balance means because I'm not in Uqua. Has nothing to do with the ability of logical thinking with evidence from both sides of the fence.<br />
<br />
I haven't rejected alternatives. Except for the belief that I can mitigate a named mob using a heal or stun. That's it, that's all. <br />
<br />
Again, that SPECIFIC reply to BB had NOTHING to do with DEFENSIVE. OUR debate IE: You Glatius and I Taragor WAS about BALANCE. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BB:<br />
<br />
Yes Taragor, I've seen splits.<br />
<br />
I've got something you CAN do as an exercise. Locate a named red mob in PoP or beyond. /Con it and read the message <br />
<br />
Why? Does your msg on the same mob say. <br />
<br />
-Oh you're a warrior, let me lie down and die right now. <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
-Please oh Mr Warrior &lt;whine&gt; I BEG you &lt;sniffle&gt; do NOT kill me &lt;whine&gt; I'll give you my loot. K?<br />

<br />
No Zotha, the most retarded thing to do is take 2 sentences from 58 pages of debate and conclude you know what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
PER the level of the section you are in the balance is not there.<br />
<br />
IE: Sewers What lvl of play is it? VT? EP? Time?<br />
IE: Tipt?<br />
IE: Ikk?<br />
IE: KT?<br />
IE: Uqua?<br />
<br />
etc etc etc. It was a generalization of all the levels and the class balance for all at those specific levels.<br />
