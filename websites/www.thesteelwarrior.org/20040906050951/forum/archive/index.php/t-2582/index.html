<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I too, am also Retireing my Warrior.  My guild leader came to our Warrior's as a group, and asked if anyone would be willing play another character, seeing as we've been lacking in DPS.  So seeing as the Warrior is becomming less and less fun to play, I was the worst equipped Warrior in my guild, and I already have a 58 Beastlord, I volunteered to do this.  So from here on out, I, like Ninja will be playing a Beastlord.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone, for all you're help with my questions, and all you're other information.  I'm still gonna come back and check the boards on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jesus is retirement in fashion now?<br />
<br />
You will be missed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nobody can resist the lure of the Beastlord!  Muahahaha! :D  It's actually quite fun, especially when you need a break from other classes.  I regularly swap between my cleric and beastlord, because the cleric is frustrating and has a lot of stress, and the beastlord lets me work it out.<br />
<br />
Hey, you never know, you might be able to get ahold of equipment on your beastlord that you can use to equip your warrior, so you can play him in a pinch with friends./shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, My guild leader gave me &quot;compensation&quot; for doing this.  So far it's been Ornate Gloves, Sleeves, and a Bracer, plus some nice DKP.  So I'm really not bothered by this at all, considering I was debating switching to my Beastlord anyways just from all the shit/frusteration my Warrior gets.  So it worked out better in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This just sucks. I really wish the devs would pull their heads out of their asses and fix our class.  If I were asked to retire my warrior and play another class I'd just retire my warrior and quit altogether.  Which may happen anyway if things continue in the direction they're going now.</div></div><hr />
