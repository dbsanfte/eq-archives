About every 80 agi is equal to 1 percent more avoidance (mob misses you 1 percent more).  The AC you gain from agi is avoidance ac.</div></div><hr />

Heh, not that this is vital to warriors, but you will run faster with 305 AGI than you will with 200 AGI.<br />
<br />
But for the mitigation, i've heard about the same, 1% per 80-100 AGI.</div></div><hr />

He states that 100 agi gives you an average of 3% avoidance, under 200 agi.  Above 200 agi you get diminishing returns, so it won't be as much.  However, this is based off of PC to PC meleeing, so that may skew it a tad.<br />
<br />
So the 70agi buff from shaman would only give around 2% avoidance at max?  Is that worth a buff slot?  I mean it's great as part of Ferine Avatar as you're getting the other stats as well, but does it make Wrulan worth anything?</div></div><hr />

This is false.</div></div><hr />

If you get down to zero agility you can't move. If you then follow up with an agility buff, that puts you at positive agility you will be able to move.<br />
<br />
Also, I noticed running along my side my druid friend, that I ran just alittle bit faster than him. Which I had heard the rumor that agility affects speed, so i looked at our agility and I had about 50 agility on him. Both us were way below our stentgh in wiegth. That same druid started looting agility augs until he had more agility than I. He would then run at about the same speed I was. Human and Iksar are both medium races. So I couldn;t find anything to cause this except agility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
doesn't agi also factor in to our total endurance pool as well? i was under the impression that str, sta, dex, and agi all factored in to it. last i heard that was a while ago though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about looking at your computer speed, because AGI does not affect your base run speed.  Being encumbered does, but your base AGi does not.</div></div><hr />

Looks easy to test.<br />
Ill have to give it a shot.<br />
Ive head strong opinions from both sides.<br />
Someone has to be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somebody already tested it awhile back.  Run from Point A to Point B naked, with base AGI, then put all your gear on and do the same, you'll find you get there at the same time you did with base AGI.<br />
<br />
Understand tho, that ENCUMBERANCE is different, when you're encumbered, a movement penalty is applied relative to your agility.  There is no bonus for having a high AGI.  I used to think for a long time that my buddy's ranger ran way faster than my necro.  Turned out that I just owned a shitty PC.  Soon as I  brought the clip plane in, I kept pace just fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright so let me picture this here, warriors get a 5% base mitigation, max agility gives you 5% avoidance, soo with CS3 and CA3 any given warrior will have 15% avoidance and 15% mitigation pretty much innate?<br />
<br />
Or I could be confusing the two completely, just trying to get a picture in my mind, but personally I do think the added 2-3% avoidance is well worth working on agility.<br />
<br />
*edit: not including ID5 and LR5, just considering the lower more common aa's first*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CA/LR and CS/ID augment the AC softcap (advoiding and mitigating AC respectively) making your AC more effective in dimishing the mob domage. while the AGI increase the AC (only the avoid part) and that innate mitigation bonus is not linked to AC at all and can't be acheive by another class in stacking AC gears. so I don't understand your math.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main concern is weather or not Agility is worth it.  If from 0 to max agility gives you roughly 5% melee avoidance (if i understood right that the first 100 agi is 3% avoidance and then each 80 after that is approx 1% so at 55 255 agility gives me roughly 5% I would call it worth it (personal oppinion).<br />
<br />
My second question which you kinda answered was if this avoidance (gained with avoidance AC from agility) stacked with CA3, and along those same lines, does the warrior innate 5% mitigation stack with CS3.<br />
<br />
And if so, that means roughly, maxed agility along with CA3 and CS3 gives all warriors approx 15% avoidance and 15% mitigation.<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to understand, and was wondering if my mindset was right or if i am completely off my rocker about warrior mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Better yet.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have parses at certain levels and softcaps on ac? has anyone given these people 10k plat to drop their agility to 0 and re done the parses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still may be wrong, never bothered to do an extensive test. <br />
<br />
But it defiantely wasn't PC difference because we actually used the exact same build. Every part of the 2 PC's was the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope<br />
from the dev statment &quot;AC soft cap is achievable by a normal geared warrior when he reach the possibility to use CA&quot; but What is a normal warrior? and Which softcap? what is this softcap before and after the AA ? we don't know<br />
<br />
We know that a knight with all def AA has a softcap below 2100 but where?<br />
we know that after the softcap AC count only for its half (except shields in secondary slot) even if it's listed normally on our skills window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah this only gives me more questions.<br />
<br />
Can someone used to taking parses send me a message via inbox, i want to try a few things but I have questions before i start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still may be wrong, never bothered to do an extensive test. <br />
<br />

<br />
connection lag ...<br />
local CPU/GPU with different charge (what was running on each machine : just OS+EQ or OS+...+winamp+....+Kazza+...+EQ) ...<br />
Server CPU with different charge (was it two toon next in same zone at same moment) ...<br />
...<br />
<br />
there is many possibily. <br />
<br />
and you know, you can do all the parse you want, if one give same result then all the other with different result are poluted with something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylexis</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, but would i do it facing the mob or away from the mob, how long would I parse to negate any low or high spikes, what level should the warrior be and what level of mob should it be and where?<br />
<br />
2 hours facing a mob sitting at 1300 ac at lvl 55, then drop agility to 0 and switch out armor to keep ac at 1300 and parse again, then a 60 warrior at 1600 ac,  then have someone at 65 do the same against a mob at 2100 ac.... what should I be looking for or doing while parsing. or should you have all three levels parse at 3 different ac settings twice, once with max agi and once with no agi... sooo much to consider.</div></div><hr />
