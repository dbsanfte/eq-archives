<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerapheus</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was kicking around an idea this weekend while waiting for plenty of rezzes on spider island in Air/Wind, and wanted your opinions.<br />
<br />
Since a lot of high end warrior gear is multi-classed nowadays, and has Mana+ bonuses on it, I thought it would be nice if warriors either automatically or via an AA were able to &quot;transform&quot; that Mana+ bonus into HP.  i.e. - a 100hp/100mana item would translate to a 200hp item on a warrior only.  That way, tanks can get the same amount of an upgrade that a paladin/shadowknight could get out of the item, since they can use the mana.<br />
<br />
Now, perhaps this would be a bit overpowering for a 1mana = 1hp ratio, but even if they downgraded it to a 50% HP bonus, it would still kick ass.   i.e. - 100hp/100mana would translate to 150hp item on a warrior.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts/opinions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at a 5:1 ratio with 12 slots, thats an extra 240 assuming 100mana at every slot. if you had all raex but bp, its just a 100hp - not overpowering. good idea i think too, 2:1 ratio isnt out of line when consider most ppl are only going to get the hp from bp, neck, earrings, and face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100 mana = 10 to all resists? I'd find that usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how about giving us like a small line of &quot;taunt&quot; spells that would have to go off our item mana pool? you could get a new one every 10 lvls or so but the new one would replace the old so you would have have one spell...<br />
<br />
this could be like a HT deal, no dmg just hate,  couldnt cast when tanking nless you got really lucky with channeling :D</div></div><hr />

But looking at your magelo shows 410 mana from items :)<br />
<br />
I actually think an idea along these lines does a LOT to even out the itemization problems we're seeing (essentially, that knights gain more benefit from items that can be used by both knights and warriors).  By allowing that mana to translate into something useful for warriors (either resists or HPs... I personally think that a 2:1 conversion of the +mana into +HP would be ideal), it would make those same items now equally valuable to knights and warriors.</div></div><hr />
