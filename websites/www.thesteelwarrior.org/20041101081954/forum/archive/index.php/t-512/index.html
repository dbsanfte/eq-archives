<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im a level 47 warrior on emarr and im in a large guild, about 220 240 members. i want to go to keal to get some better armor, most people in the guild have characters around 53 to 58 and they are willing to help me do this. what i want to know is what are the best combos for 2 full groups, also none of us have done keal before we are also going to help out a ranger by getting the &quot;helm of the tracker&quot; heads.<br />
<br />
please tell me a good way to go about this ( oh, we also have a 60 cleric and 60 necro helping out)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, im doing a little bit more than that thread is saying, such as pulling the building with the giants for the helm of the tracker, and i think i have alot more people that want to help but they are of lower level than the other guy mentioned (on top of the corroded parts)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">helm of the tracker <br />
<br />
That's the ranger helmet from the heads quest I believe.  If so, then in the &quot;arena&quot; area towards the back castle standing infront of the ice wall are three giants (far north).   The middle one I believe is the one that drops the heads, he's on a longer than normal spawn time.  There not &quot;in a building&quot; though if I got my quests right.<br />
<br />
Go play in the Arena area, camp up on either left or right ramp and have fun.   Armor drops there kinda rarley and get faction for your CoV so you can hunt in ToV Halls of Testing without worrying about KOS folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would bring em all and start doing arrena once you can take 2 or 3 Protector's of zek at a time you ready. Also if ytou could get a an experienced 62 chanter you could wlak in clear way single pull guardian easily with Pacify alsoyou can single ANYTHING in the arena with Pacify. With a 62 Chanter and their spell that get a 62 that is a upgrade to pacify if i remember right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cervesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Definately go to Arena,<br />
<br />
The Ranger Helm of the tracker comes from Kalis Storm(somthing).<br />
<br />
When you enter the arena(assuming left ramp) have your monkie/SK follow the left wall and pull to the corner striaght out from the top of the ramp.<br />
<br />
Kalis is guarded by 2 PoZ's which are easilily splitable, but who you need to kill as they drop 2 of the other 3 heads you need for the quest.<br />
<br />
Kalis is basically a PoZ who hits slightly harder and faster.<br />
<br />
Just use spam heals until slowed and after that it's a cakewalk.</div></div><hr />
