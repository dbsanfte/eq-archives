<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nopain</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
  I am in need of a little gear advice as I have been using the same weaps/ armor for the past 6 levels or so.  I will be joining an EP (pushing for Time) raiding guild shortly and need to know what upgrades I should be saving my points for/ which slots I should quest or are viably groupable given my guild situation.<br />
   While the guild does VT very occasionally it has been put to me that they will be progressing past it rather soon so I shouldn't sink the time into the key.   So given that, I am looking at PoP, OoW, GoD eventually and Baz upgrades.  Money is somewhat of an issue as I don't have the 300+k for a BoC (used it all on attunable gear &lt;sigh&gt;).  <br />
  Currently i'm grinding in BoT and EF/BB LDoN's for the anger and ac augs respectively.  I am seriously looking to move away from the soulscream belt as I feel that the waist slot has many great upgrades available in the baz alone (dust walkers comes to mind)  Problem being though I will be needing some haste.. preferably 41% if i can get my paws on it. <br />
  Any input you guys can give me for items to save for/quest after/ possibly raid for please let me know =)  Hopefully these items will last me another 5-7 levels as I push towards 70 and a shitload of AA's.  Oh and btw I screwed up and made an agnostic char(although it seems to matter less now at higher levels)<br />

P.S.  should i concentrate on AA's when i hit 66 or try and push for 70?  Which is more beneficial to making me a better grouping/raiding tank?</div></div><hr />

I was thinking of getting a pair of steel earthing rings or resilience but are there a lot of equal quality rings like that dropping in EP?  I'd hopefully be grouping in PoFire and some OoW... what slots should i avoid purchasing and focus more on farming?</div></div><hr />

If you EP able...just camp the ruins in PoE and let a guild chanter make you a couple of Steel rings.</div></div><hr />

You COULD do that, or you could just fork out the 15k per ring that they're going for now that OoW is out (at least on drinal).  I still can't find a better buyable ring in bazaar, but that one that drops off of trash in MPG is driving the price down quite a bit (nice ac, 145hp or so, cleave 1).</div></div><hr />
