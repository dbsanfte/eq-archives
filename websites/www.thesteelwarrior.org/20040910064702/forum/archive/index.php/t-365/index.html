<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I'm down to the queen's ancient blade, the spiroc lord's wingblade (both of which I can get done np np) and...&lt;drum roll&gt;...the FRIKKEN GREEN SCALE!!!<br />
<br />
There are always one or two green scales for sale in the bazaar, and if the price was in the 50Kpp range I'd snatch one up, but, alas, the going rate on The Nameless these days seems to be about 200Kpp, which I find to be utterly ludicrous. There is no reason a single warrior epic piece should cost 50Kpp more than the price I've seen for a BoC.<br />
<br />
Camping Sev is not really an option since he seems to die within 12 milliseconds of spawning, usually at the hands of unknown forces that lurk behind every tree and rock in EJ (and then apparently whisk his scales away to the bazaar to sell for 200Kpp). My guild actually got lucky and killed him once, at 3:30 AM on a weeknight, but that was the one and only time, and my warrior is about 14th in line to get guild support for the epic.<br />
<br />
So, I know that Hoshkar drops the green scale as well, but that's even more screwed than Sev, when you get down to it. Now...thank-you for reading this far as I whined away, and here're my questions...finally:<br />
 I have heard some warriors say that there is a third source of green dragon scales...<br />
 ...is this true?...<br />
 ...if so, who is it that drops them (no, it's not Nortlav...all he's ever dropped for us is red scales)?<br />
Any thoughts, hints, downright spilling of details? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FarlanderB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nah, Nortlav doesn't drop the green scale, you're right.<br />
<br />
Nah, there isn't a 3rd source for it either. Severlious and Hoshkar are it. (Unless a new source has been added recently.)<br />
<br />
The quest sucks, eh? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I cant confirm or not if this wil work but,, once I got my Epics done I combined to the 2HS and got a Mage summoned Sword of Rune (the lvl 18 mage spell) and combined it alone and got my 2 1HS's, so now I have both 1HS's and 2HS at the same time (and finally banked that dam scabbard) which makes me wonder if just getting the Scabbard and combining a Sword of Rune without having the other parts would make the 1HS's :D , if you can get the scabbard have a lvl 18 mage summon you a sword and try it.. :p , maybe skip that part all together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As soon you do the first combine with the epics in the red scabbard, the scabbard turns into a different container.<br />
Mage swords only work in the new scabbard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sev and Hoshkar are it, and for a while I expected my green scales to come from Hoshkar, until my guild got lucky.  Best way to watch for Sev is a lvl 4 (I think) mage.  Just need Sense Summoned.  Camp him in EJ next to the zone, and use sense summoned often.  Sev's pet is the only possible summoned in zone.  There isn't really a way around camping it.  Having the mage on a second account that you can just look over and check occasionally is the easiest way I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ive practically given up on trying to get a green scale off killing sev and just hoping to pick one up in bazaar atm. however on emarr they are a bit more reasonable -about 40-50k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&lt;-- killed the dragon, got green scale.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It can be done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hang in there, you'll get it eventually.  I personally got mine off of Sev's still cooling dead body.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, I'll keep at it...it's just pissing me off that one of the less useful epics (not really less useful, but there's just so much stuff out there to replace it even before you get it) would have a pre-cleric-epic-fix Ragefire type of encounter.<br />
<br />
At least if the scales were no-drop we wouldn't have this kind of highway robbery. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While we're on the epic subject...lol...I'm looking to get a Spiroc Wingblade MQ on Povar.<br />
<br />
Braeorn Battlekrye<br />
Brylin Arborvitae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had that same idea, Garoar, but at the time I was paranoid enough to not try because I didn't want to do something which might mess up the whole epic process.  Besides, you need the green scale to get the scabbard anyways, so it wouldn't help you skip Sev at all.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it took me about 2 months of camping that mofo before I finally got him (got him twice actually, but it was like an hour before patch and we didn't have enough people on and we wiped on our attempt).<br />
<br />
There is no 3rd source for green scales.  I think originally Nortlav did drop red, white, and green, but that was quickly patched to just red.  I've also seen more than one person asking if they can use the Emerald Dragon Scales from Wuoshi instead of the green scale.  The answer to this is of course NO and anybody who is dumb enough to try it probably doesn't deserve their epic in the first place.<br />
<br />
I also have a nice little write up on camping Sev at http://users.easystreet.com/korb/epic/severlious.html as part of my epic site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My trials on the Green Scale:<br />
<br />
Alliance does VP. Six VP raids under my belt. First two raids Green Scales drop, higher lvl/more progress tanks get. Next four raids NO FRIGGIN SCALE!!! In between fifth and after sixth raid, differnt guild goes in - GETS TWO FRIGGIN SCALES!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I WILL GET MY SCALE ONE DAY!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got lucky with having a very good druid friend who spent her whole time online in EJ near the stairs staring at track after a patch. Servers came online around 2pm eastern and Sev popped 12 hours later. 10 mins later, dead dragon.<br />
<br />
Camping the green scale sucks. You need to have someway to track him (mage, druid, ranger) and a solid guild or group of friends who can mobilize fast. Make the camp spot the EJ succor point, people can get there fast with a druid or from the FoB PoK book. If you are on a very compettitive server, speed will be the key. <br />
<br />
Good luck to all who need him killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>amylou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well, i killed LOTS of HG's in RM to get the 27k i need to buy mine on Terris.</div></div><hr />
