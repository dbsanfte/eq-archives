<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was at 12,133hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a side note.... that UI takes up like 50% of your screen.<br />
<br />
Do you have that setup (or close ot it) on Brutall too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, tried to leave an example of UI with little success.<br />
<br />
A couple edits later.....<br />
<br />
And another to make it a link, instead of a picture... sorry 56kers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Iuse a different UI for brutall.   I change up resolutions with nobbi when in an area with some graphic lag like POtime A,  this was taken in 1024x768 so it does seem a big, but its my bot's comp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very nice heal indeed.<br />
<br />
The best heal I have received was all my HP +3 .. yes, yes, I was in the purple bar !<br />
There's about 20 HP in the purple bar, so talk about a close call. :p<br />
<br />
Was a loong time ago though, think it was in POF pre-kunark.<br />
<br />
Edit :<br />
Just fell over a purple club hit when I was on my cleric .. and yes, he survived, despite the message saying otherwise.<br />
<br />
http://home20.inet.tele.dk/sheela/pics/kelvenur.gif <br />
<br />
Was in Cazic Thule ... humm ... during Kunark era I think, hence why you see no amount of HP healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">bah gnomers go sit on a can of spray paint and fart near a open flame</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe sure if you stand directly behind me <br />
<br />
<br />
HARRRRRRR!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">damn't gerick I do not know what you did but after I read you last post I have the worse gas imaginable.  I swear I can now be classified as a weapon of mass destruction from the gas coming out of my ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Click me!<br />
<br />
<br />
note: just because you change the extension does not turn it into a jpg, that screenshot is still a BMP</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the FD spell emote, that's not a death message.<br />
<br />
Death messages are always &quot;Slain by&quot; or &quot;died.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know anything at all..... at ALL about hosting stuffs, I just made it the same file extension as the other pics on my friends server.  So yea, sorry about that. and I'll keep it in mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was only changing it to a link instead of a picture really, realized how honking huge it was. It displays whatever extension I put behind it, generally, heh.  Learn me lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My record is a heal at -1 when I was MTing a Tower Boss in BoT.  I &quot;died&quot;, got the overhead view of my corpse, then suddenly was standing again when the CH landed.<br />
<br />
I did the only reasonable thing to do at that time... TAUNT!<br />
<br />
This was also my first heal for over 7500 pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My most interesting death was in an LDoN adventure a few months ago... I went purple, Blessing of Replenishment happened to tick right then and brought me back to life, the mob bashed me for 10 or 15ish, I went purple again, then CHeal landed. I did the only thing that seemed natural at the time... <br />
Gharghael tells the group, 'OMG WTF is taht an exployt!?&quot;<br />
It was pretty neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh .. waaaaaay back in the olden days, me and a buddy was fighting in Lesser Faydark, and boy were we lost, so we were jumpy as hell and it was night and we were night blind as hell .. well, suffice to say those Large Spiders in there use weak poison .. it gets real interesting when you've been down and lying no the ground about 4-5 times. :p<br />
<br />
Then as we finally bested this nasty spider, we managed to train Orcs on ourselves and ran willy-nilly all over L Faydark until we finally manage to run into the brownie camp and died a horrible death !<br />
<br />
We were bound in Greater Faydark, so we thought nothing of it - but damn, it took a lot of deaths to get our bodies back. I think we both went back to level 5 that day.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Ah yes, the days of true newbie hood.<br />
<br />
That's the FD spell emote, that's not a death message. <br />
That's possible, though he was in purple .. and lying down. :p<br />
I think he was a warrior though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My brain almost came out of my ears the first time I tanked the ocean giants in Plane of Storms. Nobody bothered to tell me they proc a FD on you! That was confusing as all hell. At first I thought I was dead, then I thought the heal just came really late, then I thought I was lagging, then I thought it was a bug... GAH! You don't do things like that to a troll :| Surprises r teh bAD1!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i cant remember where i was tanking, But my closest call was i was tanking a mob, Clr ch fizzled or soemthing i dropped Fast, i was laying on the ground unconcious when Clr's Divine Arbritation hit, and i think arb ended up killing the mage fully =P, was pretty funy.</div></div><hr />
