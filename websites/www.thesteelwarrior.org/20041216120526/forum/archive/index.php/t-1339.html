<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaza</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I *used* to have a baby warrior but no longer, instead my play character is an enchanter.  Being one of those classes that generally lives and dies by aggro control, the differences between warrior aggro establishment and pally/sk aggro establishment are of a more than passing interest to me.<br />
<br />
As it stands, if I have a warrior MTing, even one who is very well equipped and skilled at his class, I have to massively throttle down my casting, delaying my slows/tashs and spacing out my (pathetic) nukes.  With a hybrid tanking, I can go full bore on incoming with slow and all is good.<br />
<br />
That's an imbalance.  If by my throttling back with a warrior MT had as discernable a net benefit (IE with a warrior MT despite having to manage aggro more carefully the reward is greater), as having a pally/sk MT does now, all three would be equally desirable in groups, but as it stands, warriors are the best at the 'passive' side of tanking by a ridiculously small margin, while Pallies/SKs are the best at the aggro side of tanking by an outstandingly large margin.<br />
<br />
The solution isn't to nerf hybrid aggro OR to give warriors some sort of innate +aggro ability, I think the solutions lies elsewhere and did a little brainstorming.<br />
<br />
Right now, in terms of 'special' innate abilities, paladins get LoH, SKs get HT, and warriors get berserker frenzy with crippling blows.  LoH and HT scale and are affected by specific AAs, berserker doesn't.<br />
<br />
Right now, certain mobs and pets have the ability to enrage at low life for fixed periods, auto-riposting all attacks from the front...<br />
<br />
What about a combination of the two?  Say at lvl 60, instead of just going into a berserker frenzy and getting crippling blows, instead the warrior would go into a berserker frenzy, get crippling blows, and be enraged for a fixed period, say 6 seconds (less than the cast time of CH to avoid trivializing end game encounters)<br />
<br />
Now when the warrior is facing that unslowed mob in PoP that hits like a mack truck on steroids that's been hopped up on amphetamines, there's a clear benefit for groups and slowers and healers in timing things and having the warrior MT, once frenzy is triggered, suddenly there's 6 seconds of respite from damage, with the warrior dishing out ripostes and possible double ripostes to build even more damage based aggro, bumping up on the hate list that much faster so that when slow lands I might not get the mobs immediate attention, while also allowing the cleric to wait just that bit longer to prevent getting aggro for the CH to land... it would also somewhat reduce the absolute dependance on slowers in groups, since with a warrior and cleric an unslowed mob is no longer the OMG THIS IS GONNA SUCK situation that it is now.<br />
<br />
Pallies/SKs still shine as tanks with their aggro management, but now warriors have a true BENEFIT to a group while being less of a liability in aggro terms, win/win yes?  All of the code for this is already present in game, it would just need to be linked together properly and tied with a bow.  Heck, combine this with some of the warrior disciplines and warriors have a way of contributing some serious DPS while tanking... all without having any spells, +aggro self-procs, or any swings of the nerf bat</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol a perfect place HoT in out in out like 15 seconds of pure ripostes,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaza</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sorries for the delay in response*<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that berserker rage only triggers at 16 percent life and turns 'off' once healed past 50 percent, correct?  In that case, the concern about HoT spells allowing 'perma' Enrage is moot, I do not know of any HoT spells that with a warriors HP pool can bring a 60+ warrior from under 16 percent life to over 50 percent in 6 seconds.  And the high end cleric 'snap' heals and HoTs cost as much mana or more than CH, yes?  So a group that tried to 'ride' berserk that way would be going OOM far faster, requiring more downtime.<br />
<br />
Also, it is my understanding that you cannot riposte a riposte, correct?  Explaining why enraging pets are still eaten alive by enraging mobs?  Also, Enrage does nothing against spell effects, AE's or special attacks, yes?  So all this does is give a 6 second period where the warrior is so enraged that he can riposte all pure melee attacks, and before he can use it again, he needs to be healed above 50% and leave berserk state.</div></div><hr />

And you can riposte a riposte.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea I think. Very original and makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
And yea, to ride the enrage, you would have to maintain perfect balance between 33% or whatver and 50% or whatever.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I was typing out something to discount the trivializing of CH chain mobs when I realized how truly overpowering it would be..<br />
<br />
On CH chains, CHs sometimes land for only a few hundred HP, rarely does the MT even go berzerk, and if he does, it's not for long. The problem here is that I do not know of any CH  chain with a 6 second gap, if the warrior can goes from 100% to berzerk in say, 4 seconds, all you need is a 10 second CH chain, which is only like 2 clerics. When you think in terms of the mobs DPS (say, 2k dps), on a 10k hp tank who goes berzerk at 3333 hp, that gives you over 9 seconds between necessary CHs. (3 sec to go berzerk, 6 sec enrage) Plus, while enraged, you will do 12k+ dmg to the mob. That is overpowering. (i hope that made sense.. did in my head)<br />
<br />
Anyhoo I still like the idea, it would work, but 6 seconds is too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaza</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps make it so that instead of a fixed duration that it lasts 1 tick (kinda like Word of Morell (enchanter PBAE mezz) does)?  IE if you go berserk at second 1 of the tick, enrage lasts the whole 6 second tick, but if you go berserk at second 5 of the tick it only lasts 1 second?  It's still a nice spike of damage with more chances for procs either way, but its more volatile and less predictable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking of a similar idea,<br />
I thought that since Warriors resemble more and more the high level mobs (with Flurry and Rampage), why not get Enrage? :p<br />
<br />
But rather at 5% health. Making it rarely happen.<br />
<br />
But it has a few flaws :/<br />
<br />
This would bring back a whole new meaning to Purple Club, and warriors would start dying tons, with clerics trying to get them down to 5% health heh.<br />
<br />
And it wouldnt be much of a fix to the warrior issue.<br />
To get down to low hp and go enrage, you need to get hit,<br />
and to get hit you need aggro.<br />
<br />
Would it compensate the fact we can't aggro though?<br />
Not really :(,<br />
something that would happen every couple of fights can't be a fix.<br />
<br />
Look at defensive disc. You can use it only every few fights, so it's rendered pretty useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enrage would definately be a nice toy though ;),<br />
as long as you trust the cleric that's with you ;)</div></div><hr />
