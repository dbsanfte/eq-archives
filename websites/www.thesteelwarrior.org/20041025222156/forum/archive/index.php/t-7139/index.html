<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, it's been two days since the press brought it out, so i thought i'd bring it up.<br />
<br />
For those of you that are so outraged about the prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq, and expressed your outrage in the post &quot;register to vote this year&quot; by saying that the whole chain of command needs to be fired, all the way up to Donald Rumsfield. <br />
Wheres your outrage about an American civilian having his head brutally hacked off on camera by five terrorists and posted on the web?<br />
As soon as the prisoner scandal broke, you all were on it like flies on honey, but i have not heard one word about this? <br />
It leads me to believe that some of the posters in the above mentioned post either 1. Think this is less &quot;abusive&quot; than the prisoner abuse scandal. 2. think this american civilian deserved what he got. or 3. All the above plus sympathize with these terrorists?<br />
<br />
Sad to see that some of you posters give a few people guarding suspected terrorists/millitants more attention by them putting panties on these prisoners heads, than an american civilian getting his head cut off on camera and broadcast over the internet.<br />
<br />
I hope the solders dont do more than they already have to these poor prisoners, or there could be total chos. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

As usual, you have no grasp of the situation.<br />
<br />
If you give terrorists the satisfaction of letting them affect your life, then they win.  <br />
<br />
Be outraged all you want, but if you saturate all mediums of communication with discussion of the subject, you're playing right into their hands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
driven so far off topic as to page 9 ( in 10 minutes time remember / ) became nothing but 'f you!' and 'no, f you!' responses..overall; the entire jist of the thread went 2 ways.<br />
<br />
1. the response of 'nuke the fuckers down and make iraq a giant glass lake' was prety strong. that side of the fence there was condemning the iraqis for their 'brutal use of excessive force and public indignity' whilst slipping the controversy of what we were doing to iraqi prisoners 'under the carpet'.<br />
<br />
and the other<br />
<br />
2. War is hell. He was a contractor. He knew what he was getting into; and he wasn't an ctive member of the US military; but a 'civie' who was under command of the us military 'as a contractor' to do a job. his rights (although common under the geneva cnvention which is a farce and misaligned piece of archaic wordings these days ) weren't &quot;the same&quot; as an active enlisted military person and, well, expendable.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
it was messy after 5 pages. it was sad too how it turned out; but the whole emphasis on what the family had to go through seeing this on every TV channel at any given time of the day was convienently forgotten due to the chance to jump on some propaganda bandwagon of their political standings to prove their point.<br />
<br />
a human being died for reasons beyond his control; and has become nothing but media fodder to whom which no respect other than Nielsen Ratings would and was given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wheres your outrage about an American civilian having his head brutally hacked off on camera by five terrorists and posted on the web?<br />
<br />
I think the event was tragic.  I hope that all those responsible are eventually found and brought to justice.  I feel for the family of the murdered man.  And I also feel that if you go to someplace like Iraq looking for work, you take on what in legal terms is called &quot;assumption of the risk&quot;.  I'm not in any way saying that was was done to the man was justified, it wasn't.  But I am saying that right now the middle east in general is a powder keg and Iraq in particular is a lit fuse.  There is no way a person can't know that.  If you insist on hanging around in that kind of environment you take on certain risks.<br />
<br />
So, the terrorists did exactly what terrorists do.  That is after all what makes them terrorists.  And hopefully they'll be caught and punished.  But that doesn't justify our troops becoming terrorists themselves.  We are supposedly a law abiding country that is incensed and infuriated by the evils commited by terrorists.  That stand doesn't make a great deal of sense if we ourselves behave in pretty much the same way, now does it?   Moral outrage kind of requires that one behave morally for it to have any real validity.  <br />
<br />
And you also have to understand that our anger isn't just at the fact that our troops disappointed us and betrayed our trust in them to behave in a civilized fashion, but that our leadership didn't put safeguards in place to ensure that they do so.  Americans should know better.  And American leadership should act to make sure that situations like that don't have a chance to occur.  In the end, I can vote out our leadership when it fails us, because that's how the American system works.  I can't vote out the terrorists.</div></div><hr />

Should people be less outraged by the acts of criminal terrorists or uniformed members of the U.S. Army?<br />
<br />
How about if we are outraged by both?<br />
<br />
I wonder if the second round of photos will be published or if in what's supposed to be a democracy they will be suppressed.<br />
<br />
Slovack, the guy with the dog leash around his neck was afaik subsequently freed - not a terrorist apparently. Not all the people in that prison were terrorists or even militants. One of the steps being taken now is to expedite the process of determining who is what.<br />

/boggle???????????????????????????<br />
<br />
I guess thats the difference between someone like me with a strong millitary background, and most of the people that post here. There should be no trial. Our intel and special ops should hunt these people down like mad rabid dogs and kill them where they stand. Terrorists have no rights whatsoever. Video tape is trial enough for most people with any common sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There should be no trial. <br />
<br />
I have a military background, pretty much every member of my immediate family including myself have served in the military.  And I disagree.  There should be a trial.  Of course, I would hope that there would be sufficient evidence to convict the bastards and execute them for their deeds, but if captured they should be given a trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Should people be less outraged by the acts of criminal terrorists or uniformed members of the U.S. Army?<br />
<br />
Absolutely not.  However, it was a shock to learn that soldiers would behave that way.  It is no shock that Terrorist would.  The beheading was tragic and horrible to say the least, but no better or worse than what Terrorists have done to thousands of others over the years.  Which is exactly why we should be hunting these people down and exterminating them (as we have been doing for several years now).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's also the difference between the irrational and the logical.<br />
<br />
There's this little thing called international law.  If you go around killing who you please when you please, you become no better than them.  I have absolutely no idea how you can be so clueless about so much.<br />
<br />
I suppose the Nurenburg trials should never have happened either right?  Just kill everyone who wore the swastika eh?  After all, they don't deserve to be judged for their crimes.<br />
<br />
Slovack, I'll explain this to you slowly.  You have an opinion.  That's fine.  But understand that the majority of the time, your opinion is not based upon factual information.  When people correct you, you insult them, stating you have a right to your opinion.  If you want to continue to take this stance, you're perfectly welcome to, but understand that anything you say is quickly being dismissed as baseless ranting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our &quot;intel&quot; wasn't smart enough to know there were no WMD's. Our special ops killed an unarmed woman in that stand off - what's sickest it was a trained sniper team at 400 meters. You were in the military? Tell me that wasn't cold blooded murder.<br />
<br />
Nope, that's been our problem for quite awhile - a bunch on incompetent cowboys figuring the &quot;rules&quot; don't apply to them.<br />
<br />
Believe me, I felt counter sniper teams were in order when there was sniping early on. But you can't simultaniously try to justify our interrogation methods  and kill those that actually might have important information about terrorism.<br />

I suppose you can make that arguement.  But as far as I'm concerned I have all the reason to vote Bush out of office I need.  I didn't like him before he was voted in and he has done nothing but reinforce my initial impression at every turn.  I hold him responsible because I honestly don't believe we would have invaded Iraq if it wasn't for his personal crusade against Saddam.</div></div><hr />

I was a member of the 507th Infantry, 1st Battalion 101st Airborne Rangers based out of Fort Benning GA from 1991 to 1995(special ops). Then (when i was in) and im quite sure, still to this day these solders are not trained to hunt terrorists to &quot;capture&quot; them. There trained and told to hunt these sorts of people down to kill them, thats a fact.<br />
<br />
If you think that just because were America, we should hold ourself to higher standards, your sadly mistaken my friend. Its been common &quot;fact&quot; for quite sometime that terrorists get hunted down like rabid dogs and killed. Its been that way and it'll continue to be that way. Thats what special ops do, its there job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess every generation *needs* a war (as sad as it may seem) to remind us of the horror's of war.  It is not just the mass killings of soldiers, or the loss of innocent lives - its the way it changes our young men and women.  What happened in Iraq happened in every previous war - when someone has killed another human being it changes some peoples emotional perspective.  Look at vietnam and the atrocities we commited there.  I am not defending the actions, however, trying to keep our soldiers mindset of right and wrong is a challenge our defense department has not sorted out yet.<br />
<br />
And yes, I did serve in the military for 9 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">War is not about 'capturing' people, it is about killing them. When the war is officially 'over', thats when killing people ceases to be acceptable. When the Iraqi's stop suddenly pulling out an AK-47 and ambushing our troops, the war is over.<br />
<br />
Now obviously, someone already in custody is different, but a soldier has every right to put a bullet in someone in a war zone if he thinks they are pulling a weapon, and has been given orders that coincide with that.</div></div><hr />

Ok Haass, lets get rid of ALL the militarys special ops. Airborne Rangers, Delta and the Seals. There doing bad things by killing vs. capturing in your opinion, and thats your opinion, your quite entitled to it. So we get rid of all the special forces, the ones that hunt down the &quot;terrorists&quot;, and i mean hunting down door to door, house to house, hand to hand, in the dead of night where regular solders cant or wont.<br />
<br />
Where do you think that leaves us? In my opinion it'll leave alot of terrorists able to crawl back under there rocks, and in time come back to behead more inocent people.</div></div><hr />

No, you dont get it. Terrorists dont exist because of people thinking like me. Terrorists exist because they hate the fact that people like me have freedoms that they cant control.<br />

<br />
You're lead to believe a lot of things.  Unfortunately, the process thru which you are lead and the conclusions you reach are quite flawed in most cases.  This is no different.<br />
<br />
People aren't terrorists because we have freedoms they don't.  People are terrorists because we keep sticking our noses in their business.  Oh wait, i'm sure the Palestines are just jealous of the Israelites too right?  <br />
<br />
If Israel stopped being such militant dickheads about everything, then all of a sudden, I think all that bullshit in the Gaza strip would probably stop.  Take a fucking hint.  We aren't the goddamned hand of law in the world, and the sooner everyone in power figures out we aren't, the better off we'll be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">People aren't terrorists because we have freedoms they don't.

<br />
I think people are terrorists for a number of reasons, some of which would make little or no sense to us at all.  I'm not sure that if we stopped interferring in other countries that terrorism would go away. In fact I'm pretty sure it wouldn't.<br />
<br />
I believe there is definitely a jealousy factor involved where terrorists resent our standard of living when compared to their own.  Look, they think,  those people have things we don't, they must have therefore gotten them by being evil because no other thought process lets us feel good about ourselves.  And I think there is some religious zealotism involved.  Look, they think, those people don't believe the way we believe, therefore they must be evil.  And I believe there is a power issue involved where those without power often resent and and want to pull down those with power, not because the ones with power are necessarily evil or wrong, but because they have the power and the others want it.  I also admit there is a certain amount of their feeling like we need to leave them the hell alone, but many times the things they blame us for or feel we're responsible for are things we have absolutely nothing to do with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Kinda off topic on the Israel deal, that's something thats been going on since the dawn of time, and could be debated untill the end of time. I will however respond to this....<br />

<br />
Wrong, we ARE the hand of law in the world. Every since we've become the worlds leading superpower, with the worlds leading economy we've been the hand of law in the world. <br />
Every country that ever has an issue or problem comes running to who? The United States of America, imagine that. Why? because they know there going to get a free handout.<br />
I do admit though, the United States needs to wise up. When these other countries come whining to us, saying they need aid for this, or help with that, we need to step back and say....fuck off, deal with it yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The islamic extremists have slaughtered thousands of Muslim people that way. Now, they're talking to us in the same manner. What's really shocking though is that they see the pictures worse than that video. It's not that the things happened in the U.S. prisons....it's that there were pictures taken of it. Nudity and forced homosexuality has a whole different meaning there than it does here, it's off-limits. Dogs are also despised, and it's an even worse humiliation to be abased by a woman.<br />
<br />
I'm not rationalizing anything. The video was sick. When I hear the political people here on campus saying we're no better than Al-Qaeda, I want to spit in their face. But, hey it's their opinion right? Yeah...<br />
<br />
What we need right now, is for the media not to drop this. I feel for his family having to hear about it every minute...but with the attention spans of the media we need this to not be forgotten the way those charred bodies in fallujah were.</div></div><hr />

We *need* to deal with the people who brought the war to us.  What would you have us do?  Ignore it and just keep on going?  That's what caused 9/11 in the first place.  We didn't create this war, it was created for us (and not during this generation either, I might add).  And by war I'm referring to us trying to find and stop those responsible for 9/11, not Iraq.  Iraq is a different war altogether.  Whether we brought this on ourselves or not isn't really the issue anymore.  The issue is that there are organizations out there who hate us.  They will continue to hate us regardless of what we do at this point.  The only option we have left is to find them and stop them.  Simply pulling out of the Middle East will only serve to anger them more now.

<br />
But I also know great effort is expended by those that don't wear uniforms to capture and interogate those in leadership positions on the other side. I suspect they will find a clan/tribal leader that will deliver the goods for the right inducement. Door kicking, concussion grenades, and a helecopter assault won't be in the story.<br />
<br />
The clowns that cried WMD's, let Osama escape, let those guards near prisoneers of interest to intellegence, allowed the photos to be &quot;leaked&quot;, and STILL don't have a workable exit strategy can't be allowed to run things much longer.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen of the military high brass, they can do the job. However the political leadership and some Reserve units clearly aren't up to it.<br />
<br />
Quite a contrast with your former unit and the way things were run isn't it?<br />
<br />
EDIT: A buddy of mine did leaflet droping in Viet Nam. He still has some souveniers. The Get out of Jail Free one is the best. Turn yourself in and work for us, be well rewarded and on the winning side. Like the H'moung, those that believed us paid dearly.<br />

<br />
Does it draw the line at the point where garnering the public's eye in time of despair by overloading the masses with one single event?<br />
<br />
I agree; the public should be made aware of things such as this poor contractor's death through unbiased media. Fuel the fire; feed the flame..yada yada.<br />
<br />
But....<br />
<br />
...where does our goverment stand on this? He was a contactor. Why were contractors allowed in 'hot' areas anyhow? The 'war' is 'over' right? Were the trmpets sounded too early; or was the premature overzealous victory dance over Saddam's capture only opening the floodgates?<br />
<br />
To me; the media isn't where the public's eye needs focusing. The public knows where they stand on the issues; and with each day that someone's wife, husband, child, friend, etc.. spends another day in Iraq...what is our goverment's backing on it?<br />
<br />
The War is over<br />
<br />
The war isn't over...there's just too many shades of Viet-Nam here where the goverment wil only accept enough responsibility that puts them in favor of 'good media'...and everything else is just collateral damage. I'm suprised that more propaganda hasn't surfaced yet; maybe because of the internet-age and worldwide news reporting from all angles at the click of the mouse...<br />

I'm going to 100% agree with Glatius here. I can almost gaurentee Intel was behind the direction of the guards. Wether people are apauled or not about the way those prisoners were treated is not the issue. The issue is these photos ect. were &quot;leaked&quot;. Being familiar in the past of various interogation methods, i'm here to tell you, theres alot of methods that are aginst the rules of the GC but are overlooked by many governments. Most people dont know about these different methods and being the &quot;sensitive society&quot; it is that we live in today, its only natural for the majority of people to be apauled. <br />

This i can gaurentee, there have been way worse interogations of prisoners in past conflicts that got no coverage whatsoever. Why? because the media was not involved to the extent that they are in this war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one doubts that he had some limited amounts of weapons of mass destruction or even that he was perfectly willing to use them.  What I completely disbelieve is that he has WMD in quanties sufficient to be a threat to the world, in particular the US, which is exactly how it was portrayed.  You want to claim that the liberal press can get people to believe things when the lack of evidence is completely evident, how about the conservative press that has apparently gotten you to believe in something for which there is no evidence at all?  Are you giong to tell us next that you're appaled how the liberal press has convinced people to not believe in the tooth fairy and santa claus?  Because these massive quantities of WMDs that the Bush administration used as their justification for the Iraq invasion seem to be in the same league.<br />
<br />
Bush used photographs to point out specific bunkers, specific factories, specific ammo dumps where he told the American people these large quantities of WMDs were stored.  So on the one hand we're to believe that the intelligence community is capable enough to identify specific sites when Iraq is actively working to hide them, yet incompetent enough to let the material at those sites completely slip through their fingers when we have complete unrestricted access to the country?  That seems a pretty large contradiction.<br />
<br />
And if we invaded every country that has an overblown dictator with very modest amounts of weapons of mass destruction available, we'd have a long list of countries to invade.  By the way, why haven't we invaded Libya?  Are we giong to claim it's a country that is completely WMD free?</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: North Korea and Iran aren't nearly as militarily exposed as Libya was, but Syria? Assad probably shat himself when Sadaam was captured and survives on the sufference of the US voter...and he knows it. His army is even less effective than Sadaam's was, not to mention being much smaller. It is great at killing unarmed kurds ( http://www.dozame.org/article.php?story=20040502031337324 ) but has a pretty poor history of actual fighting.</div></div><hr />

I'll quote Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post:<br />

<br />
Yeah, sure. After 18 years of American sanctions, Moammar Gaddafi randomly picks Dec. 19, 2003, as the day for his surrender. By amazing coincidence, Gaddafi's first message to Britain -- principal U.S. war ally and conduit to White House war councils -- occurs just days before the invasion of Iraq. And his final capitulation to U.S.-British terms occurs just five days after Saddam Hussein is fished out of a rathole.<br />
<br />
As Jay Leno would say, what are the odds? The nine months of negotiations with Libya perfectly frame the war on Iraq and the fall of Saddam Hussein. How is it possible to ignore the most blindingly obvious collateral benefits?</div></div><hr />

As a former Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Warfare Specialist (among a plethora of other freaking jobs forced on me because I could pass any training regimen) there were no WMD's.<br />
<br />
Bush claimed that in the months just prior and at the time of the invasion there were WMD's. There were not.<br />
<br />
You do not transport out Mustard gas, you incinerate it. And concidering ALL of this stuff is detecable in parts per million it darned hard to do a complete clean up where you've been manufacturing. Our former sites are all contaminated and it's easy as pie to detect.<br />
<br />
They captured and wrung out (interrogated applying as much stress as possible with no one looking over your sholder to see if you were being excessive) the head of chemical weapon development when Iraq had a program and came up with 0 evidence.<br />
<br />
Virtually every country on earth has a program to do research, so that means nothing either. The question is are you manufacturing and do you have stockpiles? The answer was no.<br />
<br />
I won't say how, but it's possible to start with nothing and flood a battlefield with agent within days. No elaborate R&amp;D required. No stockpiling required. No big scale manufacturing. Even the lack of such things is meaningless.<br />
<br />
IMO, the only defence Bush has was that Sadam was a swaggering dictator that would inevitably start a war and would likely develop the poor man's A-bomb, sophisticated chemical or biological weapons. Therefore is was best to take him out when his military had been virtually destroyed and you KNEW for a fact your ground troops would be safe from chemical attack because you KNEW he didn't have stockpiles and anything he could whip up overnight could be handled.<br />
<br />
If I was in a theater where such weapons were being used and I didn't die in the first half-hour, my guess is I'd have 24 hours of effectiveness at an absolute maximum before dying. That's with protective gear btw.<br />
<br />
I would take consolation in the fact that should anyone use them against 100,000 American troops, they'd be nuked. Even if they existed, they couldn't be used.<br />

Iraq's chemical warfare programme was of enormous scope both in terms of scale and breadth. With respect to the issue of chemical warfare agent production, and based on Iraq's chemical FFCD of June 1996, the following material balance of chemical warfare agents and their precursors procured abroad and produced by Iraq in the period from 1981 to 1990 was presented by UNSCOM October 1997 [S/1997/774]: (Graal's note: report linked above)<br />
<br />
 Type of material Quantity (tons) Remarks <br />
1. Precursor chemicals produced and procured More than 20 000 Some 4,000 tons of declared precursors are not verified owing to the absence of information sought by the Commission from suppliers. <br />
2. Chemical warfare agents produced 3 850 Whether several hundred tons of additional chemical warfare agents were produced cannot be established owing to the uncertain quantities of precursors (mentioned in 1 above). <br />
3. Chemical warfare agents consumed in the period from 1981 to 1988 2 870 No documents or information on the consumption of CW has been provided by Iraq to support the declared quantities consumed. Without supporting documents the verification of this part of the material balance is impossible. <br />
4. Chemical warfare agents destroyed under UNSCOM supervision 690 Declared quantities were verified by the Commission. <br />
5. Chemical warfare agents discarded during production, or destroyed during aerial bombardment in 1991 290 Iraq has not provided supporting documentation for 130 tons of chemical warfare agents declared to have been discarded or destroyed.</div></div><hr />

Violation of UN resolutions was simply a pretext the Bush administration used to shore up their justification of the invasion.  Look, they shouted, he has WmDs and OMG he's violated UN resolutions!

Of course not. Our government didn't spend roughly a year trying to get a UN consensus for enforcement of the previous 12 resolutions against Iraq. It didn't have a majority of the (then current) security council countries willing to vote for military enforcement or anything. It wasn't becuase of an explicit threat of a French veto in the Security Council that the current administration abandoned it's attempt to get *yet another* resolution on Iraq. No....it couldn't be.<br />

Yes, Iraq violated UN resolutions, but this was nothing new.  The embargo of Iraq was pretty effective at keeping Iraq and Saddam's ambitions contained.  And as long as he continued to violate UN resolutions that embargo was supposed to stay in place.  So actions were being taken.  And there were no significant amounts of WMDs in the country.  We've been completely unable to prove that there were.<br />

As far as Iraqs complete disregard for UN resolutions, and the justification of using those disregards for military action, i'll atempt to use a medafore...<br />
<br />
A man is suspected of commiting a crime, the police catch up to him, tell him to STOP, over and over again. The man refuses to stop and keeps running, so the police tackle his ass to the ground. The man resists arrest, so the police work him over to get him under control. Then the man crys police brutality?<br />
<br />
morral to the medafore is....<br />
UN is to the law (countries agreed upon the consequence) as America is to the police(military) as Iraq (Sadaam) is to the criminal.<br />
If you dont want the police kickin your ass, dont run from them when told to STOP. plain and simple...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Oh, the French invaded Iraq and not the US?  I hadn't realized.<br />
<br />
No, the French obfuscated and obstructed &quot;unilaterally&quot;. The Russians had been paid even more than the French, but at least were willing to simply abstain from the vote. The French specifically said they would veto any resolution that authorized the use of force for any reason at all against Iraq.<br />
<br />
http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/01/Supposetherewastreachery.shtml<br />
<br />
The reason I bring this up is that the sheer tenacity with which Chirac and Schrder continue to do everything in their power, even at this late date, to try to prevent our attack seems to go well beyond pandering to their own internal leftist power bases, or any exercise of true conscience (even if I believed that had anything to do with their opposition to this war). It's reached the point where their efforts are demonstrably damaging their relationships with us, for instance, and that doesn't seem to have diverted them even though their chance now of stopping us is damned near nil. They're paying a big certain long term price in hopes of achieving something which is very unlikely. Why?<br />
<br />
France is even threatening a veto, despite the fact that it's become obvious even to the Guardian that it won't matter, and that the US is going to move with or without any further UNSC resolution. (I don't actually think we're even going to ask.)<br />
<br />
It doesn't make sense in terms of trying to preserve economic interests (i.e. contracts, reimbursement of debts). If that's what they were concerned about, they'd have switched over by now to toadying up to us. The more they resist now, the more likely it is that any contracts they've made will be null and any debts owed them from Iraq won't be paid.<br />
<br />
Indeed, it doesn't even make sense to me in terms of fear of an uprising by their Muslim minorities. Were that it, then they'd be accepting the inevitability of the attack and we'd be hearing about internal mobilization of the German and French militaries to prevent internal revolt. A Muslim insurrection can be dealt with in more than one way, and other ways may not have as good a result but definitely have a higher likelihood of success. Why have they bet all their chips on this one, which is such a long shot?<br />
<br />
It seems as if they're trying to avoid some much more awful fate, and as the odds against them lengthen and their efforts to prevent war become ever more frantic, it seems to suggest that the fate they're trying to avoid is monumentally bad.<br />
<br />
Why would France be so concerned about an invasion of Iraq that it would stand against us this strongly knowing that there will be very real long term consequences? I would imagine that a large part of it was because of the insane sweetheart deal that Sadaam signed with French oil companies. France would get exclusive rights to exploit the untapped oil reserves in Iraq and were given the best terms in the history of the oil industry, by far.<br />
<br />
There is also the fact that Sadaam essentially bribed France (among others) for support. http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040128-094014-7323r<br />
<br />
http://www.sundayherald.com/30905<br />
Firstly, they seek to p ersuade France, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, not to carry out its threatened veto of a second UN resolution to allow the US to intervene in Iraq.<br />
<br />
The French, along with Russia and China, also permanent members of the UN but not expected to vote, have extensive oil rights in Iraq and want those guaranteed before agreeing to any UN resolution. <br />
<br />
http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/2002/0312france.htm<br />
Since the beginning of the decade-long struggle between the United States and Iraq, France and Russia have been the leading powers sympathetic to Saddam Hussein. Linked by oil contracts, military sales, and loans, they have been Iraq's partisans, protectors, and proxies. Now, with a growing sense that Bush sees Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs as regional or even global threats, the State Department is keeping an eye on France and Russia.<br />
Here's why: France and Russia are far less concerned about the viability of Saddam Hussein than they are about the viability of their own oil and manufacturing contracts. By toughening their approach to Baghdad - and by prompting an internal rebellion against Saddam Hussein - they could help assure a new stability in Iraq that would actually help get their contracts renewed and their loans repaid. <br />
<br />
Russian and French economic interests are not insignificant. Few reliable statistics are available, but trade between Russia and Iraq could run as high as $4 billion a year. The Russian firm Lukoil, which is trying to extract 667 million tons of crude from the West Qurna oil field, says its contracts could be worth another $20 billion. And Iraq still owes Russia $7 billion for weapons purchased during the Cold War. <br />
<br />
France's economic stake is also substantial. The largest long-term contract in Iraq's oil-for-food program is with Paris. But Iraq has toyed with France, which has helped develop industrial support for Iraq's military and helped build the nation's electronics facilities. Shortly after France expressed support for a UN resolution on sanctions last year, Iraqi radio said, &quot;France will not be given preference in trade transactions with Iraq in the future because of its support of the stupid anti-Iraq draft resolution on sanctions.&quot; <br />
<br />
http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/313ycqje.asp<br />
<br />
Then we find out that many of France's politicians and main political parties (along with the Russian politicians and parites) have been on the recieving end of massive amounts of bribes from the oil for food program.<br />
<br />
http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2618260<br />
In January, an independent Iraqi newspaper, al-Mada, published a list of 270 names (of individuals, companies and institutions) it claimed to have found in Iraqi oil ministry documents. Those named were said to have received oil contracts under the programme, either as thanks for political support for Saddams regime, for turning a blind eye to corruption or in payment for illegal imports. Those who were handed these contracts could then sell them on to legitimate oil traders. The scheme appeared to allow its beneficiaries to say they had never taken money from the Iraqi government. The list of alleged beneficiaries includes a senior UN official and top French, Indonesian and Russian politicians.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Gabriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">As a former Marine I will post my views. You want to think Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. He used mustard gas on his own people in 1989. He used WMD's against Iran. So thank you drive on through. Just because he hid then or transfered them to another country does not mean he did not have them. I am amazed what the liberal press can get sheeple to believe. <br />
<br />
  As for the prisoners....Where was the outrage when the Iraqis drug 4 men through the streets and burned them? Where was the anger at Dave Berg? The answer is simple the press so desperately wants rid of bush that it will keep on all that goes wrong. Its a pretty sad state to be a liberal or democrat where you have to wish for American soldiers to die and make mistakes to win the presidency. Personally Kerry and the media should all be tried for treason.  And to answer the prisoner mistreatment... We didnt kill any, we didnt cut off body parts we humiliated them in order to get info to save lives. And quite frankly if the get one piece of information that saves even one american life then it is all worth it. You cry for their rights. I ask what about the rights of our soldiers who are killed,l or our contractors who have their heads cut off. What about the rights of the people in the World Trade Center, the pentagon and the planes? Yes I know the media wants to pretend 9/11 never happened. They won't show the footage on TV.  And want to say it was all some right wing conspiracy.<br />
<br />
   I do however agree with the liberals who want our troops out of Iraq. Not one more American should die there.  One Ballistic Missile submarine with its complenent of 26-34 Nuclear Devices would be more than sufficient to end the entire problem.

The trail after 9/11 led to Afganistan (sp) and not to Iraq.  Yes, Iraq violated UN resolutions, but this was nothing new.  The embargo of Iraq was pretty effective at keeping Iraq and Saddam's ambitions contained.  And as long as he continued to violate UN resolutions that embargo was supposed to stay in place.  So actions were being taken.  And there were no significant amounts of WMDs in the country.  We've been completely unable to prove that there were.<br />

<br />
&quot;The embargo of Iraq was pretty effective at keeping Iraq and Saddam's ambitions contained.&quot;<br />
<br />
No it wasn't. He was able to use the oil for food program to further tighten his control of the country, of the economy, and used it to buy influence around the world. The cost of containment was born almost exclusively by the US and the British, and the cost was immense. The need to contain Sadaam drove our strategic posture in the middle east, and was what required us to maintain enormous amounts of troops in very politically sensitive places such as Saudi Arabia. Sadaam was becoming less and less containable because of French, Russian, and German attempts to loosen the restrictions on him. They wanted to do business with him. It was getting to the point where we would have had to completely abandon containment and conceded defeat, or invade. <br />
<br />
&quot;And as long as he continued to violate UN resolutions that embargo was supposed to stay in place. So actions were being taken.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. Like I mentioned before, the French, Russians, and to a lesser extent, the Germans were all lobbying for sweeping reductions in the sanctions imposed on Iraq. They didn't want them eliminated, because that would remove a large source of income for them in terms of kickbacks and contracts via the oil for food program. They repeatedly pressed (and several times succeeded) for allowing more and ore oil to sold by Iraq and for more and more different types of products to be purchased by Iraq - Mercedes sedans sound like &quot;food&quot; to you?<br />
<br />
Actions were being taken? That's a fucking farce. Know whereof you speak before you open your mouth. The UN sat on it's hands for 9 years while Sadaam worked the system to buy influence and cover his ass. Exactly what &quot;actions were being taken&quot; by the UN? Bueller? Bueller?<br />

All that and much much more.<br />
<br />
Last I checked, just before the invasions the UN Inspector stated that he had not found procribed material or facilities. Now if you were providing a list of material from years before that's not and never was the issue.<br />
<br />
No one has stated Iraq never ever posessed WMD's. What was stated by Bush was that on the day of the invasion Iraq had enough WMD's to be a imminent threat to the entire world - some of us believe that was a willful misrepresentation. It was inarguably either a wilful misrepresentation or monumentally, bordering on criminal, bad intellegence.<br />
<br />
And Slovack,<br />
Most members of the armed forces can be proud of what they've done. Others can't.<br />
<br />
The General staff officers that I saw in the Congressional hearings, most of our representatives, and most of our citizens, many of whom are veterans, are ashamed of the excesses. They will not be saluting returning veterans who abused or suported the abuse of unarmed prisoners.<br />
* * *<br />
This should NOT be a &quot;wedge issue&quot;, something that divides us. There should be no &quot;yeah buts&quot;. There is no excuse. I don't much want to hear any, to hear comparasons, or to see a cover up. All of the photograhs should be published. All those directly responsible, those who supervised them, those who tried to hide the information from the public, and apologists should be repudiated and punished as if they were Iraqii's that perpetrated such acts on Americans.<br />
* * *<br />
Unfortunately for Bush, he is going to be splashed by the mud. I think a bit unfairly (I'm not a supporter, but he's not responsible for this). Rumsfield and others who have set the rules and conditions for indoctinating prisoners are going to take more heat - in their case it's justified.<br />

Man, you are so far off base it isnt even funny anymore. How many different people have tried to explain to you what i meant in my post? and you still cant get it. You can hype up all you want about being OWNED in a thread. I guess thats really showing your maturity, but know this, at the end of the day i can be certain that i know what the vasy majority of american citizens think of people like you. It's called being a coward. <br />
I'm not calling you names here. Its a fact, you take a poll of americans, and ask them what they think of people that would flee the country to avoid a draft or war and tell me what the majority would say? I know what they would say.<br />
<br />
So Slovack, if I understand you correctly, if I were to say that the US Government misuses the US military in order to impose vigilante justice on targetted countries, in particular Iraq, for reasons that aren't supported by facts, you figure the troops would kick my ass?<br />
Nope, you dont understand me correctly Glatius. That reply is so far off base along with Haass's. Read back several threads and you might be able to figure it out, im not going to explain it again.<br />
<br />
And Haass......I sleep wonderfully at night, thank you for being concerned  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a fucking coward because I think you're an idiot?  More awesome logic from Slovack.<br />
<br />
If my freedom is in jeopardy, I'll be more than happy to do something about it.  Iraq is no threat to my freedom.  It's no threat to your freedom, and the fact that you've been brainwashed by this administration to think it is will never change that fact.  <br />
<br />
The fact that I'm appalled by the fact that our men and women are dying every fucking day FOR ZERO GAIN in Iraq doesn't make me a coward.  It makes me able to see the big picture, where you only see this small little section of life called &quot;Military service.&quot;  Wasting our troops on another Vietnam isn't going to make America any safer.<br />
<br />
So, why don't you come up with some more insults to toss my direction, because the ones you have right now aren't flying so well.  I guess that's the only thing you have left when you don't have an argument tho.</div></div><hr />

No Slovack, I don't believe there is in any doubt as to the meaning your words were intended to imply.  If you meant that the opinion would receive a cool reception, you could very easily have said that.  But the unspoken implication of violence in your wording is clearly there.<br />
 <br />
Reminds me of a quote I've heard in the past that was attributed to Adolf Hitler. It went something like, forgive me if I don't get it quite right, &quot;if an intellectual argues with you, show him yoiur gun and that will shut him up&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I guess the truth stings sometimes.

<br />
So you know what all America thinks?  You speak for them?  Cause I'm an American and you sure as hell don't speak for me.  You can go on calling people with a free will and the ability to think outside of the political rhetoric spewed by this administration cowards all you want.  This doesn't change the fact that when you're ideals are challenge, instead of coming back with a well thought out and concise argument you come back with insults and rants.<br />
<br />
I am an American, and I'm fucking proud of that fact.  I can walk and talk freely in my country and breath easy every day in the knowledge that I live in the greatest country on the face of the earth.  Am I outraged at the fact an American citizen was killed by some Terrorists?  Yes, on the other hand I'm not going to fly off the handle or loose my ability to think for myself and blindly throw my support behind a man whom I don't believe in, whose actions have consistently gone against everything I believe in and who through those actions has painted a big target on every Americans back that doesn't currently live in the safety of this country.  The fact that I refuse to lay my life on the line for Dubbya doesn't make me a coward or treasonous, if anything it makes me even more American because I refuse to go blindly into anything.  I reserve the right to think for myself and act in what I see as my best interest and the best interests of this country.  It is my right as a citizen of this country.  People that were able to see things for themselves and see things werent right founded this country.  They then acted to make change, they refused to follow those people in charge blindly and in so doing forged the greatest nation on earth.<br />
<br />
I have made a conscience choice not to serve in the military, but the fact that I don't tote a gun constantly doesn't make me any less of an American or any less willing to defend my country against any attack.  But the simple fact is that our country isn't under attack, our country was never under attack.  You might say &quot;But what about 9/11&quot;, which again was a horrible tragedy, however it was not one perpetrated by an enemy that is so easily identified or so conveniently eradicated by simply declaring war on a country.  You have to understand that most of these &quot;terrorist&quot; have no loyalty or country affiliation.  Sure, I'll guarantee that in both Afghanistan and Iraq there were Terrorist, but unfortunately attacking either of those countries has done exactly zero to further the goal of ending terrorism and probably did more to inspire new terrorism.  We attack Iraq and we end up killing Iraqis, the terrorist just move to another hole in a neighboring country, free to plot more destruction against America.<br />
<br />
Don't mistake my beliefs for weakness, if my country was every truly threatened I would not hesitate to defend it with every ounce of my being.  But I am equally willing to rail against and call into the light those issues that I do not agree with and will not condone here in America.  The fact that someone has served in the military doesn't mean they are a hero, it doesn't mean that they defended our liberty -- Though many are and have done both -- and it doesn't mean they have the right to tell other people that they are worth less then any other person in this country.  <br />
<br />
So you can sleep soundly at night knowing you have served your country in your own way, and perhaps even believing you've protected our freedoms during that time.  And I will sleep soundly at night knowing that I server my country as well, not with a gun but with my right to appose and protest what I see as &quot;un-American&quot; and unjust.  The day an invading force sets foot in my country I'll see you on the front line.  Until then I will not fight for any other cause, any other country or any other person just because they tell me I should and I will not be put down by narrow minded, brain washed, gung-ho knuckleheads because they believe they have the divine right imparted by their service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, i dont know what all Americans think, and no i dont speek for them, they speek for themselves. I'm just simply stating a fact.<br />
<br />
You go out into your community and ask this question, no matter wether you think the government is right or wrong. Just ask this one question and nothing more.<br />
Question:<br />
If our country instated a draft or asked individuals to help there country in a time of war, and an individual flatly refused or fled to another country to avoid a war senario, what would you think of that individual? I can be certain as to what the overwealming responce would be. Maybe not 100% but i bet the majority.<br />
<br />
I dont care what Haass says, he can say that im &quot;bashing him for not seeing things my way&quot; all he wants. I've repetedly stated that i dont care what his opinions are besause he has his right to an opinion. Anyone with any common sense can see the difference. If anyones bashing anyone it'd be you and him bashing me, for me being narrow minded, brain washed, gung-ho knuckleheads   <br />
<br />
it doesn't mean they have the right to tell other people that they are worth less then any other person in this country.  <br />
I'm not claming to be a hero, i'm not claming to be better than anyone else, and i've certainly not clamed any other person in this country to be worthless.<br />

If we had a draft and instead of running the risk of serving in battle, some went to college or,  despite a waiting list, they were given the opprotunity to join the Coast Guard, Reserves, Air National Guard etc. what would YOU think of such individuals?<br />
<br />
How would you feel if one became President?<br />
<br />
How would you feel if your son or daughter was imprisoned by an enemy and was:<br />
<br />
Denied the solice they could find in maintaining their religion.<br />
<br />
Were regularly subjected to threats of execution including mock execution.<br />
<br />
Offered food intentionally inconsistant with their religious practices and intentionally unplatable while suitable food was available.<br />
<br />
Were subject to having their heads held under water repeatedly while being told they would be drowned if they didn't cooperate.<br />
<br />
Were subject to sleep deprivation with the intent to make them mentally unstable.<br />
<br />
Interrogated for 24 hours given a rest period, but deprived of sleep, and then interrogated for another 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Being forced to assume and maintain uncomfortable stress positions intended to tear muscle tissue and inflict excruciating pain and muscle spasms.<br />
<br />
Not repatriated after hostilities ceased.<br />
<br />
I imagine you'd be outraged. Those are pretty much the interrogation techniques WE use.<br />
<br />
By our own numbers over 70% of the persons that were held in that cellblock area were non-combatants, not radicals, broke no laws, and certainly not terrorists. The naked man on the end of the dog leash for example was released.<br />

Anyone that tells you he fights for &quot;The American Flag&quot; is a lier or hypocrit or someone nave.<br />

You do not fight for a flag, you fight for an IDEAL. That is Honor &amp; Duty.<br />

Their main and only goal is to grasp power, use it , enjoy it, abuse it, and stick to it.<br />
They dont fucking care about ideals or honor or anything.<br />
<br />
To fight for something YOU believe in, not for something that someone decide &quot;must be done&quot;.<br />
Of course you will not enjoy it, but you will be doing your duty because that is the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow some retard in the White House will decide :<br />
&quot; Terrorist = Muslim , thus Muslim = Terrorism , no muslim = no terrorism &quot;.<br />

I don't think it's a bad point at all.  Right now we're invading a country, in the name of a &quot;war on terrorism.&quot;  Well fuck, the terrorists aren't in the Iraqi military, so how can we possibly justify doing what we're doing?<br />

The only justification I can see is that someone said &quot;Iraq is bad, mmkay?&quot;  The majority of people there are just like the majority of people here.  We don't go around lopping off heads and suicide bombing buildings.<br />

You don't think that if someone like the UN was to decide that America's leader was corrupt and needed to be removed, and our country needed to be occupied to preserve the peace that we wouldn't do the same thing?

After all, he didnt ask to go to war, he didnt ask to be put in a situation where he'll have to take another human beings life to save his own.<br />
Be mindful of what you say about the grunt thats fighting in these wars. There in a situation unlike any other, and the last thing they need to hear is that &quot;the US goverment sucks ass for going to this war, or starting this war ect...&quot;. <br />
Speeking for alot of military men and women, when people bash the government in general about a war, they feel as if they themselves are being bashed.<br />
Sure there are bad solders that do bad things, just like civilians, but there in the far minority, and the solders that come home dont want to be called &quot;baby kilers&quot; or anything of the like just because of the minority.<br />

I'm not saying that you cant openly question the government or there motives. I'm saying be mindful about where, and who you openly discuss these issues with. The last thing that most solders wants to hear is the ranting about how the government is killing inocent foriegn civilians, or how the government is putting solders in harms way for no reason what so ever, or how &quot;the war&quot; is a dead end quagmire.

 Wheres your outrage about an American civilian having his head brutally hacked off on camera by five terrorists and posted on the web? <br />
<br />
Its horrible.  That guy was a good man...he volunteered to go over Iraq ON HIS OWN to &quot;do some good and be part of re-building&quot;.  His brother put it best &quot;they killed exactly the wrong guy...my brother really wanted to help Iraq&quot;.  And of course now the media is camped out in rural Penn stalking his family.<br />
<br />
The difference between the whack jobs that committed this atrocity and the US prison issue: creedance.  We as the US have been trading on our credibility to show we are a legitimate force of &quot;good&quot; in the world.  If (and it has not been proven at this time) there was a systematic set of processes in place to use this torture then we have lost that credibility.  This differs from those Iraq sob's in that I have ZERO expectation that they would treat prisoner's humanely.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I think we have in Iraq now is a death spiral of escalating response...very similar to what the Israel/Palenstinians face.  The key similiarity is that we are polarizing through our actions a bunch of previously unaligned 10-15 year old boys in Iraq to hate our country.  Those boys WILL show up in NY/washington/etc at some point...that is my main concern with the direction this is all going in...seeing suicide bombers going off on a daily basis in US cities.<br />

<br />
I agree with you bro and disagree with you.  I agree it does kill their morale and this is not good at all for winning the war.  However, the US force in Iraq has had alot of lies thrown at them.  They are undermanned for the mission (by about 100k troops).  They are under-funded.  The mission itself (establishment of democratic institution w/o the inclusion of religious organizations) may not be feasible (the only secular force in Iraq were the baathists).  They have constantly had their deadlines extended.  <br />
<br />
I think the administration telling the truth (that it may take 5+ years, that it may cost x dollars, that it may require a draft, that it may require allowing parties into the Iraq democratic process that we may not necessarilt agree with) will do more to help EVERYONE's morale than anything else.</div></div><hr />

You can quote the &quot;rules&quot; all you want. I've pretty much abided by them up untill now but even patient people get sick and tired of assholes like yourself. Yes, you heard it right, i said your an asshole...No, no, i take that back, your a dumbfuck asshole.........<br />

<br />
How many flames has Haass started with me &quot;just because he thinks im an idiot&quot;? Quite a few. See Haass thinks im an idiot because of the way i &quot;think&quot; about some of these situations. He cant be grown up enough to agree to disagree, or to admit that I TO have a right to my &quot;opinions&quot;. <br />
Like i've stated in the past Haass is the &quot;my way or the highway&quot; kind of person. His &quot;views&quot; are the only view in his mind, and if you dont see it his way, its no way. <br />
Throughout these couple threads i've found myself to have a change of heart about some of the points made that i may have previously been against. This is something Haass cant do, he can only hear what he wants to hear, he's got a one track mind.<br />
One thing that i havent done for sure is to conspire with the admins of the board to have someone baned and then anounce it publicly in a thread just because i dont agree with someones points. <br />
You or anyone else can say that i've been threatened by Haass to be banned for calling names or flaming, but the solid point is, and Haass will never admit it, is he dont like me because of my &quot;views&quot;, he thinks im &quot;brainwashed&quot;. <br />
Anyone with any common sense will see that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Slovack, you have to accept and understand that while our soliders may not like hearing that the general public has grave doubts and concerns about how the military is being used, this isn't a reflection on them, their morals, their commitment, or their sacrafices.  It is a testiment to the complete inability of our country's leadership to put forth solid, valid, and legitimate reasons for being in Iraq that don't shift like the sands of the desert.<br />
<br />
First it was UN resolution violations, but that didn't bring about the necessary agitation because Saddam had been violating UN resolutions for years and no one previously felt that invasion was the only recourse.  Other measures had always been used before and seemed to be having acceptable results, even if they weren't the ideal results.  Then it moved to WMDs sufficient to pose a threat to the US and the world.  Evidence was supplied to support these assertations.  Yet once the invasion is a done deal, none of the materials that were claimed to be in Iraq could be traced to anywhere.  And I firmly believe that if the Bush administration had those WMDs they would be playing it up big time in the news.  They themselves have come right out and said that they haven't found them, &quot;yet&quot;.  The likelihood that they will ever find them, after having control of the entire country for so long, is so small now that is borders on the impossible.  So now the rationale has moved to Saddam was a bad man, a bad leader, and Iraq is a better place without him.  Well, that was always true.  And it's true for the leadership of a couple of dozen other countries in the world, at least.  Yet you don't see us lining up to invade those other countries who's leadership is just as lousy as Saddam.<br />
<br />
Our troops are making sacrafices and dying while our leadership flails around in inept attempts to justify that which has had all justifications fail, one after another.  Bush has no idea how long American troops will have to stay in Iraq.  Bush has no idea when the situation will stabalize enough for us to leave the country in Iraqi hands.  Bush has no idea how many American soliders are going to end up dying in Iraq.  Basically Bush is clueless.  He doesn't understand what he's gotten himself and this country into and he has no real strategy on how to get us out of it.  And the US is going to be paying for his mistakes, in blood and treasure, long after he's left office.<br />
<br />
Is there good being done in Iraq?  Sure, I imagine there must be, because the bulk of American soliders are decent people trying to do a difficult job under trying circumstances.  I can't but believe that they're doing their best to make as much good out of the situation as they can.   And the military leadership who is in local control may also be doing their best to make a bad situation as good as it can be made.  But the end result is this, the military has been shoved between a rock and a hard place by the Bush administration and the best that can be hoped for is that the bad that comes out of it is minimized.</div></div><hr />

Here's one thing sanctions did. (http://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/documents/6mar.pdf) <br />
<br />
Here's another. (http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1997/iraq/equipment/)<br />
<br />
Any more questions? No? Go away.<br />
<br />
Brilliant analysis. Stunning logic. Let's break it down:<br />
<br />
You start off with an ad homimen attack. <br />
<br />
You then link to an UNSCOM report detailing the condition of the Iraqi army and link to a CNN report detailing the condition of the Iraqi army. I'm assuming you are pointing out that the sanctions kept Sadaam from maintaining his conventional forces at pre GW1 levels. No shit, Sherlock. I'm assuming that your assertion is that the sole purpose behind the sanctions was to keep Sadaam from rebuilding his army, and as such, was successfull. What wonderfully tactical thinking about a strategic problem. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was hoped that a rigid chokehold around Iraq would stir a popular uprising against Saddam Hussein forcing his departure. This would not only make Iraqi oil available to the West, the script promised, but also remove a possible threat to the countries in the region notably Saudi Arabia and Israel. &quot;<br />
<br />
Could sanctions be maintained indefinitely without very large concessions to the other permanent security council members? Not bloody likely. They were already starting to fall apart. <br />
<br />
Here's one of many articles describing abuse and end runs around the sanctions by the permanent SC members: http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&amp;sid=a3_wYO8bdfBs&amp;refer=asia<br />
<br />
Here is a BBC article describing French pressure to end the sanctions against Iraq in 1999, after Sadaam had kicked inspectors out, was being intransigent about allowing them back in, and was taking potshots at US and UK planes enforcing the no fly zone. yeah...he might back out of our cushy oil deal if we don't support him, so let's ask the UN to simply give up. The French advocating the UN essentially surrender? No! Couldn't happen! http://www.casi.org.uk/discuss/1999/msg00032.html<br />
<br />
<br />
The cost of containment, both economically and politically, continued to rise to the point where we would have had to abandon them as being too costly. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Any more questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
 Yes. Did you have some sort of logical argument?<br />
<br />
&quot;Go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Want to talk about unilateral action on Iraq?<br />
<br />
http://www.pakistanlink.com/sah/10-13-2000.html<br />
<br />
&quot;The US, in a change of policy, now demands the ouster of Saddam Hussein as a condition for lifting sanctions. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has threatened to veto any effort to lift sanctions even if Iraq came into full compliance with the Security Council resolutions. For Iraq there is no incentive to allow the inspectors back. &quot;<br />
<br />
For those unaware, Madeleine Albright was the SecState under Clinton. threatening to veto any proposal to lift sanctions even if the original conditions where met is hardly what could be called &quot;multilateral&quot;. <br />
<br />
The purpose of the sanctions was not to prevent Sadaam from buying replacement parts for his T-72s, the point was to remove him from power.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sanctions have not worked. A protracted economic strangulation in the aftermath of the heaviest bombing in world history has turned the country into a wasteland and brought its population on the verge of starvation. It has also made Saddam Hussein more entrenched and in full control. The situation is quite apparent to every one except the main architects of the sanctions policy; the US and its UN sidekick Great Britain. Preoccupied with Saddam Hussein they remain oblivious to the heavy toll the Iraqis have to suffer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sanctions also weren't working. They did not loosen Sadaam's grip on power, they tightened it. Because of how the UN structured the Oil for Food program, Sadaam had complete control over all of the food brought into Iraq in a way that would not have really been feasable in a tribal society like Iraq even with a stalinistic dictator. The UN oil for food program ensured that there there was only a single source for all food and medicine that originated from outside the country, and that Sadaam had full control of it. Every Iraqi citizen had a ration card, and 90% of the population was fed by the Oil for Food program. That means that 90% of the population was dependent on a food source completely controlled by Sadaam. Brilliant work Kofi.<br />
<br />
The humanitarian cost to the Iraqi civilians was becoming staggering. They were unpopular among the arab world, in particular, because of this. Sanctions were NOT useful to alter the behavior of Sadaam. They were expensive to maintain economically. They were politically difficult to maintain as well, with many western countries wanting to do business in Iraq. <br />
<br />
So the situation was: continue the sanctions that were not achieving their desired goal at a staggering cost in innocent Iraqi lives, a very large ecomonical cost, and a growing political cost; or end the sanctions and hand Sadaam a massive victory.<br />
<br />
That is something a cavalry officer would refer to as a blivet. <br />
<br />
What's telling is that France and Russia (in particular) argued for lifting the sanction on &quot;humanitarian&quot; grounds. After the US invaded, they argued against lifting sanctions until the UN was given control of Iraq. <br />
<br />
Any time France backs a particular policy ostensibly for moral reasons, I have an extremely large amount of skepticism. <br />
<br />
http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2004/03/29/rwanda8308.htm<br />
Some governments, particularly France and several African governments, continued to support the Rwandan government throughout the genocide. This limited the impact of condemnation by those other governments that did finally take a stand against the slaughter. As official documents show, some French officials were concerned that continuing support for Rwanda was damaging their own international standing, but other governments with potential influence on France, like the United States and the United Kingdom, failed to press the French effectively enough to produce a change in policy.<br />
<br />
And the most damning: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/readings/french.html<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend reading that link. <br />
 <br />
Now, for Slovack....dude, chill out. If you disagree with something someone says, find some logical counter argument. If you are unable to do so, maybe you should at least consider what they have to say. Just because you cannot logically counter something doesn't mean it's true, but it also means you have no proof it is false.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My personal opinion; the reason for Russian and French opposition to American occupation of Iraq was purely economic.  I believe French oil industry accrued receivables from the old regime was roughly 6 billion dollars. The Russians had vested interests in building a masive oil pipeline out of the North of Iraq.  Its amusing to hear freedom fries jokes etc but really it was all about oil and interests.  Just wish people would come out and admit to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The US didn't do shit about Rwanda, very true. Clinton had fresh on his mind the Mogadishu disaster and was gun shy. He chickened out. <br />
<br />
There's a diffference between turning a blind eye, chickening out, cutting and running (whatever you want to call it) and actively aiding a government that is campaigning to slaughter millions of it's own people. Especially when you know what they are doing. <br />

<br />
And there in lies the rest of the story.  As much as people want to run down the French and the Russians for looking out for their economic interests, are we willing to claim that the US had no economic interests involved?  That our decision making was free of all influence except for that of high ideals and high morals?  Are we really that naive or self involved that with one hand we'll throw stones at the French and the Russians, while with the other pat ourselves on the back for our moral superiority? <br />

Here's a news article from 2001 by BBC:<br />

If people are going to claim that the French and the Russians were motivated by money, I can't argue that they weren't.  But at least they didn't trump up justifications for an invasion while misleading and misinforming the American public in their pursuit of the all mightydollar.</div></div><hr />

Hi, dipshit, what were sanctions about again? To prevent Iraq from being a threat to their neighbors. Were they a threat to their neighbors? No. The BEST Jane's could say was that anyone INVADING them would be biting off a large chunk. Offensive operations? Sheeeeit. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was hoped that a rigid chokehold around Iraq would stir a popular uprising against Saddam Hussein forcing his departure.

<br />
So show me the threat he posed to Saudi Arabia or Israel? You can't? Guess what - that means SANCTIONS worked!<br />
<br />
As far as 'falling apart'? Who did the 'falling'?<br />
<br />
Was it the US and Britian who wanted sanctions changed? (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1335213.stm) <br />

Cost of containment, my ass. (Oh, BTW, notice the French not only went along with the 'smart sanctions' plan, they also weren't the first ones to call for lifting of the sanctions : Saudi Arabia was. (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/crisis_in_the_gulf/latest_news/252512.stm) You know, the guys in mortal danger from Saddam?<br />

Preoccupied with Saddam Hussein they remain oblivious to the heavy toll the Iraqis have to suffer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sanctions DID work. He did NOT have control of more than a third of the landmass in his own borders. That's how the Kurds ended up with a shadow state that's more of a democracy than ANYTHING we're going to install in Iraq now. That's why Islamic religious terrorists were able to PUT camps in the Kurdish north - he had no force there to stop them. Any thoughts that they were going to 'depose Saddam' were foolish from the outset, a pipe dream in US thinking ever since Daddy Bush fucked up and didn't support the Shi'ites who rose up in 1991.<br />

<br />
The sanctions achieved their desired goal, they just did not achieve the US's desired goal. Saddam was a broke-dick tinpot bleeding oil dollars from both ends while his gear rusted. He was no threat to invade ANYONE as long as he was stuck with the sanctions. Not to mention, of course, that the ONLY people hurting in the US because of the sanctions were folks squarely in GW's pocket. Ya know, Chevron and suchforth? <br />
<br />
What's telling is that France and Russia (in particular) argued for lifting the sanction on &quot;humanitarian&quot; grounds. After the US invaded, they argued against lifting sanctions until the UN was given control of Iraq.<br />
<br />

No need I'm familiar with it already.  What happened there was an unbelievable holocoust.  No Western power lifted a hand...why?  Because there was no economic stake and it was in Africa.  <br />
<br />
As for France continuing support throughout the atrocities in Rwanda all I can say is Sadam was our guy in the 80s, the Shah was our guy in the 70s and Castro our guy in the 50s.  Our hands are far from clean although I recognize there were strategic needs for the support we have given to questionable regimes in the past.  I think France's intention in Rwanda were driven more by economics than anything else; I charge that can be legitimately applied with our current realtionship with Saudi arabia (link Amnesty International page on their record).  But yeah I agree that article you link does show the French to scum bags...I'm just saying we have been scum bags ourselves in the past.<br />
<br />
 As much as people want to run down the French and the Russians for looking out for their economic interests, are we willing to claim that the US had no economic interests involved?  <br />
<br />
No sir...I accept that the entire occupation is driven by economic forces. I actually believe that if the administarion was honest about this and formulated their strategy appropraitely it would be a great deal more effective.  It is also possible that the long term economic interests of the country *may* be better served by this occupation if it results in  a low cost energy source.  Whether this benefit outweighs the cost on pan-arab hatred really is a question the American people should decide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Sorry, I have not read every post in this thread - just the first 3 and last 2 pages.  However, I feel compelled to reply to the following: <br />
I was a member of the 507th Infantry, 1st Battalion 101st Airborne Rangers based out of Fort Benning GA from 1991 to 1995(special ops). Then (when i was in) and im quite sure, still to this day these solders are not trained to hunt terrorists to &quot;capture&quot; them. There trained and told to hunt these sorts of people down to kill them, thats a fact. <br />
I was in the 101st Airborne (Airmobile) in Vietnam in 1970. (2nd of the 501st to be specific).  The 101st ceased being an actual Airborne unit in 1969 and became 'Airmobile', meaning that they typically arrive in helicopters.  However, they do not do parachute drops anymore, a practice which ceased after an operation known as Hamburger Hill. <br />
<br />
 Members of the 101st are no longer referred to as 'rangers', a terminology which in fact was pretty much abandoned for strictly airborne divisions sometime after World War II.  The rangers are nowadays separately and specially trained and are in fact their own type of unit.  Fighting forces of the 101st are now, essentially, just infantry soldiers.  Bottom line: You may have been in the 101st; you may have been a ranger.  But you were most definitely not a member of the '101st Airborne rangers' in 1991 to 1995, as that is not a correct designation for the unit. <br />
<br />
Back to the argument at hand - first of all my credentials, since people seem to be handing them out in this thread.  I have 2 purple hearts, a bronze start with 'v' device, a division citation, an air medal and the usual assortment of campaign and service ribbons.  I served in one of the most unpopular wars ever, and  a war in which soldiers were often accused of all kinds of atrocities and bad behavior.  I was a draftee and was at least moderately opposed to the war when I was there. <br />
<br />
I never killed a civilian nor was aware of it happening;  I never executed a prisoner, nor was aware of it happening.   I can't claim that we 100 percent abided by the Geneva conventions of warfare, since it was virtually impossible to do so in a Guerilla conflict, but during the time I was there, we conducted ourselves with a reasonable amount of honor and dignity, I believe, considering that we had the specific task of killing people.  <br />
<br />
My thoughts on the guards who carried out the prison abuses in Iraq:  hang 'em out to dry.  Hang their superiors a little higher.  They are bullies and jerks who bring dishonor on the other soldiers who are  actually in combat on a near daily basis.  <br />
<br />
The beheading is an entirely different matter that should not be tied to the prison abuses.  Part of our whole justification for this war is that we deplore these kinds of actions.   We need to behave better than the opposition in this, not use their actions to somehow justify our own lapses.  <br />
<br />
That's all I have to say on this matter.</div></div><hr />

If we as a country ever sink down to the level of terrorists and criminals, we become a sad place.  I take immense pride in the U.S. as the best country in the world(reinforced by my time in the navy, where I got to see a large portion of the rest of the world).  The actions taken at that prison camp is an embarrassment to this country. <br />
<br />
<br />
To comment on some of the other things from this thread:<br />
<br />
On the initial question raised in this thread:  The outrage was there.  A good man died, for no good reason.  The difference in reaction you are seeing between the two events is due to a simple thing.  Terrorists are criminals, and as such, we expect criminal actions from them.  As criminals, we will hunt them down, and serve justice as best we can.  The people commiting those acts in the prison camp where our soldiers, people we expected  to act with honor and dignity.  I think part of our outrage at what happened there was not at what exactly was done, but a reflection of our disapointment at finding out that they lacked honor and dignity.<br />
<br />
On the comments about Iraq breaking UN resolutions:  I believe that Isreal is the number 1 UN resolution breaker, followed by Turkey(I think it was).  Note that both countries are our allies, and we have used our veto power on occasions to block resolutions unfavorable to them.  Picking Iraq to invade for UN resolution violations would be like a cop picking and choosing what criminals to arrest.<br />
<br />
On the subject of France's threatened veto:  As best I remember it, even if france did not veto, the U.S. would still have been unable to garner enough voted to pass the resolution they wanted.  So, from that point of view, the veto threat was a moot point.  Secondly, to condemn a country for being willing to use a power(the power to veto) that we are completely willing to use is the worst sort of hypocrosy.  Thirdly, if you try and make the argument that France was going to veto for strictly financial reasons, then you have to allow that the U.S. went to war for strictly financial reasons.  Or you could allow that France threatened veto due to the overwhelming public opposition to a war in Iraq(democracy in action...we are supposed to support democracy I thought), and we wnt to war with Iraq for strictly the betterment of the world.  The truth is neither.  France threatened a veto most likely(and no one knows the real reason except those who actually made the descision) because they felt a war in Iraq would be a bad thing for themselves, and bad for the middle east.<br />
<br />
Lastly, on the subject(and one of republicans favorite things to say these days) of public opposition being bad for morale, and dangerous to the war effort, I have one comment:  bullshit!   For me to fail to stand up and do what I think is in the best interest of our soldiers, and our country as a whole, would be a monumental failure on my part.  We need to get out of Iraq.  We need to stop loosing our best and brightest to this war.  If the world, or Iraq, or the U.S. would end up better for us being there, I would say we need to stay, bit all the evidence says otherwise.  Simply to look at the Isreal/Palestine situation as a model, we can see the road we are headed down there can lead to no good result, with a cost that will be staggering, and mostly paid in the blood of innocence.</div></div><hr />

Gratitude will only go so far and last so long.  While I'm not a particularly big fan of the French, because I've found that they can be very culturally arrogant, I'm not willing to try and argue that Americans aren't culturally arrogant as well.  The French don't like lots of cultures from what I've seen and heard.  And they seem to manage to garner a fair share of dislike for themselves in return.  But with all that aside in the end they have to act independently and for their own reasons, because they're not a US holding.  And we as a society need to realize that they're going to do that and not expect otherwise because it would be unrealistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strange, but it is my recollection that it was the treaty of Versailles which set up the social/economic breeding ground for the Nazis, and the crippling reparations forced down the throats of the germans at the end of WWI, over the objections of the then American President, Wilson.  And I also recall that it was because the Maginot Line only covered the border between France and Germany and not between France and other European nations which allowed the Germans to utilize the blitzkrieg to do an end run around the French defenses and take France in a period of days rather than months. <br />
<br />
It doesn't seem to me that America gifted the French with anything other than the eventual throwing off of the German yoke, which it is highly dubious they would have ever been able to do on their own.</div></div><hr />

Well, in our defense President Roosevelt had been looking for an excuse to get into the War for quite some time.

A perhaps exposed to Saran artillery shell was proudly produced yesterday as if that is a useful antidote to photographs of Americans abusing Islamic prisoners. The only purpose to asserting such an occurance is trumps is to try to dispell doubt on your side. At this point they're fighting a domestic hearts and minds campaign and losing badly.<br />
<br />
I might be voting against Bush, but I surely hope our current first string team wakes up and takes care of business. With our troops on the ground we can't even keep the leaders of our hand-picked Iraqi goverment alive. We are heading very very rapidly into decades of conflagration rather than chronic smouldering.<br />
<br />
My greatest fear is that we will end up fighting an endless series of proxy wars nomally vs. terrorism but more acurately vs. Islamic fundamentalism and Pan-Arab nationalism.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know if the kind of containment policy first articulated by George Kenan and successfully used vs. the Soviet Union, Cuba, and North Korea can work, or if we must continue the Bush Policy of cutting the weak (or as the Bush team would claim - rogues) out of the herd and killing them. I do know I resent feeling that we don't matter enough to obtain informed consent.<br />

I think that it was a different time back then...a time when America didn't feel the need to be a fucking peacekeeper all over the globe.  I also feel that we should learn from our mistakes.  We helped france, and they resent us.  We're helping Iraq, and guess what, a large percentage of the Iraqi public resents us for it.  Hussein may have brought his order to Iraq, but for a lot of them, at least it was order.  Now their city is in rubble.  The infrastructure is destroyed, and there's fighting in the streets daily.  All because Americans decided they need to stick their nose in.  <br />
<br />
In 50 years, will Iraq return the favor the same way France did?  I happen to think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">The middle east has always been a thorny issue, on that I think there can be little debate.  We, as a culture, don't really understand the the middle east, as a culture.  They behave in ways that strike us as irrational.  I don't, however, think we can overestimate the middle eastern willingness to continue to fight for ideals and beliefs far beyond the point at which Americans would back off, lick their wounds, and wait for a better opportunity.  At times they almost seem suicidal and self destructive to us.<br />
<br />
And I think this is where the Bush administration has miscalculated most dramatically.  They haven't taken into consideration that Iraqis aren't going to behave like Americans.  And they're not going to respond like Americans.  Americans would have fought a lot harder and a lot longer to resist the original invasion.  And if it came to guerilla warfare, we'd have been targetting military targets and convoys primarily.  With the Iraqis, or those who claim to fight in the name of Iraq, they don't seem to have any kind of dividing line between combatants and non-combatants.  Between appropriate targets and senseless slaughter of civilians.  Of course, people will rightly claim that America has managed to kill more than its fair share of civilian non-combantants before, during, and after the invasion.  But that was never our goal, merely an unfortunate side effect of warfare in general.<br />
<br />
I think much of the conflict in Iraq is being generated by outside forces, groups with a bone to pick with America and Americans.  People looking for some vengence for the wrongs they feel they've suffered at the hands of America, regardless of whether or not the perception of being wronged is correct.  But all the same, how do we deal with it?  We have the ability to destroy most if not all of the infrastructure of Iraq.  We're certainly able to kill an almost endless number of people.  How does that solve the problem?  How do we find a relatively peaceful long term solution?  How do we stop Iraq from being the American version of the Russian war in Afghanistan?</div></div><hr />

This is just exactly how Isreal handles terrorists.  Worked wonders for them.  Sad truth but what terrorists are after is to provoke a reaction.  If they can make you react, they win.  Isreal/Palestine is a prime example.  Isreal's method of fighting back has just bred new, angrier terrorists, who commit their acts, creating new angry Isreali soldiers, and so on.  That example proves that the threat of bombs, hit squads, etc. does not deter terrorists.</div></div><hr />

I don't agree with you often Haass, but I gotta go with you on this one.  Unfortunately in order to become that kid in school nobody messes with we gotta show people why they shouldn't mess with us first.  Unfortunately that isn't going to happen.  Any major action that we might be able to take will be &quot;politicized&quot; in Washington until we end up shooting a spitball at the town drunk and spend years watching our politicians try to assign blame to one or more of our governmental agencies.  We always end up right back where we started, chasing our tails.  The system sucks because there are too many politicains on the take on both sides of the table and too many decisions made with checkbooks.  As long as we let the Democrats and Republicans run our government for us that will never change.  Too bad there just doesn't seem to be any way around them.  The system is broke, but as long as we have a bunch of idiot lard-asses sitting around making decisions with one hand on thier wallet and the other on thier cock, nothing is ever gonna get any better.  I don't know what the solution is, but the problem is obvious.</div></div><hr />

I think we pretty much accomplished this one in gulf one.  If anyone in the world had 'open battle with U.S. Military' on their contingency plans before that, I rather suspect they lined it out shortly after that.   Nobody, in the foreseeable future, is ever going to confront us with tanks, planes, ships or massed infantry.  Our technology is just too good. <br />
<br />
However, the technology will only take you so far.  As soon as you start fighting in populated areas, an awful lot of that stuff gets taken off the board.  In Vietnam, we were fighting people armed with AK-47s, Rocket Propelled Grenades, Mortars and the occasional suicide bomber.   Now, we are fighting people armed with AK-47s, RPGs, Mortars and the occasional suicide bomber.  About the only significant innovation on their side is car bombs, while we have 35 years worth of technological advances.   <br />
<br />
And it doesn't appear to be doing us a whole lot of good, because sooner or later, you've got to have 'feet on the ground', dealing with the enemy on more or less a face to face basis.   While we certainly have some better stuff now for our infantry forces (like body armor and better night vision),  the guys who are in an identifiable uniform are always going to be at a disadvantage in this type of warfare.  Unless, of course, you're willing to implement the Genghis Khan solution and wipe out the entire population;  doesn't seem like a reasonable alternative for us.<br />
<br />
As to the whole Iraq situation, I offer the following opinions: <br />
<br />
A)  I was glad to see us go in, because I hate seeing people being severely oppressed.  But that's just me.  I never really gave a rat's ass about WMD, though I must admit I was surprised they weren't there. <br />
<br />
B)  Despite the above, I never thought we had any international justification for attacking Iraq.    i.e., I'm glad we did, but we probably did not have legitimate reasons for doing so. <br />
<br />
As to the situation now, an earlier poster said it best when they said that we really don't understand people in the middle east very well.  We keep talking about Iraqis, but the more important groups are Kurds/Arabs and Sunni/Shiite.  <br />
<br />
We are going to spend at least the next couple of years trying to establish an across the board representative government in that country and try to ensure that everyone gets fair representation.  Eventually, unless we just unilaterally back one of the other groups, the Shiite clerics are going to end up in charge.  I really don't see any other possible outcome.   In the meantime, lots more people are going to die. <br />
<br />
So why don't we just cut to the chase, hand the Shiites a couple boatloads of old weapons and wave bye-bye.  Maybe before we do so, we could say 'screw you' to the Turks (thanks so much for all your help in the war), and let the Kurds go ahead and establish their own independent country in the north.  <br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but if Iraq is ever going to return to any reasonable stability, I just don't see it happening while there are still American soldiers on the ground there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That almost made me spit my drink out.<br />
<br />
Actually I dont think we should have been in Iraq.My sentiments run with Haass'.<br />
But regardless of whether we should have been there or not, we did get rid of a genocide minded dictator, and the actions of the those in French politics sickens me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Thromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">I think that it was a different time back then...a time when America didn't feel the need to be a fucking peacekeeper all over the globe.  I also feel that we should learn from our mistakes.  We helped france, and they resent us.  We're helping Iraq, and guess what, a large percentage of the Iraqi public resents us for it.  Hussein may have brought his order to Iraq, but for a lot of them, at least it was order.  Now their city is in rubble.  The infrastructure is destroyed, and there's fighting in the streets daily.  All because Americans decided they need to stick their nose in.  <br />
<br />
In 50 years, will Iraq return the favor the same way France did?  I happen to think so.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, back in WWII we did not feel the need to be peacekeeper's, at first.<br />
But where did our neutrality get us, it got us attacked on our OWN SOIL (sounds a bit familiar eh?) But Al Qaeda is another topic and if you don't think we should've went to deal with them then you truly must be un-american.<br />
<br />
But anyway, where would the rest of the world be if we hadn't stepped in in WW2? We sent thousands of planes to defend Britain, we sent warships to defend the shipping into Britain. We sent weapons and the design for the T-34 Tank to the russians (which is a major contributing factor to the turning on the East Front). We basically won the Pacific theatre alone, though I must give credit to the Chinese, Aussies, and Brits.<br />
<br />
Yes the French resent us now, they're childish and ignorant, but if we had allowed Britain to fall after France, I can guarantee Nazi Germany would be the world's leading superpower right now not us.<br />
<br />
The only reason you have the freedom to say what you're saying now is because America stuck our noses in someone elses business.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it's impossible to tell who &quot;started&quot; the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But think about it for a second, Palestinian Terrorists attack Israel nonstop, they can't just sit there and allow themselves to be attacked, and the Palestinians are in the exact same situation, now you've got to understand, the land that Israel owns is Holy land for BOTH groups. The Palestinians don't want the Israelis controlling their holy land, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
It is truly a F'd up situation they're in but you can't go and say Oh it's the Israeli's fault cause they are backed by the US. It is both of their faults, and neither at the same time, and I'm afraid the only way to stop that conflict will be to end one of the two religions, which is not an option.<br />
<br />
And No, Iraq may have never started a large scale military attack on us, but it's very likely that they would either send terrorists over here, or fund terrorist groups, which is why replacing a political party like the Baath party with one that is hopefully more sympathetic to our cause is an important strategy for us.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be a little confused.  I'll help you.<br />
<br />
Al Qaeda was thought to be stationed in Afghanistan.  Remember how well our military conquest of that turned out?  Ya, not real well.  Funny you don't hear much about Afghanistan lately, probably because we basically accomplished jack and shit there.<br />
<br />
Al Qaeda is not, and never has been the driving force of invading Iraq. This is a completely seperate issue.  This is Bush saying &quot;Fuck, we can't get Bin Laden.  I know...lets go after Hussein! Same thing right?&quot;<br />
<br />
So, do I think people should hang for flying planes into our fucking buildings?  Absolutely.  Do I think that we're gonna find them with 138,000 troops in Iraq?  Nope, probably not gonna happen.  Does that make me un-american?  I don't think so buddy.</div></div><hr />

Now, don't get me wrong.  I don't disagree that stopping terrorists and terrorism is a &quot;good&quot; idea.  I agree it is.  However, Saddam has not really been shown to have had any connection what so ever to the 9/11 attacks.  There is no paper trail showing he contributed money or anything else to the attack.  So we can't justify the invasion of Iraq on 9/11, at least not directly.  And certainly the justification used by the Bush administration did not focus on Saddam financing terrorists as a primary justification, it was WMDs that were used.  The war on terrorism actually ended up being a secondary supporting justification, even behind UN resolution violations.<br />
<br />
Libya has been known to finance terrorists.  Syria has been known to finance terrorists.  Egypt, Jordan, even Saudi Arabia has been know to finance terrorists to a greater or lesser degree.  And in the past we've confined ourselves to blowing up terrorist training bases, usually from the air.  What exactly made Iraq different?  Did we lack the capability to destroy any and all suspected terrorist training sites in Iraq?  Certainly not, we could and had in the past leveled any target in Iraq we so desired.  So why the invasion?  Terrorism just doesn't seem to fly.<br />
<br />
And will we now make it American policy that whenever there is a political party in power in a foriegn land that we find objectional, that we'll take the liberty of invading and replacing it with one we find more pleasing?  If not, why was Iraq an exception?  If so, are we prepared to invade half the world?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">In response to the original question:<br />
<br />
I think you're not seeing as much outrage over the prisoner's head being hacked off, because that kind of behavior is expected or Iraqi rebels by many. The brutality is no real surprise, it wasn't really unexpected.<br />
<br />
The prisoner abuse, on the other hand... they're supposed to be better than that. It's a surprise to see that kind of behavior from Americans. They're supposed to be better, more civilized. That kind of behavior is something you'd expect from Iraqi rebels, NOT American troops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope I think your a bit confused...<br />
<br />
I was responding to your post that said during WWII we didn't feel the need to be the world's peacekeepers, until we were attacked without cause, much like what happened with Afghanistan. After we were attacked in WWII we joined the conflict and played one of the most important roles restoring peace and order to the world, making us play peacekeeper as you say we shouldn't. Now when Al Qaeda attacked us we went over to play peacekeeper did we not, and if you don't think we should have then you are saying that we should just wait for their next attack, which is un-american. <br />
<br />
Anyway you quoted me yourself, I said Al Qaeda is ANOTHER TOPIC, which I probably shouldn't have used in my post, but I merely used it to explain to you why exactly America feels the need to play peacekeeper of the world. And No, I wasn't accusing you personally of being un-american, I can understand people questioning our motives for invading Iraq, but anyone who does question the motives of rooting out Al Qaeda is either severely uninformed or un-american.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, our reason for going to war was to find WMD, and we haven't found any.<br />
<br />
But put yourself in the presiden't shoes, Saddam REFUSES to let weapons inspectors in for months, it could've been about a month I forget the exact number. The CIA tells Bush that they know Iraq has WMD, and I'm assuming they have the evidence to make the case to Bush too. Adding to that the fact that Saddam has a notorious reputation for striving to start a nuclear program and biological weapons program. Now can you see a possible reason we might want to stop him?<br />
<br />
btw... check out this link http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,83497,00.html<br />
<br />
edit: Bush has also made talk of going to countries like Syria and Libya after we have secured Iraq, but with the way things are going now, the way people are feeling about this war it may not happen. <br />
The reason there was a massive ground invasion and occupation of Iraq instead of just leveling the country from the air, is that our goal was not merely to destroy the country, but to thouroughly search it for WMD, and eliminate any progress they could have made towards WMD, to make sure another dictator doesn't capitalize on the chaos we would have left in our wake. The last Gulf War accomplished next to nothing, except delaying any progress Saddam made, this time around President Bush wanted to go in and do things the right way.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Israel was formed in 1948, but Jews have been there for thousands of years, I'm assuming since the beginning of Judaeism. The arabs and the jews have been fighting over religion (and this land) for thousands of years. I didn't actually mean the conflict between countries, but the conflict between religions, which is really what the fighting is about in Israel. <br />
<br />
And if I'm wrong correct me, this isn't exactly my strongpoint in history.</div></div><hr />

First of all, your right I'm arguing with way to many people at one time here, that's hard for anyone to do even me.<br />
<br />
Second of all, playing peacekeeper can mean multiple things, Maybe I wasn't going by YOUR Definition of playing peacekeeper.<br />
<br />
Third, by your definition of peacekeeper and search and destroy, it is argueable that we went into Iraq on a search and destroy mission, we went to search for Saddam and his weapons and destroy them, to take out a threat to our country.<br />
<br />
Fourth, I thought I already explained this, I'M NOT CALLING YOU UN-AMERICAN!!!<br />
But I stick by my opinion if anyone (NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU HERE HAASS or anyone else here) thinks we were wrong for invading Afghanistan they are either uninformed or unamerican IMO, But forget about the whole un-american thing, I probably shouldn't have said it I just put it in there to get my point across.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'll put myself in the President's shows for a minute.  Here's what I would have done.  I would have tightened the screws on Iraq economically.

<br />
<br />
I have to say, nice well thought out solution.<br />
<br />
I believe Bush did impose economic sanctions on Iraq (I could be wrong, don't feel like going to do the research on this one). Bush asked for the UN's support, and nations such as Germany, France, Russia, and others all backed out, I know that some of the countries that were against us in our efforts against Iraq were trading heavily with Iraq, and a major reason for them to disagree with us was that they wanted to keep up trade with Iraq cause it was so profitable for them. At one point I can remember France(edit: Jacques Chirac I mean) saying, &quot;No matter what happens we will veto any request to the UN to make war on Iraq,&quot; to me that shows that France was just as determined on not letting this war go through no matter what happened, as we were on punishing Saddam. Bush didn't wait 6 to 8 months as your plan lays out, but he did demand that either the UN take action against Iraq with us, or we would just go in and do it ourselves. And your absolutely right, a lot of the other countries saw this as arrogance. But I see Iraq sitting back biding it's time, hiding it's weapons program while the rest of the world argues over what to do with them, and I have to believe this is what the President saw too.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but here's the catch 22 bro....<br />
<br />
Economic sanctions don't do shit to the man in charge.  He's gonna eat no matter what.  He's gonna have all the luxuries of his office no matter how shitty the common people have it.  The only people that economic sanctions hurt are the commonfolk, and they were the people that were hurt when we did apply those sanctions to Iraq.<br />

I believe a better plan would have been to step back and tell the UN &quot;okay, you guys wanna be big boys, tell us how you're gonna solve this problem of Iraq basically ignoring your authority.&quot;  When they run out of options, and are sick of being the world's laughing stock, THEN you can garner support for a military campaign.

I believe a better plan would have been to step back and tell the UN &quot;okay, you guys wanna be big boys, tell us how you're gonna solve this problem of Iraq basically ignoring your authority.&quot;  When they run out of options, and are sick of being the world's laughing stock, THEN you can garner support for a military campaign.  If France and Germany wanna be pussies now, then let them decide how they wanna enforce their world law against people who don't want to be bound by said law.<br />
<br />
You make a good point there, Saddam will still have his 53 palaces and 120 wives, but... This man is so nuts that he doesn't care about those, he just wants to torture some shiites and make some bombs. And any Economic Sanction imposed on Iraq can potentially cripple any weapons programs he may be developping, allowing us more time to plan, and convince the UN that something needs to be done about him.<br />
<br />
The way I see it this war was inevitable, the only reason it is a big deal is that it wasn't yet obvious to everyone that it was. Actually... Looking back at all of the information I've presented... it does seem pretty obvious this was the only solution...<br />
<br />
Ahh I know, the only reason it's a big deal is that the democrats have no hope for the election unless they can convince people this war was a bad idea...<br />

<br />
What economic sanctions do is show our sincerity.  The fact that each and every time Iraq violates a UN resolution or plays games with inspectors we crank up the level on the sanctions shows Iraq that we're not screwing around and they had best take us seriously.  With the unspoken implication that there will come a point where if we feel economic sanctions have completely failed, we will take military action.  And is shows the world that we're willing to allow things to be resolved in a non-violent, non-aggressive way, if that little jerk in Iraq would just cooperate.  When it's finally shown that there is no way to gain lasting cooperation from him, then we play up the fact that he was an aggressor in Kuwait in the past, we have no idea what kind of things he might be cooking up currently since he refuses to allows proper inspections, and how it's in the best interests of the world to remove such a renegade from the board, one way or another.<br />

It's hard to say if or when that would come about.  There were enough parties that had a financial interest in continuing Saddams regime that is hard to predict when or if they would have ever reached that point.  So you would have the US sitting on the sidelines waiting for the UN to settle the situation while Saddam basically does as he damn well pleases because the UN doesn't have the resolve to take action of any kind.  We would have abandoned our leadership position and left basically no one to lead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I can't say I believe war is EVER a good idea per se, but I believe sometimes it is necessary, I believe this is one of those cases. Now it's not necessary in the way retaliation for the 9/11 attacks was necessary.. What I mean is that when Al Qaeda attacked us, it was necessary to eliminate this threat, and no-one could argue with that. It takes some consideration to realize that the only way to get through to Saddam is through force, though the war is still necessary, it is not obvious to many people.<br />
<br />
Before we went to war, I could have predicted that this would turn into a controversial war, and lower the morale of our country, therefore making it a bad idea in some respects, but, like I said earlier about 100 times, I still feel in the end it would be our only option, other than to just give up and let Saddam do whatever he wants.<br />
<br />
But I'm curious, what do you mean exactly by the war being a bad idea? I'd like to know your opinion on the matter.</div></div><hr />

So what's better, to be a bystander, or a leader of none?<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier, Iraq isn't gonna fuck with us.  There is exactly a 0% chance that their military would ever mount an assault on the US, both from the standpoints of being logistically impossible, and also the assurance of complete and utter annihilation.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Thromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">Ok, suppose Iraq doesn't have WMD, no intentions of helping terrorists, none of those. He is defying the UN's law, he says he's not gonna let us check for weapons. We don't do anything, soon North Korea says, we're dropping the nuclear weapons ban that we've adhered to for so many years, we're gonna make nuclear weapons. When this happens, we invade Iraq, prove to the world that we are NOT playing about WMD. Not another word about Nuclear weapons out of Korea since then...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;begin flashback&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, the year is 1931, Japan invades Manchuria, The League of Nations tells Japan to withdraw the troops, Japan says ok we will withdraw, but the Japanese Army refuses to withdraw, 1933, Japan invades the province of Jehol, the reason? To defend Manchuria... Hitler comes to power in this year. 1935 Hitler has secretly increased Germany's military to more than 3 times the amount that was allowed to them by the treaty of Versailles. 1936 Hitler sends aid the the fascists in Spain to aid in the Spanish Civil War, Hitler sees his military power and openly declares that the Treaty of Versailles no longer applies to Germany. 1938 Germany makes an alliance uniting Germany and Austria. Later that year, Hitler invades the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia saying that the German people there are being mistreated. The League of Nations does what??? Nothing, preferring instead to use the policy of appeasement, and hope that Hitler is satisfied with what he has taken. 1939 Hitler signs a non-aggression pact with Russia, which also states that Russia is entitled to the Balkan states, and parts of Poland, while Germany takes the majority of Poland... Germany then invades Poland, France and Britain's ally, the two nations can no longer hide from their responsibility, WWII starts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Appeasement- The policy of granting concessions to potential enemies to maintain peace.<br />
<br />
<br />
For a second, the two situations were fairly similair, just a couple months or so, but the appeasement to Saddam ended quickly and a message has been sent out to anyone who defies the UN's laws. Perhaps if the League of Nations would have made an example out of Japan as we have done with Saddam, WWII might have never happened.<br />
<br />
Which also ties in with the original question... If these soldiers, and their commanders did indeed violate the Geneva Convention, an investigation, and trial should be performed. But the kind of media attention they are getting for this is rediculous, which ties in to something I was saying earlier.

Sometimes Hass, you have to convince the followers they need to be led.  Sometimes you have to even be willing to be patient while they come to that realization.  Sometimes you need to actually show people how their best interests actually lie with your best interests.  It takes time.  It takes commitment.  It takes a willingness to accept that people aren't always going to see things your way initially, and just because a country like say France, decides to dig in their heels and be stubborn doesn't mean that if you figure out what their motivations are that you can't work with those motivations or around those motivations.<br />
<br />
If the US refuses to lead, then no one should be surprised when the world refuses to follow.  And while we aren't the only nation capable of leading, we are the only one who seems to take some kind of pride in doing it.  Standing on the sidelines accomplishes nothing except giving another nation a chance to decide they want to lead, with that leadership maybe not being in a direction that would be good for the US.<br />

<br />
Eliminate the Al Qaeda?  Sure, but were the Al Qaeda in Iraq?  I've seen nothing that leads me to believe that Iraq was an Al Qaeda stronghold, at least not until we invaded and made the country a magnet for every disgruntled middle easterner who had an axe to grind with the US.<br />
<br />
Would or was the eventual invasion of Iraq a necessity?  I'm not sure the evidence is conclusive that it was.  Saddam liked playing fast and loose with UN resolutions and playing games with inspectors, of that there can be no doubt.  But was the US consistant in insisting the resolutions be adhered to?  And it seems to me like they were accomplishing their primary objective, keeping Saddam from rebuilding an offensive army.  He was basically castrated.<br />

Interesting interpretation of the situation.  I don't see it the same way.  I don't feel the democrats need to be desperate to find reasons to take Bush out of office, because he's provided plenty himself.  US economy - in the crapper.  Bush's stimulas package - hasn't done jack to stimulate the economy although his cronies, peers, and supporters reaped a nice tax windfall.  US government budget - through the freaking roof.  US government debt load - through the freaking roof.  Foreign policy - mired in two foreign occupations with hundreds of thousands of troops indefinitely posted overseas.  Scandal - many very suspicious dealings between big buisness and the administration, from private meetings with Dick Chaney and energy producers to Haliburton receiving no bid contracts for services in Iraq. <br />

Aye, there are many reasons you can list to take Bush out of office, and I'll be the first to admit it, John Kerry looks like he's gonna win right now. But Kerry's list is just as long as Bush's, and he hasn't even been president yet.<br />
<br />
Kerry supports the repealing of Tax cuts. Here's a quote of Kerry's &quot;Ive got news for the HMOs and the big drug companies and the big oil companies and influence peddlers. Were coming and youre going. And dont let the door hit you on the way out&quot; Funny, he took in $600,000 from these same companies to fund his campaign. He supported anti-war efforts in Vietnam, lowering troop morale, and he is lowering troop morale right now.<br />
Like you said earlier, at the beginning of the Iraq conflict, Kerry kissed Bush's ass right and left, saying how much he supported the war in Iraq, when America was still behind the Iraqi war, now the polls show favor is dropping, Kerry now claims Bush was absolutely wrong for sending our troops overseas.<br />
He has been caught in numerous lies, about the war, his views on Cuban immigrants, about his anti-war activity in Vietnam, he even lied about owning an SUV, fact of the matter is, the man says what you want to hear, even if it contradicts what he said earlier, or if it contradicts what he plans on doing.<br />
<br />
Bush has kept his word throughout his term<br />
The Economy was in the crapper when Clinton left office, and economist still say it shows signs of picking up, Stimulas Package, as to whether or not it has stimulated the economy that can be argued both ways, budget and natnl. debt have been through the roof for a while, but the war is running that number up quickly, unfortunately that's the sacrifice for going to war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi there, I am an American(proud veteran in fact), who thinks that invading Afghanistan was a huge mistake.  Note that I am in fact well informed(apparently more than you).  Headline just from today, an independent think tank has reported that Al`Qaeda is in fact very healthy, has about 18,000 members, and has enjoyed a huge burst in recruitment due to our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq.  All we have actually managed to do with our invasions is force them to hide better, which they have managed to do, while limiting the resources we can use to search for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
We invaded Iraq(this is my opinion, no one knows for sure but the people who made the descision) in part to draw attention away from failing to get our man in Afghanistan, partly to reward Bush's oil donars, partly because America rallies around a wartime president, and partly because Bush, like his father, was genuinly concerned about some of the things going on in Iraq.  WMD's where not the reason(I remember reading a newspaper article that compared unclassified and declassified intelligence documents with what Bush was saying publically, and they concluded that Bush exagerated badly what his intelligence told him...possible WMD's became certain, a chance become a probability), UN resolution violations was not the reason(Iraq is a small fish there, Isreal and turkey are much greater violators), deposing Saddam was not the reason.<br />
<br />
Thromn, your appeasment theory is so far off base it is not funny.  We already kicked the shit out of Iraq once(I know, I was there), left the country with next to no military, ungodly sanctions, and with huge destruction to it's infrastructure.  We continued those sanctions, hugely limiting what items could come into the country.  This is not appeasement .  At the time the US decided to go to war, UN weapon inspectors where doing their job, reporting that things where going well, and that there where no evidence of WMD's...turned out they where right.  There was no appeasement going on.  Knowing history is good, but comparing apples to oranges does not.</div></div><hr />

Okay, let me understand this.  Basically you're saying that because the Al Qaeda attacked us we needed to invade Iraq?  If so, you've completely lost me on the logic path.  If not, maybe you need to say what you mean differently so I can understand it. Maybe what you mean to be saying is that with both the Al Qaeda and Saddam the only thing they will really understand and respect is naked brute force?

So you think it's all a cover up, sorry I just can't say I believe that. You read in the paper WMD weren't the reason?

<br />
And I agree, we should have tried hard to get the world's support. But with the clock ticking, nothing being accomplished in the UN, France and Germany(both have veto power in the UN) happily trading away with the Iraqi's, and intelligence that Saddam was trying to create a weapon (Now this weapon doesn't have to a conventional Nuclear bomb, or ballistic missle, it can be a dirty suitcase bomb) I trust that the president made the right decision. Granted you nor I have all the facts. Besides, after such a long time stalling the UN, is it impossible that Saddam was able to destroy or hide most of the evidence of his WMD projects? And unless the media is flat out lying there is a good deal of evidence but no real hard proof yet. <br />

<br />
Well, that really isn't the point.  Yes yes yes, we KNOW Iraq had some limited quantities of chemical agents.  There is already catagorical proof of that.  No one in their right mind disputes it.  The point was, did they have the capability to make or the stockpiles already in place of enough WMDs to be a &quot;threat to the world and in particular the U.S.&quot;  and the answer to that question is, no apparently they didn't.  And all the evidence that the Bush administration trotted out to the American people justifying the invasion has turned out to be basically bullshit.  Unsubstantiated crap.  Invasions should be based on something more than unsubstantiated crap, don't you think?  I know I do.<br />
<br />
Here is the real deal.  The original mistake was that George Bush Sr. didn't take Saddam out of action when he had the chance.  The Iraq military was crippled, basically had ceased to exist as a cohesive unit.  All would take it was the U.S. military in the Gulf War to keep driving on to Bagdad and it would have been end of story.   Yes, some of our allies might have grumbled, so what?  It would have been a done deal and we would have had the strong justification of Saddam having just invaded Kuwait and being unpredictable factor in the future, so lets just replace him while we have the chance.<br />
<br />
But we didn't do it.  I thought it was a grave mistake at the time.  And so Iraq continued to be a thorn in our sides.  A thorn we allowed to be there, against better judgement, imo.  But once we made the decision not to follow through, we blew our opportunity.  We needed some very serious justification to go back again.  Justification that George Bush Jr. seemed to have.  Justification that would have been acceptable if it had be real.  But it doesn't seem to have been real.  And therefore it leaves open the entire question as to what were the real motives?  What was really going on?  And why did it have to be done so urgently when Iraq had been festering for something like 10 years?  It just doesn't all add up.  There is more to the story that we haven't been told.  That bothers me.  It makes me suspicious.  And I don't think I'm alone there.</div></div><hr />

I think invading Afghanistan was a mistake for 2 reasons.  1:  The goal was to destroy the Al Qaeda...we failed miserably, and that was predictable...terrorists are not national organizations.  They can move from country to country, and our invading was somehwat predictable, so they where ready.  We failed, and only made enemies.  2:  Historically, invasions make more  terrorists, not less.  this in fact turned out to be the case again, as Al Qaeda recruitment has blossomed.<br />

Here is the link to the article I got that number from:  Report: al-Qaida Ranks Swelling Worldwide (http://apnews.excite.com/article/20040526/D82Q22K00.html) .  Not being an Al Qaeda member, I cannot verify that number is right.  You are absolutely right tho, something needs to be done, and we are failing to do it.  We are to busy tied up in Iraq right now to even put the resources into hunting for the Al Qaeda.<br />
<br />
I also know veterans who agree with what we are doing in Iraq, and also nonveterans who do.  I was not the one calling people who disagreed with me 'uninformed or unamerican'.<br />
<br />
So you think it's all a cover up, sorry I just can't say I believe that. You read in the paper WMD weren't the reason? I've heard on the news that we've been finding a good bit of evidence that Saddam did have WMD, I posted a link earlier, here it is again http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,83497,00.html <br />
<br />
Gratz you on not knowing the difference between factual reporting and editorializing.  BTW, I did not say I read in the paper that WMD's where the reason, I reported on one specific article that backed my view.  So far the only WMD type stuff found was the two shells recently, and both the US and UN arms inspectors said that they most likely where left over, misplaced stuff from his old stockpile, and not a representation of WMD's in violation of the UN resolution.<br />
<br />
But the fact of the matter is we're at war now, and supporting the war does more good for the country than challenging it.  <br />
<br />
And once again the type comment that really pisses  me off.  The above statement is a lie, told by a coward trying to shut up people who disagree with him by attempting to paint their disagreement as bad for the country.  Let me clue you in Thromn:  I am a patriot.  I spent 6 years in the US Navy.  I work for a couple different political organizations that I feel do good for the country.  I am active in politics, and work to keep myself informed.  Being a patriot is not buying a flag after 9/11 and mindlessly backing our president.  To do 'good for the country', you have to do for the country(do you?).  By questioning the president, and by working to get us out of Iraq, I am  doing good for the country, as best as I know how.  To dismiss me as not good for the country because I don't believe as you do is sad, and you should be ashamed.<br />
<br />
Glatius, the reason Bush Sr. did not take out Saddam in the first was was a fear that it would lead to instability in the region.  This is still possible, and we will only see down the road whether that will happen or not.  I actually kinda agree with Bush Sr. on this, but hope to be proved wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand the reasoning used at the time.  I just don't happen to have agreed with it then or now.  As far as I was/am concerned once you start a job of that nature, you don't leave it half done.  Saddam proved himself to be a detriment to his own country and a threat to the region.  Once we decided to go in, nothing should have stopped us from finishing the job.  If at the end of WWII people had used the justification that removing Hitler from the leadership of Nazi Germany would lead to instability in the region, where might the world be today?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course there is evidence he HAD WMD.  They were used extensively in the 1980's in the Iran/iraq war....which we conveniently chose to ignore as they were conducting trench warfare and mustard gas attacks in WWI style.  THere are going to be old chemical warfare items rotting in forgotten places...this is not evidence of dangerous intent its evidence of bad inventory management.<br />
<br />
As far as listening to Fox as an unbiased voice.  Thats utterly ridiculous, its as equally ridiculoius as saying CNN/ABC speak with unbiased voices.<br />
<br />
 t's still too early to make a big deal out of this. But I see a lot of smoke -- a fire has got to be nearby. <br />
<br />
Think about this. We now know of Al Qaeda training camps working with Iraqi soldiers on the finer points of guerilla tactics against American forces. <br />
<br />
We know as well about thousands of gas suits uncovered little more than a week ago in Southern Iraq. <br />
<br />
We know of empty canisters thought to have been destroyed years ago, suddenly popping up in Iraq today. <br />
<br />
All of this could be circumstantial, but I have a feeling even if confirmed, the peaceniks won't budge. Like the Flat Earthers they'll argue for still more proof, more photographs, more chemical sightings. <br />
<br />
I suspect I could drive a truckload of saran to one of their rallies, complete with an Iraqi postmark and these guys would say it's planted <br />
<br />
/sarcasm yeah this sounds like an unbiased rationale voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Bush adminisration used the following reasons in the following order to justify the war:<br />
<br />
- imminent threat to neighbors<br />
- WMD<br />
- Saddam is an evil man<br />
- Iraqi's are freedom loving<br />
- we must stay the course because back down is to show fear<br />
and finally<br />
- we must stay the course because questioning the war will hurt our troops.<br />
<br />
So one line of BS after another...each previous excuse forgotten as the next is invented.  This is why moderate republicans dont trust this guy...the so called &quot;squishies&quot; that Karl Rove wants out of the party.<br />
<br />
Regarding appeasement (very good history with Manchuria btw I commend you)...if Bush senior had not taken back Kuwait that would have been appeasement.  Not invading Iraq would not have been appeasement; Saddam had gained nothing that we hadn't taken away.<br />
<br />
 Being a patriot is not buying a flag after 9/11 and mindlessly backing our president <br />
<br />
amen...critical analysis by open minds is what keeps this country alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">You keep telling yourself that. I'm assuming it's the only reason you can sleep at nite.<br />
<br />
Lets get one thing clear here....Soldiers in Iraq right now are not dying to preserve my freedom, or anyone elses.  They are pawns in a political game.  <br />
<br />
When my freedom is in jeopardy, I'll let you fucking know.  Until then, drop the holier than thou bullshit.  You're not right just because you were in the military, you're not better than everyone else, and you certainly aren't more important than anyone else around here.  When the thread starts to go south, you're right there instigating it after you get fucking owned six ways from sunday with your ridiculous ideas.  That's when the insults start flying and threads get locked.  Then you go and start another thread to keep going with your largely ill informed opinions, <br />
<br />
So hey, how about we lock this thread too, because I don't wanna read your shit, the mods don't wanna read your shit, and the majority of the people around here don't wanna read it either.  You're not interested in discussion, you're interested in promoting your inane rhetoric and insulting those who disagree with you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way...I thought I didn't exist in your world?  Sure doesn't fucking look like it huh?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the insults are coming from you. As far as getting owned the only people getting owned are the anti war peolpe who believe anything the media says and refuese to look at the facts, many have been listed but you cant seem to pull your blinders off because of your hate for Bush.<br />
<br />
You are intitled to your views but the reason you can state them is because of people dieing to protecet your freedom. The very people you seem to dislike so much. If you hate what the US stands for then move to France it seems to be more your speed.</div></div><hr />

Ah the ol' black and white debate.  You're either A or you're B.  I can't believe so many people buy into this.  Yes, I'm obviously a democrat just because I think that Bush is a service dodging war monger.  Just because I disapprove of his policies and actions and quite frankly intelligence doesn't mean I hate everyone who wears the GoP flag.   For every thing that the republican party supports that I'm against, there is an equal number of things supported by the Democrats that I want nothing to do with.  It's called &quot;Moderation&quot; and &quot;Making your own decisions&quot; rather than just blindly following whatever your favorite politician tells you that you should like.<br />

Take off the blinders and grow up indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cool, you caught me in a mood to be willing to respond in kind.  Okay dumbass, first off I didn't declare a winner.  I simply offered up a simile, if you know what that is, which I doubt, which equated your unreserved bashing of Haass several days after the issue had already quieted down to a fan jumping into the ring of an already finished boxing match.  I didn't declare Haass the winner, that wasn't the point.  The point was that you felt compelled to jump in with both feet on an arguement with nothing to add to it but attempts to belittle and degrade.  How about you grow the fuck up and actually have something to offer to a conversation before you start chiming in?  Naw, that's too freaking much to ask I'm sure.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  And by the way brainiac, our troops aren't dying in Iraq to protect our freedom.  Our freedom was never threatened by Iraq.  Our troops are dying in Iraq because a chowderhead decided to invade a foreign nation with very little justification once the facts are closely examined.  This does not &quot;protect our freedom&quot;.  This in fact imperils it even more, since now those who hate the U.S. have even more cause and can convince even more people they're right.</div></div><hr />

You know Slovack, I don't agree with everything Bourbon or Haass have to say.  But I know they're not the complete dumbasses you claim they are.  Both are reasonably intelligent and both take a fairly rebellious stand, with serious leanings towards anti-establishment.  And both seem to like to bait people to see if they can get a rise out of them  This, to me, indicates more that they're young than that they're stupid.  I'd guess, just by going off their posts, that they're both in their early to mid 20s.<br />
<br />
I haven't called you a dumbass Slovack, and you've shown repeatedly that you don't agree with me.  Now, are people dumbasses just because they don't agree with you?  Or are they dumbasses because they bait you and you fall for it?  Maybe you should step back and do a couple of things.  One, disregard the baiting as much as you can, it really isn't relevant to the conversation and it's just being done to get your goat.  Which you make very easy for them to do, by the way.  And second, since you feel so strongly about this topic, maybe you should sit down and really do some thinking about why you feel the way you do and on what you base that belief.   And then provide the support for that belief as best you can, using both logic and evidence (such as news articles that are reporting substantial facts rather than merely editorial opinion).<br />
<br />
You think Saddam had a substantial WMDs program?  Fine, provide the news evidence to support that belief.  There should be press releases from the White House listing the exact amounts of WMDs that have been discovered, right?  I mean, during an election year no less, Bush wouldn't want to be hiding the huge stockpiles of WMDs American troops have discovered, now would he?   I would think that he would want as much press coverage on that topic as he could possibly get, given that he seems to be slipping in the polls.<br />
<br />
You think we were justified in invading Iraq?  That's fine, you're entitled to that belief.  However, many Americans, maybe even most Americans, feel like an invasion needs something more substantial than vague unproven rumors that are blown up into an &quot;imminent threat&quot;.  And as far as the Saddam Hussain government being inherantly evil and needing to be thrown out, I don't disagree.  I just don't believe that America had the obligation to sacrafice even one American life to accomplish it.  And I don't like the fact that we decided to take unilateral action without, to my eyes, having exhausted absolutely every avenue possible to form a world concensus.<br />
<br />
So, you want to disagree?  Be my guest.  But provide rational reasons for your disagreement and not just emotional knee jerk hyper-patriotic reactionism.  I love this country too, even if I think Bush is a chowderhead.  Not every Presidential decision is necessarily a good one.  Not every war is necessarily &quot;protecting our freedoms&quot;.  And while our troops are just, for the most part, doing their jobs in the best possible way they can, this shouldn't be a reason to call for the shut down of reasonable and valid critisism of questionable leadership.</div></div><hr />

Glatius, interesting link.  It reminded me some of a story from a book by James Carville and Paul Begala(for those who don't know, they are the team that got Clinton elected) called Buck Up, Suck Up...And Come Back When You Foul Up .  Fascinating book with some great storied from politics, and relating the stuff back to the real world.  They talk about how Bush Jr. offered to allow 'favored reporters' advance information on the tax cut he was proposing(that eventually passed) 'if-and only if-you agree not to interviewanyone critical of it for 24 hours'.  This ensured the lkead stories where highly favorable, and contained some deceptive numbers(becasue no one could contradict them)..things like calling it a 483 Billion dollar tax cut, when in fact it was a 1.6 Trillion  dollar tax cut, if figured over the standard ten years.  Bush has proven to have a real talent for handling the media, and almost controlling it(he learned some from his dad, who used access to troops and areas in SE Asia during the gulf war to help ensure favorable reporting...if you report negative things, you would get your access vut off).</div></div><hr />

1. That anyone who opposes the war is a freedom sponge<br />
2. That anyone who opposes the war doesnt appreciate the troops and the sacrifices they make<br />
<br />
Classic moral high horse argument.  The problem is that neither of those propositions is true.<br />
<br />
 The New York Times' editors say the paper relied too much on reports from Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein without challenging their claims. <br />
<br />
They say that in a number of cases the paper had also relied on US officials who were intent on invading Iraq. <br />
<br />
They say some of the articles with alarming claims were later discredited.<br />
<br />

Oh wait, they don't excist anymore, never mind. <br />
  <br />
Just for the sake of clarity, Airborne Rangers do exist; most (maybe all - can't remember) rangers also go through drop training, so 'Airborne ranger' would be a valid general designation for an individual trooper. <br />
<br />
There are just not any 101st Airborne Rangers anymore, which is what Slovack claimed to be.  As an additional note, at the time of my original post, I also wondered about the base that Slovack mentioned - Ft. Benning, GA, since, to the best of my memory, the 101st had always had a home base of Ft. Campbell, Kentucky.  But I didn't say anything about that since I wasn't sure.  I have since gone back and checked and as I suspected, the 101st is still 'home based' at Ft. Campbell (although most of them are currently in Iraq).  They have never been based in Ft. Benning. <br />
<br />
The 101st's sub-designation has also been changed, from 'Airmobile' as I originally stated, to 'Air Assault.'  It still means the same thing - I guess they just thought it was a snappier name.  This last is probably of interest to no one besides me. <br />
<br />
I don't have anything more to add to the current discussion.  I just really, really don't like anyone posing as a Screaming Eagle.  You haven't earned that.  Pick another unit next time.</div></div><hr />

The official Ft. Jackson site doesn't mention a jump school.  They evidently do Basic training and NCO training there now.  So the fort is still active, but I don't see any signs that they're doing jump training there any more.</div></div><hr />
