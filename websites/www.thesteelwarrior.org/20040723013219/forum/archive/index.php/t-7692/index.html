<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I log on once a week or so in hopes of getting a group or finding a PUR starting so I can figure out whether or not EQ is worth playing/paying anymore. After 30 minutes to an hour of neither happening, I log off and say goodbye to the friends I was talking to, which is the real reason that I logged on in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I still logged on, I'd be Other: *Non-Casual Non-Raider*, cuz 4 - 6 hours a night never felt casual to me. Esp. when you tack on the time we spent here on the boards and EQ sites. I probly woulda looked for *Casual Non-Raider* to be *Non-Raider*, and *Casual* to be *Occasional*.<br />
<br />
Near the end, my EQ play was similar to Baadan's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had to put Casual Raider =\.  Due to my being stationed in Korea and my guild on during CST in the states the only times I get to raid are on my weekend mornings.  Aside from that I would call myself a hardcore player as I will get home from work, clean myself up and then sit and play for roughly 6 hours a night during hte week (about 3-4 nights a week), and 15+ hours on the weekends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I answered casual non-raider, but to be honest I don't raid because I am not in a guild that raids at my normal play time.  There should be a casual wanna-be-raider :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There should also be a non-casual, non-raider.  you can be spending a lot of time playing without raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's how I play everquest:<br />
<br />
When my contact sends me on a mission to Independence Port, and I have to fly 2 miles across that damn port, and all I can see is bits of the bridge through the fog, my mind drifts back to what it was like in EQ, and how limited the movement and combat was. I smile a little smile, realizing that yeah, this flight might be boring, but it's 10 million times better than how I used to get around. And then I get to my destination, forget all about EQ and go stop criminals from plaguing Paragon City!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">non-casual, non-raider (or at least, not much raiding)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd call myself a serious non-raider. I play upwards of 30 hours a week but most of that is in chunks smaller than 3 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I find it interesting how many people (like me) posted that they are hardcore non-raiders...maybe we need another category on the poll?   :p</div></div><hr />
