<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have problems with the Ykesha's stun, especailly from LDoN.<br />
<br />
Ykesha's been around since before PoP, while we were all level 60. It hit mobs up to level 55. That's fine. It hit some mobs, but not all.<br />
<br />
Now, since the level cap raise to 65, there's been no change in the level cap on stunning. Whiel the 60 warrior fought against level 55 mobs a lot, the 65 warrior rarely if ever fights them... while the 60 warrior actually got use out of the stun component, the 65 warrior never has the stun component land to interrupt casters, because tyhey never fight low enough level mobs.<br />
<br />
Everyone else got their abilities upgraded to be able to affect these new level mobs, but warriors have been ignore.<br />
<br />
Ykesha's effect should stun up to level 60 at the very least. I would prefer it land on level 65's.<br />
<br />
Ticks me off that I spent 760 AP on a proc whose stun component won't land on 95% of the mobs I fight. We used to be able to have it land on a fair amount of the mobs we fight,  Isee no reason why we shouldn't be able to now. It really is an indirect nerf... we're less able to interrupt those chealing mobs and have to rely even more on our group to do it for us.</div></div><hr />

If you want to interrupt casters up to level 65, I would suggest getting a weapon that can do it. (Planar Strike/Planar Stun proc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point is, that some LDON content is much more challenging than the Droga content, and one of the droga weps has 0.0/65 stun...</div></div><hr />

<br />
ps Kick stun has worked fine for me in ldon to interrupt casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I didn't know it was limited to level 55 when I bought it.<br />
<br />
I looked at Lucy, and the spell data didn't show any level limitation on the stun effect. I'm used to seeing stuns have a level restriction on them, so I figured it would work.<br />
<br />
Of course, it didn't. not on mobs... altho interestingly it lands quite fine on level 65 PC's.<br />
<br />
I use bash to interrupt casters. I find it works very spottily. And if you're a level 65, for most mobs you don't have any stun component to kick, just like ykesha won't land, it's the same level limit. Any interruption you're doing is only from push.<br />
<br />
No, btw, i'm not asking to interrupt anything up to 65, although that certainly would be nice. i'm only asking for level 60... 5 levels below us, which is what we used to have. I don't think it's asking too much at all... because we've had the ability in the past.</div></div><hr />

That being said the stun is there for only 1 reason : aggro.  Resisted, immune or whatnot, the aggro generated is the same.<br />

This really look like noob whining to me, but maybe I'm in a bad mood.<br />

<br />
Well Baadan is kinda right.  The correct way of stating the situation is that all mobs over level 55 are immune to stun.  There is no such cap on PC's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not true, Haas.<br />
<br />
Paladins have several stuns that work on mobs over level 55.<br />
<br />
As for it not being a problem, it's not, really.<br />
<br />
What it is, is a design oversight.<br />
<br />
I mean, we're just one on many classes that would use the proc. Why would a monk or a rogue, for example, buy a stun proc that won't stun? What good is it, if a stun won't stun, and all it does is cause aggro? It's not like monks and rogues want the aggro, so there'd have to be SOME reason for people other than warriors to buy it, even. Hell, if the stun proc won't stun but only cause aggro, why not make it a pure aggro proc? that's all it's doing anyway.... Or are we so apathetic that we don't care as pure melee that we have to have the casters interrupt the chealing mob, we're perfectly content to have to rely on them for yet one more thing now, when we were able to in the past do it ourselves? i'm sure an SK would love to be able to interrupt spells with a stun proc on his blade, even a 0.0 sec that doesn't do anything but interrupt casters.<br />
<br />
The keystone on my argument here, is that we've been able to do this before PoP. Therefore, I don't see why it's asking so much to have it updated so that we may do this again. After all, all the CASTERS got new an improved spells to affect the new higher level mobs they'd be facing... or should they, as well, keep having their mezzes and stuns and the like still be capped to only affect the same level of mobs that they could pre-PoP? Perhaps you folks are content with relying on casters to do what you've been able to do for yourselves, pre-pop, but I'm certainly not.<br />
<br />
Remember, I'm not asking for the stun to be able to stun EVERYTHING... that's unbalancing. Upping the more expensive procs to level 60, so that you may at least have a hope in hell of having the stun affect SOME of the mobs, now... that's a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually,<br />
<br />
I strongly disagree that this is &quot;just whining&quot;.    While it's not nearly as pressing for instance as the aggro imbalance vs. the relative defensive spread is, it's still an issue for me.<br />
<br />
I don't comprehend why it is that people are willing to settle for CLEAR weaknesses just because &quot;that's the way it is&quot;.    <br />
<br />
I don't believe for instance that it's logical for a mob who is immune to a stun to be made angry by it.   I've consistently said this over the last 2 years, and will continue to do so.    Hi, I'm Mr. Monster, and you are casting on me, you cast a spell which doesn't affect me, doesn't have a CHANCE to affect me, and I know this.   Why would it enrage me to have that happen?   <br />
<br />
Guys... IT IS STUPID<br />
<br />
Ok, now, back to inherent warrior skills and procs:<br />
<br />
If you can tell me why it's ok for every other class to have &quot;upgrades&quot; to those things that make them unique when they level, yet it's not ok for a warrior to.... oh I don't know.... have his stunkick WORK as a stun as HE gains power and experience.<br />
<br />
I mean, let's be serious here, and not all wrapped up into who's &quot;whining&quot; or not because that's irrelevant to the issue.    Why is it that... a cleric loses the ability to have their stun attacks at 55 and then gains them back with new spells, yet not us?   Why is it ok for Paladins to get stun attacks which scale upwards in the ability to stun mobs yet not warriors?   You guys seem so willing to just roll over and take stuff for NO valid reason it simply astounds me.   Why is it NOT ok for warriors who are granted a skill (slam/stunkick) to not have the fucking thing WORK as you level up?    <br />
<br />
The same being true for procs... why can the designers NOT come up with... oh I dont' fucking know, a proc that works against the level of mobs you're fighting?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you guys are willing to accept total sloppiness like stuns that aren't stuns as procs to replace real aggro, but I'm not willing to accept it.   I think it's asinine to collect points by fighting mobs of a given level, then saving up to buy them... THEN them not working against the mobs you're fighting.<br />
<br />
Now, those of you who said that you dont' have any trouble interrupting casters in LDoN, there's a simple reason for it... in Normal adventures, they're not level 55+.     Go do it in hard... tell me how many interrupts you get.<br />
<br />
To summarize.... it's not &quot;whining&quot; to expect that a skill you receive... WORK and scale up as you level up.   Every other skill does, why is stunkick so fucking sacred that interrupting casters would be a bad thing EVEN WITH A CHANCE TO MISS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, frodlin, except for the bit about mobs in LdoN being 55 and under... they aren't.<br />
<br />
mobs in LdoN Normal for a level 65 group are level 56-62, almost exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an even better one frodlin ....<br />

Ok and now for the golden one ...<br />
Shaman Tries to slow ..... it lands .... shaman lives<br />
Shaman Tries to slow ..... resisted ....  shaman DT'ed<br />
Makes even less sence.<br />
<br />
A progressive stunning lvl on ykesha would be nice.<br />
But the impact of that little thing is not even worth the time talking about it. <br />
<br />
Who cares if it doesnt stun, as long as the agro is there.<br />
<br />
I do agree that Hard+Gaters is a challenge...<br />
But its ment to be hard, and i dont recall us beeing an &quot;anti gater class&quot;<br />
<br />
Its not a whine, its a reasonable request, that however its way<br />
down the list of &quot;things to get done&quot;.<br />
Thus its not worth the trouble fighting for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually.... <br />
<br />
I have NO problem with, just like when you got the damn skill of stunkick, that it works JUST like it did when you got it.    It stuns ANY MOB that cons blue to you with certain model exceptions (Giants/Dragons/Bosses).    <br />
<br />
Actually, when we were granted stuns on our kicks and bashes, we WERE considered an &quot;anti-gater class&quot;, up until some arbitrary mob level thing, which is no longer relevant, since there's no longer a blatant &quot;Mobs above X are unstunnable&quot; which is EXACTLY why stunkick was capped at 55 in the first place.    <br />
<br />
Again, it's not a &quot;pressing issue&quot; but it IS an issue and bringing it up isn't &quot;whining&quot;, I'm sick to death of people who will settle for wallowing in shit accusing those of wanting a bath of &quot;whining about cleanliness&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins have several stuns that work on mobs over level 55. <br />
<br />
Yeah, and those are coded as such.  Regular ol' Joe Bloe stun spells (IE: Stun, Force of Sound, Ykesha etc) are capped at 55.  Only spells which are designed to land on mobs higher than that do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're saying that mobs are immune to stun, and the fact that they're able to be stunned by any number of stun spells somehow doesn't count.<br />
<br />
Um... okay.<br />
<br />
You say that all mobs over level 55 are immune to stun. If mobs over level 55 can be hit by any stun, than your assertion is wrong.<br />
<br />
It's much like saying a certain mob is immune to slow, when the truth is they're only disease slowable. You can't truthfully say that that mob is immune to slow, it just needs a slow with a different resist check.<br />
<br />
Or saying that a mob's immune to a certain magic, when the truth of the matter is that it's only able to be damaged by lure based spells... you can't say they're immune, they just require a different spell to affect it.<br />
<br />
Or even saying that mobs over level 60 are immune to mez, when the fact remains that they only need a different mez spell to mez them.<br />
<br />
Stun is no different. You can't say they're all immune to stun and they say that all the many stuns that DO affect them somehow don't count.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you meant to say that they're immune to most stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The could add a Planar Stun (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3588)  augment at the 1150 or 1492 point level very easily.  All the code that counts is already written, and it's a small thing to ask for.<br />
<br />
I can think of a few ways to implement a scaling stunkick (higher mobs = less chance of stun) ... They could even add it as an AA (&quot;Planar Kick&quot;).  30% chance of stun, w an aggro component similar to stun.  That would close the aggro gap some, without re-defining the warrior class.  I don't s'pose the giant races would get as much out of it as us small fry, tho ;).<br />
<br />
Heading back to the peanut gallery now ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterfell</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Emilia think again about your golden example :<br />
<br />
1. Shaman Tries to slow ..... it lands .... shaman lives<br />
2. Shaman Tries to slow ..... resisted .... shaman DT'ed<br />
<br />
It makes sense ( if I was the mob I would do the same ) :<br />
<br />
1. Damned I m slowed ... nothing more to do. No need to beat this guy now, it s too late. <br />
2. Damned that guy tried to slow me .... let s kill him before he makes another attempt.<br />
<br />
If the spell you cast is useful only once during the fight, the mob should get angrier when it resists it than when it works. If your spell/effect ( like a nuke ) is useful more than once, then he should be angrier when it lands succesfully than when it is resisted.<br />
<br />
Of course a truly smart mob should always kill the slower first ( even before he casts ) :p<br />
<br />
Btw I totally agree : when a mob is immune to stun , they shouldn t get angry when they resist it ... that s obviously stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenelan</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giant flagged mobs (HGs, Velious giants, dragons etc.) are immune to ALL stuns.<br />
<br />
56 and up mobs are immune to basic/normal/standard stun...which is what is and may always been known as &quot;Stun&quot; to those who have been playing since long before anything existed to stun those mobs (think of us as old people who can't quickly get our thinking around to the existance of this new thing when we talk about this :p ).<br />
<br />
56 and up mobs were also immune to mez (read: stun) until GoK and Rapture.<br />
<br />
With Luclin, Paladins got an AA called &quot;Divine stun&quot;. This ability was a stun that worked on those 56 and up mobs.<br />
<br />
With PoP they decided to add spells that would 'stun' mobs at 56 and up...however we refer to those as Planar/Ethereal stun/strike (etc.).<br />
<br />
When someone says STUN in the context of this thread they're talking about the old 55 and below only concept, which includes warrior KICK stun.<br />
<br />
Amusingly we get the kick stun at 55 and it wont reliably do anything on mobs that are 56 and up heh.<br />
<br />
Look at weapons like the GBoS...you'd likely be higher than 55 to get one of those...and yet it has an old world proc with a basic stun in it. They should have made a new proc that was a stun up to 60 or something.<br />
<br />
I think it's unlikely they'll change these things...but I agree it'd be nice :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But anyway, Emilia, reverse the question...<br />
<br />
You're fighting  a Ring event...  There's a Mob that can slow you but does no damage to you.  There's a mob that's doing 800 DPS to you.  The first mob has already slowed you, the second mob is still doing 800 DPS.  The ring event will be over before the slow wears off.  Which mob do you kill? :)  Now say you resisted the slow, and the mob will cast it again in 5 seconds, which mob do you kill?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And ken... /nods, yep, much better way to put it.<br />
<br />
Except that chanters were always able up mez up to level 61 by Rapture, which was level 59 spell, which has been out since Kunark.</div></div><hr />

I have not found a reliable rule for this.  Test this in BoT sometimes.  I'm usually the only way one trying to stun a gater because everyone else is lazy anyway.  There are mobs that you can definitely stun reliably with kick (if it lands) and then there are mobs that you just can't kick stun at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However: the aggro generated is the same whether the &quot;mob is immune to the stun portion of this effect&quot; or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for kickstun:<br />
<br />
When POP came out and you dinged 61, you must have noticed that your kicks once again had a chance to stun blue mobs (i.e. the level 55 kickstun limit was erased starting at level 61).<br />
<br />

I have not found a reliable rule for this. Test this in BoT sometimes. I'm usually the only way one trying to stun a gater because everyone else is lazy anyway. There are mobs that you can definitely stun reliably with kick (if it lands) and then there are mobs that you just can't kick stun at all.&quot;--Phantron<br />
<br />
Phantron is totally correct.  Kick stuns mobs over 55.  In PoV inner groups I use kick to stop runners all the time and those mobs are over 60.  I also see NPC casters over 55 get interupted a lot when I kick (like those magus guys on Grummus raids).</div></div><hr />

It's not the same.<br />
<br />
Again, I am not totally sure what your complaint is, and yes I guess I missed the point.  I could care less that my GBOS proc doesn't actually stun the mobs I fight, what I care is that it does damage and has an extra component of aggro.  I don't feel that the GBOS stun limit is &quot;shafting&quot; me, but I guess you do.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't working on personal experience, I use bash, being a large race. I was working from other people repeatedly stating that kick stun doesn't affect mobs past level 55. At this point, I'm  not convinced either way, there's been no proof offered, only some personal accounts, and statements both ways.... there needs to be proof.<br />
<br />
At any rate, if you don't see anything wrong with your stun being completely useless as a stun when it wasn't in the past, and only useful for the aggro that it generates (which it shouldn't... what kind of sense does it make that a mob gets pissed off at a spell that cannot affect it,  anyway) then there's nothing I can do... <br />
<br />
I can only imagine how loudly the paladins would have whined, had they not gotten new spells to affect the higher level mobs when PoP came out, and were forced to use spells that now, every mob they fought was immune to... but the majority of warriors, in the same situation, just roll over and take it.<br />

Heh, guess that could show just how much warriors are used to getting screwed over and ignored, expansion and expansion.</div></div><hr />

See, I'd given them the benefit of the doubt thinking that when they put in an expensive stun that many level 65's would use, they wouldn't design it so badly that the every mob that the 65 would fight, would be immune to its effects. I thought they'd actually make the stun actually do what it's supposed to, and... (gasp) actually STUN the mobs! (I'm being sarcastic at SoE, not you.)<br />
<br />
I then found out after I bought the item... and made the post because having the only stun augments that melee have acess too, limited to levels that make the stun component useless except for the fact that they generate aggro for anyone past level 60 is poor design. You can have the benefit of the stun itself until you're level 60-65, and then all of a sudden, we can't allow you to actually be able to stun the mob any more? that's crap. Considering the fact that ykesha's an old spell, I believe they've simply overlooked the ramifications of the new higher levels on the use of old procs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are only 2 spells worth interrupting:  Complete Heal, and Gate.  I would estimate I interrupt CH with the stun from Symbol of Planemasters something like once per 3-4 clerics so even if Ykesha stuns beyond 55 it's not something you can count on.  I may have stunned a mob once with the same proc when they're trying to gate and frankly I'd rather not rely on a proc to stop a gater.  All the other spells are of no consequence, and if your gear is respectable, it's often more advantageous to let them cast then interrupt them, because the mob might melee again if you stop them from casting.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, relying on a proc stun to stop spellcasting is so unreliable I don't see how it can possibly matter either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, those are the only two spells worth interrupting.<br />
<br />
However, like it or not, we rely on procs, and it's not by choice.<br />
<br />
We rely on them for aggro, we rely on them to nuke, DoT, stun, slow, provide aggro, rune us, etc etc etc. If we want to do ANYTHING cool, we rely on procs to do it. So while procs are by their very nature unreliable, true, they're all we have. I'd rather make about the only thing we have that does anything cool work properly, than just be defeatist and say well, they're unreliable, so it doesn't matter anyway. Screw that, I say.<br />
<br />
The only other think we have to work with in regards to spell casting interruption is kick and bash, and I don't know about you, but I'm getting really damn sick of only being able to use that, and having half the damn mobs channel their way through it and healing and/or gating, no matter that I've been bashing the shit out of it, the entire time it's casting a spell... and having a proc go off (that I've spent a ton of time getting) and the mob, because I'm level 65 and not 55 or 60, not affect the mob in the slightest.<br />
<br />
It goes without saying that a stun proc, or any proc for that matter can't be relied on. That's really beside the point, and a completely different issue.<br />
<br />
What IS the issue, is having a spell work properly, and for them to remember that they designed Ykesha for a level 60 world, and it's now a level 65 world. SoE says they want to find annoying issues with spells? Fine, here's an annoying issue. You say it's easier to balance spells? fine, balance this one.<br />
<br />
Your comment about reliability really reminds me of taunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relying on taunt to get aggro is so unreliable that I don't see how it could possibly matter either way&quot; - in regards to fixing taunt so that it works better on higher level mobs</div></div><hr />

I stand corrected on it being original game as opposed to Kunark, not that it really matters... although that just reinforces my point... that point being that tanks used to be able to stun anything they fight with their procs, and now they cannot stun ANYTHING with their procs.</div></div><hr />

Permafrost - 760pts for 150DD<br />
Force of Ykesha - 760pts for 125DD +0.0sec/stun<br />
<br />
It's fairly obvious that they meant for the stun portion to actually be useful. Otherwise, why would it cost the same for less of a DD, and have the same DD cost a good 50% less? Why would someone buy it over the others? The answer is: only warriors who are only concerned about the aggro from the effect that the mobs are immune to, and are willing to take the risk of it being resisted outright, for the 400AP savings over Anger III. That's it. One class, and only some members of that class. Noone else would want this. At that point, you have to ask. SInce they put in Anger III nearly specifically for warriors, why would they put in ANOTHER augment, that only that same class would be interested in? No, I think they put it in so monks, rogues, and the hybrids would find it useful too. The way it's currently designed, none of them (at level 65) do.</div></div><hr />

Yep, and such cases are few and far between, in regards to the nontanks, and the monk/anger example is completely irrelevant. None of which give the least bit of credibility to the claim that having a stun that doesn't stun works just fine, thank you very much.

Considering you think the adventure system is a &quot;welfare&quot; system with all its associated derision, I'm not surprised.  I'll bet that dosen't stop your from taking advantage of the welfare system's augments when you fight in LDoN zones, tho. You make it seem like those who gain things other than from raids are somehow a lower life form. How disgusting. Ever fought in a LdoN dungeon? ever added an augment to your armour? Grats, you're your own lower life form, by your own seeming standards.<br />

<br />
Olafsky, there's better to be found in time than that. Only the raw hitpoints are even comparable. What you're glossing over is the fact that your BP which is suppsoed to be Time quality is inferior in every other way, from AC  to resists to stats to effect.  Not only THAT, but that's not a BP that's acheivable by 50 adventures like you claim.... that's a 100 successful adventures, at an absolute minimum of 4 days played, for one item. The highest you could get for your 50 adventures, realistically, would be no more that 140HP, which not only isn't time quality, it's barely low elemental quality. Even THEN, the other stats don't compare very well. AND, you have to put in a minimum of 2 days /played to get it.<br />

The effects are the same in every wat you can name.

Hussar: You're right. The original Ykesha spell on the SSoY, etc, it doesn't need to be changed. Why? because noone uses it any more. The Ykesha line of spells introduced in LDoN, which were designed using the original Ykesha as a model, do need updating, as the design that it was modeled off existed in an entirely different realm than what exists today. If Raaj was referring to the original Ykesha spell when I was specifically referring to the LDoN spells with the same name that were modelled off the original spell throughout the thread, well, that's his mistake, and one I hope he didn't make.It's not like I didn't make it very clear throughout that I was referring to the ones that have just come out in LDoN. I don't care in the least if the original Ykesha is changed... it's faded into irrelevancy anyway. It's the ones that have been put imnto the game for all melee's use that i'm concerned about.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for someone to offer me a compelling reason why the high level augment stuns should not stun for level 65's, so that I can concede the point... because you know what, I honestly don't see any reason why this should not be the case.</div></div><hr />

The stun works just fine for lvl 65 warriors as long as youre killing lvl 55 mobs. Thats the way its designed, and for all intents and purposes it doesnt matter one bit. The stun is there for agro, not to interrupt spells. If you are relying on proccing weapons to stop shit gating or whatever you need more help then SOE can give you. Why the hell is the Karanas so big and empty? Wouldnt it be easier if they were small and didnt rain as much? Some things are designed the way they are simply because they are, LDON has far bigger issues then landing fucking stunprocs on CHing orcs in Ruj dungeons.<br />
<br />
It's fairly obvious that they meant for the stun portion to actually be useful. Otherwise, why would it cost the same for less of a DD<br />

Yeah cos stuns are useless.. tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The spell STUN does not affect mobs over Level 55. The proc Planar STUN does it. So why can't it be that YKESHA does not affect mobs over Level 55 but Strike of Ykesha can? When I see ykesha its a 75 DD/Stun and Strike is an update.<br />
<br />
Weapons with ykesha need level 37 to 46 to proc.<br />
That augment needs Level 65.<br />
<br />
So an augment proc which needs Level 65 and is an upgrade to the Ykesha line should be better in all forms than the original one.</div></div><hr />

You can say this until you're blue in the face, but you can't make it go away. Why did everyone on this thread (except for you) buy the aug in the first place instead of the cheaper, higher damaging one from Perma? It's because of the agro on stuns, even resisted-every-time stuns.<br />

Frodlin said it best on page 2 of this thread. It might not be a big issue, or even worth arguing over, but the original poster does have a point.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense to sell a DD+&quot;stun&quot; augment, that doesnt actually work in the enviroment you obtained it in(and fight in).<br />
<br />
Most mobs on normal level is lvl 59 if I recall correctly.<br />
<br />
This doesnt really concern me(yet) since I am not even allowed to put this augment in my weapon(/rude type 8).<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if I should be lucky enough to obtain the wrath of ykesha augment on a LDON-Timeraid, i would be very annoyed if it didnt at least interrupt the mobs on &quot;normal&quot; missions.<br />
<br />
Sooo, if I was allowed to put on the SoE-Designer hat for a moment, I would make the first four ykesha augments stun mobs up to and including lvl 60(normal level). And the presumably raid dropped Wrath of Ykesha, stun up to and including lvl 65.<br />

I have SoP and an Ykesha proc on my BoW, and the aggro is fantastic, amazingly enough this is the only thing I care about, not being able to stun level 59 mobs does not concern me at all, stun would be a decent bonus I suppose but we're not entitled to it, at all, and buying Ykesha for the stun value would be really stupid :p</div></div><hr />

I think what it really comes down to is that it would be &quot;nice&quot; to have it stun, but it's really not something most people care about.

The thread starter actually complains about this dirt cheap aug that damn near anyone can manage to get with relatively nil effort. Oh, sure it converts run of the mill weaps into quite substantial high aggro tanking weaps, and hell if you place it on a BoW you create &gt;&gt; Time level aggro weap..  but no, this is not enough !

The fact that the poster can return and cry &quot;but its not about the aggro&quot; makes his rant even more maddening.  Someone try to drive it into his thick skull, that EVERYTHING is about the aggro!  The whole point of having these easily resisted 0 sec stuns on items ranging from the Orb of the Sky and Crimson Sigil Gloves to the symbol of the planemasters  IS FRIGGIN AGGRO !!!  Perhaps it would be more palatable to the twit if Sony called the spell &quot;PleaseHateMe 1&quot; . . .  <br />
<br />
The fact that a fool can complain about putting this far to cheap and far too powerful agument in to whatever gimp ass weapon he might have irks me to no end whilst the Time weapons we get have an utterly useless type 8 augment slot that can reasonably do squat.

<br />
If it's all about the aggro, then why didn't I, or everyone else, just go for the AngerIII augment, that not only is better aggro, is UNRESISTABLE? Hmmmm? If it's all about the aggro, why wouldn't I go for the aggro choice that's clearly a better option? That's right, because it's NOT ALL about the aggro. Aggro is very important, but it's not everything. No. Ykesha's the only option for 2handers, and even then only because AngerIII is limited to 1h only. Hell, i consider AngerIII poor design, don't allow it on the 2handers, but allow it on 1handers, where it'll proc more. Yeah, that's good design....<br />
<br />
Talk about being clueless. Your point would only be valid IF, there wasn't clearly better options out there if your ONLY concern was aggro, and that Ykesha is  the ONLY option if you have any concern about aggro whatsoever on your 2hander.<br />
<br />
As for everyone from every melee class putting them in thier weapons, get real, and quit presenting the extreme case. How ridiculous can you get? First of all, do you forget that these things cause aggro? Any non tank putting a PAIR of those in their weapons would be getting aggro and killed on a regular basis. Not many non melee I know would like the proc enough to risk death every time. No, you'd see SOME non tanks using it in one weapon, many not using it at all, and a few idiots putting it in both. So in any group, you'd have proably between 1 and 3 stun procs, which, remember, are RANDOM. A lot of the time when they land they won't be doing squat because you either a: won't be fighting a caster, or b: the caster won't be casting.<br />
<br />
And let's remember. To get use of the stun AS IT IS you either have to pay 50% more than the comparative DD on another proc, or lose 25DD off another item that's the same cost. It's aboslutely ridiculous to claim that everyone's going to find that worth it.<br />
<br />
As for your whining about time slot 8 augments... you know what, I feel for you. Really, I do. But your problem has nothing to do with this one, and your problem doesn't mean that mine should be ignored. Sorry.<br />

Raaj: For once, you have pretty much posted my EXACT opinion on this. Most people wouldn't care, if they were concened about tsoemthin,bg it would be warrior balance issues. The kicker is tho, this little problem is far more likely fixed sooner, than the big one we face.<br />

Oh, and by the way, to whoever mentioned it, I DO own a Gloves of the Crimson Sigil. However this item was put into the game before the level cap was raised to 65, so I don't expect it to hit the high level mobs, or expect it to be changed to do so. It is, after all, older content.

Olafsky is correct, LDON should not provide the possibility to construct the 2nd best Warrior bp currently available in game, after timeless.  Yet it does. <br />
<br />
What should have been done is proper itemizing on BPs.  That is not the case.  And that is the exact reason why there are warriors runing around in plain of Time with Thurgadin BP's. SOE did a piss poor job of war bp itemization.  Instead of corecting it by adding some war usable BP's dropping in Elementals and Time (besides only timeless and rathe), they added one to LDON.  Grats every warrior in the game (who might have not killed anything past Vindi) on the possibility of making yourself the 2nd best BP in game.<br />

<br />
WHY is it that someone who puts in a minimum of 4 and closer 8 to 8 DAYS of play time, to put that in perspective, 100-200 HOURS, or 2.5 to 5 weeks of working every day, 9 to 5, should not be allowed, after that monstrous effort, to be able to get ONE item, for one of their what, 20 slots? that's not as good as what can be found in Time? Not to mention the fact that they can't make the time gear for anything outside of the basic armour slots, but even then, for those what, 8 items, they have to play 32-64 DAYS to obtain them?<br />
<br />
Why is that? What possible reason, other than &quot;well, they just shouldn't&quot; can you give? They put the time in, and they STILL can't match up to what Time people get, even in the few slots they CAN compete in.<br />
<br />
All I see here, is a culture and a way of thinking. That's of the &quot;have's&quot; thinking that they get what they want by virtue of who they are and where they're at (much like the aristocracy), and thinking that the people who aren't lucky enough to be where they are (IE, the peasants) somehow don't deserve anything near to what they have, no matter how hard they work, or what they do. Do they have a valid reason for it? No. The question is, do you? Can YOU give me any valid reason why those who don't work their ass off can't have some limited, and make no mistake, it IS limited, gear that STILL isn't as good as what can be found in Time?<br />
<br />
Secondly, you're also being quite ridiculous about that lack of BP's to begin with. Plate Ornate BP's are pretty damn good for where they're found, and are also quite easily obtainable. They easily work until the marble, or time BP. Even if you can't get that, you can easily take down Cursed for a BP of similar quality, and there's also AHR's BP, which is also aruably superior to LdoN's augmented BP. It has less HPs, but better AC, stats, resists, and effect, which makes up for it.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is... for the insane amout of time investment required, it's not unbalanced. That's far, far more time than many people will ever invest just to get one item. Those rare people that do will most likely be in a Time guild anyway. There's no reason to look down and spit upon people that do put the time in tho... I say, grats to them, we'll see you in another several hundred hours when you manage to get your next item down.<br />
<br />
Tell me, would YOU be willing to put in TWO THOUSAND HOURS to get a set of armour like that? Let me put that into perspective for you. that's almost ONE YEAR, playing the game 8 hours a day, five days a week.</div></div><hr />

No, you moron, Anger aggro is more than Ykesha aggro. As well, the entire Ykesha proc can be resisted in its entirely, while Anger cannot. If they're soley concerned about aggro, they're going to go with the Anger. And of course I noticed the resists (well, actually, more like immunity) and the fact that I still got aggro, you blithering idiot. You'd have to be completely blind not to.

You know, for someone who's trying to tell ME that I don't understand the basic game mechanics, I'm certainly glad *I'M* the one who's had to tell *YOU* why Anger is a better choice if you're soley concerned about aggro, because all YOU can seem to do is spout insults and not even answer the questions posted to you.<br />
<br />
I'll tell YOU why I chose Ykesha: #1, It was the only 2hander aggro augment available, #2, and this was definitely a minor consideration compared to the aggro, was because I wanted another tool to try to interrupt those chealing mobs... which, of course, didn't pan out.</div></div><hr />

So, until I see it go live and several people say that that's how many points it is, I'm going to go with the last offical number in hard that I've seen, which is 76.<br />
<br />
Secondly, there's not just that 60 or 90 mins per adventure.<br />
<br />
You have to take in the following:<br />
<br />
-Not every adventure will succeed, yo uknow it and I know it, no matter how good you are, shit happens<br />
-Putting together a groupand getting everyone grouped up and at the proper camp<br />
-Getting a good adventure<br />
-Getting to the adventure and buffing up<br />
-Clearing the adventure and clearing the boxes after (if they wish)<br />
-clearing often times makes more thgan 60 mins in Normal<br />
-Getting out of the adventure, getting back to the encampment, selling and splitting, and go back to step 3.<br />
<br />
All this takes time. Your calculations take none of these factors, all of which exist. That's why I give it about 2 hours per go, and since Normal is presently most effective, we go with 51 points.<br />
<br />
We're talking more like TWO HUNDRED hours. I think that's much closer to the truth. I'd have to say, probably 175 hours would be around right.<br />
<br />
You're using absolutely best case numbers that simply do not and cannot exist in the game... <br />
<br />
And remember, this is for a few select slots, and that while you're raiding, the taiders also have the chance of winning many other uber items with uber effects that the LdoN people have no chance of... like the all combat effects +10 mod, for example.<br />
<br />
Card: The reward for Time remains far greater than the reward for LdoN. That's just the way it is. I'm certainly not going to grudge LdoN people the limited things that they CAN get for all that time. Are you forgetting the far better stats on Time items, the far greater variety of items (IE good shit for every slot as opposed to a few limited ones) as well as all the nifty effects such as oh, I dunno, Combat effects, and Shielding? Not to mention the weapons that blow anything you can get in LDON right out of the water? Given a choice between LdoN and Time items, anyone I know would take Time instantly. There's just no question as to what's better, and HOW MUCH better it is.<br />
<br />
Wychway: No, on the contrary, the test showed that the stun of Force of Ykesha, if it works like the rest of them (which I see no reason why it should not) will give 250-275aggro, or so. ON TOP OF WHICH, the Ykesha spell can be resisted in its entirely, which is my expeirence gives no aggro whatsoever. AngerIII cannot be resisted.

While the LDoN guy puts in all the time, for ONE piece of gear. He's got to start from scratch, for his next piece, and he has NO chance of getting anything else the same quality along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hours someone is going to do LDON adventures are not comparible to the 4 years or 200 days of playing invested by warriors to be at the top of our game.<br />
<br />
Let me exemplify:  the President of Pepsi cola company goes to the same company and works the same hours as his secretary.  Yet his secretary make 20 k a year while he makes 20 million per year.  Is that fair? Yes it is.  Go cry me a river.<br />
<br />
You want this quality of loot, you invest 4 years of playing EQ, pushing to be at the top of your game, beating Velious, beating Sssra, beating VT, getting POP flaggs for yourself and all of your guildmates, doing elementals, and then gods.  You should not be able to get it through a month of playing LDON.<br />
<br />
So no, the peasantsas you put it are not deserving of the same quality loots as the rest.  No do us all a favor and crawl back to Vex Thall.  When you get into Time and see what it takes to get there, come back and post how this LDON bp is justified.<br />
<br />
Untill than do us all a favor, and don't post on this specific board again.</div></div><hr />

Mind you, you're saying that you can get to where you are in Time, by a month's worth of work in LDON.<br />

Don't be ridiculous. More like a YEAR in LDoN, at 40 hours a week, IE making this a fulltime job, to get HALF the slots even approaching elemental quality.<br />
<br />
Do the math for yourself.<br />
<br />
Who was it that posted Time loots up to quarm was up to 1 an hour?<br />
<br />
So call it a full raid of 72, it takes 72 hours for everyone to get a loot.<br />
<br />
LDoN guy gets one loot in 200 hours, that's not as good as time.<br />
<br />
Let me see, 3 loots in Time, or one in LDoN that's not as good as ONE in time. And you're saying even THAT much is somehow an affront to the people in Time? Jesus fucking Christ...<br />

As well, the entire Ykesha proc can be resisted in its entirely, while Anger cannot. If they're soley concerned about aggro, they're going to go with the Anger. And of course I noticed the resists (well, actually, more like immunity) and the fact that I still got aggro, you blithering idiot. You'd have to be completely blind not to. Oh, on full out resists, tho? No. There's no aggro generated. Try again.<br />
<br />
Um, no.<br />
<br />
First of all, anger isn't going to be as much aggro as ykesha. Anger isn't going to be as much aggro as a zero damage stun let alone a stun+DD. A stun is going to give you alot more than 300 hate unless you are fighting very low level mobs.<br />
<br />
It's obvious you are aren't a spell caster, and likely you have never talked to one either if you think a complete resist means no aggro. It doesn't matter if you are resisted or not, you get essentially the same aggro. There is even a large amount of people that think you get MORE aggro on a resisted spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Graal, I'm going off of tests that are found off of this link:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2814<br />
<br />
So, the evidence is in favor of it not being more than angerIII. Also remember that on a flat out resist with the DD/stun stuns, the DD component would certainly not land, which counts for more aggro. Unless you're saying DD aggro always counts, even if the DD = zero damage done?<br />
<br />
In regards to stun resist being no aggro, i can only relay my own experiences, that being I have never once had a mob turn on me after a reesisted proc stun, but only on ones that land. If someone can show some proof that the aggro does land, full resist or not, I'll be more than happy to take a look at it. Remember, not all spells have thier aggro component land... because if the aggro always counts for every spell, whether the spell landed or not, wy would they bother to make the hate spells unresistable? Their aggro would count whether the proc/spell landed or not, so it wouldn't matter....<br />
<br />
Resisted slows, big nukes, and the like, do have have aggro, agreed, but then I wasn't referring to them. I was referring to stuns. Perhaps the reality might be that upon a resist, there is aggro, but the aggro generated is far less than the aggro of the same spell, when it lands... makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi.  Die.  I've played since spring, 1999, have over 200 days played invested in my warrior alone.  I've had my fair share of non-POP raid content and I consider myself to be a skilled warrior.  I played my first couple years in small guilds of friends because I wanted to experience the game with friends.  I'm starting to progress in content, which is good, and I suspect some day I may be in Time.  But unlike the other 100 people who app'd with the Time guilds when they realized they needed more people, I haven't skipped content along the way.  Yes, I understand the concerted effort Time guilds spend getting to Time, but for individual players it doesn't require any more time commitment than literally hundreds of LDON missions.  Niether, in many instances, does it require more skill. <br />
<br />
For me and players like me this BP is where its at.  And when I'm not raiding, I'll be working my ass off to attain it.  Spending just as much time in dungeons as you might be spending sitting on your ass in PoTimeA.  <br />
<br />
In the meantime, go cry me a river over your 200 days played entitling you to superior loot.</div></div><hr />

Kiztent's tests ended up with a Holy Might doing &gt;= 450 hate. And I guarantee you that stuns aggro just fine on a resist, or when mobs are immune. Otherwise paladins would be greatly crippled in their aggro generation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the aggro landing when the mobs are immune, there's a distinction between the mob being immune, which everyone knows the aggro component still lands, and which I have personally experienced the same. and a flat out spell resist.<br />

<br />
You obviously don't know very much about the difficulty of this game if you think doing a mission 50 times that's basically unfailable with EP+ gear should produce gear anywhere close to Plane of Time that requires around 50 people to even do anything.<br />
<br />
The fact that after throwing 5K of APs at a LDoN buyable item and it's somewhat close to a PoTime item says a lot about just how powerful LDoN items are.</div></div><hr />

THAT smacks of poor design to me. Whether the aggro counts anyway is really competely beside the poiint, because aggro's only big for the tanks, and anyone else that would use it would use it because it actually does its job, and that's to stun.<br />
<br />
There's nothing else that i'm ticked about. Hell, I'm not even truly ticked at the stun not landing, it's just more of an annoying issue.<br />
<br />
And Phantron, LDoN items are not even truly comparable to Time items. They just aren't in the same league... If you max aug the HPs, sure, that ONE facet can compare, but the other several facets, that of AC, stats, resists, and effect, are never comparable. So if only 1 of 5 facets can ever compare to the item from time, it truly is not comparable, and the time investment is much much higher for LDoN. Time level guilds still enjoy a huge advantage both in quality of loot and the time it takes to get that loot... put it this way, if these items are so truly comparable... why don't we see these people get this gear? It is, after all, in their own words, comparable to Time gear.<br />
<br />
No, the truth is, it really isn't comparable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All Spells which do not can have any impact on the Monster ( stun mezz slow ..... ) cause of the level restrictions or the special behavior of the monster will do no amount of aggro any more.<br />
<br />
Then these ykesha augments are outdatet in any form.<br />
<br />
And for all ppl. here. Sure you buy them for aggro and in moment its not important if the stun does his job or not cause youre all only interested in the aggro part.<br />
<br />
But you all should know that Sony is a master of bad designing and crappy decisions. <br />
<br />
For me it would be nice if the Level 65 required augment Ykesha would do what should be done and that is stun up to Level 65.<br />
<br />
That would not change much in the moment, but it would be more logic than to have a stun who do not do his original job.<br />
<br />
What would the pallys cry when the got a new level 65 stun who would only affect Level 55 and below.  We - the non casting warriors - do love that thing cause of the aggro. Strange world.<br />
<br />
You can call me moron, but when I have to be level 65 to use that part, it should do its orginaire job and thats stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand that Daemon annoys the hell out of most of you, but that doesn't mean the basic issue is wrong.  If it has a recommended level of 65, then it should have the stun affect mobs a level 65 would be fighting regularly.  No, it's not a big deal, but smaller issues are dealt with by SOE.  And using the &quot;thats just the way it is&quot; line doesn't really make sense.  Sure, there are some things that are just the way they are, but that doesn't mean everything should fall under that.  Should we stop bitching about balance cause thats just the way it is?  Balance is obviously much more important, but the basic point is, some things are wrong and should be changed.  Maybe they could do a fix for it next time they are looking at doors in EFP that no one has tried to open since velious.  It does not make sense for it to not affect the mobs that the people who are supposed to get it would be fighting.  It simply doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
As for LDoN armor, I have to agree with Phantron there.  I'm no where near elemental, and probably will never be, but I don't think I should have access to armor that is comparable to Elemental / Time.  Though some people are being asses about it also.  Just cause we don't do the shit you do, doesn't mean we're gimps.  Some of us have put in just as much time, and have just as much skill, but choose to not go down the high level raiding path.  Also, being in an uber guild doesn't automatically make people skilled.  We've all seen uber guild idiots who are just A_Random_Raider_52 and when it comes down to it, suck ass.<br />
<br />
Next, Daemon, trust Graal, he's been one of the smarter people on this board that I've seen.  Yak procs are better than anger 3, not only that but you can get a cheap one and get all the aggro of the expensive ones.<br />
<br />
The saddest thing about this though, is that so many of you are caught up on hating / insulting Daemon, and so used to being shit on by SOE that you don't think much about it.  I know that it's a very minor thing and most of you don't care, but the fact is that it doesn't make sense in it's current form.  Though I personally will be getting Force just for the aggro, I just think it's another minor mess up by SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the issue is even more basic than that Hussar.  I think it all comes down to the fact that people are able to, nay WILLING to use spell effects that have zero detrimental effect on monsters just to hold aggro.  That's fucked up.  Stun wasn't designed to piss things off and cause it to lock on you.  Ykesha wasn't designed for it.  Force Shock wasn't designed for it. Anarchy wasn't designed for it.<br />
<br />
Quite honestly, the right thing that needs to be done is that they need to rework the hate caused by stuns in an intelligent way, and while they're at it, give warriors a REAL bonafide way to keep aggro, so that people aren't locked in to using gear that has no tangible effect on the fight except for the fact that it pisses mobs off.  55+ mobs are unstunnable, period (STFU Daemon, I don't give a fuck what kinda semantics you wanna say), that's the way it's always been, and I think that's the way it should stay.  That's not the problem.  The underlying problem is that people are so willing and outright happy to put procs that will never, ever land on anything they're fighting, just to get an aggro edge, and that's messed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My proof?  The Cleric spell Enforced Reverence.  Level 58 spell for clerics...doesn't land on anything over 55.  A cleric cannot stun a mob even level to him at 58 with his brand new stun.  This has been this way for ages, and has never been fixed even with the new &quot;idea&quot; that SOE has about you fighting mobs that are actually a challenge to you (close to your level or higher).  Yes, it's one of those &quot;annoying issues&quot; but it's the same situation.  Even the PBAE stuns for clerics don't land on anything but mobs 4-5 levels below them<br />
<br />
Yet paladins get Force of Akera at 53 that can land up to 61.  This means the developers know shit for balance.  End of story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah. The people getting the ykesha proc are getting it for aggro.<br />
<br />
If you don't want an aggro proc, you end up getting something else.<br />
<br />
I got the warm emerald shard, and some slimy coldstone fragments for giggles.<br />
<br />
When I get an expensive proc it's going to be the lifetap proc.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because I don't want the aggro that comes with a Ykesha proc.<br />
<br />
(I'm a monk).<br />
<br />
In fact a lot of my friends have their eye on the lifetap procs.<br />

Not only does it show resists are just the same aggro as when it works, it also shows that Damage Spells have very close to a 1 to 1 ratio with Hate, so 300 damage is very close to 300 hate.<br />
<br />
So a Ykesha with the 125dd is roughly 325+ hate, or more hate than Anger III</div></div><hr />

As I only have personal experience, and no hard testing done or seen, I'll concede that ALL spells MAY very well have the exact same aggro when resisted as when they land. <br />
<br />
However, in regards to your statement in regards to hate value of a stun, the thread I've linked's tests contradict your claim, and a paladin THERE also figures the aggro is less. Secondly, EVEN IF that was the case, Force of Ykesha's DD component would not land when there's a resist, which would drop your aggro down to 225. And Force of Ykesha IS resisted a significant portion of the time due to its zero modifier to its resist check. As Anger III is unresistable, it remains better aggro.  And that's even in your best case there, where you say it's not quite 10% better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, Graal. The tests that I've linked, give evidence that shows otherwise. Tell me, if you were in my shoes, which would you believe, tests, or some guy who insists that that's not the case, but offers no proof?<br />
<br />
His test is fundamentally flawed. Debuffs (a stun is considered a debuff) give hate proportional to the hp of the mob being fought. This guy was testing against mobs that were light blue to a 57. Are you going to be fighting mobs at that level?<br />
<br />
I tell ya exactly what i'm upset about, and this is the only thing I'm upset about: the only stun that level 65 melee can buy in LDoN, is so poorly designed that it won't actually do its job and stun any mob that that level 65 would normally fight.<br />
<br />
How many classes CAN stun mobs over level 55? How hard are those spells to get and what is the mana cost relative to a similar stun that doesn't affect mobs over level 55? What would be the effect of 20 melees in a raid all using weapons that proc a 65 level stun? <br />
<br />
Yet paladins get Force of Akera at 53 that can land up to 61. This means the developers know shit for balance. End of story.<br />
<br />
They did that for a reason. If you only have 1 functional stun (ie only 1 that actually hits a mob you are fighting) you will simply use the cheapest stuns you have. Adding this stun made it so that paladins burn a lot more mana than they used to. We can stun more often as well, but we don't end up using 15 mana stuns just for aggro. Look at the mana cost of Force of Akera and compare it to our other stuns...they wanted us to burn more mana. They had to give us some benefit for spending for that mana otherwise we wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

Sword of the Bloodsworn = Planar Strike, Stun 0.0/65<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder = Planar Stun, Stun 1.0/65<br />
<br />
Procs exist that stun an/or interrupt Up to level 65 mobs.<br />
<br />
To answer the question of &quot;what would happen on raids with 20 people&quot; etc... how many raid are 20 people beating on blue mobs, and what risk is there if they're clearing yardtrash anyhow, stun or no stun?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Hmm....I've seen paladins post on this board that they routinely use low level stuns for aggro generation. Claiming they don't merely because they don't stun seems fairly disengenuous.<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, why should there HAVE to be an upgrade for Paladin stuns when there is no balancing upgrade for Warrior Bash/Kick/Stun procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My spell line up is:<br />
<br />
Light of Nife (fast, single target heal)<br />
force of akilae (0 damage stun/65)<br />
force of akera (0 damage stun/61)<br />
QWoS (small damage, long duration, long recast stun/65)<br />
Heal over time<br />
Group heal<br />
DA<br />
Root<br />
<br />
If I'm fighting mobs below level 55, I will replace force of akera with cease. It costs far less mana and has the same effect. If I am fighting mobs that are 56-61, I will use force of akera because I can use it to stun mobs and interrupt casting. If I am fighting mobs that are 62+, I load cease again. Neither cease nor force of akera do anything on those mobs other than give me aggro, so why would I use the spell that costs 6 times as much mana if it gives the exact same effect?<br />
<br />
People have to have a compelling reason to use a spell. That is why they gave us a stun that would stun up to level 61...but costs a ton of mana compared to our similar stuns.</div></div><hr />

They had to give us some benefit if they expected us to use the spell. That shouldn't be that hard to figure out.<br />
<br />
Let's see, I have 2 spells: 1 that costs 15 mana and does nothing besides give me aggro and a spell that costs 90 mana and does nothing besides give me aggro. Hrmm, which one am I going to use?<br />
<br />
Force of Akera is SOE's attempt at making paladins use more mana to use stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Once again, why should they HAVE to give you some kind of benefit when they seem unable to do so for other classes re: Stuns? They EASILY could bump casting costs or code the specific Paladin spells to NOT give aggro or reduce their aggro instead. Your comments seem to be of the mindset that nothing bad should ever happen to a paladin - that's not 'balanced'.</div></div><hr />

The game is already stupidly easy enough, with nonsense like defensive ... and complete heal. Stunning mobs up to level 64 is just stupid.<br />

<br />
Cheal and defensive are two cornerstones of their respective classes, indeed of the game. Encounters are designed for the use of both of them.<br />
<br />
If you think the game is stupidly easy, why don't you get out of Velious, which was made years ago to challenge level 60 characters with no AA and far inferior gear, and actually find a challenge in PoP or LDoN, instead of whining on how easy it is. Why don't you go take your buddies on a LDoN Hard adventure, and then try and say it was stupidly easy. Tell your tank not to use defensive and your healer not to use Cheal on the named, and watch your group wipe.<br />
<br />
The game is NOT stupidly easy, that's just the level of content you *choose* to be at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-27-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Cheal and defensive are two cornerstones of their respective classes, indeed of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean they help the game in any way shape or form.<br />
<br />
In fact, when considering content DESIGN, those two abilities hamper the game far more than help it.<br />
<br />
And, as an aside, Feign Death was a cornerstone of its respective class. And has since been gimped, rather I mean, FIXED.<br />
<br />
&quot;Encounters are designed for the use of both of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly. Encounters HAVE to be designed around them. It pigeonholes Everquest content, and actually contributes to many of the problems the warrior class faces, oh so many expansions later.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you think the game is stupidly easy, why don't you ... [insert personal attacks here]&quot;<br />

&quot;The game is NOT stupidly easy, that's just the level of content you *choose* to be at.&quot;<br />
<br />
The game remains stupidly easy no matter what level you play at.<br />
<br />
And that's because the engine limited itself.<br />

CH has been broken for awhile now, and so has defensive.  They're broken by virtue of the fact that it is required to use them.<br />
<br />
You're really showing how much of the game you understand in this thread man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">09-27-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, superchum, someone who is &quot;beyond velious&quot; should have a little bit more to thier profile than 1 whole item from luclin+ that requires any kind of raid to get. Where's the Ssra stuff? Vex Thal? Lower tier PoP gear? You have none of it, except the stuff that's doable with one or just a couple of groups.  For someone who says it's stupidly easy, you should be decked out with all the best up to and including PoP, or at least have several items if you but recently started doing it.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the upper tier guilds that are cursing out RZtW, the Rathe, and Quarm would sure love to know that the game is &quot;stupidly easy&quot;. Tell me, if the game is so &quot;stupidly easy&quot;, why aren't YOU in elementals or time?<br />
<br />
Haass, I agree competely that cheal and defensive are fucking retarded ideas. The combination is very powerful. However with encounters being designed with that combination in mind, it doesn't trivialize the game at all. In fact many encounters in PoP are designed to get away from the old chealrot/defensive tank routine.<br />
<br />
ON the other end of the spectrum, ideas such as the common use of -300 or better to resist checks, mobs that can kill the biggest defensive tank in the game in ONE round, and mobs that you can plainly see and can effect you, but are untargetable *for no apparent reason*, or mobs with literally MILLIONS of hitpoints, are also competely fucking retarded ideas too. Mobs that can hit you for many times what you can hit them for, and they're hitting you with their bare fists or a fine steel weapon, while you are using one of the most powerful weapons in existance, and they're a LOWER LEVEL. Mobs that have 32k hitpoints as a level 55 warrior while you have less than a fifth of that with some of the best armour in the game. How about walls that never do anything to block or even mitigate an AE, or how mobs can aggro THROUGH walls, are also completely moronic. How about the magical weapon resizing between small races and large races? Ogre has a 8 foot long lance, gives it to a gnome, and it's all of a sudden 2 feet long, yet it does JUST AS MUCH DAMAGE. Or the fact that a little gnome tanks just as good on a giant as an ogre does? screw that I say, the way it SHOULD be, the giant should jsut step on the gnome, and squish, no more gnomer warrior. And what the hell is with NODROP items anyway? what, is the armour superglued to you? you can remove it, but not lose contact with it. What kind of crap is that? Hell, what about the fact that weapons and armour NEVER dull, get worn, break, or require any kind of maintenance or sharpening? How about the fact that warriors and other classes can get killed by mobs that are of far lower level than them, and have no weapons or armour? That sounds pretty lame to me.<br />
<br />
Hell, when I first started playing, I thought that needing 50+ or 70+ people to kill a single mob is a stupid idea. I figured just like in the single player role playing games, any 6 powerful characters should be enough to kill a big boss type mob.... <br />
<br />
There's no shortage of completely stupid ideas in this game, of which defensive and complete heal are among the least of them. Deal with the fact they're there, or move on, because none of it's going to be changing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VZ, TZ, Agnarr all dead in the past two weeks.<br />
<br />
Now get the hell off my nutsack Daemon.<br />
<br />
My gear has nothing to do with how stupidly easy Everquest &quot;tactics&quot; are.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
While we're on the topic of my gear ... who the heck are you to judge my gear?<br />
<br />
Maybe my gear is what it is because I'm not a loot whore. Maybe I only bid on items that are upgrades I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of. Maybe I actually have an upgrade path planned out. Maybe I don't stress out when my guild drops Emp and he turns around and doesn't drop any melee loot.<br />
<br />
Or maybe I'm too busy playing everquest to worry about how I've been wearing the same sleeves for over a year now.<br />
<br />
Then again, I wouldn't expect rational thought from someone who doesn't even know what one of the oldest weapon procs in the game can and can NOT do.<br />
<br />
But here's a little story for ya Daemon ...<br />
<br />
When I was in my 30s, and still a little green, I got told by &quot;high&quot; level people to &quot;STFU&quot; cause I was a newb and wouldn't understand their high end debates and issues.<br />
<br />
Riiiight.<br />
<br />
The same thing happened to me in my 40s, 50s, and 60s.<br />
<br />
Constantly people who were far too insecure about their own avatars, their own gear and their own place in the game would try and make me feel bad about my character.<br />
<br />
It doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I've slogged through this game at my own pace, having fun. I don't stress my gear. I don't stress the many failures I've had. I've enjoyed the many victories.<br />
<br />
I've been through Kunark ... where people used to berate me for not being impressed by Chardok Royals or Trak or VS.<br />
<br />
I've been through Velious. I didn't buy my AoW pants in the bazaar, I got em from the Avatar of War.<br />
<br />
And all the people who used to tell me how I'll never comprehend such weighty issues as NToV or Avatar of War level encounters, well, I think back and laugh. <br />
<br />
I've been through Luclin. Yeah, they switched the game up a bit, but not much.<br />
<br />
And now I'm slowly making my way through the planes of power.<br />
<br />
I used to get scoffed or scorned for saying high end everquest wasn't any different than killing Fippy Darkpaw, except there's more people there, a bit more lag and Fippy has a few more HPs.<br />
<br />
Nothing I've seen has changed that opinion.<br />
<br />
The game is fun. I like EQ. It's why I continue to play.<br />
<br />
But please, Daemon, you sound just like every other gimp who's told me &quot;OMG, STFU NEWB, KTHXLA.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deal with your own insecurities first. This is after all your own thread about how YOU feel robbed by the YKESHA proc.<br />
<br />
It's not suprising you'd lash out because the ONLY high end luclin item in my profile are shoulders from Shei. You're still pissed off because your Yak proc doesn't work all the time.</div></div><hr />

Especially when you go to zones like, say, Vex Thal (which I see you're keyed for) where you gain 30+ items PER raid. It'll take less than a month in VT where your average person's on the raid is going to have a good couple of upgrades. Let alone the common items from mobs in Ssra which you're also mysteriously missing. So when you claim to have been through an entire expansion, yet have next to nothing to show for it, you're going to get people thinking you're full of shit. Only logical explanation is that if you've been these places, it's been like... twice.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you still haven't answered my question.<br />
<br />
If the game is so &quot;stupidly easy&quot;, why aren't you in elementals? You say you're &quot;working on&quot; RZ, Bert, and Rydda Dar... why aren't you past em? You say it's stupidly easy, wouldn't that make you a moronic incompetent by YOUR own standards, if you aren't able to blow through this &quot;stupidly easy&quot; content? Tell me, have you taken a warrior into a Hard mission in LDoN yet and not used defensive on the named mobs?<br />
<br />
You know what, there's a reason why you get told to shut up and that you're a n00b all the time... it's because you sound like one. You sound like someone who has absolutely no clue what encounters in PoP and Hard/Raid LDoN is like. They are most assuredly NOT easy, especially the closer you get to elementals... with the possible exception of if you just take 72 and zerg the fuckers, which takes no talent or skills at all.</div></div><hr />

I will answer one of your questions though:<br />
<br />
&quot;If the game is so &quot;stupidly easy&quot;, why aren't you in elementals?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everquest is indeed stupidly easy. But easy doesn't mean FAST. It still takes time. There's competition for the flagging mobs, and a whole bunch of other crap. So it still takes time.<br />
<br />
But by no stretch of the imagination does everquest require &quot;talent&quot; or &quot;skill.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's fun. It's entertaining. It's a great game that many of us dedicate obscene amounts of time to.<br />
<br />
But seriously, if you want a hobby that requires skill, take up Tennis. Or hunting. Or Rock Climbing. Or Yachting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd disagree, to a point.  I believe that there are large numbers of people who raid who do so with a minimal amount of &quot;talent&quot; and &quot;skill&quot;.  They're cannon fodder.  Basically they just do as they're told and press the right buttons at the right times.  Most of the time their major &quot;talent&quot; is following rudimentary directions.<br />
<br />
However, you have to have a core group of leaders with a significant amount of &quot;talent&quot;.  They have to be able to hold together a diverse group of people, many of who often times don't even like each other, and turn them into smoothly running machine, or at least pretty close to one.  They have to research a large number of targets, be willing to attempt new tactics, even when this may cause huge amounts of wasted time and political fall out.  They have to be flexible, thoughtful, and willing to deal with a vast amount of bullshit.  That is, if they're any good at their jobs to begin with.<br />
<br />
There is talent required in raiding, this I don't doubt in the least.  But the fact of the matter is, just because you're in a raiding guild doesn't mean you're one of the ones with the talent....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trial and error.<br />
<br />
As Glatius says: &quot;Most of the time their major &quot;talent&quot; is following rudimentary directions.&quot;<br />
<br />
The social and organizational skills required to efficiently run a guild are another matter entirely, and not at all what I was talking about.<br />
<br />
I was talking about high end ENCOUNTERS.<br />
<br />
The COMBAT SYSTEM itself.<br />
<br />
With in game ABILITIES, like complete heal ... disc defensive ... STUN ... etc., etc., etc.<br />
<br />
The combat system in Everquest is very limited. And as such, the game does not require &quot;SKILL&quot; to figure out.<br />
<br />
That's my only point.<br />
<br />
Some people, who I'm sure will gladly continue to flame me, seem to think it takes skill to figure out the &quot;strategy&quot; behind the actual fights.<br />
<br />
It doesn't.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt SKILLS are involved in raiding.<br />
<br />
I doubt SKILLS are involved in FIGHTING MONSTERS in everquest.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ankesilke</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This whole thread was an interesting read.  There is one thing you guys seem to forget.  The majority of EQ players (24 out of 25) will never see the elemental planes.  Even for warriors, it was mentioned here that were only 50 out of 1000 warriors with Raex or better BPs in the game.  Pretty low chance for most on uber gear and content.<br />
<br />
That said, the majority of EQ players are not in high end guilds and play roughly 2 to 3 times a week for a few hours.  Sony knows this.  That's why the last two expansions(LOY and LDON) have been geared towards the casual player and the non-high end guild player.  After the failure of both the Luclin and POP expansions for Sony (Losing many players) with the timesinks for keying, bane weapons, flagging and such, Sony does not want to lose the majority of its playing base any further.<br />
<br />
Thus, the weapon augs/procs and the Gear that can be purchased in LDON (and debated heavily here ) support the majority of EQ players.  The best equipment still drops in Time - yes - and it should.  However, the casual player, should be able to progress to nearly the same level, without being in a high, end guild (This is Sony's new view IMO)<br />
<br />
You see, Sony makes more money on the number of players playing the game, not on the minority of high end players in high end guilds that play for 6 hours stretches or more every day.

This whole thread was an interesting read.  There is one thing you guys seem to forget.  The majority of EQ players (24 out of 25) will never see the elemental planes.  Even for warriors, it was mentioned here that were only 50 out of 1000 warriors with Raex or better BPs in the game.  Pretty low chance for most on uber gear and content.<br />
<br />
That said, the majority of EQ players are not in high end guilds and play roughly 2 to 3 times a week for a few hours.  Sony knows this.  That's why the last two expansions(LOY and LDON) have been geared towards the casual player and the non-high end guild player.  After the failure of both the Luclin and POP expansions for Sony (Losing many players) with the timesinks for keying, bane weapons, flagging and such, Sony does not want to lose the majority of its playing base any further.<br />
<br />
Thus, the weapon augs/procs and the Gear that can be purchased in LDON (and debated heavily here ) support the majority of EQ players.  The best equipment still drops in Time - yes - and it should.  However, the casual player, should be able to progress to nearly the same level, without being in a high, end guild (This is Sony's new view IMO)<br />
<br />
You see, Sony makes more money on the number of players playing the game, not on the minority of high end players in high end guilds that play for 6 hours stretches or more every day.  Even on Zeb, my guild is one of the top ten.  But all of those members in those guilds add up to less than 10% of the whole server.<br />

On Veeshan we have 13 or 14 guilds in the elemental planes and 3 guilds in Time. Your numbers are bullshit. People like you have been spewing garbage like this for as long as I can remember, the only thing that has changed is the venue.<br />
<br />
&quot;People are forgetting that only the top 1% of players will ever step foot inside TOV.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;People are forgetting that only the top 1% of players will ever kill Trakanon and see VP.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People are forgetting that only the top 1% of players will ever see Vex Thal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do I need to go on? Learn from history nephew.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Time 1-2, Elemental 2-4 guilds is more like the average. Casual players will constitute the majority of the playerbase when considered across all servers and wether they play as much or not they still contribute their subscription. <br />
<br />
That's not to say that SoE can justly ignore/abuse it's most loyal and dedicated players however.<br />

<br />
In the warriors case in particular (given how gear oriented we are) is the reason that most 65 warriors are elemental raiders mostly due to attrition since it is far more difficult to advance if you aren't a member of or cannot commit the time to be in a dedicated raid guild?<br />
<br />
Plus i imagine with warrior issues as they currently stand warriors without a clear purpose (MT in a raid guild) will often be left gathering dust.</div></div><hr />

You just created an artificial universe.  Maybe 40% of the level 65s are in EP on your server (on my server that isn't true, but hey).   Doesn't matter. Most people aren't level 65.  Yeah, I got the mudflation thing down and I understand the population on most servers leans toward the high end.  But if I /who all my class I find a lot fewer 65 warriors than 60 warriors.  And for all the guilds in the EP with their huge numbers (like Val, I'd reckon 4-5 guilds is more normal), you'll see 50 non-EP guilds wandering around trying to kill Tawro or having fun single grouping Talendor.  Sure more guilds reach the high-end &quot;old&quot; content when a new expansion is released with levels, skills and spells that makes the content viable, like NTOV and VT, but a whole helluva lot more will never get that far.  The average EQ player will never get that far.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the average EQ player will also probably never pass through enough missions to purchase a fully-augmented 1495 peice of armor.  I don't believe the mission environment is conducive to casual gaming.  I suspect the player who will purchase this is the long-time EQ gamer who puts in a lot of time, is maybe in a Velious/Luclin level guild, and is striving to better the character w/o leaving the guild. <br />
<br />
Dae, in relation to ripping on Wubao for his keys versus his gear, Povar is a rotation server with one notable exception.  Wubao is in a guild who is part of all the high-end rotations through Luclin.  But with rotations, you don't see that shit but like once every 6-7 weeks.</div></div><hr />

for those wondering why I haven't posted anything else on the thread... I just decided not to respond any further to any of the antagonistically written posts.<br />

As to why I put it in Sanctuary as opposed to War Room... I accidentally posted it in the wrong forum. Sue me.</div></div><hr />

Depends on the part of Luclin you're talking about.<br />
<br />
I've seen Sraa a lot more than twice.<br />
<br />
Shit just doesn't drop in there.<br />

/shrug<br />

But Vig is right. It's a rotation server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;You know, superchum, someone who is &quot;beyond velious&quot; should have a little bit more to thier profile than 1 whole item from luclin+ that requires any kind of raid to get. Where's the Ssra stuff? Vex Thal? Lower tier PoP gear?&quot;<br />
<br />
That includes more than just VT.<br />
<br />
And all that crap you posted was merely to call into question the fact that I stated the game was not hard.<br />
<br />
My gear, again, has nothing to do with the combat engine.<br />
<br />
Which makes the game EASY. Stupidly easy as I put it.<br />
<br />
So I've not been through VT 5 million times.<br />
<br />
I HAVE been to and through VT.<br />
<br />
I have helped kill every major mob in all of Luclin, except for Seru, at least once.<br />
<br />
Which means I've seen the fights. I've seen the strategies.<br />
<br />
Again, what exactly about EVERQUEST COMBAT is DIFFICULT or CHALLENGING?<br />
<br />
Please, enlighten me, since my Aten/Emp/Cursed/Shei kills don't entitle me to know jack shit about high end Luclin content or raiding.</div></div><hr />
