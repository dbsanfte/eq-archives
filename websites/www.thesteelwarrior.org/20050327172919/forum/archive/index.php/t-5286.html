<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting a bit tired of this raid. We have tried it 5 times or so now, the last 2 times we got him to 17% and 30% respectively, but then he heals up to 70-79% again and eventually we run out of steam and wipe.<br />
<br />
The emote when he stuns everyone and walks back to his spawn spot is this:<br />
<br />
Valdoon Kel`Novar calls out to the lost soldiers of his alluvium army.  His battle cry summons their essence and heals his battle wounds!<br />
<br />
He did that 5 times tonight, but it was only on the last one his hp jumped almost back up to full. And that was just after a bunch of shaman wolf swarm pets had been killed. So I am not sure of, is wether his sudden jump in HP is related to deaths since last AE?<br />
<br />
Basically I am curious wether  this can be avoided, or if we really need to beat him down several times from 70-80%ish percent.<br />
<br />
As for the adds, we are killing them off as they pop, and that do not seem to be a big problem.<br />
<br />
Its also kinda annoying that the real Valdoon seemingly can spawn randomly in west or north lair. The western lair seem more comfortable since adds only pop outside there.<br />
<br />
Oh well, another 3 hours down the drain :p</div></div><hr />

Maybe cc them cause the emote sounds he is healing off the dead. Dont kill em try that hopefully that works. Adds might have set number. I am not sure as i have not done this.</div></div><hr />
