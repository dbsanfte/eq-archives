<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dinged 66 last night!! I noticed that my weapon skills and offensive/defensive skills were going up  (stats too! yay 310 dex).  Anyone know if taunt skill goes up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't think so.  That would be nice though :/.  I'm almost 67 and haven't gotten a taunt skillup yea, and lord knows I've hit the button enough times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No taunt skill ups through 69, doubtful at 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I haven't heard of anyone getting any :(<br />
<br />
It was the first question I was asked when I mentioned to the group I just gotten a Defense skill bump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hola-<br />
<br />
Key bit is taunt still works like it always did; I know that sounds kinda obvious, but think about it... taunt always failed MUCH more often on yelllow/red mobs.  But now there are fewer yellow/red mobs pre-OoW, so taunt has actually gotten a BIG boost in effectiveness.  Stuff that used to shrug off multiple taunts (pof table mobs, for instance) become MUCH less resistant once they go white/dk blue.<br />
<br />
Levels &gt;&gt;&gt; all else (stats, skills, even gear)<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought that your level, the mobs level, and your taunt skill level (capped at 230 atm) were all a part of the pass/fail check for taunt.  Is this correct or is the skill level not part of the equation? (hehe if so then the boots of dispair taunt skill mod would be worthless eh?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are the new skill/ability caps posted anywhere yet? I did a quick search and couldn't find them.  More curious than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe offense and defensive cap at 270 now.  I don't know why they didn't just give us 5 points per level to a 275 cap, but they felt like gimping it a bit to 270.  <br />
<br />
L66 -- 255 cap<br />
L67 -- 259 cap (there's where I'm at)<br />
I would guess...<br />
L68 -- 263<br />
L69 -- 267<br />
L70 -- 270</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah still no taunt skillup at 70 , /agree with remf as to less failures</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most skills either go up 3 or 4 per level... probably some exception here and there but nothing to really worry about.  It's not like you won't have all your skills maxed long before you get your next level (except 70 of course).<br />
<br />
Being higher level makes a huge difference on Taunt.  At level 70 you can even taunt a good deal of older bosses, including stuff from GoD, with pretty good reliability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good to hear about the level advantages... it does make the decision harder as to whether I grind straight to 70.  I spent all my saved AA (30 pts) by L67.  I'm definitely going to 68, then I was thinking about doing some AA (about 20 pts worth) before I level up more and require even higher level mobs to get good exp.  As we know at L70 you want to be hunting all L65+ mobs if you can.  At 68 they just have to be 63+.<br />
<br />
It sounded like a good plan, but damn, the advantages of leveling in many game calculations, the skill increases, and the big hit point bonus for dinging 70 make that really tempting too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Being able to taunt better is more useful than any AAs you could've got.<br />
<br />
Better defense doesn't hurt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hehe I'll ask this a lil differently this time... does your taunt skill level have any noticable bearing on your success rate or is it so minor that the higher levels impact on your success/fail rate simply dwarfs the taunt skill's impact?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Being higher level increases the chance of taunt succeeding dramatically.  There just isn't that many 70+ mobs in this game (yet), and certainly not in the content before OoW.  For example Ikkinz raid 4 only Keeper of the Altar is yellow, and everything else is blue, so you can taunt everything in there as if it's just an XP mob.  That actually helps a lot on the memblur golems that you'd normally only have at most 25% chance to taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Foddwin Rottinluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My skills seem to go up only 4 per level.<br />
<br />
I got <br />
<br />
66 254<br />
67 258 ( where I am at now )<br />
<br />
I also am not sure what the other skills will go up to since they were mot all 250 caps to begin with ( ie Dodge )<br />
<br />
my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At level 70 Piercing goes up to 270 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">it is 4 per level not five.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Foddwin Rottinluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Defense just went to 259 at level 67.<br />
