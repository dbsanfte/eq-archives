<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How long did it take you?  Is it just a random drop off of any shroom down there?  Is the LZO the place to set up camp?  or is there a safer spot?  I would like to try to camp it with my warrior and cleric 2-box, but I'm afraid it will be a little dicey without snare.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of spending 5pp a shrink 10 times a night but there is never a cobalt bracer for sale on test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup really rare drop off mushrooms, think mine came off a priest a couple years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got mine a couple months ago with Me, a shaman and a druid.  Spent about 3 hours there hoping for a fungi for the shaman (with no luck).  However, my cobalt bracer dropped.  A miconid warrior droppped it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I spent way too much time getting myself, a friend, and my wife each a Reet Crown for the Crown of Deciet. On the last day ( day 7 ) we were headed down to Reets and Juggs and a Myco Warrior dropped my Cobalt Bracer. I was exstatic, because I wanted one ever since I started the game and I saw it on EQPrices.<br />
<br />
Also got an RBG a month before that, dropped as you went down the sewer pipe to the room that looks like a jail. I have found that if you go in looking for loot you are sorely dissapointed, but if you are just blowing some time and hanging with friends that eventually the loot finds you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i have seen several cobalt bracers drop over the years, and all have been from warriors and reavers, as i've somehow made a mental note of that. <br />
<br />
safe spot? not really, i don't think so, as shrooms wander the halls down there. your best bet is to sit in the corner by King camp, as you're only going to get one wanderer there.<br />
<br />
on another note, i'll let you in on a little secret about getting King single if he's teamed up with 2 clerics or whatever. just pull a shroom to the corner camp and king will aggro, solo. if you push him into the corner, he will be OOR from the healers on the pedestal. but everyone in the camp has to be 65. for the solo pull. i duo this camp sometimes with a 65 shaman.

as for snare, just use your snare whip, they have enough HP for it to proc in time. or just let cleric root at 20%, there are no shaman shrooms so none have sow.<br />
<br />
i suppose you could set up camp in the small brain room on your  right exiting the first jail door too, with 2 frog spawns inside.</div></div><hr />

I swear Rallos Zek must be punishing me.  Weird thing is tho, we got like 4 fungi's in a week.  This was after fungi drop rate was decreased.  GDI that pisses me off thinking of it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cobalt always seemed to me to drop the absolute least. No matter where you went, Singing Steel and Elder Spiritist crap was flowing like Niagara Falls, but Cobalt was painfully rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went to Sebilis with a small group, intent on getting a cobalt bracer... first priest we killed dropped it.<br />
<br />
Short trip :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did a king camp 3 days a week for 8 weeks and finally got one near the end of my trek ( AND NOT ONE FUNGI DROPPED, BWAHAHAHA)<br />
<br />
Before PoP, it was a lot of fun doing that camp, and it was good exp. Now Seb is pretty much dead, I'd suggest if you can get friends though, camping it is a good way to go.<br />
<br />
Btw, got mine off a reaver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've seen two cobalt bracers fall, though wasn't camping for either. We used to spend a lot of time down among shrooms. One off warrior, one off reaver I'm pretty sure. They're pretty rare, but there are lots of shrooms, and with the kill rate of a modern pop group it would probably take a lot less time than I remember.<br />
<br />
The first cobalt bracer drop sort of created this thing in our guild. We'd been down there a bit, and in frustration a friend called out in /gu &quot;BRUNG ME COBLATN LA~&quot;. Next mob drops the bracer. So now when we really want something, we use the brung shout. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The best 20k I ever spent a couple years ago. . .and hasn't depreciated.  Let's face it, stuff like this is easier to buy when stuff like ornate grows on trees.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've only seen 1 Cobalt Bracer drop. It was on a Myconid Warrior near Juggs. I lost the roll to a GNOME! &lt;mumbles to himself&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I camped lower exit whenever I could for months, finally saw one drop and a %@$#ing cleric won it.  Only one I ever saw.  Ended up getting a deal on one from a friend for like 7.5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">WTF was a gnome doing with a cobalt bracer??!!<br />
<br />
Second - WTF greed roll on a cobalt bracer?  Here gimme that donals helm of yours (back when they was rare) or bootz pleeb!<br />
<br />
Reminds me of a guildy of mine in Seb doing jail/armsman and an RBG dropped.  Fookin greed roll (he had a FBSS) and a cleric won it...  GRR!<br />
<br />
Had the audacity to /auction it to the zone for 55k (what it went for then)... ghey...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got one making our way to Juggs :)<br />
We must have killed tons of shrooms to get there since we kept getting adds but I wasnt sure what it actually dropped of or where since that was my first time down there. I guess I got lucky. It blew my mind I actually saw someone looting it.<br />

<br />
Trust me, if I could buy one for 20k I would raise the cash and buy it.  I paid 60k for the one on my TM warrior.  Unfortunately I play on a low-population server where almost nobody camps seb except to do bugs for plat and there haven't been any for sale at any price that I've seen.<br />
<br />
I might give it a try one of these nights.  Should be a good challenge to try to two-box it and it could save me some plat on mana batteries.  I have never been able to bring myself to put in on the VT shrink bracer becuase I could just get a cobalt one instead, but that's easier said than done.<br />

Thanks everybody for the info.</div></div><hr />
