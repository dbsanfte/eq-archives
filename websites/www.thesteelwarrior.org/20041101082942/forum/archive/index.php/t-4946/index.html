<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Senthiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Always said I'd never ask for a gear check, but I sort of set myself a goal to reach 6k HP's unbuffed and I'm running up close to my deadline. :)<br />
<br />
I should preface this with the fact that I belong to a very casual guild, and it will be remaining that way. :cool: Too many good peoples to go looking for greener grass.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I don't have a ton of cash to rely on, and tend to like earning my items where I can.  I know I'll have to make some purhases at some point.  <br />
<br />
Right now I am looking at getting my hands on a Black Plated Collar if I ever see one for sale at any point on Povar.  I'm also working towards getting my hands on ornate arms.<br />
<br />
Are there any sugggestions for other possible upgrades that don't require access to Vex Thal or tier 4 planes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ring of slime in CT try and get some 100 hp bracers. Crinose cape of the Werewolf is cheap 80 hp back piece. If you go 1hs that is bound to add some hp. Possibly a different haste item with some hp? all i can think of atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You don't have a great many choices, IMO. Not without spending significantly large amounts of plat.<br />
<br />
-Amygdalan Chain Mask would be your biggest upgrade, it's also the best droppable mask for warriors. Or, Rotting Eye mask is a cheaper alternative. Even a darkmetal Visor has 40hp, drops in Storms, or is fairly cheap to buy.<br />
<br />
-Helmet of Rallos Zek if you can find one for sale<br />
<br />
-Kizrak's Arms are a bit of an upgrade<br />
<br />
-Crinose Cape of the Werewolf for your back is a possibility.<br />
<br />
-Stonewood(or other elemental bow) Combound Bow for Range<br />
<br />
bout all I can think of off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since you've unlocked Miragul's, Malevolent Vambs of Suffering. Slap a haste aug in there and upgrade mask.<br />
<br />
 EDIT: What the hell was I smoking? Get haste aug only if you get something in the slots it goes in. K, done babbling now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Range item <br />
<br />
Bone Carved Shortbow<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: RANGE  <br />
Skill: Archery  Atk Delay: 40<br />
DMG: 38  AC: 5<br />
STA: +7  AGI: +7  HP: +50  SV DISEASE: +10<br />
Range: 175</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Senthiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ahhh if only I could put a haste item in the arms slot.. :)<br />
<br />
I noticed they're usually head, back, waist only types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Malevolent Vambs are pretty neat, and a fair upgrade to SS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">20ac 55hp mask off easy 2 day spawn named in SG.. Lazura or something.  Group of 65s can take her np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Could try for Shaderock Amulet. Drops from VD in Akheva and is 100hp. Can do with one group of 65's (or more to make it a little quicker).  We pull him to ME zone and theres no adds to worry about once you have him separated from his friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even the kylong visor from Veksar would be an upgrade (providing you get haste elsewhere) - AC 15, 5 str, 3 dex, 6 sta, 30 hps, 10 cold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Would recommend doing hard LDONs.<br />
<br />
Hard Miragul's (EF) has a 36% haste cloak on the loot table with 90 hp and various stats (I have in my magelo).<br />
<br />
Hard MM drops 80 hp shoulders with v2 (?).<br />
<br />
Consider doing Ruj for the 40 hp augs.<br />
<br />
Ring of Slime in CT can be done with a minimal amount of people for Crystallized Acid bracer.<br />
<br />
There should be a few range slots floating around that have better hp than your bow.  Sandwich of Foul-smelling herbs is a 25 hp upgrade.  Think there's an LDON range as well.  Or you could shell out for an obsidianwood/stonewood/featherwood etc bow.<br />
<br />
Ring upgrades are either time-consuming (Ring of the Shissar) or expensive (elemental earth ring).<br />
<br />
edit: there's a 100 hp ring that drops in hard MM advs, it's one of my current rings.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here are some upgrades you can get for under 10k and with just two groups:<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Do the Strength of the Elements quest. 100hps on your shoulder is great to have.<br />
<br />
Range: There are several cheap bows that have more than 25hps on them.<br />
<br />
Neck: Fierce Heraldic Collar is an upgrade<br />
<br />
Face: Fierce Visor here also<br />
<br />
Cloak: There is a very common LDON drop than Daemon mentioned, the Werewolf cloak. Goes for 4k or less on Zeb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hitting 6k unbuffed is damn near impossible w/out Tier 4. <br />
<br />
The must haves:<br />
Strength of Elements<br />
Helm of Rallos Zek<br />
100hp elemental bow<br />
2x Crystallized Acid Bracers<br />
tak or miragul's bp, legs &amp; arms.<br />
shaderock amulet<br />
<br />
Don't forget your main &amp; offhand also. <br />
<br />
In the end, I don't think all of those would be enough, its gonna take a lot of 40hp augs to get you to the mountain top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually it might be possible...since I'm bored I broke it down assuing 1 point of STA gets you 6hps...if that is correct. If it isn't I'm sure someone will pop out of a bush and point it out. This should give you a rough idea anyway. <br />
<br />
Earrings: keep 'em. <br />
Neck: Talisman -&gt; Shaderock Amulet --net--&gt;  +32hp (-5 sta)<br />
<br />
Mask: MoF -&gt; Amygyalan Chain Mask --net--&gt; +100hp (+8 sta)<br />
<br />
Helm: Kizrak's -&gt; Helm of Rallos Zek (assuming your guild hunts AoW) --net--&gt; +82hp (+7 sta)<br />
<br />
Wrists: Kizrak's -&gt; 2x Crystalized Acid Bracer --net--&gt; +134hp (+4 sta)<br />
<br />
Arms: SS -&gt; Malevolent Vambraces of Suffering --net--&gt; +40hp<br />
<br />
Gaunts: keep them. (seriously!)<br />
<br />
Finger: nothing really better out there unless you're rich. <br />
<br />
Range: Nightmarewood -&gt; Featherwood --net--&gt; +165hp<br />
<br />
Back: keep it for ubuffed stats (sta). <br />
 <br />
Shoulder: keep.<br />
<br />
Chest: keep.<br />
<br />
That right there should get you to 6k. Unfortunately you have no haste item. LDoN solves this problem. <br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
Ring of Mold: 8 dex, sta, wis, int, 85 hp/mana, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
plus<br />
<br />
Type 3: Gravestone Fragment of Flailing Dead, Worn Effect: Haste (36%) <br />
 <br />
equals (=)<br />
<br />
Hastey ring! ...and net +15hps!<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
5500 + 568 = 6068<br />
<br />
That's a lot of running around...shouldn't hurt ya in the pp dept too bad...still a huge time sink...but that's what its gonna take to get to 6k unbuffed. My suggestion is to quit EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually if you're going for best droppable mask it's the thulian visage of horror.  Personally I'd say honker down in CT for some time and you should see substantial upgrades there, bracers, earring, mask, etc.  hell even the 1hb from the horror construct would work, they are like blades of carnage minus the aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">also scalecracker in ring of fear event, nice hast/ac/hp in a range slot and tradeable.<br />
<br />
the earrings I know aren't a upgrade, but the earring from escort gnome would be, also 10th ring war, might be doable for you = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Senthiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't see where I could even put a haste augment into  finger slot.  Unless I'm missing something?<br />
<br />
Going to buy a Black Plated Collar, Upgrade the arms and pump into inate Stamina.  Also going to upgrade the bow for some HP's and by time all is said and done according to the magelo I've been playing with, I should crack 6k.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your help and suggestions. ;) Keep em coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You have obviously done Vindi, so I'm betting you could also drop Dozer in HoT.  With that option, try looking at Silver Bracelet of Speed, Pauldons of the Deep Flame, or even the Silver Charm of Tranquility (as a neck-item).<br />
<br />
Work on 10th Ring if you have friends you can call on for help in the War.  For 300-ish points, you can also buy the 10STA augments, a reasonable investment in my mind.<br />
<br />
Lots of good suggestions also made above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Crumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you can do Vindi, you should be able to handle Targrin, the fool in Tactics that drops the black plated collar.  Even Doomshade for his 41% haste earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There are actually several options available.  If you're capable of Vindi, you're probably capable of Yelinak, who has 2 decent 41% haste items (Gaunts of Dragon Slaying and Yelinak's Talisman) which would both be upgrades to your current gear.  That'd free up your mask for an Amy mask or the ole Pirate Eyepatch.  <br />
<br />
Also, you'd get probably about the same aggro, slightly less DPS, but more HP with a dual-weild configuration instead of the staff.  CHoS and the shortsword from Droga each have reasonable stats.<br />
<br />
You also may want to unlock Takish armors, the sleeves are exceptionally good, imo...especially with the 40hp aug at the same camp.<br />
<br />
Shoulder consider camping for a barbed rubicite pauldron, or if you think you can muster the forces to OT the Guardian of the Seal while you kill his guards, the Strength of the Elements would work.<br />
<br />
Another good, and often overlooked, necklace is one I recommend:  Torque of Tamed Flame from Sol C.  AC: 10 STR: +8  STA: +8  CHA: +5  WIS: +5  INT: +5  HP: +50  MANA: +50  SV FIRE: +20  SV DISEASE: +10  SV COLD: +20  SV MAGIC: +10  SV POISON: +10...I mainly love it because it's a universal resist item. <br />
<br />
And, also, again, if you can kill Vindi...you can probably easily handle the 10th Ring event.  Yes, it takes 90 mins or so...but the ring and the other rewards usually keep folks coming.  <br />
<br />
Range item:  Nightmare is ok, but if you can scrape up *some* plat you could probably get a featherwood/stonewood which would be as useful an upgrade, if not there are several +50 hp items that can go in the range slot for tanking purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Old HoT quest stuff, along with heavy augments from LDoN can have you break 6k unbuffed easily without elementals or VT access. This is the magelo of one of my friends before she quit EQ, doing everything with just like 1-3ish group forces of friends (she was guildless) or less for most things. <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=794267&amp;alt=0<br />
<br />
Some of the stuff may be out of your reach if you don't want to spend hellish amounts of time in LDoN for all of the augments, but you can still get your stats way up there without high end raiding access without problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">4 Doze quest loots huh?  Doze is week long spawn, that's A LOT of goddamned farming, or a lot of loot whoring with 1-3 groups of people.  One or the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah but Doze drops multiples, and the lesser named in the wing are less. This is assuming you don't want it all in 1 day which would be impossable anyway.<br />
<br />
I'd personnaly go with Eyepatch of plunder for your face slot if you have lots of time, i still carry it on me even tho i replaced it so i can use the clicky. Also its not that bad of stats with like 50 hp and some resists and decent AC for a mask.<br />
<br />
Kizrak for arms. Since its very possable to 1 group rhag 1, get your guild together and try to take out the whole cycle in the not to distant future, 40 AC 85 hp arms<br />
<br />
Definatly make friends with someone in a EP to get one of the bows, they are so good overall you wouldn't replace till the time clicky(get the stonewood one, disease + AoB is very sexy)<br />
<br />
could get the neck from PoI dragon for haste and some more hp... and of course the old HoT qests are still very nice for most people(hell i was in time and a bracer from him would be an upgrade)</div></div><hr />
