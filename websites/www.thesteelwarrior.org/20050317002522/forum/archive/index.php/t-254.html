<br />
I am planning on putting together 4c group within the guild for exp and hopes of a fleshgrinder. I've searched for info on the lizard who drops it and the 4c location but couldnt find anything usefull. Things im looking for ....<br />
<br />
How hard he hits  (A Thul Tae Ew Adept)<br />
Is he a caster<br />
A suggested camp spot for the 4c area. <br />
Any other useful tidbits. <br />
Pulling tactics<br />
Is he slowable<br />
Does he spawn in 1 of the 4 corners or does he wander<br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spawns in one of the corners. Last time I camped him we camped the near left corner as you enter 4c. Watch out for the AoE slow they proc, it's a true pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
You can camp the corner he spawns in if you keep a spawn timer up. I was there for 8 hours and saw him once, and he didn't drop it, by the way *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winden</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did he drop the earring tarsk? Does he always drop either the sword or earring? Anyone have a definite corner he spawns in as well? Im wondering if he could pop randomly at any corner. And sigh, I hear ya on the AoE slowers. What a pita.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a map that lists his spawn location.  His is location A:<br />
<br />

<br />
No idea if there is a drop every time of either the fleshgrinder or the earring, but I would guess that you would always get one or the other.  I have never seen one not drop, but haven't been there for many kills on him to date.</div></div><hr />

That is the first 3 seconds of me and him :) As you can see, dual wielding with an FG can potentially be painful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best place to set up camp if you want to keep that first corner monopolized is clear to it, and go halfway between it and the next corner.  You can keep both corners open easily with one solid group.  2 good groups can do laps.<br />
<br />
Each corner is a static spawn of 3 or 4 mobs, between each corner is a wanderer.  There are mobs on a ramp that begins on the north face of the pyramid and goes counter clockwise; the NW corner spawns are close to 3 spawns on the pyramid, and you often will end up with friends.  Fully spawned there are an additional 1 or 2 wanderers that make laps around the pyramid.  Those 2 are a fairly long respawn, tho.  Once you clear them, you won't have to worry about them for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">one group can do it, but needs to be smart players. the map is correct, he only spawns in that left corner as u come up. he always drops the earring or the fg, there is a place holder, just keep pulling the corner. normally camped along the hall between C and A in that map. need to get him slowed asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strikingone</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do it with myself, cleric bot, shaman, monk bot, and one other class.<br />
<br />
tough part is that there are about 4 roamers that can add if your not careful, especially obvious if you pull a corner and plan on tank mezzing the two others, and fail to account for the roamers.<br />
<br />
Lulls, pacify, mez, make it trivial. But if you want a good time, go without CC :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winden</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it :) Thanks for all the info guys. The group I set up consisted of...<br />
<br />
65 paladin<br />
55 Warrior (me)<br />
62 enchanter<br />
65 Cleric<br />
60 druid<br />
52 Rogue<br />
<br />
Let me just tell you, the hardest part of this thing for us was getting there. I was a dork, previously I brought my ranger there to run around invisi checking on what see's through it or not. I thought we could get there invisi. Anyway, 2 whipes later, we were informed to start at the gnome pyramid and pull mobs in the halls until you can get to the stairs leading to 4c. Then pull around the pyramid until you can move up.<br />
<br />
After that it was a blast. Went about 7 ish PH's for him before he popped duel wielding with the flesh in one hand. He is a mean guy yes he is. Like someone said, slow is needed ASAP!!! I love my flesh. Was a big upgrade for me. It pulls taunt surprisingly well for a straight up 160 DD.  Works well with the frosty, my next adventure will be Va'Dyn I think for a skybreaker. <br />
<br />
Mmmmmmmmmm skyyybreaker /droooooOooool<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the info my fellow Warriors. <br />
