My question is how well do you think the following combo will hold agro in zones like LDoN and mobs say that are doable by 2 grps that are not PoT/VT equiped.<br />
<br />
This is assuming that you are lvl 65 war have good haste (36% +buff) with maxed skills in the weps and max taunt.<br />
<br />
the 15/20 club from LDoN augmented with 2 dmg+ yekesha +dex<br />
and CHOS augmented with yehesha<br />
<br />
so baisically main hand is 17/20+ proc 125dd+stun<br />
                    off hand is    13/20+ proc 176dd and 125dd+stun<br />
<br />
Once again, how well do you think this combo will keep agro for a lvl 65 no uber raiding war assuming the above for every day use???<br />
<br />
Any help, opinion or advice is welcome and apreciated<br />
Good hunting,<br />

<br />

<br />
And 100 dd plus 125 dd ykesha and those weapons will let you keep agro np.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you usually want the 13/20 in Main.<br />
<br />
You get 2 procs in main and 1 in off.<br />
<br />
You get 4 from CHOS in main and 2 from Club of Madman.<br />
<br />
You get 2 from CHOS in off and one from Club of Madman<br />
<br />
So CHOS main = 5 procs.<br />
<br />
Club main = 4 procs.<br />
<br />
Actually, LOL prolly doesn't matter at that point because of DPS. NM :p<br />
<br />

<br />
p.s. if you get one proc in before slow on anything, you will be just fine tanking big stuff. 10 seconds of quality all alone agro time, and you are golden.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't the 17/20 dmg-ratio be sufficient enough to get aggro even without procs? I'd gladly mainhand that if I compare it to a 14/19 or 13/20.</div></div><hr />
