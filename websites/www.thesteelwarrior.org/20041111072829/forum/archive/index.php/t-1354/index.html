<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snotticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Name: Ingenuity <br />
Level Requirement: 61 <br />
Ability Type: Passive <br />
Max Training: 3 Levels <br />
Description: This ability grants a melee user the ability to land a critical spell which is activated from a weapon proc or right-click item.<br />
<br />
I use 2 fleshgrinders, which have Fireblast(160dd) around what would this make the procs?  If its only gonna be like 180 than I dont want to waste the points, but if its a good ammount more I might get it.  Any one have this AA that can offer an answer/advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I spent one point on it because I had just done 4 levels of straight exp and wanted to get something out of my aa's right away.<br />
<br />
With ingenuity1 the boon proc (35dd lifetap) becomes a 46 dd lifetap.<br />
<br />
So that is a 30 percent increase in damage on the crit. That would put the Fleshgrinder at a 208 crit with Ingenuity 1 assuming the dmg increase of 30 percent is what it is really at.<br />
<br />
And FYI, it does not work with the epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have Ingenuity 3 and it doubles the damage of all DD procs that crit blast.  To put this in perspective,  you have a 7% chance to crit blast from procs which occur maybe 2-5% of the time.  This sounds small but it actually pumps out some nice added damage.  I also use rampage with my earthshaker for a 246 AE DD and get some multiple crit blasts of 492 to thrill and amaze my guildmates.  <br />
This ability progresses thru the 3 levels like so:<br />
<br />
level 1 adds 33% to DD damage with crit blasts (about 2% of procs)<br />
<br />
Level 2 adds 66% DD damage with crit blasts (about 4% of procs)<br />
<br />
Level 3 adds 100% DD damage with crit blasts (about 7% of procs)<br />
<br />
All this for a investment of 6 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I were you I would put 1 point into ingenuity just for the change to get critical blasts every once in a while.  You will get maybe 5 per night while xping and then you can taunt the wizards about how leet your 216 point fleshgrinder crit blasts are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First point of Ingenuity makes the fleshgrinder crit for 213.  It's not a huge jump in DPS by any means, but for 1 point, it's a pretty decent skill to toy around with.</div></div><hr />
