I am trying to determine if my Red epic might actually work better than the Bloodsworn in my offhand. <br />
<br />
Basically, is 14/24 with Hate proc &gt;12/19 with stun? Would Red proc more oft then Bloodsworn?<br />
<br />
Anyone have experience with those weapons? ... any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
I don't have a &quot;perfect&quot; setup but when I want agro or need it quickly I do find that the duel red epics have been holding there own against mobs were the proc is not resisted.<br />
<br />
I've gone from wavecrasher to silken whip to copper hammer to red epic and if I still had my wavecrasher I'd probably pull it out an use it on some days.<br />
<br />
Overall I would have to say that the two new Droga weapons are going to be my best sure win win situation for DPS, Agro, and hitpoints ... but since I can't change my spell line up and my armor isn't changing its naural colors ... that leaves me with changing my weapons ... <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Good thing about Haflings, they can make these nifty 100% backpacks so I can store tons of different types of weapons so I can feel like I've changed a slight bit over the past 5 expansions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trong</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use SotBS main and Red Epic off. Really haven't noticed a big diff in the proc rates. But I hold agro quite well. Tanked in PoS at 57 for guild group that was made up of all 65's but me. At the end they were impressed that I was able to taunt mobs off the Shammie pretty quick after he hit them with slow.<br />
<br />
Have gotten about 4 CHoS, but never used them, just sold them for plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Use CHSD in main with Red epic in Offhand.   I personally think the red epic is too slow for main hand.....which is why I snagged a willsapper VERY SOON after becoming epic......to use in my main hand.  Now that I have the CHSD in my main, I keep the willsapper in inventory for util purposes.  <br />
<br />
With the CHSD in main hand and the red epic in the off hand I seem to hold aggro EXTREMELY well, not even hiving to taunt the mob off of the slower most times as I have allready had a couple proc go off.  I typically get ATLEAST 3 anger procs and ATLEAST 1 epic proc per minute ...... no parsing to prove this, but I have watched the messages long enough to guestimate, and often enough, I get 2 of teh procs early in the fight.<br />
<br />
I'd say the Warrior Epic (especially with the change they announced today with the green scale) Is REALLY worth it for a good offhand weapon.  Like I said before though ..... 24 delay is just too damn slow for me to use in main hand, so to me the red blade is really only good in teh off hand....and even  in teh offhand, as soon as I can snag a BOC or some other EB weapon the red blade will likely be banked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Curious, but why is it that you didn't try the CHOS? Many say that it procs more oft than SotBS.<br />
<br />
Anyway, from my experience, CHoS procs more than Red epic or SotBS so I keep it as main. When it comes to offhand however, I'm not as sure, so what I asked was which is &gt;... Red or SotBS for offhand?<br />
<br />
Now, apparently some of you have better experience with SotBS in MAIN then either CHoS or Red.  Confusing.  Heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Red blade is still dead. Inferior ratio and a more easily resisted proc. You can get a bloodsworn cheaper than your buyable epic parts. <br />
<br />
Yes, DPS does help your aggro and you should not neglect it totally. Even as an offhander, Bloodsworn is a better DPS weapon.  The proc really puts it over the top.</div></div><hr />

Don't really know, but I'm one who like to be a good tank and look good doing it. Just really didn't think the CHoS looked that good. Same reason why I'll prolly never own a SBoD. Great weapon but just looks stoopid, esp when a gnome or dwarf welds it. I die laughing looking at it.<br />
<br />
Too bad VI wont upgrade the Epics for us warriors. I spent 18 months getting all the pieces for it. Not going to bag em for a while. I mean would it break VI to maybe lower the delay to say 20 on it.<br />
<br />
One question to all you guys out there. With my gear, where do you think I could solo for some exp?</div></div><hr />

A couple of questions, first how do you have dual Red Epics? and second would you put the CHOS in primary and Red Epic in Secondary?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buying parts for the epic sort of defeats the purpose doesnt it? :)<br />
It's not that good of a weapon, all it's really good for is sort of a badge of honor, the &quot;look what I did&quot; thing.  I just want mine because I put in all that time before there were droga weapons, I figure I may as well get the dragon scales and fear ball.  <br />
Back to the original discussion, I can't say from personal experience, but based on proc, ratio, and what everyone who has tried them has to say, SotB owns red epic for aggro, and is waaaay easier to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I came back to playing I used my red epic some in Valor, BoT, etc.  But when I got much better DPS weapons, and especially when the people I group with are using much better dps weapons, its really hard to justify using a weapon with such a horrible delay, in any hand.  The proc is great, the delay just kills it.  If you have something with a good dps ratio and good taunting proc, I'd use that in my main hand and my best dps in my offhand.</div></div><hr />

Would the 2hs work better than the 2x1hs combo? I know the ratio is not awesome but it would work better? Was just wondering :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 hand weapons only proc more per swing because of the delay.   2 handers with a proc aren't any more reliable than 2 1 handers with procs, they're pretty much even.</div></div><hr />

GBoS pwns epic in every way. Well, unless you are a fashion warrior in which case its hard to beat epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the hilt of the SBoD is ugly as hell, maybe the blades part is cool, but the hilt sucks. If a sword had that kind of hilt, it would prolly break within the first slashes. Instead of being a kinda-triangle with the tip pointing to the blades, should have been the other way, pointing to the handle, and not being so thick, looks like a brick where the blades just point out, could have been more smoothed. THEN it would be a cool looking weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a SotBS for a while, I didn't like it.  I didn't notice it generating much aggro in my off-hand.<br />
<br />
The red epic has been near-useless for a long time.  The low proc rate (especially in the off-hand where you don't get as many swings) plus the high resist rate simply makes it an ineffective weapon. <br />
<br />
I have used the blue epic as a tool to touch off my primal's Avatar.<br />
<br />
Neither epic works in the on-hand, simply too slow.<br />
<br />
Duel reds is a nice brag, but ultimately ineffective.<br />
<br />
CHoS and SotBS seem to be The Pair right now.  GSoT and War Marshal's Bladed Staff are great 2h weapons.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that LDoN changes things.  A 14 19 weapon from Guk, coupled with a +2 damage aug, and an Anger aug gives you a 16 19 weapon with a hate proc.  This may surpass the mighty BoC.</div></div><hr />

I usually get envy eyes from the monks as i spank my procs out. The 238 Damage form CHoS is Uber. The stun on CHoS is resisted alot by magic resist mobs, but sowhat(238 damage with AA ability crit proc). The SotBS is pretty consistent aggro and damag, not much resists the poison based proc and stun. I can stun the crystal golems in POJ with it, similar to the big ugly stun stick we all got stuck with as a token. Does SOE really take us seriously, the other classes get pretty weapons and we get a wand or some shaman stun stick. OKOK, the SotBS is beautiful and so is CHoS, enuff said. No sparkly weapons for us measly war classes. SotBS is great consistent Planar aggro, crits (100) with AA for damag and stuns land almost always. Now think how bad you are with a BARD song Proc too, omg, can you say stun stun stun stun 4 times fast while screaming Ownage and an extra proc to boot:). Now everyone follow me to the other side of the cave while i dance this mob into its little corner. I get a knockback effect with CHoS.</div></div><hr />

Planar Strike is not poison based.  It's MR, just like Force Shock.</div></div><hr />

Call me crazy but all the other poison based attacks are green skulls and so is the planar strike of the Sword of the Bloodsworn, also the Great Staff of Thunder has this same poison based proc with the same effect and works the same way on the same type mobs minus the damage. Someone once said Crystalline Golems in POJ can't be stunned, EEEEENNNNN, wrong. The SotBS will stun them and so will the GSoT, both poison based stuns unlike pally and cleric magic based stuns. I do like pallly's and clerics, since i play them also. I also play a chanter and about every char in the game at one point in time. Someone told me that charisma is useless to a chanter , that doesn't mean its true, go see for yourself, my chanter owns every zone with charm and pacify and never is OOM.

I know, WE&quot;LL DIG OUR WAY OUT!&quot;  No No, dig UP stupid.  That's what you're doing right now.<br />
<br />
I'd say a proc that is resisted by high magic resist mobs and has the proc graphic of a magic based attack (i.e. cleric nukes) is magic based. I'd say a proc that is not resisted by high magic resist mobs with low poison resist and has the proc graphic of a poison based attack (i.e. necro poison nukes) is poison based. <br />
<br />
You would be wrong.  Spell graphics don't mean shit regarding what that spell does or what that spell resists against.  You are completely 100%, totally fucking wrong.  I tried to tell you nicely, but now you gotta make me do it this way.<br />
<br />
Call me crazy but all the other poison based attacks are green skulls and so is the planar strike of the Sword of the Bloodsworn, also the Great Staff of Thunder has this same poison based proc with the same effect and works the same way on the same type mobs minus the damage. <br />
<br />
Then you're crazy.  Green skulls..remember one of the very first green skull procs?  It dropped off the Ghoul Lord in guk, (Short sword of the Ykesha in case you haven't figured it out yet)and it checked against MAGIC.  Just because you saw a Stilleto of the Bloodclaw proc green skulls doesn't mean that all green skulls are poison based attacks.  Get it thru your head.  Graphic DOES NOT MEAN resist.<br />
<br />
Someone once said Crystalline Golems in POJ can't be stunned, EEEEENNNNN, wrong. The SotBS will stun them and so will the GSoT, both poison based stuns unlike pally and cleric magic based stuns. <br />
<br />
Bloodsworn and Greatstaff of thunder are both Stun/65 spells.  That means they will stun mobs up to level 65.  Most other stuns are capped at level 55.  If you look a little deeper in your paladin's book, you'll find plenty of spells that stun level 65 mobs, but I suppose you think those are poison based as well huh?<br />
<br />
I also play a chanter and about every char in the game at one point in time. Someone told me that charisma is useless to a chanter , that doesn't mean its true, go see for yourself, my chanter owns every zone with charm and pacify and never is OOM. Why did they think having high intelligence is better than high charisma, oh yeah cuz the FOOKING 65 level chanter said so, guess you know everything then don't cha, NOT. <br />
<br />
Well seeing as how nothing else you've said in this post was true, I see no reason to believe this line either.  Enchanter charm works off of magic resist.  Properly debuff a mob and it doesn't matter wtf your charisma is at, because the mob won't have the necessary MR to break the charm.  I may not know everything, but you're making a real strong case for knowing nothing so far.</div></div><hr />

My experience has been that I get better aggro with Bloodsworn on the offhand combined with Copper Hammer on the main hand. Copper hammer and Bloodsworn keep better aggro than 2 reds as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sad but true. Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

If i link a website with some florida land will you go buy it? Its gotta be true, see its on a website, and we all know those websites are always right, since the info was put in by someone that knows everything. Come to think of it, just like you, knows everything. Same Ol' BS new day. F00kers, now you need me to hate you the way you wish you could hate me.</div></div><hr />

Lucy has information listed straight from the goddamned data files on EQ.  It's not open to fucking interpretation, if it's on Lucy, that's how it is in the game, period.<br />
<br />
You go ahead and keep on believing whatever helps you sleep at nite.  You still haven't answered whether you think that Paladins have poison based stuns, like Force of Akilae, which will stun the golems you mentioned as unstunnable.  By you're logic, it MUST be poison based, altho also by your own admission, cleric and paladins spells are all magic based.  You don't know what you're talking about and you chose to pick up an attitude when people tried to explain it to you.  You get what you deserve, you started the flaming here after you were corrected.</div></div><hr />

Now, back to your regularly scheduled topic...<br />

It's possible for me to get a couple of amazing LDON weapons. Gonna be hard to drop an Anger3 on anything that isn't 16/19 or 17/20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lucy's picks up the spdat from EQ. This is about as reliable as it gets. Oh, wait, thats probably to complex for you to understand.<br />
<br />
Let me put it in terms your limited intellect can understand. <br />
&quot;A big magic beam sends out the secrets of the Gods, and someone taps into that and gives those secrets to the masses,&quot; i.e. Greek Mythology: Prometheus.<br />
<br />
On second thought, I tried. You Sir are too stupid to post here. Away Troll, and vex us no more.</div></div><hr />

Good way to keep a narrow mind. You know you are right. No doubt about it. Undisputedly correct. Absolutely undoubtedly 100% a ok no chance of uncorrectness without fail the final say so right. If Eve gave you the apple you'd know it was wrong since you are unfailably correct. Knowledge power and you have all the power. All the knowledge is yours for being the end all and be all of correctness. Well you said so, therefore its true. I can sleep content now. Since I know what SOE does. I read your post and its what SOE says. Yep , no point in guessing about anything, you know for sure, no doubt about it. **** IF THE MAJORITY FOLLOW THE WAVE ITS EASIER FOR ME TO BREAK OUT OF THE CALAMITY. DONT GO OUTSIDE THE LINES, YOU MIGHT CROWD ME :):p</div></div><hr />

It is in the spdat spell files, and that is the source of, well, all spell info. <br />
<br />
I do have an idea of why you may think it is resisted less though: Since Planar Strike effects mobs upto lvl 65, you do not get the red Immune message, which looks very much like a resist message. There are very few constants in EQ that are trustworthy, but SPDAT is one of them. I have seen few errors within Lucy because people report them quickly and they are checked and confirmed.</div></div><hr />

Throw those things away. At one time used a SotBs,good aggro and little push</div></div><hr />
