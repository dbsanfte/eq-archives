<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">04-15-2005, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I'm venting and its somewhat related to WoW but mostly retarded so people won't really care and shouldn't put much effort into reading this mess.  Nevertheless, it makes me happy to vent about it and that appears to be why the forum exists so here goes!<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been banned from the unofficial Hellscream forums!  Vigdis, you might say, I can think of five million good reasons to ban your drama-seeking ass.  You'd probably be right.  But let's have a multiple choice quiz and see if you can guess why I was banned:<br />
<br />
a) I posted pr0n in the general section, ohh!<br />
<br />
b) I called someone an ass fucking twitwaffle with downs syndrome, eek!<br />
<br />
c) I tried to sell lots of gold for cash on the Trade section, opps!<br />
<br />
d) In a poll discussing whether to have a real rant forum the site admin (who was against a rant forum) deleted an 8-page thread that consisted almost entirely of people posting support for a rant forum.  He kept the poll up, which at that point had 45 votes against a rant forum and 24 votes for it.  He apologized for deleting &quot;relevant&quot; posts but said the thread had too many irrrelevant things within in.  I had cached 6 of the pages, took quick snapshots of the posts, and reposted them (Hell, in one post someone claimed that all EQ server forums that had real rants section lost the community and were unpopular - so I literally linked to every single EQ server rant board in existence to disprove it).  The reposts were deleted and I was warned not to repost other people's posts.  I replied almost immediately that this was a fucking joke and I then reposted only those threads that I created.  That post was deleted and I was banned. <br />

Well, it was a).<br />
<br />
<br />
Just kidding!!  Anyway, fucking absolutely pissed and annoyed.  I had started many threads on fun but standard subjects like &quot;choose between this or that&quot; and &quot;who are you?&quot; - totally lame but community building nonetheless.  I think I've posted here before that I'm generally unhappy with the state of the community in WoW but have had some good experiences that make me think it might grow.  This was one of those really negative experiences in the other direction.  But it makes me thankful that we have such a great moderation team here.</div></div><hr />

yes, you presented a valid argument. however, countermanding a mod's action is A Bad Idea if you want to hang around. same with profanity in arguments of your position, just breeds hostility even if it wasn't intended.<br />
<br />
the typical mod on a large official game board is expedient and uncompromising out of necessity, sometimes even insecurity. our moderator crew can be more lax because the board is largely self-moderating and people actually listen when we step in. the lack of traffic also helps; we simply have the time to discuss disputes if necessary because there's so few of them.</div></div><hr />

The plus side is he stopped posting for a little while...<br />
<br />
I think this ability to make others pissed at me with little effort could have some benefits...</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />

private community with access to this information only viewable to our subscribed member base and  redistributing it for public display both on her website and the World  of Warcraft forums. http://www.therambler.net/images/WoW/rant/ offers  <br />

My reply:<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that while this email hails from my work address, O'Melveny &amp; Myers, I am not writing on behalf of my firm but merely on behalf of myself as the owner of The Rambler. <br />
<br />
As an initial matter, I apologize to my content provider and IP provider for having to deal with this wacko.  Unfortunately, the Internet spawns all kinds and they usually think of themselves as armchair lawyers. <br />
<br />
As for the substance, the information referenced in the below email is inaccurate in several respects.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the alleged copyrighted material consists entirely of words and phrases written on a publicly available forum.  The forum was later altered to require registration before viewing. But we do not live in a &quot;but for&quot; universe. <br />
<br />
Mr. &quot;Eggie&quot;'s claims are baseless - not to mention highly annoying.  The material is not copyrightable.  Copyright protects original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression.  Not only is the vast majority of the content complained of not an original work of authorship by Mr. Eggie, as is clear from the images, but copyright does not protect ideas or opinions; i.e., the written words and phrases within the posts on his board.  Neither does copyright protect procedures, processes or systems; i.e., the architecture, menu hierarchy, or look and feel of the medium in which the speech was disseminated. <br />
<br />
Even assuming such material could be copyrightable, there has been no infringement. In essence, there is an implied license for people to copy other posted written material within a web forum discussion.  The written ideas and opinions were made publicly available and there were no disclaimers regarding the use of the material. To reiterate, this use is encompassed within the standard use of all public web forums.  <br />
<br />
I hope this clears up this matter.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. <br />
<br />
Best, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Vigdis, bringing drama whereever she goes.<br />
<br />
Isk, as for your recommendation, I get that disagreeing with a mod probably isn't the brightest idea.  When the mod is deleting relevant posts (not because they contain improper material in and of themselves), I'm not sure what your recourse is.  I guess it's to get the hell out of dodge...</div></div><hr />

Funny quote of the day.<br />
<br />
I agree, Vigdis this guy seems like a real tool.  the guy was just your garden variety, day2day asshole until he decided to &quot;notfiy&quot; your employer/IP.  IMO, that is borderline harassment.  What a dicksucker.<br />
<br />
Keep on, keepin on, V.</div></div><hr />
