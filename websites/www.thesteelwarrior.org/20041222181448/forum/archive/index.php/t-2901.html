<br />
We already have to have 'sufficient will' to make a weapon work, so what if warriors; being trained from childhood in the use of weapons; could use their will to dominate a weapon?  Have a button to click, refresh about a minute, mabey a bit less, that allows us to force a proc. <br />
<br />
This keep knights happy as our aggro ability is still tied our gear.  I don't think once a minute would be overpowering as it already has a chance to do that and more often anyway.  But this at least gives us a measure of controll over it for that o-so-important initial snap aggro.<br />

Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, I've seen dozens of ideas.  Some seem good, some seem bad, some seem indifferent.  None of them mean a thing, no offense to either you or your idea, if SoE doesn't give a royal rip.  And we have nothing to indicate they do, and in fact a string of evidence showing they don't.<br />
<br />
Evidence:<br />
<br />
1. Almost a year has gone by with minimal efforts shown to address the issue (mostly in some new weapons and increased weapon drops).<br />
<br />
2. SoE has been repeating the same exact &quot;we're planning at looking at melee balance&quot; text on the upcoming events for months.<br />
<br />
3.  Absor, while making the rounds to the various boards indicates on the Safehouse that in fact the Dev team has NOT started work on anything.<br />
<br />
4.  Absor voices the opinion that pure melee &quot;aren't that out of balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
5.  Absor tells us that &quot;balance issues&quot; aren't handled in expansions, giving us notice that we can expect the big zippo for us in LDoN.<br />
<br />
6.  SoE has rebuffed every attempt anyone has made, through Absor, their representive, or through their dev team, to bring up the melee balance situation for discusion.<br />
<br />
7.  And, the final nail in the coffin, as far as I'm concerned, SoE continues to add more spells to everyone with a mana bar while studiously ignoring melee altogether. <br />
<br />
<br />
Any one of these things would be suggestive.  A couple of them would be worisome.  All of them together shows that SoE really isn't interested in our ideas, because they have no intention of addressing the problem any time soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
even better why not give melee classes a statistic, will power and maybe 1/3 of your wisdom and int gear add ons get used on will power instead, which would kinda help us on the issue of itemzation, anyway you have a good idea to start with, just wish someone from SoE chances by this thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a great idea, and it would even add some utility to war's since most of us tend to carry around an assortment of weapons with various procs like snare, fear, root etc.  Course, if we could force snare to proc, then a lot of rangers would really be out of a job ;)</div></div><hr />
