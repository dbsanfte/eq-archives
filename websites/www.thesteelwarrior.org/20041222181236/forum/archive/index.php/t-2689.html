Xp groups -- Didnt work but i was like oh well maybe you cant in here.... np<br />
<br />
Raid -- Last night ( the 22nd ) AoW was due and we killed him.<br />
While clearing Vindi statue and idol, MT's were all big races and none of us could keep the named facing the corner, we all gotten the cannot see your target and mob was turned around ( we all had aggro, mob hitting us but mob wasnt facing wall )<br />
For AoW we had an half elf tank him and AoW was facing the wall.<br />
<br />
Did that last patch changed stuff so only small races can corner mobs ?<br />
Do i have to quest that ghey wood elf hat ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easiest way to get around it is to get an enchanter to project illusion on you, then get shrunk.  AoN, WE hat, and Illusion potions all work also.</div></div><hr />

We fight him outside the arena generally on a 90 degree corner, which may make a difference. <br />
<br />
Even double shrunk, normally I can t hit him, but I CAN if looking up. (not that the view is all that appealing :p)<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed being able to still corner tank if looking up?<br />

http://www.beepworld.de/memberdateien/members54/dtf-mcbain/vindi.jpg <br />
vindi was facing Southwest, I faced northeast and was able to hit him.<br />
the arrows are my guildies attacking ;P<br />
<br />
What kind of tanking was that ? :P</div></div><hr />

We slacked the other night and had to shuffle a chanter around to another group when the weak ass drow died and a fatty had to step up. :P<br />
<br />
Just make sure ya keep some pots on ya and get shrunk after ya chug it down for the time being.  Hopefully it'll get changed back, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, we corner tanked reparm with a shrunk ogre just a couple nights ago, no problems.  (Of course we also corner tanked him with a shrunk barb, human, halfling, woodelf, dwarf, and half elf in the same fight. . .)  Sadly, we don't corner tank often though due to rangers, but I always like it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It works in some corners and not in others, in my experience, even when looking up as much as possible. Some places it just doesn't work. I think corners that are slightly wider than 90 degrees work better. It's definitely a pain. I gotta say, agnostic ogres have been taking it on the chin for a while (cultural armors, stun mitigation AAs for small races, huge exp penalty, size penalty, innate charisma penalty in an age where DI rules, PoP mobs that frontally stun ogres, plus all the baggage just for being a warrior, etc.).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogbasher</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed the same thing last month.  Couldnt reverse tank the Statue or the Idol, even in the really wide corner where ive tanked  a million times.  Got a quick Gnomer illusion for AOW and it seemed to work fine.   Glad im not crazy.   Went out and immediately bought 2 10 dose gnome potions.</div></div><hr />

Thanks guys, i havent really noticed the cornering issue in the last month, even tho we been killing Mith Marr (cornering him np)<br />

I even corner tanked in VT as a wolfie, unshrunk. Adding extra attack while making corner tanking work = teh win.</div></div><hr />

Is it fixed then, or does anyone know?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you talking about?!  The fact that all of your main tanks are Ogres *IS* a problem.  No guild can be truely successful without at least one barbarian warrior.  You may think you're successful, but you are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as cornering, I have not been having any real difficulties, even single shrunk as a barb.</div></div><hr />

Your wrong there. Its not barbarian warriors. Its female barbarian warriors. <br />

<br />
as for illusion vs shrink, i'd always go shrink. its rumored large races lose their innate regen when being illusioned. i believe i noticed a difference when i click my crown of deciet. will check to be sure</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulcrum Corvyn</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my guild just did Statue/Idol/AoW and we had a problem cornering only the Idol/AoW.   We did Statue in normal corner just down the ramp on right side of arena with no problems. But on Idol we could not pin him with MA double shrunk.  We tried another corner to the North and still could not get him pinned until we quickly gave the SA Illusion Gnome.  So on Idol and AoW we had our MA &amp; SA as Gnomes and we took them both down with the cornering method..........Just have to say I am glad I read this a few days ago before we did this :)   Thanks all for the great info....WTG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashem</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, I've been thinking about this a lot, and there's loads of conflicting stories still floating around.<br />
<br />
The theory I came up with is one of angle. That if you get the mob to come in on a perfect 45 degrees then you'll have no problem, whether you're large race or what not, as long as you're shrunk. However, if you're a bit off, that's what is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Think of the mob as a square block (from what I know, the &quot;bounding boxes&quot; on where you hit a mob are all square). Now think of a corner. If you put that square block into the corner on a perfect 45 degree angle you get a nice perfect triangle of where you stand and where the mob is limited to. Now, if you shift either corner towards you a little bit, then that's when you get pushed out.<br />
<br />
This seems to me what happened when cornering Doomshade. I quite literally got shoved out of the corner and the mob was behind me.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any other experiences like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did AoW last night.<br />
<br />
On Idol, we pinned him in the corner next to the ramp.  The MA was a Vah Shir and double shrunk.  Idol was turned on the raid the entire fight.<br />
<br />
We gnomed the MA for AoW and pinned him in the same corner.  AoW kept his back to the raid the entire fight.</div></div><hr />
