<br />
I'm looking for some suggestions. My guild is just now breaking into the Elemental Planes. I'm looking to upgrade my 2nd box clerics gear, he's wearing mostly cultural level armor and raid-rot loot.<br />
<br />
Any good places where I could 2box for Ornate level gear with a relatively good drop rate?</div></div><hr />

If you are going to get a full group going, there are some mini named in PoW, PoW and PoF that might drop some upgrades. Otherwise, look into some tradeskill stuff if you can find someone to do the combines. PoF armor has a lot of mana on it, for example. Otherwise, you can duo in Sol Ro. Ornate molds and patterns can drop off of any mob there. Just make sure that your cleric has an ER 4 item and pacify to single pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually impossible self buffed. With haste I can bareley do it and trust me it would not be worth it if you just want to farm armor. Get a group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you MUST have a ToD. And quite likely, you'll have to reslow during the fight. Make sure to use the cleric hammer pet, the damage will add up over the fights, as well as keeping MoR on the mob. I was able to chain kill without ever really needing a med break when I was there. KEI helps alot on the cleric, and any short duration self buffs you have should be refreshed before you pull the next mob. With ER4 and pacify, you should be able to single pull to the zone in as long as you're careful. You will have to be at absolute max casting range with ER4 to avoid prox aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaer</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zone in mobs are same as any other guardians I think, which now is about the rate of Kael armor drops in NToV. 1 in 100 would be my guess. Used to be high, in a group, we farmed 14 hours one day and walked away with 25+ pieces. They lowered the drop rate later that week, it was pretty silly. Now it's the other end of the spectrum, low low drop rate, but they do still drop ornate up to legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebedi</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all of the advice guys. I found it to be pretty much as described.<br />
<br />
The big thing was getting an ER4 item for my cleric so I could split mobs. <br />
<br />
I've had a ToD since kunark, I'd be lost without it.<br />
<br />
While I *could* duo there to my hearts content, I found I attracted guildies to the zone pretty regularly, so I ended up with a group most times after a short wait. It's amazing what adding a bard to a war/cleric combo will do for your kill rate :) <br />
<br />
While I could do the zone in mobs with just self buffs and virtue, I found that my cleric NEEDED crack of some kind. The mobs (even 50% slowed) just do too much DPS to keep up with otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs I was using were..<br />
Grim Aura<br />
Shield of Flame (blazing vambracers from ragefire) 9pt ds<br />
Call of Sky (orb of sky from VT) 35pt proc buff<br />
Lesser Shielding (cobalt arms) 30hp some AC and MR <br />
Strength of the Kunzar (cobalt boots) to keep my str maxxed.<br />
Miraculous Visions (ornate gaunts) 30% spell haste.<br />
34 pt DS potions<br />
Virtue<br />
<br />
I'd pull with the cleric (with Mark of Retaliation-33 point DS), and use ToD till it procced..<br />
I'd switch to prismatic 2h until avatar procced.<br />
I'd switch to Greatstaff of the four winds to finish off the mob.<br />
<br />
Unless ToD procced on the first couple of hits, slow wouldn't wear off till very near the end of the fight. I wasn't bothering to re-slow because the loss of DPS didn't make it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
76 points of DS outdamaged my melee before the mob was slowed .. by alot.<br />
<br />
I was a little worried about cashflow (spending 3k for 100 doses of shammy ds) but the first piece of silk ornate I got took care of that problem for the forseeable future :)</div></div><hr />

It's stupid that you can get armor easier from a zone that requires no flags and is relatively easy compared to SRT (which can be challenging and requires nearly every flag pre elementals)..</div></div><hr />
