The other day I logged back in for the first time and I went back to the good old PoN. That was were I always got my best exp and usually it was packed. THe last 3 times I have logged in this weekend PoN has had very few people in it. In the time I have been gone has patches and new zones made PoN no longer that good? Where should a 55 warr hunt? Would like ideas for exp hunting, money hunting and good places to get both money and exp. THanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend buying LDoN if you want any chance of getting a group.  Then, I also suggest making groups with guildies and friends if you still can group with them.  LDoN has basically ended most of the PoP groups because you get points and loot while also getting experience.  This angers me because PoP xp is much better but there is no way im gonna get a group there.  Also GL finding a group as a warrior.  I have trouble a lot unless grouping with guildies or friends that know my tanking ability or unless I make the group myself.  I recommend mistmoore in butcher block because that is where a majority of the people are making groups.</div></div><hr />
