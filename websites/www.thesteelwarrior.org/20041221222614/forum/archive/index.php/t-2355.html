<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omok Kragmaw</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always sought after a way to compare weapon set ups without having to parse log files with a third party program, and I think I have finally done it.  I spent about an hour or two working on this, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Below is a formula to determine the efficiency of a 1H dual wield set up, the only value here I am not 100% sure on is the dual wield percentage, going off of feedback from other warriors I have approximated the value at 62% at level 65.<br />
<br />
DMG1 = Primary Weapon Damage<br />
DB1 = Primary Weapon Damage Bonus<br />
DLY1 = Primary Weapon Delay<br />
<br />
DMG2 = Secondary Weapon Damage<br />
DLY2 = Secondary Weapon Delay<br />
<br />
0.62 = Dual Wield Percentage at level 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
(((DMG1 x 2) + DB1) / DLY1) + ((DMG2 x 2) / DLY2) * 0.62) = Weapon Efficiency<br />
<br />
Now given this formula, I will use Blade of Carnage in Primary and Scepter of Destruction in Secondary as an example.<br />
<br />
(((15 x 2) +13) / 20) + ((12 x 2) / 18) * 0.62) = 2.963<br />
<br />
The result is a weapon efficiency of 2.963, sounds like a nonsense number, but it's in fact used in comparison to another dual wield rating.  I will use Great Blade of Storms and Cord Hilted Spike Driver as a comparison.  These two weapons have a combined efficiency of 3.113.  Now you simple divide one number into the other, 3.113 / 2.963 = 1.05, this means that the GBoS and CHSD does ~5% more damage than the first set up.  Everyone still with me?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now here's the useful part, comparing 1H dual wield set ups to 2H weapons.<br />
<br />
The formula to determine weapon efficiency for a 2H weapon is much simpler.<br />
<br />
((DMG x 2) + DB) / DLY<br />
<br />
For a 2H weapon I will use Blade of War, which results in a weapon efficiency of 4.156 in comparison to the efficiency of the first dual wield set up efficiency of 2.963.  Simply repeat the step above and divide 4.156 by 2.963 and you end up with 1.40, or 40% more damage with the Blade of War.  I have tried this method on all the weapons in my arsenal and the results have been dead on so far, most people I have computed efficiency for I have gotten right on the dot as well.<br />
<br />
Now I know this post drags on, but I think this is a definitive way to compare weapon set ups.  The only variables I can think of that are not factored in are AAs such as Flurry, Punishing Blow, etc.  But until we get hard numbers for those abilities, they will only throw off the formula.<br />
<br />
Feedback?</div></div><hr />

This is a well known approach that dates back at least a couple years. You will see that your formulae are identical to the ones posted here: http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=66, except they give the formula for calculating DW percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And as an average hit 2x damage + DB is low at 65.</div></div><hr />

These formulas are &quot;well known&quot; to the community and I far from take credit for inventing them, I am just trying to put them in an easily accessible area and using them in new ways to compare weapons that I have not seen before.  Especially 1Hers to 2Hers.  And that formula for providing dual wield only applies to monks I think, 61% is an approximation for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omok Kragmaw</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And using my shadowheart at level 65, (11 damage x 2) + 13 seems pretty acurate for my average hit with it.  I think (DMG x 2) + DB is acurate.</div></div><hr />

Only the primary wep will triple attack which more largely benefits 2H, and also riposte damage will be greater using a 2H.</div></div><hr />

I do precisely that and the relative numbers (after all this IS just relative comparison) always equal the relative dps's of the weapons I have calculated for.<br />
<br />
I posted a thread some time back about calculating in flurry, triple attacks, punishing blade, ambidexterity. Although I can't give any solid numbers for them what I did show was that even if Ambidexterity gives a 100% chance of dual wielding it cannot ever come close to outweighing the 2h-er bias of flurry, triple attack and riposte/double riposte, nor is there any skill for dual wielding that compensates for punishing blade.</div></div><hr />

I say, why bother with doing actual work at my job, when i can just as easily come up with stuff like this (http://groening.educationvictim.com/weapon_eff.html)   Feel free to steal away the code and use it on your own someplace.  I may work on adding a 'comparison' type thing a little later on.</div></div><hr />

I'll try tossing that on in a little bit.  Also, is the formula for DW % (without ambidex) assumed to be relatively accurate using (lvl + DW skill) / 500 ?  I was thinking of throwing in a Level field to just auto-generate the damage bonuses on weapons anyways, so i could recalc the DW % for the rare occasions when someone lower than 60-65 wants to try the formulas.</div></div><hr />

Going by Lucy, damage =31, DB = 34. Predicted is 96, parced is 120. So aveage for that parse would be 2.77 * damage + DB.<br />

Anyway whatever the value you multiply Damage by it is constant for you over every weapon you wield and thus irrelevent, using modal damage (2) is just convenient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might go ahead and do the division, to give the percentage difference between the setups, but maybe that's not necessary.<br />
<br />
Some surprising results actually. The Greatstaff of Power comes out much closer to the Windblade than I would have guessed, I think because the damage bonus isn't all that different. Same with the Jagged Blade of War, which is as efficient dps wise as my Droga combo. The GSoT is 19% more efficient than my droga combo, and the Windblade about 20% more, if I understand it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scabbedwings</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, redid my version (http://groening.educationvictim.com/weapon_eff.html) a little bit.  Only things it lacks:<br />
- comparison of weapons<br />
- calculating damage bonus automatically based on level/weapon delay<br />
- formula changes for AAs like Flurry and Ambidex<br />
- the numbers/formulas to add in rogues and rangers (in the off chance anyone really cares)<br />
<br />
Also, the calculations i'm doing to calculate DW skill based on level may be a bit screwy, gonna sit down and double check them, but for the moment they're close enough.<br />
<br />
One question, though - the formula for DW % uses current level and current skill level, but is that valid for players past 60?  Admitedly, for those 5 levels the change in percentage is minimal, but it was sort of throwing me off when i was doing testing and was having the percentage change between level 60 and 61 on warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atilette</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your formula is correct, using BoW is about the same DPS as dual welding 22 / 20 main hand and 21 / 20 offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just as a reminder : this way to compare weapon will not always be accurate, as usual with damage calculation. versus Very High or Low AC targets, the formula is not accurate anymore...<br />
<br />
and yes this way to calculate weapon efficiency is old and well known.<br />
<br />
add to that : for rangers , Dual Wield chance = (DW Skill + Level)/600, and Ambidextry AA seems to increase our DW chance by about 6%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyway whatever the value you multiply Damage by it is constant for you over every weapon you wield and thus irrelevent, using modal damage (2) is just convenient.<br />
<br />
Not its not, because the higher the multipul more the weapons damage rating weighs over its speed. If you go way back in the day, to 50th, average damage was close to Damage + DB where as at 60th its closer 2x Damage + DB, and 65 it can exceet 3x Damage + DB.  A quick (and extreme) illistration:<br />
<br />
3/10 vs 13/20 (say prenerf Mossy vs CHoS) and showing ave damage/delay and a DB of 13)<br />
<br />
at         1x     2x      3x<br />
3/10       1.6    1.9     2.2<br />
13/20      1.3    1.95    2.6<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are compairng weapons, your average hit will strong effect what is best for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you guys work all the bugs out of this it really should be put in the library.  Thanks for working all this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please note that dmg*2+db is NOT the average (or mean) hit. It is the MODAL hit. There is a difference. The modal is the number that you hit for most often, it is not the average. If you hit for 10, 50, 50, 25, 100, 50, 120, 50, then the mean (average) hit would be 56.875, but the modal hit would be 50.<br />
<br />
The reason that we use the modal hit in weapons comparison is that it is easy to calculate and fairly constant for a given weapon. Average hit will vary quite a bit depending on buffs and mob AC, but modal hit is pretty constant (at least pre high end, not sure how it works at 65 + huge ATK increases, or against mobs with obscene AC where your min hit might actualy become your modal hit). Since damage in EQ tends to be heavily weighted towards the modal hit, it ends up being a decent approximation for comparing one weapon to another, but it is NOT a predictor of DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My modal damage on raids is almost always my max hit, 2xDMG is most of the time 50-80% of the number of hits for maxhit.<br />
<br />
Some examples from parses. (remember this doesnt really take into account crits discs etc). This is for offhand weapon btw, the reason is because I had iffy elemental damage on my mainhand at the time of these parses.<br />
<br />
#2xDMG/#maxhit<br />
12/20 (ofassa)<br />
12/13 (krizik)<br />
20/26 (am)<br />
10/16 (quavonis)<br />
10/20 (rock monstrosity)<br />
14/27 (GRreparm)<br />
11/20 (bird 1)<br />
<br />
Right, I guess you get it by now =p<br />
Might not change much, but still, modal damage =! 2xdmg.<br />
<br />
btw, 2xdmg = 2xmg+db for offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using modal as a predictor would comepletely screw anyone at least though 52 on weapon performance prediction. There are those under 60 who read these boards. And frankly I think we have to make a contious effort to accomidate, or at least not misinform them. <br />
<br />
Modal is also not a bad predictor from 55+, but I would never say it is a good one. It should be easy enough to a take a couple of logs from your playing and figure out what your own personal multiplier is and get a much more accurate number.</div></div><hr />
