<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I set up a lvl4 mage to sense summoned to try to catch severlious up.  Just wondering if sense summoned is zonewide and if Severlious always spawns with a pet?  I think both answers are yes but just wanted to check to make sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Janus_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, sense summoned is zone-wide.  Sometimes there's a totem fiendling pet up and he taunts me by spinning me around and making me think the dragon is up.<br />
<br />
As per your second question, he *essentially* does spawn with a pet, but he doesn't.  If he doesn't aggro when he spawns, since he is a shaman, he will cast his buffs and a pet.  When I got him, he aggroed on me as soon as he spawned and therefore didn't have a pet yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Used a wizard too before that to sense summoned, but when i found his pet up and got my guild to otm, only his pet was there =/<br />

<br />
Also when does he spawn after Server reset?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He popped allmost exactly 8 hours after server reset for me. Used mage to sense pet. This was while the Nameless was going down allmost every day, so Sev got ganked a lot :p<br />
<br />
Has dropped scale 4 kills out of the 4 I ve been on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I feel your pain. Same thing happened to me. <br />
<br />
I remember that, and it sucked :( <br />
<br />
All you need to do is on a patch day, get your level 4 mage in there and just sense summoned every half an hour or something. Thats what I did  when I got mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Selaradrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ive spent many hours camping sev, and managed to get him twice.  he doesnt have a static spawn point per - say, however he is easy to find.<br />
<br />
on top of the ledge ( the part that is up the big stair case with the the FOB zoneline)  is where he spawns.<br />
<br />
if you come in from FOB, follow the wall on your left until you coem across the ruins with 5 fallen pillars.   they are easy to spot as the 5 pillars are all in a row all by themselves.<br />
there is a small hill with a tree right near those pillars.  you can stand right in front of that tree, and be lookign straight out toward the pillars. THAT is where Sev spawns, and he paths in a circle around that area without leaving it.<br />
from this vantage point you can see him as he walks in his circle, and he will stay there until aggroed and dragged away.<br />
<br />
how do i know this? because i spent 4 hours sitting there watching him one day, hopeing and praying some peopel i knew would log on and we could take him out...God it sucks being the only 1 in your guild on... needless to say, i never did get him that that day.<br />
<br />
however, I did get him another time after server reset. i was sitting there, staring at the other warrior, who was sitting there staring at me as we both waited for sev to spawn.. we did the usual.. constant checks to see who was int he zone, checks to see how many guild members each other had on...so on so forth...eventually i decided I might as well talk to him since we had stared each other down for an hour, and i OOCed &quot;Yllin, your my best friend man, i feel like i can tell you anything&quot;...&quot;  so we both had a good laugh, started talking, and decided to run a joint raid between us and help each other rather than compete and race each other.  Sev spawned, we took him down, I won the roll for the scale.  next spawn, he sent me a tell asking for help, I went and helped him get his scale.  worked out great and we have been friends ever since.   maybe you can try something like this too and it will help you get him...<br />
<br />
anyway, sorry for the boring story, but the spawn point stuff is dead on, and I hope it helps you.</div></div><hr />
