<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khashik</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone once told me that attacks made from your offhand cannot be riposte by a mob. I searched for an answer here, but I cannot anything. Can anyone confirm this statement?<br />
<br />
Also, assuming riposte cannot occur from offhand, if you had a 30 delay 1 hand primary weapon, would you get riposte the same amount as a 30 delay 2 hander? Thanks for any info,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Havent tried, but easy to test, just wield a firebeetle eye or something in primary hand and attack something with an offhander. <br />
<br />
See if you ever get riposted.<br />
<br />
Not allowing offhand hits to be riposted is a good idea for any future dualwield tuning btw(if it isnt the case already), so maybe SoE should take notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the original poster probably misinterpreted what he was told.<br />
<br />
When YOU riposte, you always do so with your mainhand - never with your offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khashik</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, maybe that was it...<br />
<br />
So the second part of my question should be rephrased. Are there different riposte rates for dual wielding vs using a 2 hander?<br />
<br />
For example, if I swing 100 times over 4 minutes with a 2 hander and the mob ripostes 10 times, can I expect 200 swings over 4 minutes with a dual weild setup to yield 20 ripostes?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something like that.<br />
<br />
The higher your Riposte skill, the more likely you're going to Riposte.<br />
<br />
It isn't very likely, still, maybe 5% of all hits. Assuming it is 5%, no matter what is hitting you, you will Riposte 5% of the hits.<br />
<br />
Same goes for you attacking a mob, it doesn't matter what you're using, you still get Riposted 5% of the time. This is why 2h became so popular with PoP because you swing much less than if you were dual wielding and thus take less damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You no longer take damage from offhand ripostes. You are succesfully riposted (whether on enrage or a regular check), but you get the &quot;pfft&quot; noise which means a mitigated hit to zero. Remember when Sony mentioned they were looking at mob defense for DW'ers? Actually, I shouldn't say you never take riposte damage from offhand. They may have just nerfed it to oblivion. Same result, offhand attacks riposted are damage free from my experience. Kick still takes riposte damage.<br />

I asked a similar question over at the Rangers Glade and got the above response. Can anyone confirm or deny?<br />

I suppose it's worth testing, will be easy enough as the person said.  I find rangers are usually clueless though.  They do most of their research while they are dead and awaiting a rez (and are in a bad mood), and lets face it, they are distant cousins of druids.</div></div><hr />

The Rangers Glade holds a wealth of information, you might want to check it out sometime.<br />
<br />
I'll run the parse tonight and post my results. I'll try not to die to much.<br />

<br />
Hit's can not be mitigated to zero.  If this is what they're basing assumptions off, then they're forming conclusions based upon faulty information.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took about 15 seconds to test this (put stein in main hand) and a weapon in offhand.  Faced the mob while someone else was tanking on a raid.  Attack on.  About 3 riposte's in 15 seconds.  Way to go ranger's glade, awesome source of information! :)  Maybe that's why this tread was in the tavern. . .the tale goes down easier with ale.</div></div><hr />

So yeah, offhand can most definately be riposted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you take damage from any of those ripostes? It was asserted that the mob still gives a riposte message, but it never hits for any damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it causes damage.  Rangers may miss the damage while in the &quot;loading, please wait&quot; phase tough, which may have led to the roumer that riposte's from offhands cause no damage.</div></div><hr />
