<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey there, i've read about guard 3, it seems like it would be good for tanking so im deciding whether or not to buy the augment for one of my weapons.. What do you guys think about it? is it worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The basic consensus is that Guard 3 as a proc not only doesn't mitigate all that much damage (450/minute maximum with WA3 and doing it mainhand, presuming 9k/minute in incoming damage) but it eats a buffslot at least a portion of the time.  Perhaps even more to the point, it doesn't stack with Bulwark of Vie and that is generally available when you really need it.  Lastly though, you only get to augment a weapon with one proc so you might as well make it count and go Anger for your tanking weapon and some form of DD for your dps setup.<br />
<br />
I think the real killer is that it places the buff in your main buff window.  If these sorts of procs went to the bard window I could see them having at least some value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use one in my offhand in certain situations.  It adds alot of value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With OoW coming out, and AA purchaseable buff slots (up to 5 slots, atm)..... worth it then perhaps?<br />
