Here it is the velium gemmed greatsword.  A 262 smithed combine, made from the stuff droped in the GoD &quot;flagged&quot; areas.  The end result IS droppable even if some of the parts to make it aren't (haven't checked the EQTrader Corner yet).  However as you can see with a hp or ac or whateva type 7 aug to sweeten it, and drop a dd or vamp aug, it makes a comparible (statwise) and improved (dps wise at 31 28) to the dropable DPS king WMBS.  The drawback?  Probable high cost/demand in the early days to make.  Wait a bit though and I think we've got a new dropable dps king for us non raiding goobers.  BTW the other similar weapons (pierce, slash, and blunt) are of VERY similar, if not exact ratios, with the 1hders being about 16 20 on average but with the same stats.  Also I've noted NO req, rec lvls on these (but I could be mistaken).<br />

You have to look at Dmg bouns/dly.  so this and  aWMBS are both 35/28.  I would probably go w/ a WNBS over this just for the hps on it.  That is a nice looking weapon though seeing as there is no recommended/required level for it.  <br />
<br />
I cant find a working link to the listing of droppable 2hrs forom the SK boards but they had a huge one comparing all the droppable 2hs weapons that SK could use, and most of those were also war usable.  If I can find the orginal post I'll link it here if you would like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is that possible?  If that is the case are you saying that it doesn't matter what the dmg is on a 28 to 30 delay weapon?  I'm not a parse fruit but wouldn't the extra 3 or 4 dmg give you a higher hit on the top of the average scale?  I'm just not understanding (never got into the min scaleable dmg bonus parses and whatnot), not my cup of tea normally but I'm curious now.  I always just thought that dmg bonus added that bonus dmg to your origional dmg when you did hit the mob.</div></div><hr />

You dont use 31/28 to figure out the DPS on a WMBS.  In one of the posts here talking about max hits I did the math against my GSH (greater Storm watchers horn) which is 31/28 dmg bouns 35.  the numbers only worked out correctly using the 35(dmg bonus) instead of the 31(normal dmg).<br />
<br />
Ok here is the link that I was talking about before.<br />
<br />
http://shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13456&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1<br />
<br />
Grumush - Correct but only for 2handers.  When the dly is between those numbers you will use the DB to deterime max hit not normal dmg.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always just thought that dmg bonus added that bonus dmg to your origional dmg when you did hit the mob.&quot;<br />
<br />
This cant be true or I still wouldnt get hits for 1 <br />
:D <br />
<br />
Hope this helps..took me a few times reading it and actually using a weapon w/ those stats to figure out they are correct.  The parsing are for all 2 handers that a SK can use but about 1/4 are also war usable.</div></div><hr />

As far as my actual input to the topic, I would probably use this instead of the WMBS if I could find one for a comparable price because of the 14 FR/MR/CR, which in my mind is more useful than the 5 DR/PR on the WMBS.</div></div><hr />

Start paying attention.  You never hit for 1 on any weapon in your primary hand after level 28, unless the mob has some special means of mitigation, such as the dark aura effect in GoD, or a rune.</div></div><hr />

I spend probably 75% of my time playing EQ raiding.  Usually we use knights to tank trash so warriors are only MTs on named mobs.  On an average nights raiding we might kill 6 named mobs, we have 5 active warriors so I would be an unusual night for me to be tanking for more than 15mins out of 4-5hrs of raiding per night.  The rest of the time I am DPS.<br />
<br />
While your tanking setup is what makes you a warrior, its pretty important to have a good DPS set up too, unless you are happy on sitting on your thumb all night with a fleshgrinder and your blue epic doing 50 odd DPS.<br />
<br />
As I dont really have a low agro 2h DPS weapon yet and going from DW to 2h when swapping in agro weapons is an extra click or 2 (some how there is always someone new around wanting the ornate greatblade and I refuse to run around with a crowfoot lance of &quot;brells pls&quot;) I wouldnt mind getting my hands on one of these as a DPS toy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have certainly proved that you can spew out some detached out of context dogma without understanding.<br />
<br />
The reason you want the best non-agro dps weapon you can get is because there is only one MT on a raid (or in a group) and when you are not him you are, in fact, a DPS person.  If I and the rest of the warriors in my guild went by the statement above, we would just stand there looking like idiots watching the clerics go oom because all of the non MT warriors were using rusty swords and not contributing to total raid DPS.  You obviously underestimate the percentage of damage done by non MT warriors in a raid.  If 10 warriors are putting out 100 DPS each, thats 1000 DPS that goes to killing things faster.  1000 DPS is like 2 or 3 wizards nuking all out and we do not run out of mana and we do not wait until the mob is at 70% for fear of getting smeared on the ground if we pull a little agro.  If a raid depended on just casters to do all the damage, the people in it would be, in fact, morons.  Why do a lot of the people who play casters as their mains have such a clueless outlook on playing a warrior?  Do you all just PL your warrior hydras up and think you know something?  Try actually playing your warrior all by itself for a few weeks before you post here because until you do, you have no clue what you are saying.</div></div><hr />

Warriors, all things being equal as for aggro procs, would prefer a higher DPS weapon because DPS is a factor in aggro. A warrior using a a GTo4W will provide more aggro than a warrior using a shield and an Orc Pawn Pick.</div></div><hr />

(In other words Potential, not real dps) You can hold agro on emp with zero dps.

Indications are that hate (outside of procs) is based on potential damage (not actual hits/damage) following a formula that is worked out over the course of the above thread.<br />
<br />
That said, if I'm not MT, I want to do as much damage as possible, because there is no advantage to doing less damage.  The damage I do, however, is not the factor determining whether or not I have agro.</div></div><hr />

These are theories, and even many theories are presented - that does not consitute a rule, or a general consensus from these message boards. I have my own theories, but I don't claim that my theories constitute what happens in practice, or are the rule.<br />
<br />
From my own experience I can assure you that when my DPS is considerably higher than another person I will take aggro from that person with a weapon that has no aggro procs on it at all. The person I have played with over the 2 years, a BST, had lower delay duel weilding weapon setup than my 2 hander (GSo4W). Even after a slow from this BST I would gain aggro fairly quickly without taunting. He now has a GSo4W, and can take aggro from me using a duel weild setup with low delay.<br />
<br />
SOE developers themselves equate DPS to aggro generation. In fact that was a problem with the SK, and Paladins, who had to be retuned to have more opportunities to grab aggro because of higher DPS classes including the Warrior.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights...and...Paladins had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output SOE Development team<br />
<br />
Damage output causes aggro period.<br />
<br />
Based on both personal observation, SOE development team, and many posts such as this about a 2 hander BoW:<br />
<br />
It was a lower proc rate than BF/BoC...say 2 ppm vs. 4, but the extra DPS was enough to make up for the 2 lost procs. Brutul<br />
<br />
....and what I see in practice - DPS generates aggro. The more DPS then the more aggro.</div></div><hr />

Proof - I used a GSot4W without any augs to tank Seru the first time we killed him.  I did ZERO damage to him, and had no aggro proc (only the dd, which is always resisted due to Seru being 100% mr).  Yet I did not lose aggro.  Obviously, if you get an upgrade that increases your dps, your potential dps also goes up, thus more aggro.  Note that I also tanked the named vamp (that requires bane to hit) in tenebrus with GSot4W, with no problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with his statement totally.<br />
<br />
But, keep in mind I do agree you can hold aggro via procs, such as his case with Emp(whom I have tanked).<br />
<br />
My original post said aside from procs.<br />
<br />
Now going back to emporer. I have tanked emporer and successfully held aggro without procs using DPS(EDIT for clarification - I was using the corrupted shissar 2 hander). Also, I have seen Emp aggro Ganked with someone tanking using aggro procs by melee using DPS(you have to taunt to reacquire aggro and allow for additional procs to keep you on the top of the hate list). However, I seriously doubt the person tanking Emp could do successfully without DPS and Procs.<br />

Please don't confuse the issue with procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, let me speak a bit slower.  I had ZERO aggro procs.  I used a purely dps weapon WITHOUT an aggro proc to keep aggro.  Actual dps means shit.  Potential dps (which does go up with an increase to dps usually) is what gives aggro.<br />
<br />
I did ZERO dps.  I had ZERO aggro procs.  But I kept aggro with a dps weapon.  Which proves that potential (as in what the weapon can do, regardless of immunity / how hard it really lands / etc) dps is what gives aggro, not actual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact is DPS - whether potential or actual factors into aggro.<br />
<br />
Thus aside from procs(non whatsoever) a weapon having potential or actual (I personally don't want to get into semantics) greater damage than another non proc weapon will generate more aggro.<br />

What issue?  I haven't seen you actually argue anything.  Everyone knows that dps gives some aggro.  I don't see what you are arguing.  The guy you replied to said that potential damage was what caused aggro, and said the actual damage he put out did not change his aggro.  And potential vs actual isn't semantics.  Potential means that no matter what you hit for, it's the same aggro.  Actual means that if you hit soft for a few rounds, you would lose aggro.  Which is what he was saying.<br />
<br />
Thus aside from procs(non whatsoever) a weapon having potential or actual (I personally don't want to get into semantics) greater damage than another non proc weapon will generate more aggro. <br />
<br />
Yes, that is obvious, and we've known that for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing that some SK's think otherwise (and frankly, based on what we were told to read, I saw nothing that said as much) because they just don't hit as hard as warriors over the long run (lower skill caps means more hits for minimum damage) and thusly the difference between certain weapons becomes negligible. I think that from the warrior's perspective it's rubbish and the basic numbers pretty much speak for themselves (i.e.: more dmg/same delay = better), but it may be different for other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I'm not arguing against that at all.  Aggro from dps got brought up, which is why I went into that.  I didn't comment on the difference between the two, because I think Haass and others put it well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dafrog, do you know what we mean when we say &quot;potential damage&quot; and &quot;actual damage&quot;?  Because when you refer to that as a semantic difference, I begin to suspect that you don't actually understand what we're talking about.<br />
<br />
It's not just a difference of nomenclature.  &quot;potential damage&quot; and &quot;actual damage&quot; refer to two different things.<br />
<br />
Suppose I had a 100/10 weapon.  That weapon is *amazing* for DPS, right?  It's a &quot;great DPS weapon&quot;.  It does lots of DPS.  It has high DPS.<br />
<br />
But &quot;DPS&quot; is an imprecise term.<br />
<br />
Against the Emperor, that weapon does no damage at all.  Takes no actual hit points off his hit point total.<br />
<br />
So we're really looking at two different concepts, both called &quot;DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
One concept, which around here we call &quot;actual DPS&quot;, is only measurable vs. specific mobs.  Against a BoT boss, that 100/10 weapon might have an &quot;actual DPS&quot; of 1000.  It takes 1000 HPs off the BoT boss's health every second.  But against the Emperor, that same 100/10 weapon has an &quot;actual DPS&quot; of zero.   It takes no hit points off the Emperor's health, no matter how long you swing it at him.<br />
<br />
That's &quot;actual DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at what we call &quot;potential DPS&quot;.  That's the amount of damage you would &lt;I&gt;expect&lt;/I&gt; the weapon to do, all other things being equal.  That 100/10 weapon has a &quot;potential DPS&quot; of 1000, whether you are measuring it against the Emperor or against the BoT boss, whether the mob it is being wielded against has an AC of 10 or an AC of 10,000, whether you have an ATK debuff on you that means you miss 9 out of 10 swings, or an ATK buff on you that means you hit 9 out of 10 swings.  Even though the weapon does &lt;I&gt;no actual damage&lt;/I&gt; to the Emperor, it still has a shockingly high &quot;potential DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's &quot;potential DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
They are fundamentally different concepts.<br />
<br />
What people are saying is that the thing that determines melee aggro is &quot;potential DPS&quot;, not &quot;actual DPS&quot;.  That 100/10 weapon will do an &lt;I&gt;amazing&lt;/I&gt; job holding aggro against the Emperor, even though it never does even one HP of damage to him.  That 100/10 weapon will hold aggro against a mob with such high AC that you never land a single blow against it.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is a true statement that a weapon with &quot;better DPS&quot; will hold aggro better than one with &quot;worse DPS&quot;, in general.  But given a choice between tanking the Emperor with a 10/20 weapon with Emperor-bane +10 (effectively, a 20/20 weapon), and tanking the Emperor with the aforementioned 100/10 weapon with no Emperor-bane at all...<br />
...the 100/10 weapon will hold aggro far, far better.  Nearly 10 times better, in fact.<br />
<br />
Even though it does no damage to the Emperor at all, never removes even one HP from his HP total, has absolutely no &quot;actual DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does this help clear things up for you?<br />

<br />
Maybe I read the person who posted after me wrong. Maybe it wasn't a response to me. <br />
<br />
Show me a weapon whose actual weapon damage is much greater than their potential damage. There is a relationship. Semantics was used in context of whether someone was specifying actual or potential damage. Not as a threat.<br />
<br />
I just don't see how his response would change the equation of things to my reply or anyone elses without derailing it(confusing the issue).<br />
<br />

I apologize if it's become derailed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Off the top of my head, the following situations benefit from an understanding of potential vs. actual DPS:<br />
<br />
1) tanking a melee-immune mob.  A bad bane weapon will tank more poorly than a good non-bane weapon.  Since the tank's job is to hold aggro and soak damage, not to do DPS, the MT for a melee-immune mob is better off using the best potential DPS weapon he has access to, rather than the bane weapon.<br />
<br />
In particular, a dual-hate-proccing non-bane weapon will definitively out-aggro an equivalent non-dual-hate-proccing bane weapon, even if the bane weapon has significantly better ratio.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Dealing with high-damage-rating, low-damage-bonus weapons.  Actual DPS tends to be proportionate to ((2 * damage rating) + damage bonus), while hate tends to be proportionate to (damage rating + damage bonus).  So the damage rating contributes much less to potential DPS than it does to actual DPS, changing the math about which weapons are best.<br />
<br />
Consider a GSoT: 31/30, DB 36.  Its actual DPS will be based on a weapons quality of (62+36)/30, or 3.27.  But its potential DPS, its &quot;hate quality&quot;, will be closer to 2.23.<br />
<br />
Compare to a GSot4W: 41/31, DB 37.  Its actual DPS will be based on a weapons quality of (82 + 37)/31, or 3.84.  But its potential DPS, its &quot;hate quality&quot;, will be closer to 2.52.<br />
<br />
The GSot4W is less of an improvement over the GSoT for hate, than it is for DPS.  Mind you, it's still better.  It's just less better.  :-)<br />
<br />
That's part of why low-delay (below 28) 2-handers are so bad for warriors.  Consider a 30/20 2-hander.  Its DPS quality is (60+13)/20, or 3.65.  Better than a GSoT.  But its potential DPS, its &quot;hate quality&quot;, will be closer to 43/20, or 2.15.  Significantly worse than a GSoT.<br />
<br />
Summary: there are two situations where &quot;actual DPS&quot; and &quot;potential DPS&quot; are usefully/significantly different.<br />
<br />
1) when the mob is immune to actual DPS, potential DPS is the relevant factor to calculate by<br />
<br />
2) when the difference between ((2*damage)+bonus)/delay and (damage + bonus)/delay is significant enough to make one weapon markedly better for aggro than another.<br />
<br />
There may be others; those are the only two situations I was able to think of, off-hand.<br />
<br />
I wish that SoE were aware enough of their own mathematics to put &quot;DPS-weapons&quot; into the high-end game for warriors; 50/25 2-handers, for example.  4.56 quality rating for actual DPS, outdamaging darn near anything.  But only 2.56 quality rating for hate, making it much easier for a BoW-equipped or even hate-aug'ed GSot4W-equipped MT to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
By the way, I just did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation for VDD.  60/38, DB 40.  DPS weapon quality 4.21.  Hate weapon quality 2.63, or only slightly better than a GSot4W.<br />
<br />
Mind, there may be some small multiplier (1.25 or so) on the hate formula, so it would end up looking more like (damage * 2 + bonus)/delay for DPS, and (damage * 1.25 + bonus)/delay for hate.  <br />
<br />
So, I ran some numbers.  Weapons considered here (dmg/delay(bonus@65)): 60/38(40) VDD, 41/31(36) GSot4W, 31/30(36) GSoT, 32/20(14) Crow-Footed Lance, 39/24(14) Cranial Bludgeoner, 50/25(14) hypothetical weapon.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to format a table in here (since it doesn't seem to like my HTML), so I'm going to have to just give you the data messily, and ask you  to format it for your own selves.  <br />
<br />
DPS quality ((dmg*2+bonus)/delay):<br />
VDD          4.21<br />
GSot4W    3.81<br />
GSoT         3.27<br />
C-FL          3.90<br />
CB             3.83<br />
hyp.          4.56<br />
<br />
Hate quality ((dmg*1.25+bonus)/delay):<br />
VDD          3.03<br />
GSot4W    2.81<br />
GSoT         2.49<br />
C-FL          2.70<br />
CB             2.61<br />
hyp.           3.06<br />
<br />
Hate quality ((dmg+bonus)/delay):<br />
VDD          2.64<br />
GSot4W    2.48<br />
GSoT         2.23<br />
C-FL          2.30<br />
CB             2.21<br />
hyp.           2.56<br />
<br />
Even with the more conservative hate formula ((dmg*1.25+bonus)/delay), the hypothetical weapon significantly outdamages VDD, but has effectively the same hate.  The C-FL outdamages the GSot4W, but has markedly less hate.  The CB, likewise, slightly outdamages the GSot4W, but does significantly less hate.<br />
<br />
If we take the more extreme hate formula, the difference is even greater.<br />
<br />
Anyway.  Seems to me that the difference between actual DPS and potential DPS has at least some relevance to the question &quot;Which weapon is best for holding aggro?&quot;, or &quot;How much does DPS affect aggro?&quot;<br />

There is a third situation where the potential damage vs. actual damage might make a difference: for warriors who have not maxxed their weapon skills. If such a warrior gets a new weapon with high potential hate, but has low skill in that weapon type, he won't hit the mob very often when he first starts using the weapon. However, if I understand things correctly, he should be able to hold agro with the weapon as well as he would if he were hitting with it--thus, he can use it to tank with while training his skill. <br />
Obviously, that would only matter to younger warriors. But if non-proc hate really is just a function of the weapon's potential damage and the level of the character, and not actual damage done to the mob, then a young warrior should feel a lot better about using a high-quality new weapon to tank with.<br />
<br />
But I appear to be de-railing this thread. My answer to the actual question first posted is that the new weapon looks pretty good to me. Of course, there's a grave danger that a potential difference exists between theory and practice. In the interests of science, I'd be willing to accept a free one to try it out. I might have to keep it for a long long time to build up a good data set, but no sacrifice is too great to further the pursuit of knowledge.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd be willing to accept a number of free top-end droppable weapons  and use them all for a long long time to get to the bottom of this.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but where did this come from and how was it constructed empirically?<br />
<br />
It seems to ignore the inate hate charatertistics of differing procs...these procs of course being the lion's share of hate generation (dps being a factor as argued above but a MINORITY factor).<br />

<br />
Unless I forgot how to do fractions, the difference between  '((2*damage)+bonus)/delay and (damage + bonus)/delay' is damage/delay, or ratio.  <br />
<br />
So you just made very complicated 'better ratio weapons hold aggro better at the same delay'.  Which I think everyone knew.</div></div><hr />
