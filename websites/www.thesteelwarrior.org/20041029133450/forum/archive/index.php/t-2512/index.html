<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ChrystianVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the fastest possible way to get kromrif/kromzek and tormax faction?  I need to turn in Yeli's head for my new gaunts =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL proabably did it already, killing Yeli, though killing Dain will help too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ChrystianVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nah i'm still scowling, my faction was bottomed out w/ all giants and we don't do yeli/dain enough to rely on hits since my guild is factionless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BeeoRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's a camp in GD, it's a coldain mine, there's a spot with a large room, with 3 dblue to 61 guards, 1 dblue to 61 named coldain, and 6 green to 61 mobs.  I killed the green mobs fine solo/self buffed, with a healer I'd pull 2 of the guards, and anotherroom with 3 greens, and 1 blue.  Get coldain heads in groups of 4, run to kael, give them to the kromrif recruiter at the zone until you're dubious kromzek, then give them to cpt. bvelenos (or something similar, can't remember his name).  For tormax the easiest way is to do dain/yeli =P  You do get tormax faction for most kael quests, but it's pretty small.  I'm still scowl tormax atm, but I'm working with a cleric friend who's also factioning, so we're slaughtering those dwarves, and turning head, after head, after head =P</div></div><hr />
