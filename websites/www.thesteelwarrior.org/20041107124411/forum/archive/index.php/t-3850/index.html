<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, here is a detailled analysis of the &quot;STUN ISSUE&quot;<br />
<br />
No matter what people say, stuns are by far the current ROOT of all our problems with paladins and why warriors are not wanted in groups. Because Stuns give INSTANT, RANGED, SNAP AGGRO, we cannot compete fairly with them for groups in PoP. No one asks a paladin/warrior their hps/ac, no one asks us our weapons, or our AA's. Warriors are an UNKNOWN quantity, Paldin Stuns ARE NOT. The rest of the class balance issue is still there, and needs addressed. That has been done many times over. What I am here to do is analyze and explain WHY Stuns are over powered, and also, how there is an EASY fix to this problem.<br />
<br />
First Lets look at the Spells in question. Basically there are 2 spell lines of stuns. There is the pure Stun, and then there is the stun + DD + KB, and there is one spell that is just Stun + DD. <br />
<br />
Lets look at the Pure Stun Line:<br />
=================================<br />
Force of Akilae  Level 62<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(4.00 sec/65) <br />
Mana: 65<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Force of Akera  Level 51 <br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(4.00 sec/61) <br />
Mana: 90<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Stun  Level 35<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(4.00 sec/55) <br />
Mana: 35<br />
-------------------------------<br />
Desist   Level 15<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(2.50 sec/55)  <br />
Mana: 25 <br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
Cease  Level 9<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(1.00 sec/55)   <br />
Mana: 15<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
Now as we look at this we see a few things. There are 3 components to a stun, level affected, duration and mana cost. Ceast, Desist and Stun all can affect up to level 55. Each has  an increasing Duration, and an increasing mana cost, although it gets much more effective. Basically Stun is double the mana cost for 4x the duration. Note that Stun is a level 35 spell and is usefull all the way until level 55 to stun the mobs. The next level is Force of Akera, it is a level 51 spell that affects up to level 61. The duration is the same as Stun, but the cost is much more as it affects higher level mobs. Finally we have  Force of Akilae, a level 62 spell that affects up to level 65. The duration is same as Akera, but the Mana cost is LESS.<br />
<br />
So what is wrong with this spell line? The mana cost does not scale up correctly, and there is a slight gap in effectiveness. I honestly have no problems with using Cease up to level 55, Up to that level Paladins do not see the huge increase in mana and mana regen abilities that make this such an abused spell at higher levels. What would I change in this spell line?<br />
<br />
First Off, the Spells Cease,Desist and Stun at Level 55 NPC, And Akera needs Hard Capped at Level 61. Meaning you just CANNOT cast on any mobs Higher in Level, the mobs arent immune or resist, but when you go to CAT on the mob the spell engine PREVENTS the CASTING PERIOD. The spell is NEVER cast, the same as when trying to cast KEI on a level 20, or a charm, etc. The ability to do this is in the game, it needs to be used. These SPELLS all NEED to be Hard capped. The reasoning on casting a Spell on a mob that YOU KNOW has no EFFECT JUST forAGGRO is a broken concept.<br />
<br />
Second, The mana cost for Force of Akilae is out of align with what it does and its effectiveness. The cost difference of this spell to Akera should be closer to the difference in Stun and Akera. So this spell SHOULD cost 230 Mana.<br />
Fixxing Akilae to this:<br />
<br />
------ Altered SPELL -----<br />
Force of Akilae  Level 62<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(4.00 sec/65) <br />
Mana: 230<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Third, I feel A new Stun needs to be added at Level 57. There is a Gap in stun effectiveness.<br />
<br />
----- NEW SPELL CONCEPT ----<br />
Force of Akheva  Level 57 <br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(4.00 sec/63) <br />
Mana: 180<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
The Last change, Would Be to Make All of These spells ALL have a range of the TAUNT SKILL.<br />
<br />
This Would Give Paladins at least 2 stuns available at all levels with appropriate Mana cost for their effectiveness. It would also fix the Level 61-62 gap. It would also remove casting USELESS Spells on Mobs SOLELY for Aggro Generation, these spells were designed for STUN not AGGRO, that is the SK line of spells.<br />
<br />
Now the Second Line of Spells<br />
Lets Look at the Stun + DD + KB spells:<br />
========================================<br />
<br />
Quellious' Word of Serenity  Level 64<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(10.00 sec/65) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 108 <br />
Knockback<br />
Mana: 200 <br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
Quellious' Word of Tranquility  Level 54<br />
   <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(10.00 sec/61) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 108 <br />
Knockback<br />
Mana: 200 <br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Force  Level 50<br />
   <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(6.00 sec/55) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 74 (L34) to 90 (L50)<br />
Knockback<br />
Mana: 90 <br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Lets examine these spells, All have a good KB for mob positioning. All have Long Stuns 6-10 seconds. All do around 100 DD. They scale up relatively poor in levels affected. is  50 spell goes to 55, 54 spell goes to 61, then there is a gap until 64. The Duration and Damage also doesnt scalle relatively well, the mana cost is also poorly scaled. So what would I change on these?<br />
<br />
Well lets start at the bottom, Force assuming this spell is balanced. Lets move up to Tranquility. The duration is doubled, the damage is more and the level affected is increased. All of this at the cost of a little more than double mana. the Only Change I would Make is to HARDCAP Force at Level 59 Mobs, and HARDCAP TRANQUILITY at LEVEL 64.<br />
<br />
Moving up we see a gap, there no stuns + Dd + KB available from level 61-64. In here a new spell needs added. My suggestion:<br />
<br />
----- NEW SPELL CONCEPT --------------<br />
Quellious' Word of Itellect Level 59<br />
   <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(10.00 sec/64) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 158 <br />
Knockback<br />
Mana: 300 <br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Moving up further, I would alter the final spell in the series:<br />
<br />
------ Altered SPELL -------<br />
Quellious' Word of Serenity  Level 64<br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(10.00 sec/65) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 216<br />
Knockback<br />
Mana: 400 <br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
These changes would bring more into line the cost/effectiveness of these spells, and also fix the Stun/DD gap. These Spells I would Leave with the RANGE As they Are.<br />
<br />
the Last Spell in the Stun List is unique, this is a stun + DD no KB.<br />
-------------------------------<br />
Holy Might   Level 49  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(6.00 sec/55) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 29 (L19) to 60 (L50)    <br />
Mana: 60 <br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
This spell just needs Hard Capped at level 55. No other adjustments necessary.<br />
<br />
So now we have looked at the Stuns, and looked at fixxing them. Now Lets look at the Paladin and un-knowing Warriors excuses/reasons for NOT FIXXING stuns.<br />
<br />
1.) It will Make all our AGGRO weapons USELESS. Well, I know OF ZERO warrior weapons that USE any of these Spells as procs. This reason is thus a Fallacy.<br />
<br />
2.) It will allow ABUSE of stuns to STUN LOCK mobs, etc etc.. Well Notice I didnt really change the Aggro of these spells at all, I just corelated the mana cost more with the effectiveness of the spells. Also the spells were HARDCAPPED so you COULD NOT stun lock a mob with spells that DONT AFFECT them ANYWAYS.<br />
<br />
3.) Well take away our stuns, we will just find another way to get aggro.. Well I looked into this also. below is a List of spells I can see a paladin using to gain aggro.<br />
<br />
Wave of Marr 		850 PAL/65 <br />
Supernal Cleansing 	300 PAL/64 <br />
Light of Nife 		400 PAL/63 <br />
Touch of Nife 		450 PAL/61 <br />
Celestial Cleansing 	225 PAL/59<br />
Healing Wave of Prexus 	650 PAL/58 <br />
Superior Healing 	250 PAL/57<br />
Wave of Healing 	450 PAL/55 <br />
Light of Life 		215 PAL/52 <br />
Flame of Light 		85  PAL/50 <br />
Ethereal Cleansing 	150 PAL/44 <br />
Wave of Life 		250 PAL/39 <br />
Healing 		60  PAL/30 <br />
Light Healing 		25  PAL/15 <br />
Flash of Light 		12  PAL/9<br />
<br />
Now looking at this list, these spells, except 2 are MUCH more mana intensive than cease/desist. This would require a greater mana usage and be much more difficult to attain the same MINDLESS_FLAWLESS_AGGRO_CONTROL that exists now. Except for Flash of Light, which BTW can have seriously bad side effects, such as mob running and drawing a train, I have no problem with them using any of these spells to 'get aggro lock' It wont work anywhere near as effective as the abuses of cease,desist, etc..<br />
<br />
I believe that these changes would help alot<br />
It WOULD NOT PREVENT a paladin from having superior aggro control over a warrior. <br />
<br />
It WOULD NOT prevent from having RANGED AGGRO. <br />
<br />
It WOULD NOT prevent from having SNAP AGGRO.<br />
<br />
It WOULD prevent mindless flawless aggro at NO COST.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I beleive the whole problem(stuns is included in this) is the insane ammount of aggro that is generated by LOW LEVEL, EASILY RESISTED spells.<br />
<br />
I came up with an idea of how to balance this out.  <br />
<br />
What if the aggro generated by NON DAMAGING Spells was temporary aggro.  That is that after x amount of time, the aggro from the spell in question(stun for paly fear or snare for for S-knights) was dropped.   This duration of the aggro from the spell could be dependant on 1) Wether or not the spell landed.  2) The level of the spell.  Also,  the duration of the hate needs to be less than teh refresh time of the spell.<br />
<br />
What this would create is a situation where Hybrids would HAVE to use thier higher lvl and more mana costly spells in order to maintain aggro, but could still use thier low cost spells to initially aquire aggro. ..... preserving thier ability to get &quot;Snap&quot; aggro(although keeping it is another matter untillthey get some damage on teh mob)<br />
<br />
In the late game content ..... this would make mana a real issue for Hybrid Tanks when in an XP group.....they may have to med between pulls on occasion(i.e. slowing down the  groups xp gain rate to that of having a warrior tank), but they would still be a valid choice for tank.  Thier aggro lock would NOT be as secure as it is now......again leveling the playing field.  BUT on a raid they could STILL perform thier traditional roles of aquireg aggro Quick when needed.<br />
<br />
Direct Damge spells and Dots would still generate permanent aggro as they do now.<br />
<br />
Anyway ... I am sure the Ideas could use some more tweaking, but whatta ya think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you hard capped stuns that affect level 55 and lower at level 61 you would be hard-capping the Great Blade of Storms, the Copper Hammer of Striking, and every wep augmented with Ykesha procs.

Do Any of these weapons cast the spells Listed above?<br />

NO...<br />

Then HARDCAPPING  these spells   would have NO EFFECT on these weapons AT ALL....<br />

Why wouldnt they just change these spells? Are procs triggerable? can u do them at will and on demand? NO.. Are pally Spells? YES! that is why they are an abusive means of gaining cheap on demand, idiot proof aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Landrain, it's pretty obvious you don't have a spell caster twink. If you do, it's either spite or stupidity that would make you want to castrate paladin stun spells that much. Hardcap cease and desist so they don't give any aggro on mobs above 55? Fine, no problem. <br />
<br />
Changing our other stuns in the way you mention is, quite frankly, fucking stupid. Let's take the stun that paladins use more than anything else and multiply it's mana cost by more than 3.5. With FT15, VoQ, AoC, and SD a paladin would recover the mana from a single 4 second stun in 5 ticks. A paladin with those same buffs but only FT2 would take 9 ticks to recover that mana. A paladin with just KEI and AoC (which is not abnormal) and FT2 would take 12 ticks to recover the mana from a 4 second stun spell. A paladin in that situation is about average...and would be able to maintain casting a single stun every 1.2 minutes. That would preclude ANY other casting to maintain mana level. 1 stun per mob and no other spells cast. If one stun per minute is enough to balance out the difference between warriors and paladins tanking ability and DPS, what does that say about weapons with stun procs...that go off on average 2 times per minute? You would leave paladins with far worse aggro abilities than warriors currently have. Keep in mind paladins are the ONLY class in the game with a mana bar and no useable general purpose nuke. We can nuke undead once every 30 seconds, and that's it.<br />
<br />
You don't like the way the duration and mana cost scale for those stuns? Why don't you compare them to the hp/mana and hp/second for nukes or heals? As you go up in levels, most spells give a greater return for the same amount of mana. It's one of the benefits of levelling.<br />

If you look at those spells, you will notice that each newer spell got better in every way. They became more efficient, they became faster. There is no reason whatsoever to load up the lower level version because the higher level version of the spell is better in every way. <br />
<br />
Your brilliant idea is to make the higher level spells worse than the lower level spells. That will really wean paladins off of cease won't it?<br />
<br />
EDIT: and of course the secondary effect would be to make a paladin require having KEI or better to function in a group. Hint: paladin with FT2 and AoC (no KEI) would take almost 3 minutes to regain the mana from a single stun. 1 stun every second or third mob with a chance to use an emergency spell at the cost of significant downtime? That balances out the differences between paladins and warriors doesn't it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Force of Akilae always struck me as out of whack for what it does.  I mean it stuns higher level mobs than Force of Akera, same duration, but cost less mana?  And don't say spells are supposed to get better as you level because by that logic Strike of Sol should be unresistable, do 5000 damage for 50 mana and have no aggro.  I mean what kind of upgrade is it that gets you so much aggro that is more easily resisted than draughts, and cost more mana than any other nuke?  Why does Bliss uses 300 mana when Apathy uses 200?  According to you Bliss should be 100 mana never mind the fact that it mezes up to 68 instead of 62.<br />
<br />
Even if Akilae used the same mana it is still better than Akera in a significant way because it affects level 65 mobs instead of just 61.  <br />
<br />
People tend to overlook that Force of Akilae is also the best damage prevention spell in the game.  For 65 mana you're guaranteed to stop at least one round the mob has.  To be conservative, let's say the average PoP mob does 300 damage a round on average (double 600, hitting 50%, and hitting for average damage), that's almost a 1 to 5 heal there, which is better than any other heal except Complete Heal.  In reality the damage mitigated by stuns is far more than just 300 per cast.<br />
<br />
I've never seen anyone use the long stuns because Force of Akilae is already too good for both damage prevention and aggro.  I think the Quellious line can actually do a bit more damage, to something like:<br />
<br />
mana 250<br />
stun 10.0/65<br />
DD 600<br />
<br />
That way you get a decent nuke but have to commit a lot of mana.  This spell can be balanced easily by just making it do more damage and use up more mana because a Paladin's mana isn't desirable for damage (usually).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Paladins bitched because they didn't have the capability to gain agro lock on mezzed mobs without doing damage. (I mean really, who uses Taunt or the other no-damage stuns that give agro? :D)<br />

<br />
Paladins have lower DPS, a lower taunt skill, a complete lack of a no fail taunt AA, fewer and less viable aggro proc weapons - which all adds up to inferior aggro without spells - and tank less efficiently. You think having 1 stun per 2 or 3 mobs balances that out? Having 8 stuns per mob is a bit much, but that is from the paladins that use the chessy low level stuns. I wouldn't have any problems with making cease and desist give 1 hate on any mob over level 30. <br />
<br />
Where in the great big book of balance does itsay that Paladins Should be Able to CHAIN STUN mobs for NO EFFECT at Will, with no significant mana cost.. for purely aggro generation?<br />
<br />
Where have I EVER said that it does? What percentage of paladins that post here, or on PON, or ANYWHERE THE FUCK ELSE have said that being able to gain aggro with very little cost is balanced? Just assume that we all understand it isn't and move on. Notice I said &quot;Hardcap cease and desist so they don't give any aggro on mobs above 55? Fine, no problem.&quot;  in my initial post?<br />
<br />
It's when you advocate the castration of the ONLY detrimental spells that we have as paladins (which happen to be level appropriate and have a mana cost comparable to other similar spells) that I get a bit touchy. Generally stuns are what paladins use 90% OR MORE of their mana for when grouping. Sure I could use 450 mana to heal half a bubble on someone...or I could let the cleric who is overflowing with mana heal much more than that for roughly 350 mana (less with SCM). Paladin heals really are spitting into the wind compared to cleric heals EXCEPT in emergency situations. In those emergency situations the only thing our heals really do is buy about 1-1.5 more seconds for the real healer to land a heal. We get 1 very fast casting heal, then we have to wait on refresh. Ask a cleric if a paladin healing is going to help at all with downtime. Besides heals and stuns, what other spells do paladins have that need to be cast repeatedly during the course of an xp session? Sometimes root, but that is usually it.<br />
<br />
It also has been stated that if Hybrids cast as good as pure casters and their parent classes, no one would play the parent class... that is a Dev Quote BTW.<br />
<br />
If you really think that paladins casting ability even begins to approach the casting ability of clerics, I would have to question whether you gave that any thought at all. The next time you see a paladin in a CH rot, let me know, k? Look at a paladin's best heal compared to a cleric's best heal. It's not even close. The relationship between cleric's tanking ability compared to warrior's tanking ability is closer than cleric's healing ability and paladin's healing ability.<br />
<br />
Light of Nife and Touch of Nife are a paladin's 2 best heal spells. Light of Nife is a 850 hp heal for 400 mana with a 1 second casting time. It heals 2.125hp per mana, 850 hp per second in a single cast, and  262hp per second chained. Touch of Nife heals 1125hp for 450 mana with a 5 second cast time. It heals 2.5 hp per mana, 225 hp per second in a single cast, and 155hp per second chained. Supernal Light heals 3025hp for 600 mana (520 with spec, roughly 480 or so with SCM3) with a cast time of 3.75 seconds. It heals 5hp per mana (without taking into account spec, which paladins dont' get), 806hp per second in a single cast, and 504hp per second chained.<br />
<br />
Should I compare nukes between clerics and paladins next?<br />
<br />
It also has been stated that if Hybrids cast as good as pure casters and their parent classes This is bullshit unless you are trying to say that hybrids DO cast as well as pure casters. Hybrids don't need their spells to be crappy efficiency because there are already built in mechanisms to ensure that pure casters cast much, much better than we do.<br />
<br />
YES I DO know that stuns are hideously broken, and YES it IS an EXPLOIT of the game system.<br />
<br />
It's an exploit to stun a mob to stop it from casting complete heal? It's an exploit to stun a mob that is running over to attack the enchanter and stop it in it's tracks for a few seconds? It's an exploit to stun a mob to position it properly? It's an exploit to stun a mob to stop it's melee attacks for a few seconds? It's an exploit to stun a mob that turned to run and hopefully get enough chance for root/snare to land?<br />
<br />
Force of Akilae always struck me as out of whack for what it does. I mean it stuns higher level mobs than Force of Akera, same duration, but cost less mana? <br />
<br />
force of Akera was added in after Force of Akilae had been live for a while and after all the whining about paladin aggro had been going on for some time. The point of that spell is quite simply to give paladins a reason to stop using cease. It is designed to make a paladin use more mana. THAT is why the 2 FoA spells don't seem to match up in mana cost.<br />
<br />
And don't say spells are supposed to get better as you level because by that logic Strike of Sol should be unresistable, do 5000 damage for 50 mana and have no aggro. I mean what kind of upgrade is it that gets you so much aggro that is more easily resisted than draughts, and cost more mana than any other nuke? Why does Bliss uses 300 mana when Apathy uses 200? According to you Bliss should be 100 mana never mind the fact that it mezes up to 68 instead of 62.<br />
<br />
Come on Phantron, you know better than this.<br />
<br />
65. SoS - 2740 DD, 640 mana, 8 cast time, 4.281 dmg/mana, 342.5 DPS, -10 resist adjust - this is the big damage, efficient nuke<br />
64. DoE - 950 DD, 255 mana, 3 cast time, 3.725 dmg/mana, 317 DPS, -50 resist adjust - this is the low resist nuke<br />
60. Ice Spear of Solist - 1200 DD, 300 mana, 4 cast time, 4 dmg/mana, 300 DPS, -10 resist adjust - level 60 big damage, efficient nuke<br />
60. Lure of Ice - 825 DD, 320 mana, 4.5 cast time, 2.75 dmg/mana, 206 DPS, -300 resist adjust - level 60 low resist nuke<br />
<br />
Apathy and Bliss are basically the exact same spell except for the level limit difference. Mezzes have always cost more as they got higher in level because mez is &quot;the best damage prevention spell in the game&quot; (not FoA). If you look at Apathy compared to Bliss, it costs 33% more mana to use Bliss to mez a level 68 mob than it does to use Apathy to mez a level 62 mob. Compare that to FoA and Stun. It costs 86% more to stun a level 65 mob using Force of Akilae than it does to stun a level 55 mob using Stun, which is the spell that Akilae originally upgraded. I don't see where the cost of FoA is out of line at all for what it does, comparitively.<br />
<br />
People tend to overlook that Force of Akilae is also the best damage prevention spell in the game. For 65 mana you're guaranteed to stop at least one round the mob has. To be conservative, let's say the average PoP mob does 300 damage a round on average (double 600, hitting 50%, and hitting for average damage), that's almost a 1 to 5 heal there, which is better than any other heal except Complete Heal.<br />
<br />
How many players resist a heal? How many players are immune to heals? Do you know how effective stuns are for reducing melee damage taken from slowed mobs? Not very, btw. Supernal Light is already a 5 to 1 mana ratio without any focus or healing AAs btw. Keep in mind that as the tanking ability of the paladin goes up, he will actually mitigate less damage by stunning.<br />
<br />
What does a paladin use his mana for when there is no need for additional healing in the group and when there is no need for ghetto crowd control from root? If we aren't actually casting spells, in what way are our penalties balanced? That is the problem with purely defensive spells, they don't stack for shit.<br />
<br />
As an aside, the last time I fought Blazzax, I cast a total of 0 group heals. We were all full health pretty much all the time from MGB wood, CR, and paragon being up the whole fight. I basically don't need to cast group heals at all on most mobs with an AE, and when I do, I often die. If you want to take aggro from paladin spells, take it from our group heals. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Landrain, this is why I wanted Cease and Desist to hardcap at 35 and 41, respectively......because that would force Paladins to use level appropriate stuns if they wanted to use them for aggro generation.

<br />
 With all due respect, the spells offer flexibility. You have those tools there for when the shit hits the fan. That's your bonus for being worse at the pure tanking then a Warrior - being able to adapt quicker to bad situations than Warriors. Not to mention that those stuns and heals mean in the short run you out mitigate the Warrior......but he's the best over the long haul, assuming mana is an issue. That's balance. But just because you HAVE them does not mean you have to USE them all the time.<br />

<br />
 Ah, you led right into the point. What use does a Bard have for Mez if there's an Enchanter in the group. What use does a Beastlord have for his slow if there's a Shaman in the group? Not much, right? But if something bad happens, they provide emergency redundancy for the group. That's a Paladin's role as a Hybrid - utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Anyone ever teach you that relying on procs is a bad idea cause they can't be relied on? Yet we have to. I won't even mention ykesha procs, stun proc weaps, or the blade of war. I will mention pally epic and the knight-only weapons that drop in so many zones where warrior-only weapons don't drop.<br />
<br />
You think having 1 stun per 2 or 3 mobs balances that out? Having 8 stuns per mob is a bit much, but that is from the paladins that use the chessy low level stuns. <br />
<br />
Any pally that casts 1 stun every 3 mobs would get booted from the group. You should know better than this. And, cheesy lower lvl stuns? Why in god's name would you use a high lvl spell for agro when a lower one will do? Are sks casting clinging darkness cheesy? Is a 60 wizard casting lvl 39 concussion cheesy? Is a druid or ranger casting a lvl 29 ensnare cheesy? Is a cleric having DA (lvl 1!) memmed cheesy? I could go on, but the point to show you casting a low lvl spell ain't cheesy, it's common practice.<br />
<br />
Should I compare nukes between clerics and paladins next? <br />
<br />
Nobody wants pallies for nukes, and few want them for heals. Pallies are wanted for tanking nearly as well as warriors and their unbalanced agro lock. Compare that. Your examples make as much sense as comparing chanter nukes to wizard nukes and saying wizard's more in demand.<br />
<br />
there are already built in mechanisms to ensure that pure casters cast much, much better than we do. <br />
<br />
Like what? Inflated spell costs were removed, fizzle rates were adjusted (effective casting lvl fix), what exactly are those mechanisms? Or do you mean the specialization alone ensures casters cast MUCH, MUCH BETTER than hybrids do.<br />
<br />
It's an exploit to stun a mob to stop it from casting complete heal? It's an exploit to stun a mob that is running over to attack the enchanter and stop it in it's tracks for a few seconds?

It's an exploit to stun a mob that turned to run and hopefully get enough chance for root/snare to land? <br />
<br />
No, it's an exploit that stuns can be used for agro lock in exp groups AND in raids nowadays with nearly no time needed to med by the paladin. You know exactly what he meant, address that instead; if stuns were used ONLY to interrupt spells this post wouldn't be here.</div></div><hr />

Whoah there big fella, before you go off, you'll see that there was a 10% mitigation difference, not 19% and I specifically asked Thepp if stuns were used or not, and he specifically responded that they weren't.   <br />

it is my contention that a paladin takes LESS overall damage than a warrior against stunnable mobs, and not a single person has shown this to be wrong.   Not a one.

Try reading again.  He is saying that is what would happen if the mana cost was upped to the original posters suggestion.<br />
<br />
Also note, he agreed that they have good spells for when the shit hits the fan.  The thing is, all other casters have spells that are more useful during fights when there isn't a problem, so why not let pallys do so?<br />
<br />
I hate how much of an imbalance exists, and I agree something needs to be done, but too many of us warriors are going the wrong route imo.  And all this shit doesn't change anything with SKs, who are just as far ahead as Pallys are.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As an FYI, I find SK aggro generation to be much less offensive than Paladin aggro generation - both because that IS their job description AND because they lack the high end HP/AC of the Warrior, the ability of the Paladin to selfbuff to close that gap, and the ability to mitigate damage as well either innately (Warrior) or through spells (Paladin). There IS a noticable difference when an SK tanks in the healing department vs. Paladin/Warrior.<br />
<br />
 *Please don't throw out Fear as a mitigation tool for an XP grouping SK, please, you Paladins. I hope you're brighter than that. ;)<br />

<br />
 I also offer you something else to chew on.<br />
<br />
 Rumor has it SoE has started work on the next expansion. The Bards over at TCH have been fighting over the new 32 manasong retuning, with the point being made that they have to tune the new content to the current abilities. If that's the case, will they be tuning to Knight aggro being the baseline of aggro generation, or Warrior aggro? They've got to tune it one way or another.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did say paladin by himself has lower dps, you just left it out (or didn't read it). I also said tank's dps don't matter when the group can cut loose with a pally tank the way they can't with a warrior. Most groups for PoJ trials prefer a knight tank - why is that? He has 20% less dps than a warrior! I know you know this and were arguing just to be contrary, but it's because he'll allow everyone else to do 20% more dmg, making his own lower damage meaningless in comparison.<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier, if you're comparing solo DPS, show me a soloing warrior. Otherwise group DPS is what counts, and pally group's DPS &gt; warrior group's DPS. And yet they always bring DPS up as a supposed disadvantage, I wonder why?<br />
<br />
As an aside, bringing DA up in balance discussions is a bad idea, I've no idea why anyone would want to. How is it gonna help anyone tank? Mobs lose interest in you soon as you cast the spell.</div></div><hr />

Paladins have EVERY SINGLE tool that warriors have except! AoE Taunt, the vaunted guaranteed aggro that you espouse. You Said a paladin couldnt cast on more than once every 3 mobs with my suggestion, OH and still keep a FULL mana bar. Well thats a HELL of a lot more often than a warrior can pop AoE taunt, which, btw does have some bugs, like z-axis problems and a realatively short range, certainly not range 200.<br />

then of course there is that comment about paladins casting as effective as clerics. Well it seems to me that YOU were the one who brought up how pure classes spells always get better and thats why paladins should, etc etc etc.. You are the one comparing paladin casting efficiency to cleric/wizard. I was the one who said the spells should be balanced agains themselves.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
As to proccing weapons?<br />
<br />
The last I saw, a paladin could use a  BOC  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25210), and a  BoW  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25989), and a<br />
 Anathae  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=52058)... 3 of the TOP 5 warrior aggro weapons, whats left?  BF  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28855) and  HG  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28854)<br />
<br />
oh, wait.. there also a couple others..  SoBS  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62188) ,  CHoS  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62186), and  GSoT  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24799)<br />
<br />
So of these top 8 warrior aggro only weapons Paladins get to use 5?<br />
<br />
And lets not even go into the MULTITUDES of knight only wepons that exist it seems in every zone...<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Well then there is the TAUNT differential, which is what a Knight tops at 210? a warrior at 230? 10% difference? so when we taunt and FAIL 40 % or MORE of the time, we MUST wait 6 seconds for the skill to refresh, what does a pally do? Why that 1.0 casting spell that gives 10000 hate... well yeah thats worth those extra 20 points in taunt...<br />
 <br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
of course you will twist ad change what I have said, as you already did, because you are protecting your 'designed' ability. If you noticed I would add more stuns because there is a gap in ability to cast a stun effective on an exp group mob. I just feel the absurdly low casting costs really get rediculas. I mean 65 mana for a 10 sec stun up to level 65? Come on, at Level 65 how many times could a paladin chain cast that spell before going OOM? ALOT. considering NORMAL mana regen in Exp, is KEI,Bo9+ Ft 2 - very easy to get all of these and they last long time,... thats a regen of..  14 + 8  + 2 = 24 mana a tick? and recast time on that 65 spell is 24 so 4 ticks... so 96 mana by time can recast? so a net GAIN of 31 mana each casting? EVEN with the cost I said would be better, 300 mana. you would regen this mana in 12 ticks? so 1 min 12 sec? thats alot faster than AoE taunt refresh. IMO being abke to cast this spell once a minute for 10000 hate is MORE than enough... <br />
<br />
Saying that you would be useless is NOT true anywhere near at all, Saying you MAY have to med after 10-15 minutes of combat is what we USED to call Balancing effect.<br />
<br />
See It was even said that the benefit of a warrior over a knight as tank should be the need for LESS downtime, since the warrior doesnt require mana to hold aggro or do damage and their better mitigation save on healing mana. While a paladin had better aggro control at the cost of being limited by mana. The reality is that its just the oposite. <br />
<br />
A warrior limits the group, while  a paladin doesnt....<br />
<br />
Note: Uber Time/full Elemental war/pal will break this stereotype but the standard LFG smuck on the wall in PoV will prove the above reversal of fortune true, almost 90% ofthe time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No matter what people say, stuns are by far the current ROOT of all our problems with paladins and why warriors are not wanted in groups.<br />
<br />
Yes, stuns are the caue of this problem, with Paladins. <br />
<br />
If you take away a paladins spellbook. And Give them just the other tools they have. the Difference between them Tanking and a warrior Tanking, is extremely minimal. It can be determined by extensive parsing and thats about it. <br />
<br />
Give them all their utility spells, and that easilly makes up for the difference in hp/ac/mitigation/dps, but  it is still a close call, and either will do just fine.<br />
<br />
Now Give them their stuns and 99.9% idiot proof no fail aggro, and now there is NO COMPARISON between the two classes, Paladins win hands down every time.<br />
<br />
One of three things must happen to balance this effect..<br />
<br />
1.) Nerf stun aggro completely - bad idea if not implemented 100% correctly<br />
<br />
2.) Eliminate the ability for paladins to cast stuns add infinum - by adjusting mana cost, reset times, hardcaps etc (this was my proposal btw)<br />
<br />
3.) Give warriors equivalent aggro generating capabilities as a paladin. - this is said to be game-breaking<br />
<br />
So what is left?<br />
<br />
oh, thats right.. Warriors are supposed to just suck it up, go afk until needed to pop defensive, and wait for the next expansion where knights get defensive so that we can then reroll as some usefull class..</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.113*1.02*1.0493=1.191~<br />
The paladin had 19% less survivability than the warrior did.<br />
<br />
it is my contention that a paladin takes LESS overall damage than a warrior against stunnable mobs, and not a single person has shown this to be wrong. Not a one. My 1.5% number in terms of avoidance differences held up like expected even though you guys were calling me a loon 5 months ago when I said so.<br />
<br />
A paladin can mitigate VERY much better than a warrior during initial engagement. It's an enormous advantage being able to stop a mob's melee at the start of engagement before it is slowed using a stun. The drawbacks are unstunnable mobs (obviously), long fights (less benefit from stuns relative to warrior mitigation and hp advantage the longer the fight lasts), very small benefit on high MR mobs, and greatly reduced benefit when tanking lower DPS or slowed mobs. The ability to stun a mob during initial engagement is most of the time a very major benefit for paladins. It is why I load both of my FoAs and QWoS instead of the cheap stuns. That benefit from stuns can't be kept up indefinitely and has definite drawbacks. On the whole, paladin stuns are a very powerful mitigation tool, as they were designed to be.<br />
<br />
I personally don't see the stun mitigation benefit as unbalancing, assuming of course that aggro issues for warriors are addressed in a well thought out fashion. READ AS: Taunt skill works a minimum of 75% of the time against even cons and below.<br />
<br />
Also note, he agreed that they have good spells for when the shit hits the fan. The thing is, all other casters have spells that are more useful during fights when there isn't a problem, so why not let pallys do so?<br />
<br />
Yes and no. It isn't even necessarily that other classes can do the same things we do better, it is sometimes there isn't anything for us to use our mana on because it isn't needed. If no one needs a heal, casting heals won't do any good. If we aren't tanking, we can't cast stuns (due to the aggro of course). If both of those previous situations are true and the group is getting consistent single pulls, there isn't anything that a paladin CAN cast that will be beneficial. We don't have nukes. We don't have debuffs. You only need X amount of healing. You only need X amount of crowd control. Once you have reached the threshold for those things, a paladin doesn't have anything to spend his mana on that will improve the performance of the group. It used to be that paladins could add value by downtime healing. With the mana regen available to most pure casters nowadays, I have to ask...what downtime? I would say that mostof the time, we paladins can find SOMETHING to spend our mana on, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is very usefull. I will say that generally LDoN adventures allow us to use our abilities to a good extent. <br />
<br />
As an example, tonight I was fighting in PoE with a warrior and 2 paladins in the group. I was pulling and offtanking (so that we always had a mob in camp) but the second paladin didn't have much to do with his mana. There were several times that he cast a group heal (even though it was unneeded) simply to see if he would get a crit. He didn't really have anything to do with his mana. Those situations are generally rare for a paladin, simply because people rarely group a paladin when they already have a tank.</div></div><hr />

And you didn't answer about those two spells.  Both are very close in raw data, yet cripple is high aggro and malo is low aggro.  CH is listed as 7500; it's a lot of aggro, but not near that.

Base1 for a spell is quite simply, the quantity of the effect in slot 1.<br />
<br />
Quellious Word of Serenity<br />
1: Stun(10.00 sec/65)<br />
2: Decrease Hitpoints by 108<br />
base1: 10000 (divide that by 1000 and see what it gives you)<br />
base2: -108<br />
Since there are no other effects, base3 through base12 are all 0.<br />
<br />
Force of Akilae<br />
1: Stun(4.00 sec/65)<br />
base1: 4000 (divide by 1000 and see what it gives you)<br />
<br />
Blessing of the Nine <br />
1:  Increase AC by 32 <br />
2:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 618 <br />
3:  Increase HP when cast by 618 <br />
4:  Increase Mana by 8 per tick <br />
base1:109<br />
base2: 618<br />
base3: 618<br />
base4: 8<br />
base1 is the amount of AC (for more on how to figure that out, go to http://www.magelo.com/forum_flat.html?mess_num=16087 and find the formula there)<br />
base2 and base3 both list 618, which is the amount of hps they add to your max and current hp, respectively.<br />
base4 is 8, which is the amount of mana regen per tick<br />
Since there is no effect above slot 4, base5 through base12 are 0.<br />
<br />
Moonfire <br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 1150 <br />
base1: -1150<br />
Since there is only an effect in slot 1, base2 through base12 are 0.<br />
Since there are no other effects, base2 through base12 are all 0.<br />
<br />
Starting to see a pattern here? I guess Moonfire is also a massive jolt spell since it obviously LOWERS a druid on the hate list by 1150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The paladin had BSS and AoC, the monk and warrior had no hp buffs at all. <br />
<br />
 This, I'll note, is part of the reason I prefer the hard caps on the lower stuns - Paladins have the ability to self buff to where they have HP and AC much closer to the Warrior than the Monk. For tanking purposes, it's a hell of a leap, given that Monks can't really tank raid content and Paladins do. With 15/25 mana aggro generation, that's much too close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Graal,<br />
<br />
1. The assumption that the warrior will have BSS cast upon them cannot be factored into the &quot;survivability&quot; question, as the warrior doesn't bring BSS to the total package.   On top of this, there is indication that the Paladin didnt' even have his full buff lineup cast upon him for this test, as it appears that the aim was to get the two as close as possible.   Therfore discussing hitpoints at all in terms of &quot;survivability&quot; is incorrect.<br />
<br />
The tests were all performed with a Shaman as primary healer, and as we all know, the HP/AC advantage for a Paladin when grouped with a Shaman as pimary healer is fairly extreme as opposed to the warrior.    <br />
<br />
2. Adding values that fall WELL within the margin of error for tests to come up with a conclusion that exceeds the margin of error is invalid.<br />
<br />
Because of these two factors, again, it's a LOT closer to 10% than 19%, and as I said, not factoring in stuns as mitigators is wrong anyhow.</div></div><hr />

The actual survivability edge is more like 15%, which is the average edge in mitigation plus whatever smidge of hp advantage the warrior has after BSS and AotC, and the sliver of extra avoidance. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, this does *not* include the effect of stun on stunnable mobs, nor does it factor in the significance of aggro control, which means earlier and more confident debuffing (and thus less dps doled out and more efficient healing).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Not to be sarcastic and not to play an overly traditional card.  But why do some of you seem so hell bent on demanding that every aspect of a knight be brought into play but not every aspect of a warrior.  While I have no illusion that things like defensive or other disciplines would create balance between the two classes, according to your own rules do not all aspects need to be included in the final analsys?  <br />
<br />
As for the stuns themselves, it seems fairly clear that many of you do not play (pure) casters.  Very few have managed to correctly relate spell growth correctly.  While mana cost does, generally go up, spells get more efficient as you go along.  When you read caster boards, this is where problems come along.  For example, FoT for mages was a problem for wizards.  2000damage for 500 mana.  If you only looked at mana cost, you would see it is substantially more then the pervious nuke mages get...so therefore, wizards should have been happy.  The problem was that the ratio came down to 4:1 dmg to mana, which was previously the domain of wizards, not to mention the high damage.  There is alot to take into account when balancing spells.  <br />
<br />
There is another problem when it comes to balancing spells that I find pure melee generally do not take into account.  If a spell cannot be expected to be cast under normal situations it is ,generally, worthless.  This is why when SoE was trying to balance casters relative to eachother they were having a few problems figuring out where to start.  Buffs are a major source of problems when it comes to balance.  They are hard to decide exactly how much they are worth.  Honestly, the only self buffs I use are AotC and Brells 90% of the time.  Personally, I don't think paladins should have ever gotten AotC and I would prefer they got rid of it then to have them rape my stuns.  <br />
<br />
I am not a believer in balancing classes in isolation, it lends itself to further imbalance.  If you are basing balancing around the fact that paladins get lower level versions of cleric buffs-that do not stack with regular cleric buffs of course-you have a problem.  The problem is that then there are a whole lot of interclass connections that would then completely unbalance things.  How many warriors get a virtue even if their healer is a druid or shaman?  In doing so, you've nullified the &quot;advantage&quot; of the paladin spells.  Should buffs be made in such a way that they only last as long as you are grouped with the person who cast them?  If that was done... banking on paladin buffs would be fairer when balancing.  Every single time a warrior is capable of getting virtue when not grouped with a cleric, it invalidates a supposed advantage of being a paladin.  Not to mention the fact that if you balance classes in isolation, you either have to make all buffs self only or all buffs stack.  If virtue and the guidance line stacked, there would be more of a point to this aspect of the debate.  Or if warriors couldn't get virtue period.<br />
<br />
If you balance classes in context of the usual practices of the players, the real paladin strong points would be stuns, AotC and brells.  Like I said before, I think AotC should be removed on principle.. as a former pure caster I don't like that paladins ever got it.:P Brells...eh, to be honest, scrap it too if you want.  <br />
<br />
I'm obviously coming from a different place then most warriors though.  My view of the tanks, by no means the only or true one, is that warriors should absorb damage the best and the knights should hold agro the best (of the tanks).  This is partially because of where knights get each of their abilities:Tanking from warriors, agro from casters.  So, my way of &quot;fixing&quot; things leans towards making warriors the unquestioned better absorbers of damage and letting knights retain their agro(atleast a good portion of it).  This, naturally, extends into itemization too..but thats not what is being discussed here.  <br />
<br />
The last thing is.. the idea of hybrids has changed over the course of eq.  They are losing a &quot;child&quot; aspect and attaining individuality.  Its not quite fair anymore to play the &quot;parent&quot; class card when the hybrids are moving towards becoming distinct classes in their own rights.  Look at the last few expansions, they have all been getting unique spells and their own rolls, though they do retain some of the old parent/child characteristics (old buffs for example).  It honestly, would not be totally out of line for SoE to remove parent class derived buffs from the hybrids at this time, leaving hybrid classes with only the spells that are unique to them.  If that were to happen, or the current trend continued... this line of argument will not last long.  Honestly, I suggest giving it up and simply look into recieving a balanced class based on individual merits and uniquness inherent in each class, rather then through some idea of right of dominance through being a &quot;pure&quot; class. <br />
<br />
I apologize for the length of this post..... got a bit too into it.  Anyway, hope nothing I presented offends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">why do some of you seem so hell bent on demanding that every aspect of a knight be brought into play but not every aspect of a warrior.<br />
<br />
Actually, the problem is that warriors don't HAVE any other aspects. I autoattack, I taunt, and every now and then if I'm on a raid and it's needed I might /disc defensive. I /shield frequently, but of course that's a sad joke of an ability that adds 25% to the MOB's dps. But I think that on general terms this is wrong anyway; people have done a pretty good job here considering the classes in totality. Much better than, say, on PoN. Frodlin and others were laying out the argument a year or more ago, with considerable resistance. Now, much of what they have been saying is taken for granted in a lot of places (except SoE HQ apparently); it didn't use to be that way. <br />
<br />
I give up on the rest of it, except to say I never get any buffs other that what my group can provide. And obviously the only sensible way to balance experience groups is to think about the configurations OF experience groups. And any configuration of an experience group that doesn't involve a cleric means the paladin will be a hugely important buffer -- and still an important buffer even WITH a cleric. So any effort to wave away paladin buffing abilities, healing abilities, root, cures, etc, all that non-stun crap, is completely bogus, and, frankly, hypocritical, given the way you started your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Retain your aggro all you like Paladin, the problem is your ungodly ease at near flawless aggro control and your ability to survive the mobs beating as well as a warrior. I remember back in the day when paladins could split tank spiders for a bit in velks but if they went too long without assistance or they'd be walking back to res themselves. This is no longer the case for knights. Also, back in velks a caster could survive a bit of split tanking themselves while waiting for the warrior to ripp aggro off of them. This is no longer possible with mobs in PoP throwing down attacks of 500-900ish damage on a sissy in silk.<br />

Yes I agree warriors -NEED- better hitpoints, migation, and avoidance to a point where people can actually tell the difference. Perhaps like it was back in the days of KC and Velks, where clerics would say, &quot;Excuse me Mr Pally I'm trying to conserve my mana, can you please let the REAL tank do his job?&quot;<br />
<br />
But even with this extra migation, warrior aggro needs to be brought up in some way. Warrior aggro is just not acceptable in it's current state in comparison to that of a knight. All the hitpoints, migation, ac, avoidance, defensive skills, defensive aa, defensive discs mean nothing unless that mob is only interested in attacking you.<br />
<br />
On another note, recently through extensive parses on the boards it seems that warrior melee dps is not 20% more than a paladin with similar gear/haste/atk rating and the same weapon, this should be looked at.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that things would be fairly okay if warriors had about 85% of the aggro knights currently have and 130% of the survivability (through more hitpoints, migation, avoidance, etc etc and etc).<br />
<br />
It's not a matter of balance anymore sometimes. I get so frusterated that I don't want balance, I want my rightful place as the best tanking class back. Clerics are the best healers. Shamans are the best slowers. Enchanters are the best for crowd control. Necros are the best looking. Warriors deserve the spot as best tanks, we sacrificed mana for the rights to tank more effectively than other classes and we want to see it.<br />
<br />
Maybe some of you disagree with my thoughts, well.. you're wrong and that's all there is to it. Warriors should = best tanks, hands down, no arguments.</div></div><hr />

Being able to take punishment means nothing if you can not insure you are the focus of the mobs attention. Your attempt to separate the two and deny that as a Tank your melee parent class is Warriors is a feeble attempt to show why you deserve to be a superior tank with spells. One or the other chief. Cut your HP's in half and the spells are not a problem. Eliminate stun and mana regen and your 90% Warrior abilities are fine.<br />

I'd prefer that Warriors got more HP's, better mitigation, competative aggro abilities, and some unique Warior abilities.<br />

<br />
Even if the devs at EQ listened to me, the knight class would not be that bad off. I'm sure players that had knight friends would continue to group with them as always. In fact I'd still group with them because both knights offer a lot of utility (that you claim not to have) to a group to make it more rounded. But warriors only offer hp/ac/migation/avoidance to a group/raid so... since we are specialists and master of war and all that, we should therefore be the best at what we do.<br />
<br />
Warriors live/breathe/dream about/eat aggro and tankage and yet we can't quite grasp at it. Whereas knights think about aggro and tankage a little, and then read their pansy spellbooks and yet aggro and tankage come to them with no effort. The whole concept is wrong and perverted to say the least.<br />
<br />
Warriors &gt; Knights in everything related to melee that's just how it should be. Sure knights deserve to have fair aggro, but warriors should have near the same aggro and considerably better tanking skills because Speacilization Tanking: 255  so stfu and Lol @ U chavr warriors own you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">That parses says exactly what it says.  Your survivability is the product of every aspect of tanking.  If I take half as much damage as you do I obviously have a 100% better survivability.<br />
<br />
Actually, it's more disturbing that although we have 20% better survivability/tanking and yet it still does not make a noticeable difference.  20% better tanking is almost unnoticeable for XPing because most XP mobs are not capable of killing players.  For example I probably have at least 100% more survivability than an equivalent uber Enchanter but that doesn't stop them from trying to solo normal LDoN mobs since their chance to die is probably like significantly less than 1% (if the healer was AFK, and they didn't have Arcane Rune and Eldritch Rune up, and I was AFK, and slow was resisted 5 times, maybe they will die).  Yes my chance to die is something really close to 0% but does it really matter when it's that low for the enchanter?  The same can be said to Paladins since I'd imagine even a fairly low end Paladin doesn't come out that much behind an uber Enchanter in terms of survivability.  As long as the Paladin's chance of dying is 'low enough' it really doesn't matter how much better a Warrior is at surviving.  It can be 0% and it would hardly matter (though in that case we should just go solo instead).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'll dispute one thing you said, Phantron.<br />

 XP mobs certainly CAN kill players. However, in a group, that generally only happens when people do stupid group tricks. And we all know who enables stupid group tricks. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Yes, I do want paladins to maintain better agro control then warriors.  As long as warriors are the best tank in the game, be it 10%,15%, 20% or 50% better, they should never be the best or equal to best at agro control.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I want to see warriors upgraded to better compete with the current content.  Warriors do need some work.  They do need a more reliable taunt, just not the best taunt.  They need other things too, but I really don't feel like saying this all yet again. <br />
<br />
As far as parses go.  I don't think 3-4 parses will work.  What ya'll have is a parse of high end characters.  It shows what happened one time, in one area.  To be truly effective and to have something that is actually useful, you need to have parses from people in HoT gear all the way up to time level gear.  You need parses with no AA's and parses with full AA's.  <br />
<br />
We don't know that the 15-20% that was shown in this one parse holds true for lower levels of the game.  We don't know how AA's affect the situation.  We don't know if there was some fluke that was overlooked and isn't apparent because there's no comparison data.<br />
<br />
The parse is intersting.  It does give us information.  The value of that information is very low though because there is nothing else out there to verify that information.  Also, that information ONLY applies to the area of the game that was tested.  Assuming it holds true throughout every level of the game is wrong.  This is why you CAN'T base any changes off what this one parse has shown us.  It's an incredibly small window into the world of EQ and in no way provides enough data to see the problem we face clearly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, I'll state what I want for the tank classes so that no one can assume anything otherwise.  I want interchangebility based on the situation and group makeup.  I want warriors to be as favored as paladins as favored as shadowknights.  I want groups to take more then one tank because they want added safety.  I want groups to say we need a tank... grab the next war/pal/sk that is lfg... don't matter which one.  I want to be useful on raids.  I want all tanks to be useful on raids.  I want for us to have the ability to apply some damage if we aren't selected to be taking damage for a given fight.  I want to be able to help with more then just crowd control all the damn time (pet peeve of mine the past two weeks... I'm tired of tank mezzing at every damn raid lol).  I want paladins to have some areas that they are the best at.... and I want warriors to have the same thing.  I don't want any of us to be obviously the best choice every time for the tank slot.  I know what it's like to not be the best choice and I dont' want anyone to feel that pain.  At the same time I refuse to sit by while another class is trying to push me back down to that point.<br />
No warriors should never be hands down the only choice for tank.  No paladins should never be hands down the only choice for an exp group as tank.  Both classes should be viable and wanted in the game.  <br />
<br />
That is what I want.  If your gonna quote me you'd better damn well quote the whole paragraph and not single sentences or partial sentences.  It's meant to be taken as a whole, not in bits and pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Paladins should NOT get better aggro control than Warriors, period.<br />
<br />
 They already are the second best at survivability and the best at mitigation. There has to be SOMETHING they're worse at than the other two to have balance. Right now, they don't have that weakness.<br />
<br />
 Simple mathematical model:<br />
<br />
 Tank type      HP/AC     Mitigation   Aggro  Total  Average<br />
<br />
 Warrior             1                2              3        6          2<br />
 Shadowknight  3                3              1        7          2.33<br />
 Paladin             2                1              2        5          1.67<br />
<br />
 That's what it boils down to, plain and simple. Paladins as it is now give up WAY too little for the amount of aggro control they get. You don't want to change that, obviously, because you've said so, no matter how many platitudes you mouth about 'interchangibility'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It's your OPINON that paladins have too much mitigation compared to their agro.  You can't qauntify either and then put them into a simple mathematical formula.

<br />
My opinon is that I give up enough mitigation compared to equal level warriors.  I can see who takes less heals and who has a harder time surviving fights.  From where I'm sitting I'm giving up plenty for the agro I have.  Maybe if your in elemental/time level gear then the mitigation difference isn't as noticeable, but <br />
<br />
1.  There aren't as many people in elemental + level as there are people in the lower levels of the game.<br />
<br />
2.  There are methods to improve mitigation for the areas where gear has closed the gap some.  A class wide nerf is not the answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Warriors haven't proved much of anything with numbers.  They haven't done enough parsing yet to prove anything.  All they have atm is opinon, and you know what those are like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Well if it's just one XP mob versus your group, you really shouldn't die.  If there's more than one, maybe, but then versus multi-mob isn't just an issue of aggro between Knights and Warriors anymore.  <br />
<br />
Warrior mitigation is still better when you factor in the discs but the problem is that it's not enough to make a significant difference since Knights can get close if not surpass our AC by using a shield which is never possible as a warrior (in all realistic situations).<br />
<br />
In XP groups Knights can stun mobs on incoming which probably the strongest mitigation tool you can get in the XP groups.  Yes even over Turgur's especially consider that stuns ensures that Turgur can land without aggro issues.  <br />
<br />
And why do so many of you still cling on this 'don't nerf Knights even though it's imbalanced!' idea?  Warriors are the baseline class for aggro and mitigation.  If warrior gets better (especially on mitigation) mobs have to get better too because that's what they're balanced against.  Improving warrior mitigation is actually nerfing everyone else's mitigation because then all mobs have to be made harder so that a warrior tanking them doesn't become trivial, and thus everyone else ends up tanking worse since they didn't get improved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Your posts go further and further into some fantasy land.<br />
<br />
 I sure as hell can quantify mitigation, not to how much more you have, but you damn sure have it. Stuns and self healing - two things you have that Warriors don't have. Shadowknights don't have stuns, but do have a joke ability to self heal with lifetaps. Therefore, I quantify you No. 1 in mitigation, Shadowknights No. 2, and Warriors No. 3. It may even be Warriors #2 and SK's #3, but implying that Paladins aren't #1 is just farcical.<br />
<br />
 As far as aggro control? I'll use, rather than math, the fact that you can toss two stuns and a slow does not pull aggro off you. A Warrior has no such device innately. A Shadowknight is better at aggro control simply because he has more devices to grab that aggro quickly than a Paladin, but once again, it's clearly evident without needing to quantify it precisely mathematically.<br />
<br />
My opinon is that I give up enough mitigation compared to equal level warriors. I can see who takes less heals and who has a harder time surviving fights. From where I'm sitting I'm giving up plenty for the agro I have. <br />
<br />
 Horseshit. Horseshit and apple butter. Are you telling me that using a Paladin to tank in an XP group is a DISADVANTAGE? Are you saying that the difference between a Paladin and a Warrior tanking at lower levels than EP/Time is a NOTICABLE one in FAVOR of the Warrior? If so, you are arguing against the anecdotal evidence of a large part of the playerbase who says Knight tanking makes their groups EASIER!<br />
<br />
 Or are they all wrong? So much easier to believe that EVERYONE who posts on the issue is wrong, and Chavr is right? Give me a fucking break.<br />
<br />
 1. There aren't as many people in elemental + level as there are people in the lower levels of the game. <br />
<br />
 You're absolutely right. Unfortunately, the 'balance' in aggro control isn't felt by Warriors until they get raid level NODROP items, outside of two or three weapons. Knights get their aggro control starting from level 9 in the form of cheap spells. The aggro difference is LARGER pre EP than post. And the survivability issue is not NEARLY as large as you make it seem, since most gear a Warrior can wear is NOT exclusive to them - Paladins can wear the EXACT same gear in most cases, and the only thing the HP difference means is that the Cleric CH's at 60 on the Paladin instead of 50 on the Warrior. BOY, what an advantage, eh?<br />
<br />
 2. There are methods to improve mitigation for the areas where gear has closed the gap some. A class wide nerf is not the answer. <br />
<br />
 A 'nerf' by making it so you can't cast a level 9 spell to gain aggro on a mob it logically should never affect? Puhleeze, whine more. Plus, I could care about mitigating more, I mitigate well enough. I don't control the mob well at all with my innate ability - the same innate nonspell ability YOU HAVE - and that should be fixed. At the same time, it's not too much to ask to use appropriate level spells for appropriate level mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay there's your whole quote, I hope you're happy, well let's take a look at a single part now and talk about why you're wrong and I'm right. <br />
<br />
You've said you want equality and interchangability between the 3 plate tanks. What reason justifies that? Warriors are masters of war and sacrifice everything for aggro and tanking therefore they should be the best at what they do. Paladins sacrifice what? Oh... nothing. I see, you just want to maintain your imbalance so that groups will pick you over a true -warrior- tank.<br />
<br />
I said before that even if the devs at EQ did infact follow my suggestions that I'd cntinue to group with paladins and shadow knights because they have utility to add to a group.<br />
<br />
Right now: <br />
Paladins offer survivability + aggro + utility = best tanks in EQ<br />
Warriors still offer survivability (not as high as pally because they got heals and stuns) + 1/2 aggro = not tanking as well as Paladins.<br />
<br />
So there's math for you, you offer too much and sacrifice nothing, you are hands down the best tanking class in EQ and that's OUR job. We chose the class which was intended to have that spot. It would be like if a druid or a shaman surpassed a cleric in healing. Or if a druid or mage surpassed wizards in direct damage spells.<br />
<br />
So... don't go posting about whatever else you were thinking of posting because so far you've been wrong and you'll just be wrong again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I'm hesistant to even reply on this board again.  It's really starting to feel pointless to bother posting anymore.  I shall make one more effort though to have a reasonable discussion.<br />
<br />
You try to say that stuns are greater then warrior innate mitigation, yet stuns are resisted, some mobs are stun immune and paladin innate mitigation is lower then warriors.  Relying on stun to mitigate every single mob you fight is a losing propostion.  If a mob requires stun for a paladin to tank then you will lose out more often then not.  All paladins are subject to mobs stunning them.  Stuns have a refresh time to be cast.  Between being stunned, fizzles and resists stun is not reliable for constant mitigation.  Stun is useful, and allows a paladin to tank some mobs, but it's not the end all be all that you make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the best at mitigation.  Hands down.  They have the best innnate mitigation, higher ac/hp and when all else fails they just click the defensive button and mitigate better then anyone else for the next 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, as for agro.  There are two things I want to try to communicate here.  First is warriors have just as much agro as anyone else in the game, because a successful taunt gives you current hate +1.  However, that alone isn't enough.  That is the second thing I want to speak about.  The fact that the current taunt isn't enough and does need changing.  Warriors should never equal a knights agro output, but they do need better then what they have now. SOMETHING I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS.  I cap'ed that because somehow you warriors keep assuming I don't want any improvements for your class.  Higher success rate and some innate hate on success and lesser hate on failure, with the total hate capped at a certain point, is needed for warriors.  Increase the range of taunt to about 50ft also.  So yes, knights would have better snap agro, but warriors would have enough agro that they would be able to get a mobs attention on inc.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm telling you that in a group a warrior is a better tank then me.  I work with the warrior to ensure he maintains high agro, but he tanks.  When a cleric is running near OOM when I'm MT and has enough mana to nuke with a warrior as MT tells me one thing... I take more damage.  The warrior only had about 500 more hp then me at the time also.  As long as the warrior can maintain agro they are the better tank.<br />
<br />
All the evidence ya'll want to flash around is from people talking about an optimum group.  How many optimum groups are really out there though?  How many times are people in a group where someone doesnt' end up afk, or ld or you have to dodge a train.  How often do buffs fade or get stripped and you have to recast.  How many times do you get a bad pull and have to slow down to handle it?  In a perfect situation, with a perfect group you would be better with the higher agro tank, as long as they have enough mitigation to handle the mobs being tanked.  90% of the groups aren't these perfect situations.  There is no need to max out efficiency.  A warrior can be used in these groups just fine.  The group might have to go just a tad slower when starting a fight, but who cares because you will have to go slower at other times also.  Who is really counting the minutes in combat per hour vs. number of mobs killed?  No one.  It's just done on the boards to show hypothetical situations.  This doesnt' mean there isn't a problem.  Merely that the problem isn't as bad in game as it is on the boards.  Warriors are far from useless and unwanted completely, yet if you looked at the boards you'd think warriors just sit at the zone lines for days on end begging for a group.<br />
<br />
Your agro argument is fairly accurate and my taunt suggestion above answers that.  Your survivability argument is wrong though because a paladin does take that much more damage until your in VT or better loot, which is usually elemental if you can do VT.  Until you hit VT most gear is class specific and yes the warrior gear is taht much better.  No one gets every piece of high end all/all gear.  It's spread out amongst the tanks, you might get one or two pieces but in now way do you get enough until you hit VT.  So that whole argument is pretty much worthless.<br />
<br />
I agree with you about cease and desist.  If people do use them for agro on lvl 60ish mobs then something is wrong and their agro component needs to be hardcapped.  I've never once said that was a bad idea.  My only beef is warriors who think all stun agro should be nerfed.  Stuns and the agro from them are what make paladins the best emergency class.  We make mobs pause their attacks on others and then make the mob attack us until such time the mob can be dealt with.  That is what a paladin is primarily setup for.  However, there are fewer and fewer instances where such a class is needed.  So a paladin then needs to do his secondary role... tank.  Nerfing our primary role will also nerf our secondary role, in which case we would really not have much to offer a group.  Paladins are tanks and if our abilities to tank are stripped from us then there is no need to invite one to a group.  All those heals and BSS and our streaky undead dmg is not enough alone.  We have to be viable tanks as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Omni... read this really slow ok.<br />
<br />
Paladins and shadowknights are TANKS.<br />
<br />
Warriors are TANKS.<br />
<br />
That is three classes that are tanks, yet 80% or so of all groups only need ONE tank class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Three tanks... One slot....<br />
<br />
The only way to make this fair is for all three tank classes to be equally desired for the tank slot.  The factors for who you choose should be based on group makeup and the area you plan to exp in.  The situation would dictate your choice.<br />
<br />
Lastly, as I just said in the post to partha... paladins are not the best at survivablity.  Warriors are.  If that weren't true then paladins would be tanking every mob at every raid for every guild.  My guild only uses paladins as off tanks on lesser mobs.  That is because warriors are the better tanks.  <br />
<br />
However, if you are firmly under the conviction warriors suck so bad they can't tank anything anymore, then nothing I can say will alter your opinon.</div></div><hr />

And this stuff about paladins offer nothing to a group without stuns? That's crazy you'd still be able to group heal, buff and rez, that's more than a warrior has. From what I understand those group heals can bring a tremendous ammount of aggro. So... you'd be like us warriors, relying on  taunt for aggro but you'd also still have other choices.<br />
<br />
I've heard of my friends doing LDoN groups with paladins as the main healer and them winning. So now the 4 healing classes are apparently Cleric/Druid/Shaman/Paladin? which reminds me... Clerics should be getting on Paladins too for them infringing on their other side of a Paladin's hybridness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">It's not that we offer nothing without stuns... it's that we offer nothing without the ability to be a tank in some form.  Group heals are good agro, but they consume a very large chunk of mana.  If you use them solely for agro you will be oom and medding very fast.<br />
<br />
There is no way I'd be able to main heal for any group.  Once again, maybe some elemental paladins are doing it, but that is the few, not the majority.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changing some of the stuns isn't a bad idea.  The lowest level ones that apparently some are using for agro.  That is rather silly.  Nerfing the level appropiate stuns though would be wrong.  They are the only thing lesser equipped paladins have to even out the mitigation/survivability gap.  If they are altered then a paladin can't be relied on as a tank.  If the agro from all stuns was nerfed then a paladin could not be relied upon for emergencies.<br />
<br />
We are the sum of our abilities.  If we lack anything we pretty much have now then we lose a large portion of our desirability. <br />
<br />
The solution here is to upgrade warriors in their weak areas to bring them on par with current content.  Paladins are there now.  Other then a few spell issues that are kind of silly our class is right where it needs to be.  Warriors need to be brought inline with everyone else.  Dragging paladins down will only hurt the tank classes, it won't help them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">You've said you want equality and interchangability between the 3 plate tanks. What reason justifies that? Warriors are masters of war and sacrifice everything for aggro and tanking therefore they should be the best at what they do. Paladins sacrifice what? Oh... nothing. I see, you just want to maintain your imbalance so that groups will pick you over a true -warrior- tank<br />
<br />
I think he means when someone is looking for a tank for an experience group they want a plate tank and dont' really care which one.  I don't think there is anything wrong with that assumption and if you really think all exp groups should always look for a warrior to tank... well I just don't think you will ever get what you want.  There should be trade offs here and there, some people should prefer one tank over the other depending on group makeup etc, but if your group needs a tank and a warrior, pal or SK walk into zone they should all be viable enough that you pick them instead of looking for another class.<br />
<br />
Right now there are two problems with tanking. <br />
<br />
1) Knights are too close to warriors in the overall survivability and warriors are too low on the aggro scale.  On the flip side its quite posible that if this is balanced in the future that paladin spells at least are too weak, I have never added a paladin to one of my groups for his spells or his dps, its only for the tanking aspect.  If they made warriors beefier tanks and fixed their aggro they could pump up paladins spell casting side a bit.  (can't comment on SK's much)<br />
<br />
2) Non plate melee are too close to knights/warriors from an overall survivability scale.  Its just too easy for the non tank melee DPS classes to tank exp mobs these days.<br />
<br />
This game is evolving into a DPS fest more and more with each expansion.  Right now in my opinion the power scale goes(not including healers who are too hard to judge)<br />
<br />
Casters &gt; Melee hybrids(especially beastlords) &gt; Rogue &gt;  Knights &gt; Monks\Warriors .<br />
<br />
Any help for knights, monks or warriors is nothing but a good thing from an overall game standpoint in my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Chavr, this is the problem.<br />
<br />
 When a Shadowknight tanks, everyone knows that he has fewer HP and generally less AC than a similarly equipped Warrior, and that he's going to require more healing. In return, he gets the best aggro generation among plate tanks.<br />
<br />
 When a Warrior tanks, everyone knows that you're going to get the best HP and AC there is in the game given similar equipment. You know he's going to mitigate a bit better than the Shadowknight, and you know he gives up aggro control for those bonuses.<br />
<br />
 When a Paladin tanks, everyone knows that he gets aggro generation functionally equal to a Shadowknight, while being nearly as durable as a Warrior - certainly much more durability than a Shadowknight. He'll also mitigate over the short span of a single XP engagement nearly the equal of a Warrior. The problem is, he gives up essentially NOTHING to get these advantages over the other two. And no, DPS is NOT a concern among plate tanks, being that plate tanks almost never do even half the damage to any one mob in an XP group.<br />
<br />
 Paladins right now have no functional weaknesses. THAT'S the problem. My ideas of retuning stuns only offers that if you use them for mitigation and aggro extensively, you'll pay for it in med time. That's probably not the case in the high-end game, but high end Warriors don't see a problem with aggro generation in general. The problem is seen and felt most acutely BEFORE you get to the Elemental Planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">So what your saying is that a paladins agro + mitigation = a good tank to have, while a warriors agro + mitigation = not as good of a tank to have.<br />
<br />
So why not make it so that warrior agro + mitigation = good tank to have?<br />
<br />
Warrior mitigation is the best with agro being lesser.  Boost agro so it is functionaly workable in an exp setting and you have equality.<br />
<br />
Warrior = best mitigation + good agro<br />
<br />
Paladin = best agro + good mitigation<br />
<br />
<br />
Both are wanted and viable and the only thing to consider is what kinds of mobs your fighting or the make up of your group (caster dps or melee dps).<br />
<br />
As for SK's.... I really have no clue what they need.  The sk's in my guild are on par with my hp's and I don't know enough about their spells to make any determination there.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you think about it, there is nothign wrong with a class not having a weakness.  That means they are right where they need to be and are apealing to groups.  Warriors are weak in the agro deptarment.  So beef them up so they aren't.  Then they will have no functional weakness either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">This is the fundamental difference between players like me and Valeris and players like you and Glatius and Aeka.<br />
<br />
 You three seem to find the idea of any kind of risk in the game abhorrent. We see it as a necessary part of the game.<br />
<br />
 You want Warriors to have aggro functionally equivalent to that of Paladins currently? That means not only that they would have to retune ALL content in the game, since Warriors also have /defensive (/defensive sucks for XP groups but is super peachy neeto for raids), it also means that the risk of anything bad happening in game outside of raids (maybe even raids as well) would approach vanishingly small. It's like playing Quake in god mode - fun for a bit, but once it gets old you DON'T go back.<br />
<br />
 That's why we prefer keeping the base difficulty there in game - this helps keep the game interesting, and it keeps people having goals to obtain. We're seeing the flight of a lot of high end people out of EQ already, simply because there's not much to do that's absorbing or challenging left in game. Why would you want to speed that process up by allowing people to use the content even quicker than they do/can now? Further, why would SONY want to do that, especially with EQ2 looking to NOT be the breakout success they hoped for?<br />
<br />
 You know, for the longest time in game, people played and had fun while aggro generation was NOT the be all and end all of grouping. PoP was only bad because it was overly weighted towards the top end - people at the top end didn't find the first two tiers overly challenging. Those who DID - well, they discovered that between the attention lavished on the Hybrid tanks, the screwy itemization, the outsized XP bonuses of Tiers 1 and 2, and the scaling of power of all the mana using classes that things went easier with aggro lock. Since it's human nature to follow the path of least resistance - we are where we are today. Funny thing is, as I mentioned in another thread, most of the server population, were you to tune aggro down a bit, to eliminate lock - it wouldn't really affect them much. They'd change their playstyle and life would go on, much like every other change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Okay... if you think that warrior aggro being near paladin aggro would remove all risk from the game, you have some serious delusions about this game. With better tanking/aggro I'd be more tempted to intentionally pull and tank 3 mobs at a time in an exp group where as right now I feel comfortable only tanking 2 for a short period of time. In other words I'd use my higher skills to go out and have fun and to attempt things I wouldn't dare try now by challenging myself and my groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">No Partha you just don't grasp that simply removing aggro from paladins does not balance all aggro in the game.  All you do is drag paladins down to where warriors are now and make SK's and Beastlords the tank of choice.   I would love to see them completely rework the entire aggro system including nerfing slow all to heck, nerfing lull and nerfing mesmerize so that there was honest to goodness risk in the game, but that will never happen, you know it, I know it, everyone knows it.   They aren't going to balance warriors by changing every other class, they are going to do it by changing warriors.  So the only real option for balance is to raise warrior aggro or raise warriors survivability.  You are left with the choice of what combo of those two things is the best.<br />
<br />
As for DPS not being a concern, bull crap... in this game DPS is &gt; all.  I have been passed over for a group because they wanted a SK for the DPS because frankly healing/mitigation just isn't that important with enough AA.  Now its not so important that I think had the SK not been around the group would have waited, but it most certainly is a part of balance, as much so as the mystical &quot;utility&quot; that supposedly gets Paladin's groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Omni, your statement reinforces my very point. You could do these things right now if you wanted to, but you view the risk as outweighing the rewards. Right now, Warriors are viewed as inferior choices to Knights for that very same reason. Reducing the amount of risk (note I said reducing, and 'vanishingly small' in the previous post, not 'elminating') will only trivialize the content more quickly. That's not good for the long term health of the game.<br />
<br />
 And Ennder, they could do that right now, as far as Warriors are concerned in aggro control. The fact that most people don't should point SOMETHING out to you. If aggro generation was the be-all and end-all, then Warriors and Knights would BOTH be out of jobs. For most Beastlords, however, mitigation is still a factor - that and the fact that while they have excellent INITIAL aggro, they don't really have tools for snap aggro. Unless you count Flash of Light, which has it's own drawbacks, all their aggro spells are slow casting, and they DON'T get Taunt either.<br />
<br />
 Oh, and as far as DPS goes, as long as I have to DW to get my aggro up with proc bandaids whilst ya'll frowst about with the 2hander of your choice, then DPS DOES mean squat. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Partha, sorry but you're wrong. I could survive 3-4 mobs at once right now. I just have no garuntee I can keep all 3 or 4 off of the rest of my group members. A pally or a SK would not have this same problem with the same mobs. Therefore a knight is a better tank in that type of situation due to the fact that they can indeed protect their group.<br />
<br />
Please think before you post. Or maybe level up a bit so you actually have some accurate input on the subject at hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">You're missing my point, Omni.<br />
<br />
 Right now, you could STILL pull 5 mobs to camp on every pull. What stops you is knowing the likely consequences of that action. A Paladin can do the same thing, but because of aggro control that is overpowered for the environs and his other tools, he shortstops the likely consequences of that action. That's what I mean when I tell Paladins they have too much aggro generation for their durability.<br />
<br />
 And, no, you don't need to smartass about levels to make that observation. If you haven't made it by level 30 or so, or similar observations on aggro control, chances are you never will, as long as you keep a Knight in front of your group. You see what I'm saying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">... I'm not missing any point you said there would be no risk if I had better aggro. I stated that I would do things like pull more mobs and tanking more than one mob at once to increase my risk factor and then you say I missed your point. Um... no<br />
<br />
The reason I don't pull 5 mobs to camp on every pull is becasue it's STUPID considering my current aggro. 7+ fails on all 5 mobs? Yeah right. But a paladin throws down 5 stuns and there is no aggro problem for them. So you're saying that aggro for warriors breaks the game? But aggro for a paladin doesn't?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just use some common sense here please. And the thing about levels... I think it's valid, I was level 60 back before Luclin and there was no aggro problem. I'm not sure how level 60 warriors are now in comparison to their hybrids and personally I don't care, I've played a warrior up to 65 and I'm tired of getting this BS from other players, &quot;We'd like a tank that can hold aggro, sorry&quot;.<br />
<br />
So level up to 65, get a hundred AA and then when you see a level 62 Paladin picked to tank in BoT over you, feel free to come back here and comment on how you think warriors don't deserve aggro. Until then, you really don't have a clue as to how bad the situation is, thanks.</div></div><hr />

You can twist it around anyway you like, but I'm convinced that a warrior can be perfectly viable while having less agro then a paladin, yet more agro then currently.<br />
<br />
Your proposition looks like the death knell of knights to me and I'll fight it tooth and nail.   At no point do I agree warriors should have both unmatched survivablity and unmatched agro.  Paladin spellbooks don't provide enough utility to get a group based solely on their contents.  Our appeal comes from our spell line coupled with our tanking ability.  Remove the need for our tanking aspects and you completely remove the need for the paladin as a whole.<br />

<br />
 Omni -<br />
<br />
 Actually, I'm a bit BETTER qualified to talk about it than you, because I WASN'T 60 at the release of Luclin, and because I DON'T XP in BoT now. Warriors in the 50's with VERY few exceptions didn't have any good anger weapons (and still really don't unless they can come up with 20k and invest in the Droga weapons). During the 50's, unless you've got guildies, you ain't got shit to work with as far as grouping unless there's NO other tank around. Period. Because all the casters know that they can group with a Knight and grind it out a hell of a lot faster and a hell of a lot easier, that's what they do. What you're seeing in BoT is the end result of that process, not the beginning.<br />
<br />
 Further, I think it's good that you wanna push yourself in all phases of the game. Most people don't. That's why, in BoT, it's the Chavrs of the world that get picked for groups and not the Omnis. And since I don't particularly like the thought of them having to retune ALL the content in the game, and the subsequent hassles that would give everyone, that's why I proposed what I proposed.</div></div><hr />

You can argue it sanyway you want, but you're still wrong. Paladin after Paladin has posted on a thread in PoN outlining why they were just as happy not tanking in a group. Why do you suppose that is? I'll gladly tell you or you can go read it for yourself - the spellbook. Yes, the mighty spellbook with heals, Root, etc. is a huge difference.<br />

Paladins that insist on parity as Tanks are really saying we want to be = tanks and have a spellbook.<br />

If warriors are improved to such an extent that they are hands down the best, most desirable tank then there will be no desire to have a paladin.  The reason is a paladin offers tanking + utility.  The improved warrior your talking about offers tanking + dps.  However, your warrior would tank so much better that it would be silly to try to root park or CC adds.  Just stick the warrior on it and let him go to town.<br />

Paladins HAVE to remain desired for their tanking or they will not get a group.  All those pretty spells you dote on do nothing without the fact that we can tank.  It's just that simple.  No value as tank = no value to a group.<br />

Paladins are SUPPOSED to be tanks + spellbook.  We are weaker tanks then warriors  but our spells make up the difference.  If we aren't desired as tanks then by no means are we caster enough to do anything for a group.  <br />

Giving a warrior aggro control similar to yours doesn't suddenly stop you being able to take the hits as well as you do now, how often is aggro control the only means by which you get to offtank? You could do the exact same job without hitting a stun first via the 'warrior method'. What does aggro have to do with the other spells you yourself tell us you're using in a group? <br />

Knights can only argue superior aggro control being needed if they WANT to be a better choice to main tank and yet you prefer not to? Ookkaay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Superior agro control is needed however for emergency situations, which is where paladins are meant to excel.  If warriors have equal or superior agro (which some warriors advocate) then they will be the tanks used in emergencies.  The combination of agro + tanking will mean they are the most logical choice to peel off on adds.  When that happens paladins will serve no role at all.  <br />
<br />
MT is a paladins secondary role.  Our primary role is off tank/emergency class.  If warriors were able to control an add as easily as a paladin then paladins would no longer have a primary or a secondary role, as warriors could fill both more effectively.<br />

I have nothing against warriors receiving an upgraded form of taunt.  I am however completely against warriors getting equal or greater form of agro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">People tend to overlook that Force of Akilae is also the best damage prevention spell in the game. For 65 mana you're guaranteed to stop at least one round the mob has. To be conservative, let's say the average PoP mob does 300 damage a round on average (double 600, hitting 50%, and hitting for average damage), that's almost a 1 to 5 heal there, which is better than any other heal except Complete Heal. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, thats better than any other spell but Complete heal.   Er... well except Complete Heal, Karana's Renewal, Quiescence all unmodified by Spec, SCM, Healing AA/duration AA, or Foci.  So, lets include full spec, SCM, the adept healing aa (I won't even include healing gift atm), SCRN, a standard 20% Imp Healing 4 (easily obtainable ornate).  I will leave mp4 out as it would reduce the cost of the stun used in comparison.  For heal over time spells I won't even assume an ext buff/duration foci.<br />
<br />
Healing AAs = 19% more hps healed<br />
Spec = 10% mana savings<br />
SCM = a further 10% mana savings<br />
SCRM = 50% increased duration.<br />
<br />
So from the baseline hp/mana the above would equate to 1.19/0.8 = 48.75% increase on a per mana basis for direct heals and 1.5/0.8 = 87.5% increase for duration heals from baseline.<br />
<br />
In otherwords direct heals would need a base hp/mana of (5/1)/(1.4875) = 3.36, duration would be (5/1.875) = 2.67 in order to be as efficient as it is claimed that stun is for damage prevention.<br />
<br />
Which 61+ priest direct heals meet those criteria?<br />
<br />
Answer:  ALL except Tnarg's mending<br />
<br />
Which 61+ priest duration heals meet that criteria?<br />
<br />
Answer: ALL of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PCs are not ever heal immune, they don't resist heals.  A paladin tanking must be unstunned and pass channeling roles to finish casting while being hit.  Furthermore STUNS do NOT prevent X seconds of NPC melee damage.  It SUSPENDS their melee action, it does not reset their delay.  On a nonslowed mob it is of the most benefit, but is the hardest to land.  It is easier to channel on a slowed mob, but it has much less effectiveness on average due to the way it suspends their attacks.  I can't move while casting, I can't melee while my spell is being cast, I can't begin another cast for 2.25s after one is finished.<br />
<br />
Are stuns useful?  Certainly.<br />
<br />
Are they anywhere *near* as useful on average as 19% increased durability?  Nope.</div></div><hr />

Hello McFly? Paladins are easily the best mitigators in the game in experience groups, and 2nd best on raids PLUS you have a load of extra abilities like rez, root, buffs, cures, fast heals, group heals, etc. <br />
<br />
Why aren't you therefore suggesting a paladin aggro nerf, to put them in line with their mitigation abilities? I mean, how stupid is it to tell warriors they have to deal with crap aggro because they mitigate well, while the game's ACTUAL best mitigator is an AGGRO GOD (in addition to being the best buffer in the game, and group healer, and fast healer, and a good rezzer, rooter, etc, etc)?<br />

<br />
Completely valid reply but I was responding solely to the overrated 'damage prevention' usefullness of stuns.  There is a real opportunity cost to casting stuns.  Without the aggro asset of stuns they frankly wouldn't be worthwhile casting while tanking even with current mana costs.<br />

Agro for the MT is not exclusive to what the MT does, it's something the entire party has to assist with.  Even with stuns I can lose agro if someone is stupid.<br />
You're just proving our point. THE WHOLE PARTY DOESN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AGGRO WHEN A PALADIN IS TANKING. Got it? Do I need to make a picture? Do I need some crazy hand signals? Hmm, picture... I think I'll make one when I get home to show you. And you can put that image onto your LFG window that way you can be reminded of what we're talking about when you are setting up a group.<br />
<br />
The combination of agro + tanking will mean they are the most logical choice to peel off on adds.  When that happens paladins will serve no role at all.<br />
I'm going to be nice and assume you're joking, and call it a day.</div></div><hr />

How do you obtain this &quot;easily best mitigator&quot; figure?  This is not *one bit* a flame, I would just like to know how you are quanifying this given the variabilities of mob immunities/resists, casting interrupts, variability of the effectiveness of stuns based upon effective mob delay, availability of buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
As far as raids go being 'second best mitigator' without superior aggro = you are what we use when *all* warriors (even those with far substandard gear) are unavailable.  Both tanking and healing/curing don't 'stack' well.  Currently both the warriors and the knights in my guild are content with their raid roles, they are unique and valued for their relative strengths.  Make knights in *all* ways inferior to warriors in regards to tanking and I doubt that would still be the case.  I guess that would leave paladins the raid role of &quot;LH tank transitions&quot;<br />

<br />
This is an emotional and subjective opinion, so I won't address the overal 'balance' but will discuss a few mentioned components.  The 'best mitigator' I am questioning above.  But to call paladins the 'best buffers' is misleading.  YES, sans the presence of a near 24/7 available 4 hour virtue paladins can buff for more HP.  But I am  being 100% truthful when I say since I memmed hero/sow/marzin (2 year ago?) I have cast it *less* than 20 times.  And not a SINGLE time was it during an XP group.  Most of them were a &quot;going to solo some low con mobs&quot;, some were duels, and the ONLY raid time I used them was for rebuffing the 4 Warriors we were churning on a 3 cleric, 24 man, 2am Aten goo fights many moons ago.<br />
<br />
Take the cleric hp buffs a pal has a delete them all so I have an excuse to not cast them 3 months from now when I am next asked to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Sure, paladins are easily the best overall mitigators in exp groups because groups with paladins <br />
<br />
-have more hps (paladins being able to buff entire parties EVEN when a cleric is present, and hugely when a druid or shaman is healing), thus reducing the impact of mob dps<br />
-produce more dps (the dps classes not needing to hold back), thus killing mobs fast (mob death being the best mitigation of all)<br />
-have more efficient healing due to aggro control, and also have EXTRA healing because paladins are the best fast healers and group healers in the game<br />
-have yet another option for ghetto crowd control with paladin root<br />
-have a back up rez if the cleric bites it, or if there is no other rez available (again, druid or shaman healer)<br />
-and have earlier and more confident debuffing (sure, get that tash, slow, and cripple in early)<br />
-can STUN mobs. Sure, stun fails sometimes. Does it fail 50% of the time --  like TAUNT does? Nope, it doesn't. Oh, and you have taunt too.<br />
<br />
See? It's easy, when you think of mitigation in broad terms -- as it SHOULD be thought of. Groups work better on many levels with paladins, and that's the essence of mitigation.<br />
<br />
But even if you define it narrowly, ignoring the impact of the paladin on the rest of the party, between stuns and the paladins own mana bar they are better mitigators, straight up. Warriors get 10% more innate mitigation, maybe, 1.5% more avoidance, and possibly 5% more hps after AotC and BSS (if that much), which is an aggregate of 16.5% more survivability, possibly. Stuns and the use of the mana bar EASILY make up that amount.<br />
<br />
But wait, that's not all. Keep in mind here that the this 16% difference ONLY applies to the warrior and the paladin. But the paladin adds at a MINIMUM 330 hps to EVERY person in the party. Now the party has more aggregate hps, including the people most likely to suffer from aggro. A paladin adds from 1980 (at a minimum) to 10,830 hps to the party -- just with buffs, never mind the hps he renews with heals (or AC he can add), or the hps he adds that others renew with their heals. Now the GROUP as a whole has significantly more survivability, and since we are talking about groups, that's really the end of the story.</div></div><hr />

And they're - according to paladins anyway - second-best at mitigation. Warriors, on the other hand, are best mitigation in the game, but their agro control is superior to none. Dead last. Any caster will out agro a warrior, as will monks and rogues.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it make sense for warriors to be #1 in mitigation and #3 at agro control in the game, behind knights but ahead of all the other casters? Since knights are #2 at mitigation and #1 at agro control?</div></div><hr />

That's defining the term so broadly that it no longer matches the commonly accepted definition of the term.  The narrow defintion once again avoids any attempt at quantification and simply claims that paladins directly mitigate better via spell usage &quot;easily&quot;.  That is hardly an effective argument.  Paladins could claim that the increased personal warrior DPS, hp, avoidance, and mitigation &quot;easily&quot; make warriors the better group tank.  Both arguments would be pointless as they really aren't developed well enough to *be* an argument.  They are at best unfounded conjecture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Uh..did you read my post?<br />
<br />
Paladins routinely say warriors are better mitigators, and offer warrior hps as a reason why.<br />
<br />
On that basis, what possible reason could there be to exclude the hps knights bring to parties in the form of buffs and heals? Or to exclude the hps knights clearly save as a result of aggro control? Or exclude the dps saved from mobs as a result of stun? Etc.<br />
<br />
The answer is there's no reason, except that it's convenient for knights to do so.<br />
<br />
For knights to ignore the effect of the mana bar in extending their mitigation powers is simply dishonest.<br />
<br />
If you reject my definition, I reject yours as meaningless. It's just character description -- warriors have more personal mitigation and more personal hps. But warrior *GROUPS* have less mitigation and less hps. Which is the mitigation that matters?<br />
<br />
And my narrow definition is perfectly valid; at least as valid as any claim you have made, for instance. You seriously don't believe that group wide buffs and stun that stop all incoming damage for a period of time account for a 16% difference between two individual characters? Do you play EQ? Reading the following, I'm not sure:<br />
<br />
Paladins could claim that the increased personal warrior DPS, hp, avoidance, and mitigation &quot;easily&quot; make warriors the better group tank. Both arguments would be pointless as they really aren't developed well enough to *be* an argument. They are at best unfounded conjecture. <br />
<br />
See, there's legitimate argumentation, and then there's just arguing for the sake of arguing. This is the latter. <br />
<br />
For example, the personal dps gap is 20%, proven in many parses -- unless undead mobs (like the many in LDoN) are the target. This is what? The difference between 100 dps and 80 dps -- so the paladins are seriously suggesting 20 dps is meaningful? Is that a joke? Anyway, GROUP dps is clearly higher with a knight tank, because of aggro control -- check the posts by wizards on this point. Which is the more relevant measure? Obviously group dps, and any effort by knights to drag the discussion into personal dps is pointless argumentation. <br />
<br />
The avoidance gap, which you've just offered as a potentially substantial difference, is all of 1.5%, anticipated theoretically and proven in parses. Again, pointless.<br />
<br />
The personal hp gap we've already gone through -- it amounts to maybe 500 hps after personal buffs are accounted for, but is more than completely eliminated JUST by the group hps the paladin brings to a group in buffs. Paladins bring a MINIMUM of 2330 and a maxium of 9080 hps to a group just in buffs. Why are these hps less significant than the hps on their characters? They aren't. Of course, we still aren't counting the hps latent in the mana bar as a result of heals.<br />
<br />
The mitigation gap is 10%, proven in parses, but that's only between the two characters, once again ignoring the impact on the party. Etc. But how about these stuns? If you land one or two stuns that actually land on every exp mob, which is perfectly feasible, you've just made up hundreds of points of damage the tank would have had to absorb otherwise. Could you stun enough to stop 10% of exp mob dps? Easily. That's 4 seconds on a 40 second fight -- which is like 1 stun.<br />
<br />
None of this is unfounded conjecture. <br />
<br />
I understand it's inconvenient for you, but you just can't ignore what happens to parties. At the end of the day, that's what matters. And that's why paladins are better experience group mitigators, just as I said they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I could live with what Landrain calls 'hard capping' of stuns to have no effect on mobs higher than the level they can effect.  This would cap Cease, Desist, Stun, Holy Might, and Force at 55.  It would cap Force of Akera and Quellious Words of Tranquility at 61, and would cap Force of Akilae at 65.  This would force Paladins to use level-appropriate stuns.<br />
<br />
I think the mana costs and range of the stuns are appropriate, however.  Landrain's ideas for increasing the mana cost and reducing the range on stuns would make them unusable in a group setting.  The stun might only get used to interrupt a CH or Gate, and then only if there weren't many casting mobs to worry about.  <br />
<br />
So while it is not appropriate for Paladins to be able to hold aggro by chain casting a spell that only costs 15 mana, it is appropriate for a Paladin to be able to cast Force of Akilae an average of twice a fight in an experience grind.  Hard capping the stuns as described would move things in that direction, while the changes that Landrain suggests would be very close to removing stuns from a Paladin's spellbook altogether.<br />

<br />
*I* asked several times for your analysis of stuns as an ISOLATED element.  Once you have that you can apply that figure to the OVERALL class balance debate.<br />
<br />
But you somehow can't do that, don't want to, or aren't getting the point.<br />
<br />
You want each and every element to mystically just 'be' so it can jump headlong into your class balance crusade and thus the numbers twist and turn every which way till they are pointless and can be 'defended' with whines thinly veiled as insults.<br />

The CLOSEST you came was saying 10% mob dps decrease with stuns was 'easy that's just 1 stun per 40s fight'.<br />

Wow, *that* is some compelling argument.<br />
<br />
Of course, its flat-out wrong.  If you want to know why ask Graal.  He may be willing to educate you.  I am no longer wasting my time in this thread.<br />
<br />
You want  to keep equating tank direct mob melee mitigation to everything a paladin can do there can be no argument, because there is nothing to argue.  I didn't bring up warrior AAs or discs as they weren't relevent to the isolated analysis one would ASSUME would take place in a post entitled &quot;Stun, and Analysis...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fact 1:  Warriors have more absolute tanking power, but are often somewhat less group efficient.<br />
Fact 2:  Paladins are often more group efficient as a tank, but have less absolute tanking power.<br />
<br />
That is the current situation.  Either accept *some* measure of 2 or give up *all* of 1.  <br />
<br />
Supplemental paladin spell 'utility' should be balanced by warrior dps and utility.<br />
<br />
The VAST majority of warriors accept 1 and 2.  Many would wish for the gaps to be closed and imo MOST of them realize that the existence of that dichotomy preserves the distinct flavor of both classes.<br />
<br />
However SOME paladins want absolute 100% tanking parity in ALL situations.  I am NOT among them.  SOME warriors want absolute 100% tanking parity that borders on preference in ALL situations.<br />
<br />
Neither is going to happen.</div></div><hr />

I can't.  Neither should you if you think about the entirety of the game.<br />
<br />
Implementing something that would make stuns have 0 impact on mobs depending on level range in order to tweak relative aggro and mana usage IS appropriate.<br />
<br />
BUT,<br />
<br />
Leaving NO aggro capability at ALL on 69+ mobs, ONLY DS on mobs 66+, and ONLY Akilae and DS on mobs 62+ is going a bit *too* far.  It really would greatly diminish paladin raid AT aggro.  Even though LDoN should NOT have been used to 'balance tank aggro' it has done a fair amount to that end.<br />
<br />
I would suggest leaving all post 60 stuns at full impact on ALL mobs and capping all PRE-60 stuns at level 60 mobs (this being a slight nerf to Akeara).   However additional coding would be needed to give some indication whether stuns are working or not.<br />
<br />
The mana costs suggested in the original post remains unusably excessive just as much as current mana for cease as aggro is too negligible.</div></div><hr />

I offered all the support I needed for the arguments I made. I laid out my basic premise, which is that hps generated or saved via mana are as valuable as the hps carried by characters. From that followed everthing else, with supplemental rebuttals of the various pointless or bogus arguments offered by you (personal dps, avoidance, hps, etc).  I realize it's simple and convenient to ignore the effects of the mana bar and the spellbook in considering hps and the effects of mitigation. The problem is that ignores the basic issues.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you haven't made a single contribution here. You offer a few general and bogus criticisms, but nothing directly on point.  You say things are unfounded, when they clearly aren't. You say you can refute my crazy notion that paladins can cast ONE stun per mob, but then you don't. You say my numbers are twisted, yet you offer nothing to show otherwise. That's not surprising, since with a large body of parses and the facts of simple arithmetic lying behind those arguments, you can't.<br />

The odd thing is that you then go ahead and make my point, though in a somewhat weaker form. Umm..thanks, I guess.<br />

Anyway, my entry into the thread was to object to the notion that Chavr and many paladins have put forward, that taunt should scale with mitigation -- because they clearly exempt themselves from that argument.

<br />
I have 8144 hp fully buffed. If general Reparm turns on me and does 8200 damage to me in a single round, how does my mana help me? If I had had 200 hp more, I could have survived that single round of combat. <br />
<br />
*BTW, I have actually had something like that happen. I got my fang of flame, which was about a 45hp upgrade for me. The next mob we fought was Babs, I got aggro from groups heals and babs turned on me for a single combat round. I had 12 hp left afterwards. A heal landed, bringing me to full hp, and babs turned back to the tank. If I had not had those extra 45 hp from that earring, I would have died. Very minor differences in total hp can have dramatic effects, but only when the damage taken in a single round is close to your max hp. In most other situations, max hp isn't nearly as important.<br />
<br />
If I am taking 20 damage per second tanking (just pulled a low number out of my ass) and I am able to effectively heal myself, my mana essentially does exactly what you contend: it augments my total hp. It can extend my hp outs for a long, long time, assuming stuns and interrupts don't keep me from healing more damage than I am taking.<br />

If I am taking very significant damage, but not enough to kill me in one round, I can use some of my mana to in a sense augment my hp. I can use that mana at a fixed rate. The maximum rate at which I can use my mana to augment my hp is 262hp per second. I can do so for about 30 seconds before I have completely used my mana pool of just under 4k. (Fairly significant mana pool for a hybrid) If I can take the time to heal myself slower, I can do so in a much more efficient way.<br />
<br />
The hp differential between a paladin and a warrior is forever. It doesn't run out after 30 seconds, it doesn't stop working after 30 seconds, etc. There is one caveat...defensive also acts as a hp augmentation, but defensive is only available 30%? of the time. Of course, defensive is the single biggest hp augmentation ability in the game. Fairly analagous to using mana as a hp aug in a way, but also very different mechanisms and different strengths and weaknesses. Using mana to supplement (augment, whatever) your hp works better the lower the damage per second, whereas the hp augmentation of defensive works better the greater the damage per second. Also, no amount of mana will heal you if you take more damage in a single round than you have in hp. Defensive effectively increases your hp by x% in relation to melee damage only.<br />
<br />
I think that those things are fairly balanced. I do want to point something out: A warrior can team with a healer to augment their hp in the exact same way that a paladin augments their hp. No amount of additional healing (you could bring 100 clerics) will allow a paladin to survive a single round of combat greater than his total hp. To put it another way:<br />
<br />
A paladin can do some things that a warrior would require the help of another class to do. A warrior can do things that a paladin simply cannot do, regardless of the amount of support he brings along with him.</div></div><hr />

I have 8144 hp fully buffed. If general Reparm turns on me and does 8200 damage to me in a single round, how does my mana help me? If I had had 200 hp more, I could have survived that single round of combat. <br />

<br />
Wow, Paladin's can one group Reparm and Babs? Btw Reparm can do upwards of 20,000 damage in one round, so defensive wouldn't help one bit there. Especially if the warrior has to dual-wield to try to hold aggro, but we won't go there....<br />
<br />
Your argument completely and utterly misses the point Graal. I honestly expected better, but then I realized that there is no justifying argument for the state of paladins in todays game. Several expansions ago, they became the pet class of some Dev and we now have one of the most overcompensated for classes in the game.<br />
<br />
As a refresher... This post was suggestions and analysis of the Paladin Spell line to see what is wrong with it, and what can be changed to fix it..<br />
<br />
All the discussion about hps and mitigation is, like communism, a red hering...<br />
<br />
The problem is very simple..<br />
<br />
Paladins + Stuns  vs  Warriors + Taunt ... in an EXPERIENCE GROUP setting.<br />
<br />
Paladins have a multitude of raid uses and roles, warriors have very limited roles, far fewer than a paladin, yet we see paladins screaming for more raid roles. Warriors are ok for the most part  with their raid role.<br />
<br />
The problem is the  Experience group role. Warriors simply cannot compare to a paladin. I cannot find one sensible person who can honestly say that in any normal exp situation it is more desireable to have a warrior than a paladin. Do warriors still get groups, sometimes. Do warriors sit LFG for hours on end, quite often many do. Are warriors clearly the last plate tank chosen for groups, mostly. There are always exceptions, time geared, full elemental with BoW, etc,etc.. But UNLESS you know the name, guild tag or the rep of the two people involved, invariablely if you have choice between war and pal for the tank spot, you choose the paladin.<br />
<br />
Why? Warrior gear is an unknown, ESP with armor dyes, you can no longer look at a player and see their gear. Paladin stuns are a KNOWN quantity. They have them, they use them. EVEN if they dont have their 60+ spells, everyone knows they have cease and desist. And Cease can be chain cast non-stop by almost any paladin with just ONE of the several Mana regen spells available, and NEVER with a loss of mana... <br />
<br />
Cease cost 15 mana, cast 1.5, reset 9.. can be cast every 2 ticks<br />
<br />
SD = 18 mana in 2 ticks<br />
Bo9/Po9 =  16 mana in 2 ticks<br />
Quelious = 36 mana in 2 ticks<br />
Tranquility = 32 mana in 2 ticks<br />
KEI = 28 mana in 2 Ticks<br />
PoTC/PoTG = 12 mana in 2 ticks<br />
AoC = 6 mana in 2 ticks<br />
<br />
ONLY if the only buff a paladin has is AoC or PoTG/PoTC do you ever have a LOSS of mana when chain casting... People KNOW this, People expect this. <br />
<br />
Dont tell me you never cast cease, sorry I honestly dont believe you. When you have a slower, the mobs gimped dps doesnt matter so the stun effect of lowering dps really is not a factor, all you need is aggro, and cease is BY FAR the most efficient aggro generator in the game, nothing compares to it. If you DONT USE it, you are the one who is the fool. <br />
<br />
And dont tell me how you only have 8 spell slots so you dont memorize it.. Well considering how every single paladin claims that ther healing, and rooting, and utility spells are useless.. WHAT else do you memorize? hell you only need 2 spell slots from what all the paladins claim, since your other 6 slots are so utterly useless..<br />
<br />
And while we are at it, we really need to change the way we discuss this, because it allows paladins to further twist the argument..<br />
<br />
No longer should we call it Paladin Stun Aggro... We need to call it.. Paladin NON-STUNNING Agro. Because invariably another paladin will use the argument, &quot;Please take aggro away from stuns, then I can STUN LOCK mobs forever, and never get aggro&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">No idea why you bring up Raparm, Graal. I was talking about experience groups. In which case, thank you for agreeing with me.<br />
<br />
And how about the hps paladins add to the rest of the party? Following Graal's argument, every single member of a party with a paladin now has a batch of extra hps that are intrinsically more valuable (like Graal's fang of flame, or the warrior hp edge) because they provide that extra margin of survivability (and again, never mind the hps latent in the paladin mana bar, or the fact that this extra survivability might not be needed because of paladin aggro control). The slower with 4000 hps who gets aggro, gets hit for 4100 and dies when grouped with a warrior, survives with the 4330 hps he has when grouped with a paladin (assuming he gets aggro at all of course, and assuming the paladin can't loh him, heal him, or root the mob) -- and so do all the rest of the party -- the nuke happy wizard, the aggressive rogue, the dot crazy necro, etc. When the warrior is in the group, ONLY the warrior has more hps, even though when the warrior is in the group, the other people are more likely to actually need those hps. <br />
<br />
If Graal's theory is correct that extra margin hps are more valuable, then the paladin wins out here again -- 5 members in a paladin group now have an extra margin of hps they don't have when grouped with a warrior (and never mind the additional levels of safety the paladin offers with his mana bar).<br />
<br />
All hps matter, and the 2330 to 9080 hps the paladin brings to the party are a pretty big deal (again, never mind the hps latent in the paladin mana bar).<br />
<br />
By the way Graal, Kether apparently believes it's absurd to expect a paladin to cast a stun that actually stuns a stunnable exp mob ONCE per fight. Is he correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">But Tug you forgot... MGB BSS thats oh, 72 people x 300+ hps?<br />

<br />
Did you forget paladins can also HEAL and LoH? Self buff beyond what a warrior cn be buffed to, even if that warrior has all the classes in the game at his disposal?<br />
<br />
No other class has LoH, very true. There are 3 classes that heal significantly better than paladins do...by orders of magnitude. How is a paladin going to self buff themselves higher in hp than a warrior who has access to a cleric, druid, shaman, and ranger? Hell, just the cleric and shaman could outbuff what a paladin could self buff. The problem with paladin buffs is VI (at the time) went with half measures. Paladins didn't have any unique buffs at the time, and groups essentially required clerics at the time. They added in the brells line of buffs to address that. It would not have been out of line for them to remove either the symbol line or the hero line from paladins in recompense, maybe even both.<br />
<br />
Tell me again about how valuable our 400 hp advantage is, given the 20-30k hp worth of heals youre holding in your mana bar and LoH. I'm listening...<br />
<br />
In an xp group? Not very much at all. Likely it would mean an extra 200 hp healed per CH at most. Generally it would probably mean less than that. You would need to ask a cleric for a better answer. Tanking a raid level mob? Extremely. Take your total hp, multiply them by 1.4, then compare that number to an equivalently geared paladin or shadow knight. That is the true hp gap for raid level content. Efficiency isn't the concern there, only survivability matters.</div></div><hr />

Nope. I'm not saying warriors are balanced at all. I don't warriors are currently balanced. I also don't think warriors need massive increases to hp or AC or massive increases in DPS or any of the exotic changes people have recommended. I think a taunt button that actually worked more than half the time against blue mobs would be a very good start. <br />
<br />
You're saying warriors are balanced because we have an effective hp gap for 3 minutes out of every 10?<br />
<br />
I'm saying that it is one of the primary factors in warrior balance, not that it is a valid reason for warriors to be unable to do their jobs effectively in xp groups.  But simply because it is of much less relevance in experience groups doesn't mean it isn't a factor in balance.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that you can and do spot heal yourself while tanking, or self-LoH during a damage spike?<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier, I cannot...a cleric cannot...an ARMY of clerics cannot heal me if I take more damage in a single combat round than I have in hit points. Generally when a tank is taking damage, it is during an xp group when the actual damage taken is very controllable and to be honest, generally trivial to keep a tank alive barring some very bad circumstances...or it is during a raid event when survivability is really all that matters. <br />
<br />
Paladins are very good at using spells to improve survivability in xp groups, but it generally isn't our heals, it is our stuns. A 850 hp heal every 3.25 seconds isn't going to come close to keeping up with the mobs damage output if it isn't slowed, if it is slowed who needs emergency heals anyway? Stunning a mob for 4 seconds buys us a hell of a lot more time than our heals do, for a fraction of the cost. our 850 hp heal costs us 400 mana. Our 4 second stun costs us 60. It allows us to take much less damage while the mob is getting slowed than a warrior would. It also has the side benefit of causing significant hate so the slower generally doesn't have to worry much about aggro. Our heals are not designed for efficiency, they aren't really designed as a means to self heal to offset damage. They are primarily designed to be cast on others in emergency situations - with the exception of our heal over time spells. Our heals are not a primary balance issue, I think it is mainly our stuns.<br />
<br />
If you get off a single heal, if the fight lasts longer than 3 minutes, the hp gap is gone. <br />
<br />
If during the fight you only have 1 CH cast on you, then yes. If you have multiple CHs cast on you, then no. If you are in an encounter where a CH is landing essentially between every combat round for 3 minutes, that small hp gap adds up to something massive.  If you are in an xp group, it doesn't mean much at all.<br />
<br />
I'm not disagreeing with you that warriors do not offer enough for experience groups with the way things are currently set up. I'm not disagreeing with you that the difference in tanking ability between a warrior and a knight in experience groups is not large enough to justify the disparity in aggro control (I think warriors actually produce more long term aggro, but that doesn't help them in xp groups) and is not large enough to justify the disparity in utility between warriors and knights. I freely say that warriors need a significant boost to their ability to control aggro (not necessarily just added hate). I freely say that if warriors had knight levels of taunt there would not, WOULD NOT be a return to kunark level imbalance for knights. Kunark is gone and won't ever come back. <br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't have any problems with warriors have essentially the same aggro as knights in experience groups. Just my opinion, but warriors would also need some added utility similar to /shield. I strongly disagree that further improving warrior hp, or further improving warrior mitigation, or further improving warrior DPS relative to the other melee and hybrid classes is needed, or would even do much to correct the issue. People decide that they don't want a warrior because they think the warrior doesn't taunt as well as they think a tank should. It's that simple. Remove that as an issue, and groups probably won't care who their tank is as long as the tank can survive, is not overly mana intensive to heal, and there isn't a massive difference in DPS or utility between the available choices for tank.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I kind of went on a bit and got off subject, but there you have my opinion encapsulated.</div></div><hr />

While I may disagree with you on some minor points, I have to say:  You have a good grasp on the tank balance situation.  If all paladins thought like you, the current situation would be much less drama queenish.<br />
<br />
Your vision of tank balance doesnt exactly match mine (Id give warrior more hp, among other things).  But If all your changes got made, I'd be happier with the final result than the current one.  It would be livable.<br />

<br />
The vast majority do. The problem is that paladins feeling this way doesn't stop warriors from pushing for things like:<br />
<br />
The warrior needs to be the single best pure tank. He needs to take the damage best, keep the mob on him the best, and everything that entails. Period.<br />
<br />
He shouldn't have to share this job, ever. When they go &quot;Okay what do we want to tank?&quot; The first thing to come to mind should be the warrior in exp groups, in raids, you name it.<br />
<br />
The paladin should always support him, the group, you name it. Tank in some situations, but have those situations be few and far between.<br />
<br />
The paladin wasn't made to be a tank, he was made to be a mixture between clerics and warriors, not the &quot;I'm a warrior with spells&quot;. He shouldn't be as good at tanking as the warrior and he shouldn't be as good at healing as the cleric, but it should come in and balance itself out in the end.<br />
<br />
We see that sort of thing and it just pisses us off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. If you also account for stackable self buffs(sorry not sure of the names) the hp difference is insignificant.(pally's keep forgetting to add these when comparing hp)<br />
<br />
2. AoE taunt....only works every 15 min and generates ZERO agro, all it does is shift it to you, as soon as anyone else in the party/raid even so much as breathes hard, the mob is right back on them.<br />
<br />
3. Knight/War dps...every comparsion i have ever seen shows the knight swinging same weapons as the warrior...now go out to BoT, PoV and look at how many crappy dps agro generating weapons pally's swing.....i rest my case<br />
<br />
4.  &lt;my favorite&gt; the &quot;if you nerf our guaraneteed, push button agro lock at will we are just sub-standard tanks that cast spells&quot; ....well YES it's called hybrid...you get to be the jack of all trades,but master of none. <br />
<br />
I do however agree that a straight &quot;nerf&quot;(and i really hate to call this a nerf since it would just be removing an exploit that was never intended to be part of the game), but a little give and take. <br />
<br />
A.) Somehow (i;m no game designer) have all items that are &quot;one size fits all&quot; meaning all plate class get bobs bracer ac 12,hp 20 mana 20 to be balanced fitting the class wearing it ex this bracer would be ac 14 hp 30 for warrior , ac 12 hp 20 mana 20 for knight and say ac 10 mana 30 hp 15 for cleric not sure of exact numbers, but you get the idea.(this should also apply to leather and chain wiht reguards to BL vs. Monk and Ranger VS Rogue)<br />
<br />
B) Redude knight midigation 10%, raise warrior midigation 10%..reduce knight hp base 10%, raise warrior hp base 10%...recuce the ac factor you get from armor on knights to 1.5 and war to 1.7, this will create a seperaton between the classes, but not though a monkey wrench in the entire game by drastically moving one class up alot or another down alot<br />
<br />
C.) Ya know all them mobs that when you cast a stun on them you get the &quot;XXXXmob is imune to the stun portion of the spell&quot; well he should also get zero stun agro from it(hell if he's imune why should it bother him)<br />
<br />
D.) Something needs to be done about agro in general, with reguards to stuns, again i am no game designer so not sure how to atcually implement this in a fair way, i just know the way it is delt with now is a total joke.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And to those pally's who say that if you do stuff like this that you cripple your class i say bullshit.  I will grant you that well over half of the pally's willhave no clue how to play their toon if they cant have their push button guaranteed agro lock at will, but thats cause they dont have a clue about the other aspects of their chr, they just play MT hit stuns when they need agro and maybe a wave heal from time to time.</div></div><hr />

YES! sorry if this pisses off knights, but wake up, warriors are the specilists and should be the #1 choice at their specialty hands down. That's why we chose this class.  Paly's chose variety and other means of supporting the xp group/raid(smack mobs aound, heal,root,buff,stun to break spells ...on and on and on) so that's your job, and the job you chose upon character creation.  Had you wanted to be the #1 choice to tank, then you should have made a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys all make very convincing arguements but...<br />
<br />
First of all, nerfing Paladins is not the answer.  Why?  Because it makes the game less fun for the people who play them.  Thats the basic thing no one has talked about in this thread and that is why I think it is wrong to nerf them.<br />
<br />
Second, the solution IS to give warriors better agro gaining ability in the first 15 seconds of the fight.  Some kind of ranged EB-like innate instant castable ability would do just fine.  A  taunt dot or whatever would probably work too.  Some people would say this is game breaking but that is irrelevent because the game is so broken (whole other arguements here so I won't go into them) that it doesn't really make a whole lot of difference at this point.  Knights can already tank every mob in this game.  The mitigation advantage of warriors is not sufficiently high enough compared to knights that this would make a whole heck of a lot of difference to this game if warriors were given exactly the same agro generating abilities that knights have now.  Give warriors a little less agro than knights and the balance between warriors and knights will be close enough to stop worrying about it.  <br />
<br />
Right now, I dual wield two force shock weapons.  If I get 1 proc off before slow lands in an experience group, I usually hold agro the whole fight unless someone does something really dumb.  If I don't get a proc off before slow lands, the mob goes for the slower almost every time.  For me, the difference is one (usually resisted) stun between having to play the taunt lotto and having a happy slower.  That is basically all it would take to fix 90 percent of experience group agro issues.  It is in fact that simple.  <br />
