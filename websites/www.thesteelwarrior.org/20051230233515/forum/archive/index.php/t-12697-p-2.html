Perhaps the wording of my post might have been a bit misleading.  I was trying to comment on the fact that using HS spam with the Improved HS talent and a fast 1h is quite effective.<br />
<br />
The downside is, you just can't hit with HS quite as hard due to the fact that a faster weapon tends to have a much lower damage range.  My understand is the higher your damage from HS, the higher the overall threat generated.  With a fast weapon you're making up for it with quantity.<br />
<br />
As for the 1.8 buff, I'd imagine it would effect Revenge, since it's instant, and it surely effects MS which I toss in for the debuff (Scarlet Strath anyone?)</div></div><hr />

MS, Overpower, and Whirlwind are the only things affected for warriors.<br />

Revenge is an instance, but it's fixed damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know this is a little bit out of place, but does anyone know of any information like this for druids?  I somehow ended up being designated my small family/RL guild's MT for our raids (just UBRS and ZG at the moment), and although we're doing fine and having a blast, I'd defintely like to do everything I can to improve.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any actual threat numbers behind our abilities, just generalities about certain things generating more aggro than just the damage.<br />
<br />
If anyone has done anything like this or could point me in the right direction, I'd be very gratefull.  If not, I may have to try doing a similar set of trials myself.  Assuming I can rope one of our priests into helping with it.  :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping, either way.  :)</div></div><hr />

Ok, figured it was a bit of a long shot.  :)  Thanks though, and it looks like the same technique for figuring these numbers out for druids should work just fine.  Just gotta take the time to do it now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me and my husband decided to test this because someone told me taunt generates hate :: Tests using Greater Lava Spider - Heavy war Golem - Magama Elemental - Dark Iron Steamsmith (pretty much the mobs in Searing Gorge)<br />
<br />
Kanr being my lvl 60 feral druid hubby :)<br />
Testing of first aggro.<br />
<br />
1)I'll get 1st aggro via prox (no dmg, no taunt tools)<br />
2)Kanr will bring the mob down to 50% health using auto attacks (in dire bear form 15% defiance version), he has aggro during the attacks. at this point he'll stop attacking.  All I do at this point is taunt once and its mine even when the taunt buff on the mob has worn off. (I never did any dmg whatsoever, it was just 1 taunt)<br />
<br />
Again tested first aggro for me with dmg.<br />
<br />
1)I'll get 1st aggro via prox (no taunt tools)<br />
2)I'll bring the mob down to 50% in def stance using auto attacks, then I'll stop attacks, he'll taunt just once(during his taunt duration he'll have aggro) but once it drops its back to me.<br />
<br />
We also tested this with sunders.<br />
1)I'll get 1st aggro via prox (no dmg, no taunt tools)<br />
2)Art will sunder the mob 5 times then stop<br />
3)I'll taunt once and its mine, it wont flip back to him<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) I dont do a single point of dmg<br />
2) kanr takes 20% health off of mob (he gets aggro)<br />
3) I taunt once, mob is mine<br />
4) Kanr takes another 20% heath off of mob(he gets aggro)<br />
5) I taunt once, mob is mine<br />
6) Kanr takes another 20% health off of mob(he gets aggro)<br />
7) I taunt once, mob is mine<br />
During this I never did 1 point of dmg or any aggro tools, so we tested this with kanr being first aggro : roles reversed for testing :<br />
<br />
1) Kanr gets first aggro does no dmg<br />
2) I take off 20% health(i get aggro<br />
3) Kanr taunts once, he gets aggro<br />
etc ;p<br />
<br />
Then we swap 1st aggro does dmg (kanr gets 1st aggro tho)<br />
1) Kanr brings mob down 20% health - he has aggro<br />
2) I taunt, after taunt is gone he has aggro again<br />
3) Kanr brings mob down another 20% - he has aggro<br />
4) I taunt, after taunt is gone he has aggro again<br />
5) Kanr brings mob down another 20% - he has aggro<br />
6) I taunt, after taunt is gone he has aggro again<br />
<br />
We reverse it again for testing :<br />
I get 1st aggro<br />
1) I bring mob down 20% health - i have aggro<br />
2) Kanr taunts, after taunt is gone I have aggro again<br />
3) I knock off another 20% health - i have aggro<br />
4) Kanr taunts, after taunt is gone I have aggro again...<br />
<br />
I think ive confused myself silly.<br />
Just in case this seemed scewed due to the fact kanr was a druid, I asked a guildmate to come test this with me. (Artengen 60 war def stance and maxed defiance)  We testested it over with him replacing kanr, it was the same O_O<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">11-18-2005, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to sum it up as taunt haveing a possible 3 effects for aggro, of which you're working on in this case.<br />
<br />
1) Forces target to attack you for the duration of the effect<br />
2) Adds a small amount of hate to the target, up to highest hate +1<br />
3) Adds hate to abilities performed during the effect.<br />
<br />
2 and 3 are pretty much just guesses on my part from observation.  There seems to be enough of a variance with your testing so that throwing an abilitiy in post taunt will cap you out on the hate list quite effectively, or at least more reliably than just taunt :/  Damn oddities.  At least the mechanics aren't stupidly simple in this game to test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cib</div><div class="date">11-21-2005, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading over your test, it seems that taunt held agro only when taunter had initial agro.  I am going to test this on my warrior, but if that is true, it is just another reason for the MT to get initial agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celandro</div><div class="date">11-28-2005, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bloodthirst vs. Shield Slam from a post I made in WoW Warrior forums<br />
<br />
<br />
Assumptions: 5x defiance, 15% crit, 1200AP, infinite rage and 25% Damage reduction (fairly typical with 5x sunders), 1.9 values for bloodthirst, use bloodthirst instead of shield slam, +1% hit (might gloves),<br />
<br />
Shield Slam<br />
500 * .75 = 375 damage<br />
4%miss 5%dodge, 5%parry, 15% crit: 13.36% 0 damage, 15% 750 damage, 71.64% 375 damage = 381 damage<br />
= 381 * 4 + 950 = 2471 hate<br />
<br />
Blood Thirst (he doesnt even do this)<br />
1200 * .45 = 540 damage * .75 = 405 damage.<br />
4% miss, 5% dodge, 5%parry, 15% crit: 13.36% 0 damage, 15% 810 damage, 71.64% 405 damage = 412 average damage<br />
= 412 * 4 = 1648 hate<br />
Question here is what does the +100 healing do for hate? It should be somewhere between 100 and 400 hate value. There is also the possibility of some innate hate on bloodthirst.. but lets just put that the minimum hate should be<br />
1648+100 = 1748<br />
<br />
2471 - 1748 = 723 hate /4 = 180.75<br />
<br />
You must do 180.75 extra damage (or other agro) in the 6 seconds between 31 point abilities with your flurry build to make up for the lost hate from shield.<br />
<br />
with 15% flurry, your flurry should be up approximately 40% of the time. This also increases your dps by <br />
With Quel<br />
2.0 /1.3 = 1.54 speed with flurry<br />
1.54 * .4 + 2 * .6 = 1.816 adjusted speed  <br />
This means in ~18 seconds, you will swing 10 times with flurry, and only 9 times without giving you 1/3 of an additional heroic strike every 6s<br />
Heroic Strike: (this does not include the agro you would have had from your regular attack)<br />
1020 hate / 3 = 340 hate<br />
<br />
723 - 340 = 383 hate /4 = 95.75 damage<br />
<br />
Now we are getting really close.<br />
Did that 1/3 of an attack give you the 95.75 damage you would need to gain agro? What about crits from shield bash/revenge proccing flurry and increasing the % of time you are in a flurried state? What about higher crit %s and AP?  What about extra procs from your weapon due to the increased attack speed? In a non-infinite rage state, you also increase your rage generation by doing damage.<br />
<br />
All of these things get better for flurry/bloodthirst as your gear gets better but do not affect shield slam nearly as much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">11-28-2005, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to consider the 10% passive damage bonus you &quot;should&quot; be picking up for 1h if you're going that deep into the protection tree.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have 15% crit with a tanking setup, I can show you about 5% you can ditch for dodge/parry/defense etc.  There is no doubt that a fury build owns if you're in a position to stack your crit up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celandro</div><div class="date">11-29-2005, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your base crit with a fury build is 10%. You then can very easily stack another 5% on with 1 elemental sharpening stone + mongoose potion. Druid + Shaman or paladin buffs can push you up even higher. Thats with no agility on your gear and no +crit gear.<br />
<br />
There are certainly some sacrifices in the protection tree (last stand, defiance or imp shield block) but its not actually a significant % boost to your mitigation, certainly far less of a difference than the rest of your gear makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">11-29-2005, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, ok.  Now I see where you're getting it from.   I usually think of things on the cheap, and overlooked such matters. ^^<br />
<br />
Prot isn't about mitigation tho.  You get all that from the first 10 points or so, realistically if anyone wants to get beat up less they can get it.  It's mostly imho about passive and active threat generation.  Being a 31/5/15 setup, I notice a lot less snap back from taunts from the prot guys, and even with gimpier weapons they tend to do a better job of locking a target down.  But then again, for what they give up, they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celandro</div><div class="date">11-30-2005, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, with bad gear protection is definitely better. You get a large constant boost to your agro abilities. Unfortunately, that boost (sheild slam) does not benefit from more weapon DPS or attack power.<br />
<br />
<br />
The question is, at what point do other builds out agro the protection build.  Common wisdom is thunderfury with its huge proc and high dps (esp with the bonus nature damage) is better for a fury build.  From  the numbers I posted, if thunderfury's dps with fury is 95.75/6 = 16 dps higher than it is without fury, then it is worth it to spec fury.  Now I did leave out the 10% bonus from 1h spec, but it should be obvious that as some point DPS * %boost &gt; DPS + Constant.<br />
<br />
Protection tree needs some way to scale with gear in the expansion or it will have serious issues as dps will rise considerably.</div></div><hr />
