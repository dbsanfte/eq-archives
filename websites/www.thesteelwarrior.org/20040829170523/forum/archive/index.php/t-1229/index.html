<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks interesting, might be worth a look again after more information is released, although I have yet to see or hear about much lore in LoY...I wonder how they tie in together, as they said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">something about item breaks blah blah blah <br />
<br />
<br />
NOOOO Items breaking would suck :rolleyes: <br />
Although I know it is planned for in EQ2, but still, what a crappy idea. Unless you can repair them or something. even then it still dumb :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We are also introducing some new environmental elements: objects that break, or need special skills to open, <br />
<br />
I think that's what you were referring to. Looks like he meant objects in the game, like maybe breaking the wood off of a doorway that was boarded up, or having a torch knocked off the wall during battle. Just speculation, but that's what I got out of it :)  Actually sounds kind of neat.<br />

Zone instancing = teh big win!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, the zone instancing is a little different than what i expected to see, as in just a couple zones with big encounters instanced, but like it said...in the wake of a full guild expansion, a group based one is a great idea. That and i've always been partial to dungeons, the no respawn thing is great too...LDoN is gonna be the best thing since kunark i think :)<br />

<br />
SAN DIEGO, CA - June 16, 2003 - Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, today announced Lost Dungeons of Norrath(tm), a new expansion for the incredibly popular PC Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), EverQuest(r). This full-sized expansion will focus on the exploration of more than forty dynamic dungeons, with the main emphasis being placed on single group content. New technology and design ideas have been implemented that will allow players to work their way through dungeons within the context of truly personalized encounters. Lost Dungeons of Norrath will be available fall '03 in limited quantities at retail and as a secure digital download from SOE.<br />
<br />
The discovery of once forgotten dungeons, artifacts, and power has set Norrath's competing factions in motion. To control these new areas, the various factions will employ mercenaries, adventurers, and their companions, sometimes even pitting them against one another. Hundreds of new quests will lead players across the face of Norrath in a new age of exploration and conquest. Legendary dungeons filled with undiscovered horrors, items, and fame are waiting to be found. Players of all levels will discover detailed environments that cater to the wide range of play styles.<br />
<br />
About Lost Dungeons of Norrath<br />
<br />
Just when you thought you'd covered it all -- five massive continents, the moon, and the homes of the gods themselves -- a new series of adventures leads you into some of Norrath's greatest sources of speculation and mystery. The story that began in Broken Skull Rock now yields new clues about an event threatening to change the face of Norrath. Assist a band of adventurers on their quest to unearth long-hidden artifacts of power from forgotten dungeons, secret catacombs, and long-buried ruins. A mystery is unfolding and a new age of exploration and adventure has begun!<br />
<br />
Explore more than 40 diverse dungeons set in 5 new environments.<br />
<br />
New Dynamic action System (DAS) emphasizes personalized group encounters without interruption from other players.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the excitement of &quot;dungeon crawls&quot; that are tailored and customized for your group's attributes &amp; levels.<br />
<br />
New environments, objects, and interactive items await the hardy adventurer. Reap the benefits of the new Adventure Rewards Technology.<br />
<br />
Encounter dozens of new challenging monsters and NPCs.<br />
<br />
Collect explosive new spells, new trade skills, fearsome weapons, and other incredible loot!<br />
<br />
The new expansion will be downloadable via the EverQuest launch pad for $24.99. Additionally, retailers will be offering a boxed version that will carry a suggested retail price of $29.99. <br />
<br />
From monkly business front page on friday. <br />
<br />
Now i know there's going to be a couple people pick out the &quot;explosive new spells&quot;, but don't threadjack...don't want to have another casters get it all (even if they do) thread going.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on to the goodies. Faction. That's one of the first things i noticed in there. Sounds like there'll be another velious type faction layout. 40 zones in 5 settings, would suggest 5 nice brand new battling factions!  More armor quests would be nice. Velious has mid levels covered, and sure the stuff is great all through 50s, but there's a gap between velious and elemental planes. From what i've read about ornate, that doesn't count :mad: Different quests would be good to have too, more weapons and jewelry quests would be a godsend, for those that like to work for their gear instead of spending 10k in the bazaar anyway.<br />
<br />
Lost Dungeons of Norrath will be available fall '03 in limited quantities at retail and as a secure digital download from SOE. Just like LoY, great for lazyass people like me who don't want to camp long enough to run to the store  :D<br />
<br />
All in all, looks great so far. LDoN site is half live, only took a quick look at it, will check it after i write my exam today.<br />

PS: Yes it says June 16th, and yes it was posted on friday the 13th...somewhat odd don't you think? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They messed up. Put out the press release early, then removed it, then realised people had already copy/pasted it across the internet, shrugged and reinstated it :)<br />
<br />
Fairly typical SoE implementation, lets hope they implement the expansion itself so it meets expectations (for once).<br />
<br />
Val</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Okay, maybe I am just reading into things.... but that says New Tradeskills, right? Not, &quot;new tradeskill recipes.&quot; Someone please tell me I'm not dreaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Great, another expansion were we can continue to be ignored and neglected as a class and told we're 'balanced'.  Just what I want to lay out my hard earned cash for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Glatius, there are at least 10 active whine threads on the board right now.  Does every thread have to be about class balance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it's a typo, Donnel. The interview I read stated they werent adding any new races, classes, trades, etc. They probably meant new trade skill recipes.<br />
<br />
I dont think there will be 40 zones, Kelorm. The message said 40 new dungeons in 5 different environments. I'm betting this refers to the dungeons that we can spawn. There will probably be 5 new zones, and you can pop group/raid instances in each of those zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shawn Lord: More than 40 adventure zones, dozens of new NPCs and, well, the whole thing is about quests that take you into these new zones with a goal to accomplish. <br />
<br />
I was somewhat surprised when i read 40 zones too, but that's what the interview says, and is suggested in the press release...also think it says 40 zones in the ebworld info too but i'm not sure.<br />
<br />
But hey, i could be just reading it wrong. I'm allowed to wish :D<br />
<br />
Besides, i don't think they'd release 2 tiny little expansions one after the other. 5 zones would at least warrant a new class or race, and the price is more than LoY was, so i'd expect more content. Also mentioned dozens of new mobs...kinda hard to fit dozens (maybe one dozen) of mobs into 5 zones without making it insanely cramped unless it's a bunch of giant zones (a la WK and TD, dungeon style, lol)<br />
<br />
I think SoE is learning, they may be slow but they're not entirely stupid (we're all playing the game aren't we?). And glatius.../agree brutul, have patience and i'm confident there will be changes. SoE started fixing things up a while back, and of course their pet classes are going to be fixed first, but you can't say you haven't seen improvement in overall gameplay in the past 3 or 4 months. If people want to get a full class revamp as they're suggesting they're going to have to wait and hope.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i'm way off topic again...woot to the 40 zones if i'm right, /shrug if i'm wrong, 25 bucks isn't a whole lot, even for someone going to school and only working part time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">People were bitching that the outdoor zones sucked...now we get dungeons.  At the very least we get something different.  <br />
<br />
I vote if you bitch about something and Sony addresses it, you can no longer bitch for a month.  <br />
<br />
IMHO, exping in BoT is the same every night pretty much...pull, slow, kill...<br />
<br />
A dungeon crawl with no respawns means you actually have to use your head and think.  I would even argue that Warriors have greater use in unknown dungeons because of AE Taunt and Defensive.  One bad pull and AE Taunt and Def and Evac...could mean the difference between wipe and win.  <br />
<br />
I am wondering if the CR will be the old method of running to corpse or if you will be able to rez at zin.  I would think you will have to run in and CR, making not wiping that much more important.  <br />
<br />
I think this is a very positive expansion given they do what they say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hm, that quote makes it sound more like 40 zones but the second part of his statement makes it seem like he's including the spawned dungeons in his count. Guess we'll wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dreiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">40 zones, <br />
<br />
5 zones to get the quest in.<br />
5 different factions to quest for,<br />
<br />
45 zones left<br />
9 zones for each faction.<br />
<br />
see it works:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No, I dont see. Is that new math?</div></div><hr />
