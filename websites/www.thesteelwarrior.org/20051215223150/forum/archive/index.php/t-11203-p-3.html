I have no clue how true it is however~</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's gathering info from people with census ui and it's very accurate, it caught everyone in my guild and is only 1 level off usually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh yeah thats right, most warlocks are imp-gimps.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, 540 extra hp is really gimpy.<br />
<br />
It's more of a nuisance factor. No other pet can really match the ease of using an imp at 60 in pve.<br />

And the only time a paladin is useful for AE tanking would be the exploding corpse room in scholomance. Boy do they shine there!</div></div><hr />

I hate that room.  Inevitably I'll have Justar, 60 pally, going consecration happy and a mage in my group. Wee!<br />
<br />
As an aside, with 2 pallys, 2 mages, and 2 warlocks (plus some other random classes), I was able to AE basically all of LBRS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">04-12-2005, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, just to let everyone know first of all, i just hit lvl 45 with my first character in this game andi choose a warrior. Now one thing i have noticed is that a pally a warrior combo own anything, reason being warriors are dmg dealing dmg taking fighters, as when the pally focus's more on trying to stay alive! Just last night i did  a quick Uld boss run ( ya i know low lvl instace compared to Dm But im gettin thier)<br />
And we had a lvl 56 pally, 44 warlock, 44 warrior, 39 hunter which switched to a lvl 60 warrior. The as i watched this really simple battle the warrior tanked while i took out all his little badie friends seeing as i used beserker stance for multi attacks with whirlwind, by time the paladin had killed one i had killed almost 4, people don't understand the shear power of a warrior, in pvp a pally vs a warrior is always different, when i do pallys i always start out like this. Bloodrage right before battle then let my rage drop to about 15 then i have fulll health again and the battle just starts i intercept causing 3 second stun then i switch to battle stance and hamstring and rend, then i just start whackin at him, the pally trys to hit me but always decides to heal due to hes below half his life i will use pummel due to its long cool down and canel heal and if he does iummne i will use heavy meageweave bandage so i gain like 600 health while he maybe if he got luckly got close to full health, then i'll switch to a 2h weapon and change to beserker stance and just start whackin like mad and one thing i have found is to do herok strike then whirlwind since whirlwind is an instant move u get like 2 moves in one then while i have beserker rage on which gives me rage everytime he hits me i  should have alot of rage for the excute pummel will be ready again and before he trys to heal i cut him down. now these battles last anywhere from 1minute to 3minutes and this plan doesnt all ways work but it does most of the time.....  If you play on my server khagdar u would see in IronForge Just how many paladins thier are, too many at this rate thier only going to be down sized and the warrior will remain supreme, and since we hold aggro better just having a healer on a warrior and some auras from a pally we rule, best combo for raids or groups are Warrior,Paladin or druid, Hunter, Warlock And A Mage u can give or take the warlock for another warrior or paladin and u canswitch the druid with a preist but from what i have seen those groups own all....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyzz</div><div class="date">04-12-2005, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played a Warrior in EQ exclusively for 5 years, so I can understand the antimosity for paladins carrying over from Norrath to Azeroth.  That being said, I started a paladin at WoW launch with the sole intention of him being an alt to tool around with from time to time, but I found myself playing him more and more and my warrior main less and less.  <br />
<br />
I am in agreement, though, that as a whole the paladin community in WoW is an absolute habberdasher of asshatery.  I'm sure all classes have their share of jackasses, it's simply the nature of the beast that is World of Warcraft, but 75% of the paladins I have encountered may possibly be the demon offspring of Sam D.<br />
<br />
I guess I just like the versatility that a paladin brings to instance groups.  However, we are hardly a full replacement for a warrior.  Our lack of snap aggro and limited taunting tools will always make us the second or even third choice for tanks behind warriors and feral specced druids, and frankly that's the way it should be.</div></div><hr />
