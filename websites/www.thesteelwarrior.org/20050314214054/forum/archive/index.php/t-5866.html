<br />
new war only GoD BP is :<br />
<br />
110ac 300hp 225endurance +15 all stats + 20 all resists 4% shielding and 4% spellshield<br />
<br />
no worn effect<br />
<br />
i dont think 10ac, 50hp some endurance and some more shielding/spellshild worth the loss of Echo of Anger (unless some EoA augm will pop somewhere)<br />
<br />
probably this is the &quot;ornate&quot; armor set of GoD, and we still have to see the GoD's &quot;elemental&quot; set (200ac 500hp ? :D )<br />
<br />
comments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also at least in our guild it will probably cost a healthy chunk of DKP, so there are other items I can upgrade for bigger benefit than the raex BP.</div></div><hr />

Increased chance to crit - 20% per level(?).  LUCY sez Cleave (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?searchtext=Cleave+I)</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, spell shield %s are pretty much the only thing that will protect you from unresistable mob Procs.<br />
I consider that BP better than Raex, as agro shouldnt be an issue when you get that BP :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 1 extra shielding and spellshield isnt worth the trade off of EoA and the riposte mod in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The Cleave effect would have definately made the trade off more interesting, but as it stands now, I wouldnt make the swap.</div></div><hr />

If someone has already gotten it, it would be reasonable to assume that a guild that can obtain Raex BPs will have no trouble getting these as well and at a faster rate. I would GLADLY swap Raex for this when I am not MT or MA on a raid.</div></div><hr />

Musta been a good week to be a ranger ... good point about the aggro at that point, tho for me aggro isn't much of an issue  right now, and yet I still want more aggro. :D</div></div><hr />

(Also a lot of the armor has mobs switched around, so many Warrior Arms have echo of anger mod /shrug)</div></div><hr />

I would expect that when people actually DO find it and don't just mine it out of the database, it will have Echo of Anger or another suitable effect.</div></div><hr />

It'll be upgraded well before people are close to getting it.  I'd probably have 350 HP or more by the time people are at the content dropping BPs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think so. From what I know, NO END GAME loot has been leaked yet. That is, nothing we've seen so far is the END GAME (i.e. PoTime B/Quarm of POP) loot.<br />
<br />
Considering they have another expansion coming out in a few months, I wouldn't be surprised if a LOT of this stuff is tuned up so massively that it simply will not be doable with a full raid of lvl 65s with massive gear and AA. It's quite possible that we may even need lvl 70 (or whatever they choose for the next milestone) and new level 70 AA/abilities/Gear to beat this expansion. At least that's what I'm hoping for...</div></div><hr />

Not sure how much the equivalent Time upgrade would be but 300 HP for GoD elemental is still far too weak seeing Quarm loot is coming out of tier 2s.<br />
<br />
Unless there's another BP option at Tacvi or whatever the last zone happens to be, I think you've to have at leats 350 HP on a Warrior BP to be a worthwhile upgrade, seeing Raex was about 100 HP more than the closest BP (Rathe BP).</div></div><hr />

Well, to be more specific, this armor is/would be the result of the Abysmal Sea Warrior armor quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most guilds are still struggling on tier 3 zones (has anyone got to tier 4 ?) there are 2 tiers of gear we stil need to see<br />
<br />
and if tier 4 stuff will be an upgrade like elemental was rispect lower tiers......emh....../drool :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have any of the Abysmal quests been completed yet?<br />
<br />
There was some speculation taht the Muramite shit that drops from like Voltac or whatever in Ferubi and such might be a component for it but no one seems sure.<br />
<br />
I am only at KT Trials currently and only played briefuly in Yxtta and such,But I have not seen anyhtign yet that would point to anyhting for these quests dropping in those zones or the next few zones after,You would think for them to be at least semi common at all we would have seen some items components drop by now or have to assume they don't drop till tier 4 which might suggest that this armor is in fact &quot;end Game&quot; for the expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless of course tacvi jsut ends up being another Time and every mob drops 8 thigns that are upgrades to what you currentyl wear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really see another tier of a set of armor upgrades beyond the Abysmal Sea quests.  Keep in mind no one has even gotten any piece of it so they'd have to be better than what's dropped so far, which means 220+ HPs at least for tanking classes.</div></div><hr />

Gonna be able to bitchslap everything pre-GoD/ next expansion with that kind of possibile gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really alot different than other expansions, except this one, for a change, might keep us ubers out of lower expansion raid zones. Why kill anything in VT, or elem for that matter, when you can get it in a group in GoD?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plane of Time gear makes NToV mobs trivially easy with even 6 people. But they don't bother cause they don't want the loot. Its a cycle.</div></div><hr />
