While playing EQ, did an alt + enter (do it all the time, had no problems before) then alt + shift + r and loaded up Kazaa. It's a program to download music if you don't know.. I downloaded a song, and about halfway I wanted to listen to it; ya know, make sure its the right one. So, I do a preview, and all of a sudden I get a bunch of crazy pop-ups and all this garbage and EQ closes itself. :eek: I close all the pop-ups and get outta Kazaa and try to load up EQ. It won't lemme in! Wont even let me get the program up. Says Windows is searching for the file EverQuest.exe. So, I go and chat with a CSR and he says to go download the patch program and get the .exe file directly from their site. I do that, I've been doing that.. it just doesn't work. I've uninstalled and reinstalled EQ about 5 times already, and still the same problems.. even when I get rid of all the EQ files and get brand news, Im still strangely missing that file. I have no viruses, no adware, no spyware, nothing. Everything runs just perfectly EXCEPT EQ.  :mad:  Really wanna play, was in the middle of an LDoN when it happened and didn't get to go back.. Really need your guys' help on this one. Please.. don't really want to have to wipe out my hardrive and reinstall XP, I have no idea where I even put my XP disk  :(  All help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you can download yourself an illegal copy of EQ that works while you're at it.</div></div><hr />
