<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question from a shammy here seeking your opinion.<br />
<br />
Is it better for the shammy to set up his slow announcement hotkey:<br />
<br />
1)  &quot;Inc. SLOW on %T in 3.0 secs&quot; [used at the start of casting]<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2)  &quot;%T has been SLOWED&quot;  [used upon seeing the &quot;yawn&quot;]<br />
<br />
Using both seems over the top on the battle spam and uses too many hotkeys.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that 1) is more useful to the tank, but 2) is more useful to the cleric.<br />
<br />
I have been using 1) on the theory that slow is seldom resisted when I Malo first, and the Warrior can better time his taunt with 3 secs advance warning than waiting until after the slow lands.  If there is a resist, folks know when they see another cast message.<br />
<br />
What do you think, or does it even matter from the tanks perspective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I have the spell effects filtered off into a window so I can see when slow lands and aren't too worried about having a message.<br />
<br />
I think the message is more important for the healers when they are timing their heals so I would consider a &quot;&lt;target&gt; has been slowed.&quot;  hotkey to be more important.<br />
<br />
Thats how I do it on my enchanter anyway.  I also have a hotkey for &lt;target&gt; resisted slow but I usually try to train my groups not to need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally look for the &quot;soandso yawns&quot; or &quot;slows down&quot; or &quot;looses its fighting edge&quot; and not at the group chatter... but thats me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a warrior I prefer the pre-cast message, failing that I demand AT LEAST a resist message.  I know when its slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Neither are really needed for a tank imo.  Though landed would be useful for clerics.  As a tank, I know you are going to slow at the beginning, and will already be waiting for it, even without you announcing it.  Also, maybe this is just me, but I watch my spam chat box, and always see when everyone starts to cast, and see when and what lands, so it makes no difference to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I perfer when I slow with my ehcnater to spam the following.<br />
<br />
Possibility of slow incoming on %t sometime in the near future. Please put seats in the upright position, put your head between your legs and get ready to kiss your ass goodbye.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
all joking aside I think it is suficiant to say when the mob is slowed. as a tank i dont really care if it is being slowed or not it's the healers job to watch my health and keep me alive. so option 2 is my vote :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I want to know when its slowed, not that you are trying to slow it. I expect you to try to slow it =)<br />
<br />
Its clerics that really look for this message - possibly if i havent seen a &quot;slowed&quot; message and i'm at 40% and the clerics just gave a CH message I might bang defensive - but usually I just wait for my corpse to pop to the GY =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">when stuff we fight is not trivial I watch fairly closely for messages anyways to see what kind of debuffs are in. And if its not working out, I can always go furious.<br />
Having good incoming messages is much more important !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In groups it's not really important (it's different on raids though). It's best to fire off the hotkey upon a successful slow, a hotkey saying &quot;slow is imminent&quot; is kinda useless in the event of a resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't really like people spamming the channels with everything they do. <br />
<br />
Assisting Haass! Don't care..remove this line from your assist hotkey.<br />
%T has been Maloed!  Don't give a crap, affects my life none.<br />
%T is SLOWED!   I can see that by the fact that i'm no longer getting my ass beat.<br />
%T has been snared!  Well I should hope so, it's 20 mana and druids ain't got nothing else to do.<br />
%T is BLAH!  Ya, that's nice, now stop spamming my chat so I can see important things like &quot;Hey, I gotta go afk&quot;  &quot;Buff X is down&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
 I don't really care what you're doing, I assume you're doing your job.  I've seen plenty of raids where every goddamned thing casters do they gotta say in group, and that's rather annoying.  Tell me if there's a problem with landing X or Y so I can be prepared for it, but I'll assume you're doing your job if you're silent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i hate spam. the only hotkey i would watch for is when clerics cast CH, so i know whether its gonna land in time or not. for slow, i look out for the malo to go in then get ready to taunt, then watch for slow to be cast and count to 3 and on 3 if i see so and so yawns then press taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a shaman, I dont bother to announce slows. The tanks know when turgur lands...it's night and day. About the only thing I will announce is if I'm going to spot heal one of the off-tanks, so the cleric doesnt waste mana healing them. And I dont have a hotkey for that, I just say 'healing so-and-so' in groupsay.<br />
<br />
On raids, if it's real critical that other casters know when a mob is malo'ed or slowed, then I'll announce that too, but otherwise I just do it and get on with other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">one where i know that the mob is slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I watch the spam also. Most shaman/ench I know have a &quot;has been slowed&quot; hotkey, infact, I don't think I havn't seen one since like level 40. But it's easy to watch for the message.<br />
<br />
The only one I care about is &quot;Binn you got a cheal comming&quot; and thats about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and don't put shit like &quot;Tunares beauty and grace brings you this complete heal Binnamar. Be prepared to feel the love, and thank tunare when she is done healing you.&quot;</div></div><hr />

About the only message, or lack thereof that bothers me is when I'm actually paying attention to my lifebar, it's only got a pixel or two left and I have no idea if there's a heal coming.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya, forgot about heals.  I don't mind so much about heals because i play a shaman on the 2nd box, and it's nice to know when I gotta heal and when I don't.  All other messages can suck it tho.<br />

It's REALLY annoying to be at like 1 bub, drop a Quiescence on myself, and then start casting Tnargs to patch me back up over berserk and then I get :<br />
<br />
You are filled with the healing force of nature.  You have been healed for 2925 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, thanks.  Nice to see I blew 650 mana on redundant heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What I am getting out of most of these responses is that most warriors are ok with just looking for the &quot;very uncomfortable&quot; Malo message or &quot;yawn&quot; Turgurs message or noticing the slowdown in mob attack to time their taunt, that most dont think a chat message from the shammy is really needed.<br />
<br />
I am thinking maybe the thing to do is just make a &quot;%T has RESISTED SLOW, trying again...&quot; as a wake up call for the cleric and leave it at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I hate nedless group spam so just say when mob is slowed and get it over with. I get spamed enough from guild/group/raid/tells and 2 box as is :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What kills me is people that don't SEE spell messages on the NPC - roots, snares, debuffs, etc. If it's a raid environment, it's different - I don't need to see &quot;a large rat&quot; engulfed in flames x30. But in a single group? Filter all but group spells, and you can see the critical info.<br />
<br />
Resists? Maybe for the healers. I know when a mob resists slow, because it ain't hitting me anymore (yay AET).<br />
<br />
The good messages are the ones that say:<br />
<br />
Evac now.<br />
<br />
Train inc.<br />
<br />
Kitre is my g0d.<br />
<br />
That is all. Carry on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Spam is bad.<br />
<br />
As a warrior, I don't really give a shit about the heal messages or the slowed messages.  I'm just going to stand up there and beat on the bad guy.  My tactic doesn't undergo some transformation when the mob has been slowed.  <br />
<br />
In fact, I find that slow messages get in my way as they are not generally timed for when the actual slow HITS the mob and generates agro.  I ignore them, always, and just turn my effects on minimally so I get the haze of slow landing on the mob on my screen.  That'll alert me to when I need to taunt, if I need to taunt. <br />
<br />
Those messages ARE important for the clerics in the guild.  Clerics need to know who is healing who, when.  Clerics need to know when a mob has been slowed.    I'd never make a resist message.  What is the point?  If the slowed message hasn't come across the group/raid, then it's presumed the mob isn't slowed - we don't need to know the reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly, timed taunt is teh win.<br />
Well, it should be :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, for inc messages, my group is lucky if I even type out 'Inc'. <br />
I got a full hotkey bar with inc messages, all 10 ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't mind shamans who confirm when things are slowed.<br />
<br />
But I watch the casting messages and taunt appropriately.<br />
<br />
Messages or no messages, talkative or taciturn, I don't really care.  It's the shamans who insist on slowing from way far away that annoy me.  After a few pingpongs I'll generally &quot;catch&quot; the mob, get aggro a few swings then lead it over and fight it on top of the shaman.  They usually get the point after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Like everyone else thats been saying it over and over and over again, 5bazzilion times ... im gonna add my 2cp<br />
<br />
I dont much look for the chat message for a slowed mob.  Most of the things I EXP on i can tank blindfolded and unslowed if i had to.  The slow message is good for the clerics.  I know when the mob gets slowed due to &quot;So and So looses their fighting edge&quot;, &quot;So and So yawns&quot;, or &quot;So and So slows down&quot;.  I always have my group spell messages on just for that purpose, so i can estimate slow.  <br />
<br />
Spell message pops up, i know its slowed.  The chat message is good for the healer however, as clerics arnt getting beat on, they cant judge as fast as you if something is slowed.  So letting the clerics know something is slowed, helps them prepare heals better.  For instance, your tanking a Daiku Death Knight in PoTac, the cleric starts his CH when you hit 60% ... if he sees a slow message, he might just wait a little longer, cause he knows you can take the hits longer.  Helps save healer mana, which decreases downtime.<br />
<br />
Message after slow = good<br />
<br />
Message that your casting = useless<br />
<br />
Resist message = the best one yet ... tells me your trying again, and might ping pong the mob, so i should be ready with my taunt key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The only time that a slowed message is useful is if your on a raid.  Since I keep group spells on, I can see when the mob is slowed and I can see when you malo.<br />
<br />
Also, if you stand next to the warrior, then he can time the taunt when the mob turns....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The &quot;SLOW RESISTED, trying again&quot; message makes sense to me in an exp group setting because it is a wake up call that this pull is going to be different than the normal rhythm of the group.  A 65 shaman using Malo first might get resisted the first time on maybe 1 out of 15 pulls of giants in BoT.  The message would tell the cleric he better heal faster than the normal rhythm, and warns the tank to expect extra agro on the shammy when she tries to slow a second time.<br />
<br />
The other advice above for the slower to stand next to the main tank is absolutely right, if the shammy knows what they are doing.  BTW, I love it when the puller/tank positions the mob right next to me in exp groups.  I always try to move to the normal pull spot so this will happen.  I hate it when the puller/tank just randomly pull to different spot, because repositioning myself on every pull delays the malo/slow process, especially when I am sitting on a horse.  An unslowed Tier 3 mob can do a lot of extra damage during the 3 seconds or so it takes to reposition on horseback after Malo lands (since that was casting while the mob was incoming) but before slowing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What noone likes ta roleplay no morez?  I do it add de time with my shammy main and my warrior alt.  After all I be de big sexxah ogre dat gets de gurlies in de Jell-O bafs.<br />
<br />
Har Har Har, seriously I do have a slow message for my shammy figured it would help both the tanks and the healers at the same time.<br />
<br />
On raids though I do take it out of gsay and leave it in raid, as most times I am the only shaman there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I want to know each time a spell is cast, so I can be extra alert for the need to suddenly taunt the mob back onto me.  As a tank, whether it's slowed or not doesn't have any effect on what I'm doing, I'm still going to be hitting it and trying to keep it focused on me.  It's important for clerics to know when it's slowed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Oh,<br />
<br />
Another thing that bugs me is pet attack messages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Goner, go rip %T's balls off  and bring them back to me on a golden platter. A cheeseburger would be nice too... mmm cheesburger&quot;<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I guess I'm in the minority, or I'm still not advanced enough in the game yet that excess spam annoys me. Yes, I know when the mob slows down, I'm in range to see the message, but I'm not the only one in the group. If a sucessful slow message helps out Healers, great, we all have to work together. Same with resisted message. I agree that it tells the Healers to stay on their toes cause 1) mob is still hitting full speed, and 2) slower is gonna receive a beatdown.<br />
<br />
Tunare's children go overboard, but their Goddess is a Passive-aggressive bitch, it's not their fault.<br />
<br />
And the first time I really enjoy the burst of laughter from reading any message, but will concede that saeeing it over and over and over would get on a person's nerves.</div></div><hr />
