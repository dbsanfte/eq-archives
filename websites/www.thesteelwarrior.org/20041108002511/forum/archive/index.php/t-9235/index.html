<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearhugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have rooted about but can get a straight answer on this. I am a Halfing Warroir 65 with a +10 atk item. My Atk when buffed by a shaman is 1430<br />
<br />
Billy =20<br />
Ferine Avattar = 140<br />
Str 285.<br />
<br />
Now I was chatting with Frog by the name of Krep (/wave Krep) and he like me has a companion, but his is a Beatlord, his ATK is 1560.  now the BL Buff is ferocity witha +150 atk but he doesnt have billy so, in theory I should be pretty level with him. how come I am 130 atk behind him ? we compared kit and stats, we are petty simular. why the big difference ?<br />
<br />
Any ideas, what would you expect a Warroir of 65 with 285 in all combat stats to be ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">warriors dont get the innate atk bonus's that some DPS classes get. BLs might get one, i'm not really sure, but i do know that my bro's BL has always had more attack than i did from KC to time, despite us having the same lvl of gear as close to the same str and always using the same buffs. i'm not 100% on this, just my oppinion from lvling with a bst wsince luclin went live.</div></div><hr />
