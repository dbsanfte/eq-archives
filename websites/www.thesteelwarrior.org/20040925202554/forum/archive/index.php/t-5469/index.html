<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CalistiaFraghert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm camping Sev right now for my green scale (hopefully) and I was wondering if my information on his spawn is accurate.  I'm waiting with my tracker on the western portion of EJ and i've been waiting here for about 2 hours now with no sight of him.  How long does he take to spawn after a server reset usually and am I in the right spot?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">erm around 6 hours for me, and he spawns at the top of the great stair case and roams around there, he isnt KoS if your faction is high but his AoE will hit you if he attacks others, fast way to get there is to come up from the FoB zone and head straight north.<br />
<br />
<br />
be sure to get a good tank, magic resists over 150 or at least a bard in each group</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry I don't know the answer to your question, but your username took be back hehe.  Is it safe to assume that you are the same Calistia Fragheart that used to post on the Caster's Realm Warrior board back when I did?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CalistiaFraghert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea brutul, probably.  I think i'm the only one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Six hours? Did they change Sev's spawn timer? I thought he was a many-days spawn, that's why I never bothered to try him. Also, what faction do you need for him not to attack you on sight, Ring of Scale?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thats how long i sat there :D<br />
<br />
um faction? i forgot but i was ally :D i think its RoS<br />
<br />
i did it with 1 and a half groups of 65s, i used disc fur first then disc stonewall, i had people try to slow him after i told them fur was down so i would return the most damage(not sure if slows did land) i also stacked all the DS i could</div></div><hr />
