<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone figured out their agro? Its really important that only one person maintains agro as we're going to attempt Hulcror with 5 people. We killed Velitokrin with the same people, and almost lost because the warrior talked only around 40%-50% of the time. The rest of the time it was on the shaman/cleric - so we burned a lot of mana keeping those two up.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't understand their agro. The shaman said that chain slowing and summoning a horse mid fight is the same amount of hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgias</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we've only done Velitorkin, so I can't comment on Hulcror.  Best we can figure, is that Veli's knockback is actually a shadowstep that removes you from his hate list, kinda like CoH does.  I'm guessing this because when we were fighting him we had several pet classes with us, and everytime the AE went off, I would see several messages along the lines of &quot;Kabeker gates.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a great point. I know its NOT a regular memblur because when I would lose agro, 10-13 Anger procs would NOT get me agro back. Meaning that whoever else had agro had a very large hate lead on me. The thing with that is, Hulcror from what I remember on raids had very strange agro as well. He would just jump from tank to tank even though those tanks wouldnt taunt. Hulcror would also kill people running through who had virtually 0 agro.<br />
<br />
Another thing about Vel is the shadowstep isnt always a memblur if your theory is correct. Sometimes the cleric would hold agro through 4 or 5 shadowsteps/knockbacks and I would only get agro back after a successful taunt, which by the way lands on Velk 1 in 15 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haladan</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Havent had any big problems with Vel, only that if u get shadow stepped far away one might lose agro due to range.  Hulc though seem to remove the top person on his agro list, so being only one tank might get tough on the others.  Might stack up on all kinds of insta agro clickys :p  Not that iv tried to one grp any of em hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They both seem to have a random memblur or aggro list shuffle... I don't think its related to the shadowstep on Velitorkin, but who knows.<br />
<br />
 I'm not sure how you could hold aggro on a single tank reliably for long enough to be worthwhile, we've had to solve the problem by throwing multiple tanks at them all going for all out aggro,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The proc on hulcror is basically one that he randomly drops the person on the top of the hatelist to the bottom.  Think of it as &quot;Involuntary evade&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The times I have done Velk we usually have 2 tanks both going full out on aggro and have him pinned so that the tanks don't get shadowstpeed that often.  it seems to work fine with this setup so that one of us keeps aggro on him pretty reliably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh doubt hulcror is doable with under 10, just too much of that random proc/blur thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could probably see Hulcror being doable with 3-4 groups, but not under 10.  His dps isn't all that high, and honestly he's really not all that tough of a mob, but the mem blur thing is he does can be pretty unforgiving at times.  We simply fight him the same way we fight Vallon - Corner him with all your tanks in front with their aggro weapons out.  Whoever gets aggro gets healed.  1.5 million damage later, he's dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could see it being done, if everyone there buffed to around 11-12k. Everyone stay as far away as possible(Clerics max ch range, shaman max heal range, etc) and Hope that as soon as he memblurs one taunt+Bellow will put you back into top spot. Honestly, I've never noticed it dropping you all the way to the bottom. When I tanked him, I got dropped, 1 bellow+1proc later I was aggro again. With 50ish in raid. So, I think it could just drop a few places(5 or 10)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With regards to Veli, <br />
<br />
when we were doing him with a full raid of Elemnetal equiped guys, things would go pretty sour after a couple of minutes, regardless of what the tanks were doing, chaining stuns, hitting AE taunt whatever, he would start summoning the wizzies and turn them into gnome pate<br />
<br />
so it seems that he blurs the top ppl on agro , or at least has them on some kind of reverse rampage, when you have half a dozen tanks inc knights all trying for agro , including ae taunt and its noit working , then there's a problem <br />
<br />
strangely enough tho , when we dropped him FAST , ie lots of DPS , we didnt really have agro problemns , other then the top of agro list would be blurred or something , and we'd generally have 3 or 4 tanks continually swapping agro about , so it looks like /assist heals and shedloads of DPS ( oh and DMF ) is the way to go <br />
<br />
he drops some really nice Elemental plus gear too , including Velitorkins femur , which has a stun to level 70 and when fitted with A3, holds one hell of a lot of agro , seemed very much on a par with my A3 equipped bloodfrenzy , plus the stun interrupts making it a great weapon, if not for the stats , works as good as Edge from time  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had pretty decent luck on Velk just hitting Bazu Bellow immediately after a shadowstep and getting back to him as fast as I can.   Not aggro lock by any means, but I am tanking the majority of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">erm range doesn't effect his blur, i've had aggro the whole fight on hulcror, then at 20% he rushed over to someone at anguish zoneline who had casted a debuff on him before heading to his raid for some reason....then ran back and trained several mobs on us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avengus</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm well our fight looked something like this:<br />
I tanked him to 82% no problems with agro. Then lost it, 3 anger procs and 2 failed taunts didnt get it back.<br />
-AT burned and got it back<br />
at around 72 percent lost it again. Hit a lucky taunt and got it back.<br />
65 percent Lost it again, 9 Anger procs in, still on rog. Rog burned nimble and was getting quick heals from the shaman and cleric<br />
Got agro back at 55ish.<br />
Now from 55-&gt; 0 The shaman, cleric, rogue, bard and the warrior (me) tanked roughly the same amount. The only reason we won is that everyone in the group had over 10k hp, when taken into account with Velk's really slow attack rate , we managed to keep everyone up with quick heals. but were pretty much OOM at the end of the fight. <br />
<br />
--Obviously we wont be able to pull this off with Hulcror, so I'm looking for ideas on agro control. As I mentioned before, we had 5 people, leaving 1 spot open for any class that may help your plan :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may want to try something like this;<br />
<br />
Warrior Shaman Cleric Bard Ranger Ranger<br />
<br />
The strategy would work thusly; obviously have your rangers doing ranged DPS, with Shaman doing HoTimes and spotheals while Cleric chains CHs. Bard singing mana song / ds / resists / dps, and if any important classes get summoned, have him use group DA, Warrior click off and get that aggro back. It's not scientific, but it probably will give you a good chance of working this fight, long as group DA doesn't cause your Warrior to splat while reestablishing aggrolock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haladan</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id add another warrior.  Start out normal. With war001 on top, war002 on second spot on agro list.  As soon as memblur happen, war002 probably gain agro.  War001 start chaining taunts to get back up to the 2 top agro people. As soon as/if both wars lost agro, war001 pop AT whine other war keeps mashing taunt to get back up.  Next time both wars lose agro, war002 pop AT, while war001 mash taunt. Hopefully this will let one of the two wars do most of the tanking til the fight is over.<br />

Most of the time when i get the knockback i get summoned  as soon as the knockback takes me out of melle range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here.  Monk pulls, war tags and back himself into a corner.  Give the MT a couple of secs to get aggro then it's gravy.  After that, time your taunts and bellows.  After we've kicked into the fight, everytime I get shadowstepped, I get summoned so it really hasn't been that big of an issue.   <br />
<br />
Sure, every now and then he might turn on people, but his dps sucks ass so it's not earth shaking if he turns for a few secs.</div></div><hr />

You already know he mem wipes. You have Anger procing AET going and taunting normally. What else is there to know? You're not going to hold aggro on him the whole fight, sometimes not even half the fight. It's all up to the RNG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would like to post that tonight my guild and i took down hulcor with no loss of arggo.<br />
<br />
we did this via a arggo switch.  I was primary tank for this mob for 70% of the fight.<br />
<br />
at 30% which is when he likes to wig out on us and start membluring himself, I had our top sk go to town on the arggo spells.   at this point he took arggo from me and held it the rest of the fight with no wiggle at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
it was about as picture perfect as it gets.</div></div><hr />
