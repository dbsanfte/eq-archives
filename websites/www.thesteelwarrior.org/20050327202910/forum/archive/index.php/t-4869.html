Prior to this patch, we could do an AA in 2 hours at a lazy ass rate, or just over an hour if we had the right people on and grinding hard.  Last nite one of my rogues said he got 2 blues AA in an hour. Just now I've got the bard/cleric duo saying their bar doesn't move for individual kills (used to be pretty consistent 1% per kill there) anymore.  <br />
<br />
So, anyone else experiencing this? And on top of that, anyone from SoE care to ask around the water cooler and figure out why this is the way it is? I'm assuming this is a bug, because you didn't leave Droga like this for damned near half a year and now suddenly decide that too many people are getting XP AND Loot AND useful faction at the same time.  Fix it please.  I don't want to go to PoP, I like dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to this article the Drog / Nurga exp was only 12%.  A ZEM of 87.<br />
<br />
ZEM from Absor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/editorial/011401_EQ_Producers_letter.html) <br />
<br />
The ZEM tonight, 12/21 was 95.  Thats 20% exp more then normal and 8% more then it used to be.<br />
<br />
I do not know what the ZEM was last week.  But the highest ZEM is PoP 119 (not counting some noob cities).<br />
<br />
Sorry Haass, Id have to say that something else was affecting the exp rate of your friends</div></div><hr />

I don't enjoy hearing stories of XP nerfs of my favorite XP spot, but I also don't like starting threads to inquire about them and learning that my friends are dumbasses.<br />
<br />
I'll check into this Wednesday and come back to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kruscher</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">exp seems normal there, every now and then i dust off the shaman to go farm some loot for bazaar purposes, and it seems like business as usual on the exp front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, XP is fine, found that out when I had a chance after I posted this.<br />
<br />
Apparantly people in my guild are just retarded or something.  Disregard.<br />
<br />
PS -- Oh, and damn you for bumping this.  And damn me for doing it too.</div></div><hr />
