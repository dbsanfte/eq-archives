I have been away from EQ for a bit and want to make sure I get the best I can with my plat. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's hard to tell you what to get without knowing what u have.<br />
<br />
edit (Didnt see the stripped word :confused: )<br />
<br />
Hows your faction with CoV and or Thurg?  You can prob get a nice set of MQ'able gear.  <br />
<br />
I'd get these in order for their importance . . .<br />
<br />
1) Haste<br />
2) Weapons<br />
3) Armor<br />
<br />
Some good items are Mosq leg earring, Valor ring of Gallantry, Clattering Bone Neck, Helm of Rald, Frosty, Barn Covered Axe.  Just camp the /bazzar for these items and see how much stuff u have left.<br />
<br />
You dont have any no drop items?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand right, he said that his warrior is striped, meaning no gear.  My best advice, look at cultural armor as good, resonably cheap armor.  Most SS MQ stuff would be great too.  Look at PoTC earing quest, all items needed for it sold in bazaar.  Valorian rings are good for fingers, or just 6/65's if you don't want to spend as much.  Cloak of greater pernicity has come down nicely in price, and is not a bad back slot, especially if you still need STA.  For weapons, look at honed blade of Ykesha, Frostbringer, any of the new weapons coming out of Droga.  With 150k you should be able to get a pretty decent setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gear</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is agnostic he doesnt get any &quot;good&quot; cultural armor.  I would do the following.<br />
<br />
-Buy a Cobalt Breastplate and Legs.  You will love the clicky heal and clicky invis at you're level.<br />
-Buy Champion or SS MQ's to fill the rest.<br />
-Buy a good Haste item.<br />
-Buy a Honed Blade of the Ykesha and a Frosty.<br />
-Buy two Valorium Rings of Gallantry.<br />
-If you have money left look at you're ear's &amp; back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Allot also depends on you.<br />
<br />
Will you have to buy everything or do you have friends/guild to help with quests.<br />
<br />
Personally I am a former guild officer with Raid Leader exp. I am pretty good at finding quests where multiple people can benefit.<br />
<br />
Your best option would be to <br />
<br />
- Buy nice haste item CoF or CoCW or such. This will be your last purchased haste item til you get 41% dropped item. (35k-60k)<br />
- Buy nice agro weapon, If you plan on doing Epic then spend small amount of plat here. You can get two nice agro weapons for 10k. Other threads have info on real cheap agro weapons.<br />
- Get armor good enough to hold you over but nothing that will break the bank - Acrylia BP, Engraved Field Plate, stuiff like that with good ac stats and under 2-3k each. Look for bargins and mass purchases. Can prob equip all armor slots for 16-30k <br />
- Buy Gallantry rings. On my server they are now 4 and going down fast. 6-8k<br />
- Save about 10kpp for gems and get some Thurgy armor farmin going on.<br />
- you should have spent 73k to 141k by now depending on your choices. If you have plat left get some dps weapons to use when not tanking. <br />
<br />
If you are patient, have friends who can help with quests, and smart buyer you can be ready for NToV type raiding and have 50kish left to play with.<br />
<br />
The key to that plan is getting you Thurgy armor. Plate House drops are really nice, you get average of one drop per cycle, which is like 6 mobs in cycle plus 4 locals. The armor is slightly better than cultural as well.</div></div><hr />

Some decent WR packs, Rallic pack, herbalists, evil eye etc.  <br />
<br />
Also resist gear set is a nice thing to have in your BP. <br />
<br />
A reasonable bow, doesnt need to be anything fancy but always helps.  <br />
<br />
A Fleeting Quiver is good to have to. <br />
<br />
Insta click buff items,  JBoots MQ, Shrunken Gobby Skull Earring and  Bracer of the Hidden.<br />
<br />
Worn Enduring Breath Item, fishbone earring is popular.<br />
<br />
for the future see if you can get a Greatstaff of Thunder for under 10k,  you wont be able to use it till 55 but for a warrior there isnt much you can buy thats better short of a SoD or a BoC.</div></div><hr />
