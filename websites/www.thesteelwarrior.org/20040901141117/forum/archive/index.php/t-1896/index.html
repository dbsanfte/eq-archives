<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me and another warrior are attempting to plan a sky raid. I once had a link that explained how to achieve more than one wingblade. I think it was by leaving atleast one mob up thus causing the lord to respawn(forgot).<br />
<br />
I think the link was called Adawen's guide to plane of sky that explained this. Link is dead.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me if multiple wingblades are achievable, and how I would go about doing this? Or a link that explains this aspect of the wingblade?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Found the link -<br />
Korby's guide had a link:<br />
<br />
To camp the Spiroc Lord: The Guardian must be alive to farm the Spiroc Lord. In order for the Guardian to respawn, at least one follow Spiroc must remain alive. If the Guardian is not up but there is at least one follower left alive, all must camp - someone has agro. Once agro is cleared, the Guardian will respawn. If possible, the follower Spiroc(s) can then be killed as long as the Guardian is NOT killed. Any mobs that come to assist the Lord must be trained away and dealt with - as soon as the Lord dies, Sirran spawns and he WILL assist the remaining Spirocs. The Lord should NOT be fought in his spawn spot as he will immediately respawn and you will have to wait for Sirran to despawn from the previous kill (only ~20 mins). There is the option of trying to train Sirran away, but it soon may become difficult to place the 3 (or so) mobs remaining so they do not assist one another. Just remember - Guardian and Lord will assist one another; Guardian must be up for Lord to respawn; Lord's death spawns Sirran, who will assist both Guardian and Lord. Sounds fun doesn't it? ^.^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What you do is this....<br />
<br />
Stand at the corner of the island near the edge facing where the Lord spawns,but out of range where you cannot actually see him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretending as if thsi spot was a clock,The lord is at 11 oclock,The guardian is at 2 oclock on other side and your raid is at 7 oclock closest to the island ledge as oy ucan get wihtout to much worry of falling<br />
<br />
Send in a puller(insert witty class bait here) and have someone trail him to tag when he gets DTEd.Drag the lord to the corner where yo uset up camp and kill.Upon Death Sirran will spawn.Be weary of proximity to the edge,you do not want to push the lord or the raid off,but you want to remain fairly close to it...<br />
<br />
Really any spot on the island that is very far from the center of the island and far from lord spawn point and Guardian spawn point will work.<br />
<br />
Now move your entire raid into the center of the islandwhich is a sort of crater...Keep far enough away form lord that he does not aggro.Now pull him to that spot and kill,Agian Sirran will pop there.<br />
<br />
Now move back to your old spot and repeat the steps again,over and over until you have your share of Blades..</div></div><hr />
