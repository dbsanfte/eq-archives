<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to remember a statement directly from VI/SoE in the past about skill mods. IIRC they basically said that the hard cap is the maximum achievable by any class, and NOT a flat 252 for all skills. I think they even used taunt as an example of a skill that capped below 252, and therefore wasn't effected by +taunt mods (discussion arose due to the +10% taunt helm from Griegs)<br />
<br />
Other warriors I've spoken to seem to have the same knowledge of taunt mods, but none of us can cite the souce. I've been through both this, and the old board, and can't find anything. Searched the main EQ sites, as well as web-wide searches on the subject, but nothing.<br />
<br />
Is this just a widespread myth that people take as true, or is there a reliable quotable statement that spawned it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Reason this came up again was the plate only +taunt boots in PoTime, and the fact that most of us 'know' the taunt has no effect, so let them rot. Can anyone shed some light on it?</div></div><hr />

Course, it may well be that these are the final plate boots of the expansion anyway, but if the taunt mod has no effect, I won't be in any rush to loot these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semp</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was parsing a comparison of an Obsidianwood 5% archery.. a Stonewood 5% archery... and a Warmaster's Recurved Longbow 0% archery... and I found that the Stonewood and Obsidian had roughly 82% accuracy and the WRL was running at 79% accuracy.  This leads me to believe that mod items do in fact help... I ran 3 parses with each bow and always got pretty much the same accuracy on each parse.  Ranger archery is capped at 240, so I'm thinking that those 12 points to get up to 252 would account for the 3% accuracy... enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had a +10% taunt helm for a long time, and I remember discussing it some on Steelwarriors when I first got it.  (Even back then people stated the stats were so crappy that they wouldn't use it even if the taunt mod worked.)<br />
<br />
Well, based on my biased observation for the past year or so, I'd say that the taunt mod definately does help.  I could easily be completely wrong, but it *seems* to me that if regular taunt works maybe 50% of the time on average mobs, then with the helm on, taunt works 66-75% of the time.<br />
<br />
When do I wear the helmet?<br />
<br />
-In an exp group where a caster or some damn monk is snagging aggro.  (I find it more convenient to taunt a mob off more successfully than having 100-200 more hps in an exp group.)<br />
<br />
-On a raid waking mezed mobs.  (I think this is extremely helpful like on a bertox raid where a MA is constantly waking mezzed mobs and you don't want them running around to smack enchanters, nor do you wanna wait an eternity to retaunt a few times.)<br />
<br />
I don't ever wear it MTing, what would be the point?  It would be pretty rare that a regular taunt was successfull on a boss mob anyways.<br />
<br />
I'd love to hear of someone testing this somehow, but for now I believe in it.  Have to believe in something!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhahadir</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These mods work like the mods for Tradeskills.  You have the RNG (random number generator) spin your initial skill and then your mod is added to that number to give you your total modded number.  So in the case of an Elemental bow you will hit more often and in the case of the helm you will taunt more successfully.  Mods do not add hard numbers to your actual skill level, they only apply to the RNG generated number when you use a skill of any type (casters, melee, trade skills alike).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the crappy taunt helmet from Grieg's End and I did keep it in my bag for a while.  I did not try parsing it, but I felt that it did make a difference, and I'd use it in situations where I was expected to tank but was having difficulty doing so.  My guesstimate is that I succeeded at taunts 1/3 more often with the hat on.<br />
<br />
I banked it for good when I finally got my first taunting weapon (Cord Hilted Spike Driver).</div></div><hr />
