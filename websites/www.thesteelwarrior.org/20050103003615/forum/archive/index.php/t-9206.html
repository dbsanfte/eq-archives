I figure this will tie into something bigger. I have been trying to mine Loyalist of Dranik faction for as I raid with the guild. I'm up to dubious now and hopefully will get further.<br />
<br />
However, I have only seen people 'alluding' to the fact there is a quest. I don't see any detail about it. <br />
<br />
Where do kyv hearts drop? I've killed 100's in Dranik's Scar and haven't seen one heart.<br />
<br />
Also I figure I would start collecting things as I go. Especially the stackable ones until I figure what they are for. So i have ukun hearts, noc teeth, noc heart, etc.<br />
<br />
Anyhow thought I'd start a thread to see if we can gather some more details.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly the most common drop, and not exactly the most common model out there, but I remember destroying a few of them along with the noc hearts.</div></div><hr />
