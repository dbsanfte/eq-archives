<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to the tribute guy in Kaladim and checked everything on me.  Lots of variety, some of it fairly non-sensical; but the GSoT was worth 27000+ tribute points. <br />
<br />
Checked the bazaar shortly therafter.  None for sale. <br />
<br />
Also - Defender's lightblade is worth 13000 points.  <br />
<br />
Also none of those for sale in the bazaar anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">bile drenched main gauche(costs what, 50p these days?) is 23000 points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, that sucks.  I am almost 52 and was thinking of buying a GSoT the other day but thought to myself, oh well prices won't go up, no worries.  /sigh  I also think the tribute system is lame, so I'm not happy.  They won't get my dollars for GoD.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can we please not post cheap items that are high in tribute points while I'm at work and unable to buy?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
P.S. I know of a few dirt cheap items worth a lot...but my lips are sealed until 500k!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just had my wife check the bazaar for a GSoT for me, none left.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty much anything with a recommended level is worth mad points.  This seems like a good idea for a way to separate really valuable items from worthless junk but thanks to the common drop of some items they are dirt cheap in the bazaar and worth a ton of tribute points.  Kinda tough to evaluate the real value of every droppable item in the game hehe, wonder what a BoC is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kalli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BoC / AoW helm = 35k or so points<br />
<br />
Most LDoN normal drops are worth 8-25k points, as are most higher tier Pop drops.<br />
<br />
That 29 / 34 that dropped every other mob in justice was another 18k.<br />
<br />
Other than that, most of the drops from old world through tier 1 pop are in the 1-2k range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Still no GSOT's.  :(  I'm pissed.  Anyone on Stromm have a GSOT they'll part with for a reasonable price?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, well I found a GSOT for sale this morning for 999pp.  Not exactly as cheap as they used to be...  but pretty reasonable imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They're gone now, not surprising. Expect much much lower rates when they return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm...  I wonder how long it will take before GSOT prices come back down and they start coming back into circulation?  I guess that all depends on how much they change the tribute system, but either way I'm happy paying 999pp today for one.  1k is really a drop in the bucket anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>skarresmoore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I checked the Stromm Bazaar on Wednesday night (2/11) and found no GSoTs up for sale. A little later, there was one up for 999pp. Thank goodness I waited because a quick check Thursday afternoon revealed one for sale for 100pp. I thought perhaps I had waited too long to pick one up, but you better believe I jumped on this one. Of course, the fact that they took down the tribute masters probably helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea, 1k is still less than it's worth as a weapon.  Lots of people happily payed 30k for it before it became such a common drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, that is funny, I am the person who bought that one GSOT for 999pp.  :)  I just didn't want to risk that the prices wouldn't come back down...  and at the time I didn't know that they had removed the tribute dudes...  so I got it while I could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I picked up one on Emarr last night for 100 plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tribute value for GSoT is now 840.  <br />
<br />
Aside from all those that disappeared from stock in the brief time this was going on, prices should presumably return to normal shortly. <br />
<br />
I only checked a few prices when I logged in, but I am going to lose a ton of tribute points when the nerf goes in next week, and I didn't use any tradeskill items at all, just weapons and armor. <br />
<br />
There are several things that I bought and turned in that are now worth less in tribute than what I paid for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh, well the only GSOT I saw on Stromm last night, and I checked a lot, yes I'm a bazaar rat at times, was 10k.  That's right, 10k, lol.  I haven't checked the bazaar on other servers in awhile, are there that many scammers prevalent in the bazaar on other servers as well?  I just can't believe some of the crap I see marked up way beyond what it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dureen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Didn't see any in Ec'i bazaar.</div></div><hr />
