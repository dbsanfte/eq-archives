<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today in PoV I did some tests with a ranger and druid in guild.<br />
<br />
To the right of the zone in is a building. At the entryway there are 2 spawns, one cons yellow and the other white. We killed the yellow con so that we could have the white alone (Making it level 65).<br />
<br />
I taunted to agro the Guardian, and ducked. I had no damage shields, and did 0 damage to it. I used taunt every time it was up though.<br />
<br />
Test 1: How well can a warrior hold agro with just taunt. The results are how many heals it took, how much the heal was for, and for how long the mob was engaged for until the druid drew agro.<br />
<br />
--1 heal (3935 damage) - 25 seconds.<br />
--1 heal (2100 damage) - 20 seconds.<br />
--1 heal (3935 damage) - 35 seconds.<br />
--1 heal (2100 damage) - 25 seconds.<br />
<br />
Test 2: I had a ranger snare the Guardian one time to agro it, take off damage shields, and duck while being hit. The numbers correspond to the same as above.<br />
<br />
--3 heals (9400 damage) - 65 seconds.<br />
--5 heals (Didn't get damage) - 94 seconds.<br />
<br />
During the second run the yellow repopped, and he snared it to attack him also. Both guardians lost agro on the 5th heal (only 2nd while the yellow was there).<br />
<br />
While this is limited, it helps to show where an aggregate taunt (meaning +hate instead of being instantly on top) could help our class. Tonight I'm going to get a cleric to try heals under the same circumstances, and maybe a paladin or SK to help. I'll try and get more examples as well.<br />
<br />
Some of you might be thinking that it's common sense a snare or any other spell would build more hate than our taunts. That's exactly the point. Taunt is worthless if you're on top of the agro list, and with it's poor failure rate (around 42% on white cons) it isn't a reliable enough skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FarlanderB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good test, imho. A taunt that added hate every time you pressed it would help. Are you suggesting a new taunt button, or changing the function of our current one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd argue instead that perhaps persistent taunt as a secondary method would be preferable (See Furor's dea for reference).</div></div><hr />
