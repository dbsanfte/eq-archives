Used to be 2 until I steped down due to playing time restrictions.  So really it would be 3 and 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After doing it, I have a lot of respect for guy like Furor who run guilds, and raids, and MT too.  There's a lot of shit going on, and you've gotta be on the ball at all times.  Everyone wants to talk to you when you're guild leader, they all have their little problems with Person X or Person Y or group Z or whatever. Then on raids, if you're coordinating that, you've gotta keep all the dipshits from going into the no-fly zone and wiping your raids, and on top of that, you've gotta take an active role in your aggro generation (position, etc).<br />
<br />
It wouldda been a lot easier if I wasn't MT, but none of my friends could match my experience/gear.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is a bit on the smaller side.  Our guild/raid leader is a 60 Cleric who 2 boxes his 54 Ranger most of the time.  I still don't know how he does it.  He usually lets us suggest places that we could raid if we provide a few details about what we would like to accomplish.  We usually manage to get 2 and a half groups of lvl 40+ on most of our raids.  Our very few lvl 60+ members have left for guilds that are much farther along.<br />
<br />
Our MT is a 56 Warrior.  He handles all the tanking/assisting duties.  He calls for when he wants melee to assist and for the casters to blaze away.<br />
<br />
My main is actually a 51 Monk.  I'm our back up puller.  My Warrior is now lvl 40 so I can start bringing him along for our raids.  There are a couple of Warriors and SK's that are higher than him so I probably won't see too much MT duty unless things go seriously wrong.  But that could change as I grind out a few more lvls.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No warrior officer anymore since Zzixx retired, Shikarii.<br />
Not to mention no paladin or sk officer either.<br />
<br />
We have 5 or 6 warriors breaking 8k hp raid buffed now, 2 of us breaking 8.5k so that makes tank duty rather easy.<br />
On hard targets it is usually AC and AA level that decides your spot in the line.<br />
Our usual MA has an almost 100 AA lead to the next one though (196 to my 96 AA) but when he goes down there was no target yet which i couldnt tank.<br />
As a guild that rather distributed equipment level is rather good as it doesnt make you that dependant on a single person.<br />
Rather nice if you can do cursed cycle and the only thing you have to worry about between the 3 named is your healers mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild does things a tad differently.<br />
<br />
There's not really a &quot;#1&quot; warrior, we try to all be &quot;tankable&quot; at all times, and we're all within 200ish HP from each other with only newer members being an exception.<br />
<br />
We communicate very well with one another and discuss tanking tasks, and pass our suggestions on to raid leaders, who sometimes take them, and sometimes have different ideas.  Either way, it works out very well, and more often than not, warriors who have great strengths in one area have those utilized.  For instance, we have 3 warriors who are VERY good at rapid target selection, so for fights with a lot of targets, they get that job, while other tanks are really good at tanking the big mobs, others have big resists, and so on and so forth.  We communicate, use each others' strengths and don't believe in a &quot;heirarchy&quot; of tanks, where 1-2 get all the &quot;tank time&quot; while the others just rot away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was raid leader, guild leader, MT, website admin, and DKP admin... for 6 months.  It was going really well until we stopped doing Velious, Kunark, and Luclin... and started PoP... then everthing started to suck.  PoP sucks.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, tons of people quit because of PoP and I disbanded the guild because I didn't feel like rebuilding and re-equiping a million newbs.<br />
<br />
I've been raiding with an elemental guild lately, but being unflagged and having to wait in line and not being able to attend about 70% of the raids really blows.  No other guilds on the server want or a willing to let warriors come on their raids just to gimp flags.  So I've been working on AAs... either something while change while I'm on vacation for 2 months, or I'll quit EQ most likely.  <br />
<br />
I'm done leading raids and dealing with drama, bitching, people quitting constantly, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I make my wife handle lootmistress duties and attendance tracking.<br />
<br />
Our guild has class officers who handle various aspects of each class' duties during a raid (ie: cleric officer sets up the CH chain, monk officer details who pulls what, etc)<br />
<br />
I still do the overall management (ie: tell the monks when to pull or hold pulls, tell the healers when to use a CH chain and when to just use fast heals, etc) but for the nitty gritty details I trust the class officers to lead the other members of their class.<br />
<br />
I do get accused of being kinda gruff during raids, and I don't allow anyone to sidetrack me (ie: if someone wants to chat about a problem with another member or something like that, I make them wait till after the raid to talk to me)<br />
<br />
Of course, our guild is run more like a military commando unit than anything else.  I've got a great bunch of folks who put a lot of time into EQ, so on &quot;common targets&quot; raid leadership is along the lines of:<br />
<br />
/rs Everyone take your places, you know what to do.<br />
/rs Mana/Buff check, everyone ready?<br />
/rs Ok, pullers, go get &quot;Boss_Mob_01&quot;<br />
engage mob, build agro...<br />
/rs ATTACK ---&gt;[ Boss_Mob_01 ]&lt;---<br />
distribute loot....<br />
<br />
I love my guildmates :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a time, I was just MT, then got promoted to officer status due to my push during raids, and helping making new tactics for our 40 person raids where we felt Zerging wasn't an option.. During time a few of the other warrriors stepped up and leveled and we are using a rotation.. But I am one of 2 warrior officers sharing duties of guild movement on raids. Too many voices on a raid can create whipes but we have found a happy medium, we keep each other in check with repops, tactics, and disciplines. Like i said we are a small guild compared to the guilds above us but we have excelled in what we have accomplished.  Guildleader triple boxes and does final say/recording loot. We have taken up the responsibility of how to get to the next mob...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaer</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GL in EQ (multi gaming guild), Main Tank for all in house stuff and about 50% of the joint things we do, and Raid Leader. <br />
<br />
One thing we've found is good delegation skills are more valuable than your own personal skills. Learn how to put the proper people in the right places and you will gain much.<br />
<br />
Point in fact - I remember the first time I lead a weekend Plane of Sky raid (pre-kunark). I set everything up 3 weeks in advance. Got platinum from everyone. Handled all the component gathering and stones. Wrote out groups, lead the raid (was playing my shaman back then), and handled all loot myself.<br />
<br />
It's been different for me leading raids ever since. Find strong officers to assist in guild management. Find strong officers or raid leaders to assist in raid leading. Find someone to handle site admin. And your golden!</div></div><hr />
