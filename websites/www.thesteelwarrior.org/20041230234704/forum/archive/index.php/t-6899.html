<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, recently I've started tanking some of the lower end PoP PU raids.  Last night my cute half elven butt was saved on each of the bosses on the Carprin cycle by divine intervention.  I want to know how exactly this thing works.  Also, I know charisma affects it, but how exactly and how much charisma do you need?  I'm kind of looking for a basic primer type explanation.  I'm sure there are plenty of tanks like me out there that are just starting to experience the world of PoP raid tanking.</div></div><hr />

The Cleric Thread (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14272&amp;highlight=DI) - credit goes to vazaelle.Mikar with additional parses by maelin.Ceridwen for proving how DI/UD work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never had a DI fail on me except once due to hp skip. It always fires or fades after the mob is dead. My cha is whatever magelo says. I don't bother buffing it<br />
<br />
Basically DI fires at 14/15 percent. Once you go below it fires. If you go from 16 percent to 0 too fast it will fail. Like from a lucky quad + nasty proc.<br />
<br />
If you are a troll or Orge or other low cha class I can see being concerned with cha but half elves start pretty decently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cha is the difference between DI partial healing for (1600 * UD) and healing for 8000. It's also the difference between a partial going off at all or doing nothing, even if the cleric has UD3, if your cha is low.<br />
<br />
The proof is in Ceridwen's parses.</div></div><hr />

I've had DI save me way too many times now.  So, is it worth losing my nice cha boost from my cloak of greater pernicity for ac on a loyalists shield?  How do you balance out all the stats a warrior needs (semi rhetorical question there)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go loyalists shield. <br />
<br />
Always group a Bard and make him sing Amp + Solons. It should cap your CHA at 305. If it doesn't, grab a CHA buff from your Shaman.<br />
<br />
MT&quot;s should always be with a Bard for AC/DS/CHA/Resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorgo</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From reading the description of unfailing divinity AA I got impression that even a DI failure will result in a heal which folks seem to be saying is a 4800 hp heal.  There are times when a mob hits you so hard he knocks you from somewhere above the DI threshold to dead in 1 round and DI doesn't have a chance to fire -- but other than that when getting DI from an UD3 cleric are folks seeing hard failures?  The answer to that makes a big difference to me on how much to focus on charisma gear (and probably for a lot of other low to middlin warriors that should probably still focus gear and augments on HP/AC for a while more) -- a 4800 heal is still pretty good in my book for a &quot;failure&quot;<br />
<br />
May ask clerics in a bit, wondering on others experiences.  My cleric has UD3 and I use it a lot and haven't really noticed it &quot;hard failing&quot; despite my bad charisma (even with an enchanter buff im in mid 150's CHA as an Ogre)<br />
<br />
Thanks -Xorgo</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It can still hard fail with UD3 + high charisma, but hard failures are less common than partials (4500 heal).  The cleric thread linked above is pretty clear about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorgo</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Sassinak - I agree that cleric thread is pretty conclusive though contrary to the in-game description of the UD3 AA skill.  I did find this thread in eqcleric as well - http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=17182&amp;highlight=unfailing+divinity - and consensus there is that in game description is incorrect.  I am going to ask clerics if anyone asked SoE if UD3 is working as intended or if they concede their in-game description of UD3 is wrong.</div></div><hr />
