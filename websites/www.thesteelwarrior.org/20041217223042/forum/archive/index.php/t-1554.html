<br />
1. is there a way to tell if they are already bugged?<br />
2. how long should these take?<br />
3. basic progression - how many rings do we need to do.<br />
4. do exp groups still bug the rings? <br />
5. are guilds just doing this on server up or is it less buggy now? anyone had any luck with a GM repopping zone if rings are bugged?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that a PH for the main boss spawns at the end of the ring is not a bug.  This is this way so that you can finish the zone and get into poearthb even if the loot-dropping bosses have been killed.  The PHs are identical in every way to the real bosses, other than they don't drop loot (sort of like the Cursed cycle in Ssra).<br />
<br />
The ring events are harder for xp groups to disrupt.  I'm sure they are still blowable, tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way a ring will be &quot;bugged&quot; is if you totally finish the ring and kill the named.  The other night we got to the vine ring and it was 2 am and we lost due to lack of numbers at the time.  We came back the next day, redid all of the vine ring and kill the named.  If the named is killed and you still want to go for the avatar, you just kill all the rings and the PH's associated with them.  I don't know the respawn on names, probably only after the server comes back up still.  As far as exp groups blowing the ring, it would be very hard to do now.  They may disable them for a while but you just have to wait for the mobs respawn time or clear the ring and wait for it to respawn so you can do the named.  Either way, the named doesn't poof anymore unless it is killed.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
