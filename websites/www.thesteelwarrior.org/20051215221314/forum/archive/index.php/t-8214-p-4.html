I am wanting to know if my current setup is sufficient enough to tank trash mobs for the exp as well as what named mobs might I be able to tank while using Disc. I currently have a cleric and BL that group with me on a regular basis with similar gear and aa's. <br />
<br />
Also, what GoD zone or zones would you recommend for me to try to get my feet wet in?<br />

<br />
Also, the Chunk of Hardened Slime? (30hp type 7 one?  ear range finger?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because I was really curious, I decided to see how high a casual player could get without raiding, using both LDoN and GoD since LDoN is considered a godsend for non-raiders.  I was surprised to see just how high they could go.<br />
<br />
First off, this is based on the idea that everything listed in Ciae's list can indeed be gotten by one group without raiding.  I'm hoping Haas can prove that right or wrong.<br />
<br />
I went ahead and stuck the Adventurer's stone to 100%, since I'm getting the max capable stats.<br />
<br />
Maxed out hp AAs, added augs.  Here's the Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1034967).  ~8k hp unbuffed is pretty darn nice.  You can even get slightly higher if you get some Velium Gemmed weapons instead (less agro procs though), or decide to raid small bit and try to pick up a Cipher of Veeshan.  I think the GBoS can be one-grouped by now.<br />
<br />
I couldn't think of a better helm (other than Rallos Helm).  Ciae listed the Miremuck one, but since I don't know for sure where it's gotten I left it off.  I know Iksars have higher AC than others, so you might want to adjust for that (I think it's 50ac?  I like Iksars, so I used one)  With a clicky bramblecoat, you can get this guy's AC up to over 1700 (maybe mid 1600s on others).  I chose the AC augs from LDoN for those slots also, instead of just looking for highest hp.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can suggest some better items for a LDoN/GoD hybrid?  I'm not going pure hp, but high hp with a good AC as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it includes items that are outside of GoD, but I actually don't raid and have aquired everything through bazaar/ldon/GoD (see side magelo). If you include KT/Ikkinz, you can do very well, and if you can beat tipt for the bracer than you should be able to get the KT/Ikkinz stuff with a little work. Also, there are some alternate profiles on my profile that are even better that simply have more of the named and trash drops from GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stone Shard of Fortitude is from one of the Pixxt named in Qinimi. I've killed it solo before, hits for around 600. There are two 30hp augs (ear range finger) that I know of, one from Barindu named and one from sewers. It's been a while and I don't xp anymore, so I don't remember which the Chunk of Hardened Slime is from.<br />
<br />
The aug you're thinking of Ejryu is Faceted Gem of Might, 20hp type7 non-lore augment from Tumia Lehio in Natimbi, same slots as the Stone Shard of Fortitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oulurok</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, haven't been playing my warrior much lately since my first raiding guild disolved.  I got in OoW beta and made a beta buffed warrior and was impressed with his ability with Ornate.  He's got 8k unbuffed at level 70 and I was like damn, I want this on live so I been playing warrior again a little.  <br />
<br />
It's been my experience so far that GoD groups want 9k unbuffed warriors on my server.  I am FAR from this.  I did get into one GoD group, consisting of all people that weren't experienced in GoD.  We made it to Qin and did one of the sepwers that someone recomended.  We didn't even get to the second room.  <br />
<br />
I'm working on maxing my defensive aa's, 82 atm, up to LR2 or 3, I forget.  Hopefully one day I will be able to get groups in GoD for some nice upgrades, for now I am exping in BoT.  I am Tactics falgged and would love groups there but no does groups there which is sad, cause it's a great zone for exp.  Trying to finish Sol Ro flag but I get very frustrated at the low discipline level and disorganisation of Pick Up raids.  One day.   :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, they have the shard listed in Allakhazam, but not Lucy.  It's Pixtt Krakt Ticov.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great post, although I think casual gamers who jump right into GoD expecting to skip straight to KT/Ikkinz are going to be sorely disappointed.  Ikkinz trials are still hard with time gear.  It's doable without raiding but it damned sure won't be easy.  I think for most casuals the list should basically stop at KT and yxxta single group stuff.  A non raider would have to be VERY motivated to get much farther before OOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ventured into GoD today, for the first serious effort I have given it myself.<br />
<br />
I 4 box my Warrior, Cleric, Chanter, and Monk. I have the basics, but it's utility I lack. For the longest time, I wrote off GoD due to the inconvenience of it all. The run there sucks, I lack utility of things such as snare, evac, group invis, etc. After today, I'll learn to deal with the convenience issue.<br />
<br />
I marched into Barindu today, and went for the Sewers. From what I read, Plant hit the hardest, but things were single pullable, and didn't run. I'd like to think I'm a solid tank, so I decided this trial would be my best bet. Originally, I figured I'd just go in, see if I could stay alive, and after that see if I could get some reasonable XP. I got in, and I was surprised that once slowed, the mobs were cake at best. The only death I had occured when the chanter got agro and died on tash. I went on to tank it unslowed and live just fine, regardless.<br />
<br />
After a half an hour or so (yea, my dps is somewhat lacking) the named spawn. Kri V'lak, to be specific. I figured &quot;What the hell? The mask is nice, and my monk could use the staff.&quot; Now, I really had no hopes of actually making it to the named. From what I hear, most people just invis/paci to the named. I can't do this. Lack of group invis, and the fact that I have to move 4 characters at once just doesn't appeal to me. I decided that I had the time, and could use the XP, so I cleared to the named. Surprisingly, the only trouble I had was the unslowable abandoned workers. They hit like mack trucks.<br />
<br />
All went well, and I got to and killed the named no problem. The whole deal, including the run to Barindu (see invis mob cause a death otw), took me roughly 3 hours. Now, 3 hours for the 1 or so AA didn't seem amazing, but the fun I had, combined with the chance of loot (Kri V'lak dropped chains arms, which rotted), and the XP, made it worth it in the end.<br />
<br />
I'll definately be going back, and once I figure out how to reliably deal with mobs that flee, I will be headed to lair for a few items I need. My only regrets about GoD, is I didn't explore it sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 things that can help fleeing mobs are haveing a snare weapon off handed on warrior or the monk and haveing your cleric ready to assist your warrior and cast a stun or 2 and or root. Unless I am mistaken all mobs that run can be rooted and snared.</div></div><hr />

I solo'd Kril 4 times when the uh.....&quot;feature&quot; was in, and he dropped no chain arms =(<br />
