<br />
 (BTW, Hi, nice to meet you all.)<br />
<br />
 A pretty nice belt, too.<br />
<br />
 Girdle of the Flesh Eater<br />
<br />
 ac6 wis5 int5 svm5 svc15 hp30 mana30 Taunt +4% all/all <br />
<br />
<br />
 Now, Absor, the question.<br />
<br />
 Given that everyone who plays EQ who has a clue about itemization knows that this is a belt geared towards the Knight Class, <br />
<br />
 Why in God's Green Earth does your item development group figure Knights NEED to bring taunt closer to Warrior levels? <br />
<br />
 I don't look forward to your non-reply.<br />
<br />
 PS for the sig change community, I'm in.</div></div><hr />

I mean I'm a gimp but that belt is by far more gimpy than even I can manage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps Sony is concerned about knights running out of mana and needing more help getting aggro. I mean without clarity, beast clarity, protection of the nine, self buffs, and flowing thought a knight might have need to med once ever twenty mobs or so after chain casting cease repeatedly.<br />
<br />
/looks at all those buffs<br />
<br />
So yeah Absor, why does the game need a taunt modifier seemingly made with mana users in mind? Aren't the only other taunt mods extremely rare drops from unrewarding zones and events?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point is... making an all/all item which has stats that gear more towards a hybrid than a pure melee is the discussion here and then throw taunt mod on it, something that is suppose to be the warrior's &quot;specialty&quot; (and I use that word loosely).<br />
<br />
This is just poor itemization, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Expecting some accusatory post on the board directly addressing Absor to get a reply is stupid. And 50x moreso because it's in the shithouse. People acting all fucking uppity because they don't get a reply in the general forum is bad enough.<br />
<br />
 And Absor is right, classes are nowhere near as out of balance as you fucking band of ninnies say. But fuck him anyways, fucking clueless PR people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I'm convinced more than ever classes are TOTALLY out of balance. I just watched a friend of mine SOLO 50-60 mobs, in a single pull. He earned 2.3 AA in just over 20 minutes, and could do it all day long if he felt like it. <br />
<br />
That's totally nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
4% more Taunt for Warriors is 4% more Taunt than a Paladin. The math still works althought the mechanics are dubious.<br />
<br />
IIRC the higher the skill in taunt the higher level of mobs you can taunt, they might have changed that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember SoE once said that Taunt is worked such that the maximum warrior can get to is treated like the cap anyway so even if you can get to 252 taunt it doesn't do anything anyway when asked why taunt doesn't go to 252.<br />
<br />
So this items help Knights more than Warriors, but not for the reason you stated above.  A warrior has no advantage out of this item since anything over the warrior max doesn't do anything anyway.</div></div><hr />

Great now more people are going to jump on the bardwagon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I'll admit, I'm in mostly elemental with a BoC and a CHoS. But, my son's girlfriend's cat's level 9 Pally twink can steal aggro from me.<br />
<br />
Now maybe that's not all that imbalanced, but the cat's Pally is grouped all the time and I'm /lfg most of the time. And don't be suggesting the cat has a better personality - this is the same cat that walked across my keyboard once and ninja'd that RBB from Vox.<br />
<br />
Tell Flynte hiyas and let him know Mom still speaks highly of him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard's exp-earning abilities are balanced with the fact they get shit for AAs. :D <br />
<br />
Now enchanters...I remember hearing people say some enchanters are getting groups now because they've gotten all their AAs from charming (before the charm nerf).  I'm sitting here thinking &quot;Um...thanks?  I'm supposed to be thankful you've gotten bored of exping enough to bother with grouping with us?&quot;  Anyways...:D<br />
<br />
There was a dev that said any taunt skill over 230 doesn't make much of a difference because the game is set for 230 to be the max.  Now if someone could prove that having a modifier actually did make you taunt better when you're already at 230, then warriors would benefit just as much if not more, but since warriors reach the cap naturally, it really only benefits knights (and to a lesser extent, rangers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just one more piece of goofy and pretty much useless equipment added to the game.  If SoE really understood what they were doing, stuff like that wouldn't even show up because it's not really an upgrade to anyone who would be getting it.  At most it might be useful on a lower level twink.  But then again they've done away with a lot of that by making the required and recommended levels so high.  Often by the time you can get full use out of an item, there's no point in equiping it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if it was ac16 +5 str/sta saves the same +60 hp slot 1 type 3 +4% taunt<br />
<br />
then maybe it would be ok. then you could toss in haste, aura, vegy, regen or anyother ype 3 thing.<br />
<br />
i find it funny that another drop with close to the same name is the flesh eaters ring ac 12 +7 to about every thing +hp mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it so unfair the way this whole game has become. Yesterday I was selling some 61+ spells and after checking the prices I was depressed. Supernal light - 500pp, Supernal Elixir - 100pp, Talisman of Tribunal - 50pp, etc. I mean casters get their spells soooo easily. Now look at warrior stuff. Helmet of Rallos Zek - 90k, Crystallized Acid Bracer - 170k, BoC - 375k /sigh. And all this is usually 'recommended for level 51' or 56 now compare it to their 60+ spells. I mean where's the balance? :confused: <br />
<br />
Just like all the elemental parchments/spectral parchments are no-drop, they should also make ornate molds no-drop so people can get them easily instead of buying/trading forever just to get one piece.<br />
<br />
edit: Thanks Kaesorn for pointing out my mistake :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the parchments themselves are already nodrop...the spells that come from them aren't.</div></div><hr />
