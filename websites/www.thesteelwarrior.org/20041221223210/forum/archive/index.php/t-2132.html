<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the whole HP/AC mantra, but as a half elf I'm kind of deficient in a lot of other places as well, but I'm sexier than any darn oggie!!  My in game hubby is a 65 cleric and he's pretty much obsessed about my sta and HP.  We go round and round about my gear upgrades.  I know I need as much HP as I can get, but how much of the other stats should I sacrafice? <br />
<br />
Also, I'm about to beat him over the head with my Tae Ew Long Sword if he says one more time there's no way I'm getting into BoT at 65 with my HP.  He preaches about how no healer wants to go oom, he even jibes me a little about that when he's helping me level in PoS!!  He wants me to do IS5, ND3, then PE at 60, but that's 22 AA's!! At that rate I'm not getting to 65 and BoT for another year anyway.  I'm only 59 with 3068 base HP and 1143 AC, which I don't think was that bad for my level.  I've heard all about the bonuses you get as you level, but I just can't convince my hubby about that.  Could y'all please explain about those bonuses in a little more detail and how exactly it will affect me so that I can then explain it to my hubby?<br />
<br />
He's a good guy really, it's just we've just now gotten to the upper tier planes due to our levels and the removal of the flag requirements so this is all new to both of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your gear and AA don't change you'll have ~3300 HP at 65. 4k would be ok for BoT, more is better of course.<br />
<br />
HP and stamina should be your focus, along with AC. Try not to sacrifice DPS or haste either. Your other stats are basically unimportant. Besides stamina which you'll prolly be working on, your agility should stay above 75 otherwise you'll drop ~40 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Isk said ... For some targets you want to be atleast 4khps and 1150 AC when you are tanking in Tier 2 planes and above, the only thing you don't want to sacrifice to achieve this is haste.  Personally I hit 60 before PoP came out and stopped XPing, then when the level limit got increased I stayed at 60 until I had finished ND3 which wont take too long at all these days.<br />
<br />
At 60 and above 1 point of stamina gives 6hps up to 255 stamina after which the returns are reduced.  Talisman of the boar (shammy buff) raises stamina by 60 so you should aim to have stamina over 195.  If it gets over 220 you can afford to drop stamina for raw HPs until you get round to working on Planar Power AAs, though those will probably be pretty far down the AA track even once you hit 65.<br />
<br />
As said above with your current gear at 65 you'll be around 3300 HPs.  With ND3 and PE you can add another 12% to that which will put you at close to 3700hps and from there its just a short jump to get that goal of 4k.<br />
<br />
You have an advantage with your partner playing a cleric in that you probably wont have to be one of the LFG crowd warriors and you hopefully wont have to spend too much time with a druid healer (and therefore without cleric buffs) so your HP total wont be as important as for other warriors in similar gear / AA situations, but otherwise a very good reason to stay 60 and AA would be to not get a rep as a paper tank by the PoV/S/HoH/BoT crowd cause thats only going to make it harder to get XP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah, and a gear tip or 2...<br />
<br />
With your partner you should be able to easily duo the Draconic Pauldrons quest for 15AC 12str/sta shoulders (an extra 60 hps) assuming you have CoV faction.  You would also only need one or 2 friends to help you out with the Bracer of Benevolence quests 17AC 8str/sta/dex, 30hps and resists (another 32hps each).<br />
<br />
I'd also look at replacing the cobalt with something that has HPs.  A Skyshrine gauntlet MQ will last you a long time as the nicest piece of the SS set with 90hps, and I'd look at some player made boots, fine heraldic or whatever, for another 30hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're basically done getting bonuses for leveling.  It's all 50-60hp a level from here on out, especially with your stamina where it's at.  22 AA points is your best bet for gaining any HP thru just XP'ing.<br />
<br />
Mobs hit freaking hard in the planes...things could damned near one round you if they get lucky.  As far as what to sacrifice for HP, sacrifice everything except Stamina and huge chunks of AC.  You die because you run out of HP, not for any othe reason.<br />
<br />
As for gear, check the various threads in the bunker, they'll tell you everything you need to know about what's good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice is if you can get to 4k hp's with gear, that is better than doing it with AA's.  Part of that is just that, with 4K hp's before you do ND, you will get more for it, and part is that you will get AA's faster at 65 than at 60, most likely.  What stats to sacrafice for HP's?  Everything but STA(for hp's), and to a certain extent AC.  No other stats matter significantly. <br />
<br />
A couple gear ideas for you.<br />
<br />
1:  Soulscream belt...more haste, more AC, more STA, more HP's, you can farm it easily.<br />
<br />
2:  You are not going to do significant bow damage, so get the best use you can out of that range slot.  Replace nightmarewood bow with either a bow with sta and hp's, or better yet an Idol of the Thorned.  <br />
<br />
3:  PoTC earing.  More hp's, plus STA.<br />
<br />
4:  As Eodin mentioned, if you can get SS quest guants, grab them.  One of my favorite pieces of gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO you would tank better in BoT at 65 with your current hps than you would at 60th with ND3 and PE and all the other hp aa's that you could get.   Really BoT giants aren't that bad once they are slowed, you just have to worry about them killing your enchanter or shaman before they get slowed :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for your suggestions.  I really wasn't trolling for equpiment upgrade advice, I did that in an earlier thread ;).  My in game hubby and I are already in the process of upgrading my gear as we get pp.  We got a cloack of greater pernicity to upgrade my hooded black cloack, bracelet of fortitude to ugrade one of my silver chitin wristbands, and a valorium ring of galantry to upgrade one of my velium fire wedding rings.  We plan to get another valorium ring of galantry next.  I'll look into doing the quest armour after that.  So hopefully I will be getting closer to that 4K HP with gear.  I had just read all the threads and posts about how you should get levels before AA's and couldn't get that across to my in game hubby.  I have absolutley no intention of being suicidal in BoT.  It's just that with my playing time (I only play during the days when my 2 year old allows for it and not at all on the weekends), I need to maximize my exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hows your Thurg and CoV faction like?  If they are high enough, some really nice cheap upgrades are to MQ some of those pieces to replace the Cobalt gear.  Boots and Gloves dont run much at al, maybe 1-2k each item.  <br />
<br />
PotC quest is cheap and maybe look into a Clattering Bone Necklace.  What does Mith Marr have as far as Cultural Gear?<br />
<br />
Grab your Hubby and hit the new Veksar in LoIO.  They have some nice drops there and its 1 groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level &gt; AA...<br />
<br />
At 65 many of the good exp mobs will be blue, Beez are a good spot and great exp, tradeskill drops sell well in teh bazaar too.  Lotsa gem drops and parch drops.<br />
<br />
Beat yer clerix over the head and splain to him that for a warrior level &gt; AA.  AA's at 65 with 90% AA turned on are about 1 per 45-90 mins depending on yer group.  It will take you, in a good group, about 6hrs per level from 61-65... ok that is at a rocking pace actually heh.<br />
<br />
Oh and for gear... HP, HP, HP.  STA is nice but compare slots and consider essentially 1STA=6hps.  With Raw HP's winning out somewhat... that said, I'd almost think you should've kept one of those silver chitin wristbands (40hps for a non-cultural bracer is good).</div></div><hr />
