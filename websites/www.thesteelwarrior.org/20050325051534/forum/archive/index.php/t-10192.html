<br />
Have read some good threads <br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8214&amp;highlight=gates+discord<br />
<br />
But still have a some basic questions. Also please see my Magelo I am curretly level 62 ( magelo not updated )<br />
<br />
1. Is GOD worth anything pre 65 and XX of AA<br />
<br />
2. With OOW out to hunt in and great new Bazaar items does the value of GOD go down<br />
<br />
3. If I was to enter GOD with a group of level 65-67 ( Healer , Chanter , Bard and Ranger ) What area could I tank ( with high end buffs im at 1450 Ac and 7500 HP)<br />
<br />
4. Should I wait an buy GOD later and forget it for now <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
However, I think you nailed it in number 2 above.  You are gonna get more benefit from exp'ing in OoW.  Runes, attunables, sellables, LOYALIST FACTION and ARMSMASTER's QUEST PIECES combine to make Omens much better for you at this point.</div></div><hr />

I've never tried it but I assume you can't get GoD AAs without owning the expansion?   If not Weapon Affinity is probably the biggest reason for a warrior to own GoD hehe.  I enjoy GoD quite a bit, but do you NEED it?   Not really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since im not going to do major AA work till 65 ... that issues is not urgent. <br />
<br />
I guess ..... then are thier good upgrades that I can get with a single group that would be more bang for buck then doing OOW stuff ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion no, the GoD content that can yield you upgrades is too difficult to tank at level 61 with few aa's.<br />
<br />
As far as bang for the buck goes...stay in Omens a while. Get your loyalist faction/Armsmaster's quests finished, grab a few attunable upgrades, grab some groovy augs, earn some aa's, then go give em hell in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Buy it now if for no other reasons Sturdiness AA and Tribute. To answer 3, yes there are a few places for you but as far as progression is concerned (trials etc) they will be pretty out of the question until your 65 and i'd reccomend at least 5.8-6.2k unbuffed for ease.</div></div><hr />

OoW isn't necessarily better XP than GoD, it's just way easier.</div></div><hr />

Also if you plan on helping any rogues with the epic 1.5 in PoH then you need to have to GoD as it is an expedition and will cause the turn in to fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoD as an expansion for the &quot;casual&quot; EverQuest gamer was a total crock of shit.  GoD as an expansion for the &quot;hardcore&quot; EverQuest gamer was somewhat of a masterpiece.  <br />
<br />
The problem with GoD is that the money, the real meat of the expansion, is hidden away behind locked doors which only the raider can unlock.  Kod`Taz, Yxxta, and Ikkinz are chock full of fantastic upgrades that a single group would really go nuts over, even if some of the pieces a bit on the rare side.  Exp is fantastic, named are plenty, and the reward is well worthwhile.  The catch?  Unless you're a well-elemental equipped tank, your chances of succeeding the trials to gain access to these zones is virtually nill.  Tipt and Vxed trash mobs are no fucking joke.  Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru is a mack truck on steroids.  Sewer trials are just an ill-conceived royal pain in the ass.  No wonder the casual EverQuest gamers are flocking to World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
But with OoW, there's hope.  Honestly, OoW made GoD much, much, much more enjoyable for me.  I'm always game and eager for challenging content, but there comes a point where you have to draw the line.  At level 65 with PoP/GoD AAs and over 10k+/2300ac buffed, I was getting fucking plastered by single group Ikkinz trash mobs.  A lot of this had to do with the fact that there are shamans aplenty inside Ikkinz, and they haste the fuck out of everything.  Dispelling solved this problem, but all it took was one person not paying attention and a 2000dps quadding Kyv would turn your &quot;fun&quot; into a one hour CR party.  OoW adding a lot more padding for simple, should-be-recoverable mistakes with the increased skillups and defensive AAs.  Those hasted Kyvs are still no joke, but I now at least have a freaking chance to reach over and hit my cleric's divine arbitration key.  Seriously, they were fucking overboard.  I bet this very same thing has a lot to do with the fact that even Riftseeker mobs don't come incomming hasted.  You'll never see a shaman/enchanter mob haste an ally inside RS.  That would drive people insane...<br />
<br />
With OoW defensive AAs, quested armor, and improved weaponry, you should have the capabilities of winning these Tipt/Vxed trials.  While the MPG trials do yield more shwaggin' stuff for your time, it's not always necessarily in the same slots.  Glyphed Prayer Rings, Resonating Earrings of Battle, Carved Vrex Totems, Crafted Wristbands of Strife, and various other P3/P4 quality armors out of Ikkinz would never be passed up by a casual player.  Add in the (3) 20ac augs you can get between KT/Yxxta and you might realize that gaining access to these zones might very well be worth your time.<br />
<br />
GoD is actually a very good expansion.  Too bad it was aimed a wee bit too high though.  ;)<br />
<br />
Btw, Weapon Affinity and Sturdiness are easily the best things out of this expansion, bar none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruenorg</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw, Weapon Affinity and Sturdiness are easily the best things out of this expansion, bar none.<br />
Yep...no doubt about that.  Tribute is awesome and some of the group leadership stuff is great too - most notably, Health of Target's Target.  I'm lost when I don't have it - super handy for tanks as you can tell instantly who your mob is most interested in having for lunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taraddar</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with most. There are some nice things in GoD for ya if your willing the put in the effort but they are a little beyond you at this point. The tipt bracer, glyphed prayer ring, Shielding aug, 3 ac augs are some of the better ones. Odds are too that you'd have little competition in there. On my server the ubers have mostly moved to RS and the zone is usually mostly or totally empty other than a guild moving threw to some raid.<br />
<br />
Even with that said this I would recommend you buying the expansion now. Tribute can be really handy and if nothing else can provide a little extra hps and ac for you. More importantly tho leader aa's don't work for you even if the group leader has them unless you have GoD. Hott and designate MA are just too cool. Can literally make the difference between wiping and saving your arse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I completely forgot leadership. Tanking without HoTT is like tanking with your eyes closed. Buy GoD now, just for that feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eriatha hit the nail right on the nose.  GoD is a raiders expansion, an expansion so tuned up it has even crumbled raid guilds.  The progession although much more simple than PoP is painful.  However the benefits to people who can make it past trials 1-6 is the absolutely wonderful zones of Kod`Taz, Yxtta and Ikkinz.  trash drops make EP non visible slots look like a joke.  Named are has he said plentiful and the exp is still fantastic with chain pulling groups.  Much easier to grind then in MPG.  GoD is my favorite expansion because it really seperated the men from the women (not literally).<br />
<br />
<br />
But with OoW, there's hope.  Honestly, OoW made GoD much, much, much more enjoyable for me.  I'm always game and eager for challenging content, but there comes a point where you have to draw the line.  At level 65 with PoP/GoD AAs and over 10k+/2300ac buffed, I was getting fucking plastered by single group Ikkinz trash mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before there was OoW GoD was the worst expansion ever.  Getting 1 rounded by trash, absolutely locked into the holy trinity of grouping, required time gear for a tank...the expansion blew.  Level 70 against the mobs has really made the content much easier to deal with.  Myself, an EP geared warrior, can easily handle KT trash with a druid healer now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, buy GoD just for the AAs when you are ready to start working on them.  Other than doing a Vxed instance as part of my Epic 1.5 progression, I never go to GoD.  I won't repeat everything that was said, but it is a an expansion for hard core raiders, waste of time for everyone else.   Certainly no upgrades for me in any content that I am capable of getting too, or tanking with the exception of an aug or two (only now can I consider going after them, before OOW, I was way too weak a tank).  In OOW, I have been able to reap many upgrades that have been single groupable, and I have been able to tank. <br />
<br />
GoD is just annoying, there are some named mobs in the non keyed zones that will just tear apart a group (a raid even) and drop junk.  The zones are just packed with wandering mobs that have too much dps to even bother with. <br />
<br />
When I tap out OOW to the extent I am capable, and grind a bunch more AAs, I may consider going back to GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoD is impossible to live without because of :<br />
1. WA5 (our best agro booster)<br />
2. Sturdiness (it's much cheaper now)<br />
3. tribute (to patch what you lack most)<br />
4. epic 1.5 (yes, you need GoD to complete this OoW quest)</div></div><hr />
