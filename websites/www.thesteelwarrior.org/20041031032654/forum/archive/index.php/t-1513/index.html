<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ChrisDaTank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well....I had my seller back out on a GSoT,  DA%$ MOTHA#@$&amp;% So in retrospect, I have lots of cash now.  I was thinking about maybe just upgrading some gear, and then worry about weapons.  I dont really have a problem with aggro, but that might change since my Frosty/BCA seems to be losing its touch.  Just curious on how other warriors seem to get over this hill.<br />

Most warriors just keep on plugging along with the levels and the AAs and eventually fate steps in and that weapons upgrade you've been lusting after drops right in your lap.<br />
<br />
Hang in there ... mebbe the next GSoT seller won't back out. Maybe you'll get some good groups and actually get to loot your next upgrade. Or maybe you'll get something really kickass from a raid.<br />
<br />
In any event, good luck.<br />
