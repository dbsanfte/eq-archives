<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>terk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious around what level the Fungi Tunic becomes more of a burden than an aid in groups? Pre-45 it seems to be great, as you rarely need to get healed if you're wearing one, but after that, when you're getting hit for 110-120+, would the extra 30ish AC from one of the crafted BPs be better in the long run? I know you'll take less damage with the higher AC, but will it even out the regen?<br />
<br />
Just curious. Or maybe others would just bag the Fungi, wear the high AC in a fight, and wear fungi when group is healing up?</div></div><hr />

Sounds about right.<br />
<br />
Well I had my Fungi up until PoP exp groups.  With KEI and everything now, mana regen is too good and groups rarely run outta mana.  With PoP exp, I stopped two-boxing and just did mainly group exp from then on.<br />
<br />
Fungi is good for solo play still, and would be good until like lvl 55.  I decided to sell mine and get a whole buncha upgrades for the cash.  From 56 on, it was all HP/Stam/AC stuff and Im still on that road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I gave my fungi to my alt around 51 and switched to a cobalt BP...never regretted the change.  Fungi was great pre-pop, but in PoP I'd rather have the ac and hp of a good BP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely in PoP you want as much AC/hps as you can get.  I always wore my fungi if I was grouped with a shaman, but my ac/hp breastplate if I was getting CH'd.  Regen doesn't mean much if you're grouped with a cleric, but it's worth wearing if your healer is a shaman or druid at lower levels.  Always worth throwing on for downtime if you don't mind swapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would think anytime your cleric is 39+ and has comeplete heal :p.<br />
<br />
30 AC can be quite the shift in some places too. For exmaple, the front of Seb, going from below 1000 to above 1000 will result on of those big drops of damage. (Where you can notice the change in the number of max and min hits.)<br />
<br />
I would test on the mobs if you can carry both with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mandragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I trade out my FH BP for my fungi when I'm soloing LBs (and some DBs) so that my recovery afterward won't be as long; the constant regen mitigates a good bit of the damage, as long as you aren't fighting heavy-hitters.  And, of course, the speeded-up recovery in general is nice.<br />
<br />
For groups, the FH never comes off; if I'm tanking and I'm in need of that extra bit of healing, I'm dead anyway.</div></div><hr />
