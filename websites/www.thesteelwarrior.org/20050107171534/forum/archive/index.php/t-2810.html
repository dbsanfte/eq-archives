<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering if there is anything I could really upgrade with plat rather than nodrop raid gear, judging from my magelo link. <br />
<br />
Working on 10th Coldain ring and Valorium ring only adds some stats. I guess Ornate bp maybe or would it make more sense to just put lots of plat aside and save up for a BoC?<br />
Guild would like to try AoW, but we have yet to find statue up when enough of us are on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">anything droppable that's still useful at 65 is going to cost alot, but if you can get the cash, there's boots of the storm, velium encrusted gauntlets, helm of rallos zek, crystalized acid bracer,  stonewood compound bow is a good range item and of course ornate molds. as far as saving for BoC, typically i see them for around 400k, you could probably get 2 ornate bracers, boots, arms, helm, and guantlets for that, or maybe a SoD and something else and still have cash left over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zynth pretty much nailed it. You are down to buying the best tradeable gear available to get a decent upgrade, and none of the, are going to come cheap. The good news is that the prices of most of those items are coming down pretty fast. On my server, every one of those items listed has come down under 100k except the bracers - and don't expect those to come down any, they are super rare.<br />
<br />
Unless you have a truckload of plats, your best bet is to live in BoT for the next few weeks and pray for hot dice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple upgrades that might be doable for you are another mosquito leg earring, and keep the solstice earring for resist gear.  Also, a heavy rubicite girdle from CT; on my server they run around 30-40k.  For your back slot, you might want to do the Loyalist Shield of Honour quest in Katta Castellum/Tenebrous Mountains.  It's doable by 1 group.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't mind losing 35 HP *I know, it's a good chunk of HP, but oh well*, you might want to consider horn spiked shoulder plates.  Nice ac, some stats and resists.<br />
<br />
That, and the other upgrades people mentioned are all good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check my magelo. It looks like I may be an upgrade or 2 ahead of you in several slots.<br />
<br />
I did a lot of buyable upgrades then joined a raiding guild so Im looking mostly at no drop stuff from now on. Some of the things I am looking at possibly acquiring would be Vindi BP, or Ornate BP. A Neck upgrade something like Amulet of the Dreadgazer, the Klandi neck item (not ST key) or if I have a buttload of DKP a Bile Etched Choker from CT. Possibly also a back item but not really worried about it now. Im still looking to buy an Elemental Bow since for the price its impossible to beat, but anything else is going to be 200k+ and I cant afford that.<br />
<br />
Hope my self evaluation helps put you in the direction youre heading. My advice to you, along with the others here, would be to pick up some Ornate stuff, Myrmidon Gaunts if your faction is ok. BoC or SoD is nice but IMO your better off going for a lot of decent upgrades instead of one big one. And I assume you raid from your post so I would just go through all of your current targets and identify items that are upgrades and appear to be ones that would last a long time. if your doing PoI dragon or even if youre not get your guild to go there and kill him as many times as it takes to get a hammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ear Symbol of the Veteran<br />
Amygdalan Chain Mask<br />
Tear of the Rainmaker<br />
or for sta, Bloodmetal earring of engagement</div></div><hr />
