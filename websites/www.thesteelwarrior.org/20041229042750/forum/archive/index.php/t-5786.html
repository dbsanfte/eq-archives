What's the deal?  Did someone just goof and patch the wrong spells, or did I miss something.  I could've sworn openings were being scrapped...</div></div><hr />

That source date just refers to the date of the spdat file it was read from, not necessarily that that particular spell/ability changed or went live on that date.  You have to look at the history tab for that spell/ability to see when it was added/modified.</div></div><hr />

Though the skills listed are the old openings ones, and are not guaranteed to make it.  They are probably just leaving them in until they are done designing new skills, and then will either change them or replace them entirely.</div></div><hr />

Magnes, what makes you say they will not &quot;fix&quot; Warriors? While I don't entirely agree that we are broken, I really don't think we are so badly gimped that it is worth deleting. I find my biggest complain atm is my agro generation in pickup groups, but I tend to blame the pickup groups more (ie.. I can hold agro perfectly well in guild groups in elementals, but have hellish time in bot with &quot;pickup&quot; groups). Do you feel our DPS  or tanking is broken, or is it something else? You take a very strong stance and I am interested in knowing more.<br />
<br />
Kamidari, thanks for that link. I missed it when it was first put and it was good to know about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as aggro problems in BoT and HoHo type zones I have noticed that some of the aggro from spells is absolutly stupid. Were in HoHo pulling to GY. Had a druid harmony snare pulling. Mob would get to group and I would root it. Tank engaged and we go thru then normal tash malo slow bit. Druid has done nothing else at this point since pull. Root breaks mobs goes straight at the druid even standing up. So snare draws more aggro than Slow Malo Tash and tank taunting ? Thats not right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then delete your warrior.  If you want to have a more rational discussion however, I can do that.<br />
<br />
First, you say they aren't going to fix us.  Have you forgotten about incite?  What about our innate mitigation?  And even the availabliity of the two droga weapons, cheap and easy to get weapons with decent aggro.  You don't have to raid to get aggro weapons, you don't have to play a lot to be able to tank better than a similar knight.  Those were some of the bigger concerns, which have been addressed.  I know it's been a long time coming to get these upgrades, but the most important part is here.<br />
<br />
As for the second part, they are working on it.  It will add utility to the warrior class.  Obviously I can't be more specific, as the specifics are not out and available yet.  However, after seeing Incite, and knowing the effects they were putting in to the opening system before it was scrapped, I believe they now can get things right, or at least close enough =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also noticed that snare generates a lot of aggro in bot/hoh... let me tell you, this is a GOOD thing. With someone pulling with snare, and then rooting, all you have to do is get a succesful taunt, and use incite. There, aggro is yours. Only way anyone is gonna get the mob off you, if you have decent weaps, is if they either drop to &lt; 10% health, or the snarer starts chain nuking and sitting or something. For several hours in BoT last night, we had an all-out dps group, with my boxed shammy sitting off to the side for slows and the occasional heal/FA/haste. With a druid pulling with snare and usually adding an ac debuff before the mob reached our camp, I could just taunt on my warrior, and when I slowed with my shammy, he wouldn't get aggro. <br />
<br />
And no, I'm gonna have to say that warriors are not broken any more. Before I went to BoT last night, I finally got an anger2 aug and Weapon Affinity2, and I had zero trouble with aggro. In 2ish hours of chain pulls, I lost aggro once, when an add aggroed the druid, who got smashed up a bit by both mobs. AE Taunt, incite on the add, switch back to other one, and we were fine. To all of you having aggro trouble, the best thing you can do is get some aggro augs, and as many levels of WA as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree that warriors aren't broken anymore. No, taunt isn't a snap lock, but after learning to fight in the old system, and then getting incite, it certainly helps. Taunt is a lot easier to manage.  Have the combat abilities makes using discs a bit easier now too.  <br />
<br />
I'm enjoying playing my warrior more now. There may be room for improvement, but it's certainly more solid for the changes we have received.<br />
<br />
And if someone doesn't want to group with me because I'm a warrior, it's their loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaruk</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with the above posts.  I'm in a non-raiding guild, and I can say that the tools are there for warriors to effectively hold agro.  We don't have agro-lock, but that's the downside for our other advantages.  In fact, the paladins in my guild are now complaining about how much warriors outclass them with our better dps, mitigation, and innate healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors aren't broken.  END is broken atm, but that's being worked on and will be fixed soon (END on old items).<br />
<br />
Warriors are just dependant upon gear, though with incite, slightly less reliant on gear.<br />
<br />
Warriors are still boring to play, if you are bored with them.   All classes are boring to play if you are bored with them.  Just like anything else in this world is boring after some point, same reason you are checking out that chick in the booty shorts while you are with your girl friend who's even hotter.<br />
<br />
The only way to fix this is to quit, play another class, or just grind thru it and hope you get over it at some point.<br />
<br />
I've been playing my necro lately, got 3 levels, up to 57 while I've been 'taking a break' from my warrior for a bit.</div></div><hr />
