<br />
what should i work on next<br />
<br />
profile does not reflect a +5 str aug, +5 dex aug and a +5 sta aug<br />
<br />
know you get sick of these but could use the advice...i have limited funds...right now i only have about 5k and funds are tight...<br />
<br />
also have a GSoT as well<br />
<br />
<br />
this is my main of 2 years..ok its my only as well...i just cant stand playing other classes...i level slowly...but hold my own...<br />
<br />
just really curious as to where i should be putting my focus...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Clattering Bone Necklace for your neck slot.<br />
<br />
2) Skyshrine (Myrmidon) Gauntlets MQ for your hands.<br />
<br />
The Gaunts alone will add 90hps. The Clattering Bone Neck I believe will add 50+<br />
<br />
If you have money left over, get a 65 hp ring. That will add 33 more hps in that slot.<br />
<br />
I believe all of the earring upgrades and buyable Arm stuff will mostly cost more than that.<br />
<br />
See if you can get the SS gaunts and Arms at the same time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tynaeya</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SS MQ i havent really seen any of on the Povar server..i keep an eye out...<br />
<br />
as to the necklace..well that would negate my haste item :(<br />
<br />
i actually ditched the 65 hp rings in favor of these...my stats were REALLY horrible... and i chose to take the 33 hp loss in favor of some stats..just my opinion...i like to make it so with full buffs i am max str, dex and sta..which i am just barely holding onto.<br />
<br />
hmmm ... i think with my cash flow i may be stuck lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tynaeya</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">another issue to me is that i dont seem to hold aggro well...this especially became apparent when i tried tanking in PoD...i just cant hold it or get it back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The agro is most likely your level. If you are taunting anything yellow or red before level 60, it will not work at all. You need to be level 60 for your taunt to affect mobs that are higher level than you.<br />
<br />
Didnt see the haste on that neck thing.<br />
<br />
Try finishing out a few Hp slots with Fierce Heraldic then. That might help a little :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Collect components for more Fierce Heraldic and replace your legs, masks and shoulders with it (if you can find a smith to do it cheaply).  Other options include a solstace earring, 65 hp rings, Cloak of the Maelstrom, Belt of Dripping Bile/Heavy Rubicite Belt, Sword of the Bloodsworn (or whatever that other Droga sword is).<br />
<br />
Most of those items are either incredibly cheap, or attainable with a single group and some patience.  ...and you're probably going to want to eventually get different haste...*shrug*</div></div><hr />
