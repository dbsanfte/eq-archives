Recently picked up a frostreaver off the dain thx to meh new guild, (Ally to dubious in 1 kill) and i was wondering if anyone had any thoughts or opinions on its performance vs a greatstaff of thunder<br />
<br />
I know that the GSoT has better DPS but i have heard tale and rumor that the dain axe's proc can make up for the difference, and seeing as the ratio on the axe isnt too terrible i can find that believable.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if anyone happens to have dealt with this first hand, id appreciate any info, i will continue to do my own tests as i find time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ive used both of them, and I preferred the GSoT for Aggro and Frostreaver for Dps. True the frostreaver does have 0.0 stun on it and 125dd, I liked the GSoT a better because of the higher dps ratio + higher aggro. So imo stick with the GSoT and use the Axe for dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wait a second...The GSOT has a better DPS ratio but use the axe for DPS? Not sure what that means. They both have the stun component, and neither is ideal if you absolutely want to be a non-agro warrior on a raid.<br />
<br />
That frostreaver is way underestimated for Agro, I have seen someone using one that would take agro off the 2hs epic all the time. (not saying that much anymore but it was a constant headache back then)<br />
<br />
With full taunting and 2hs and a headstart on agro, that thing would always pull agro away.<br />
<br />
How far off in DPS would a 42/43 be from a 32/31?<br />
<br />
It's a great weapon. Slap a 510 Ykesha aug on it and go to town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't use the Dain Axe for dps in a non-tanking situation, as it has a considerably good chance at pulling agro.  The 125dd + 0.5/55 second stun with a semi-lure component to it really pisses mobs off.  Dps wise, while it's not much to shake a fist at anymore, but was probably awesome back in its day, is still nothing to sneeze at in the hands of a 65 Overlord. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, i use it as dps just because the people i play with can always pick up aggro off of that, but i *did* use it as my aggro wep until i bought a GSoT and it worked totally fine ;) Ive procced 4 times in a row, ive procced once in 4 fights, but its the same for every wep, and if frostreaver and gsot have the same proc rate (which they have a very good chance of being) then it is just dependant on the ratios, and a faster hitting weapon but still pumping out decent damage is what i picked, but it IS more fun seeing the bigger numbers ;) it is very hard to resist (-50 CR or something, dont remember what it said on lucy) 510/760 Yak aug on either would be a good aggro wep, I choose the GSoT because of its ratio/stun up to 65 but its all choice, either would work :D <br />

Rough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to use my Dain axe exclusivly for everything, in most situations I was never a raid tank but I used it for DPS never had a problem of pulling aggro if I wasn't taunting.  I still use this for my DPS weapon because well, I can't bear to give it up.  Now though in exp groups i'm usually weilding a GSoT, It just &quot;feels&quot; like it gives me a more solid aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My dain axe is perma-banked because DARK ELVES can't use it!!!!  BAH!!!!  What a ghey race selection, thanks SOE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why loot a dain axe as a DE anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thx for all the positive, no BS info guys, <br />
<br />
base on feedback i got im gonna keep the reaver on me as my medium aggro setup (SA, need to pick aggro up if tank dies) and ill keep my GSoT up for normal tanking. <br />
<br />
Havent looked into any LDoN augs yet, been living in ToV (Prayers answered at last) but ill do some research and see what i like and how hard it is to get.</div></div><hr />
