Im doing MPG/RS trash and lower named and am seeing that these stupid mobs summon me while I am right next to them for some reason.<br />
<br />
So I get summoned and then its &quot;you can't see your target&quot;, so I have to move a bit, and if stonewall is up its a real pita to reposition, meanwhile I am not attacking the mob and my wizards get summoned... and die.<br />
<br />
Iv been using defensive now on named or summoners ... can't see much way around it. Any ideas? Are you all getting summoned while you are next to the mob beating on it?<br />
<br />
By the way I found this &quot;mayhem&quot; spell for chanter that is like 500HP damage absorbe and has no regent to consume. 12 seconds refresh but its kinda nice if you need some extra healing and chanters is doning noghtin heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kxorth</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just use defensive :).  With your setup your warrior isn't a major DPS contributer anyway.  The only time I use stonewall is when I'm soloing or duoing with my girlfriend's druid.<br />
<br />
Kx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is the same problem i faced when killing xanamech for the first time with my guild the other night. when the AE snare hit me, in addition to stonewall, i couldnt budge backwards at all, so i looked left and right, and sidestepped backwards in a zig-zagging motion. was quite effective for moving xana to the right spot, unfortunately i didnt learn the trick quick enough to save the gnome, maybe next time nitram :|<br />
<br />
Also, do you chain incite? if not (dont personally feel the need to), just save it for a summon/when agro wanders, and throw it then. should be enough to hold you over until you can position yourself again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a one group I consider a warrior a big DPS contributer; i always use stone.<br />
I also strafe out if i am summoned, but I always stay close anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snare + stonewall = same speed as stonewall.<br />
<br />
Backing up is next to impossible always ... they don't stack.<br />
<br />
Don't incite more than once but i strongly reccomend you slap that BoC in primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In sam's case I'd take the lazy route and go with defensive. Those wizards dps is gonna suck when you're futzing with the warrior trying to get him repositioned with strafing, and if they die it'll double suck.  Normal people should stonewall in groups all the time, IMO. Strafing works great, especially if you're used to doing it a lot from playing FPS's etc.<br />
<br />
Snare may not stack with stonewall, BUT be aware that being encumbered DOES stack with it. If you go stonewall against a mob like galuk drek in veksar with a -250 str debuff, and are carrying 2kpp, you WILL not be able to move, at all. I found this out the hard way, hehehe. That fight was a bit scary without defensive, he seems to have very high atk because I saw a LOT of 1600+ hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors are very high on DPS for groups (and raids for that matter), and there's no better way to reduce damage you're taking by killing something faster.<br />
<br />
That said, stuff in OoW seems to have very small hitboxes so you get summoned around if it even moves a little bit.  If you can't get used to strafing back to a good spot you may have no choice but to use defensive.<br />
<br />
As for snaring, I'm pretty sure the highest one takes effect if you somehow got multiple ones on you.  If they're on the same slot, then they'll overwrite, but the snare effect on Stonewall is on some obscure slot (like 11) to that should never be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I completed epic, I ended up using the 5aa for Press the Attack. It's not a huge push or anything, but when summoned, it is normally enough to push the mob in front of you. <br />
With strafing (which should be a habit for every player regardless if you play FPS), you really should not be missing more than a couple of swings max and if your wizard is so close on your heals agro wise that missing a couple of  swings gets him summoned and you can't even get agro back in time before he dies, perhaps it's time to consider an extra concussion now and then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WRT to getting summoned: One trick I use in places places like wall of slaughter with those bigass bazu models, or GoD vs the #$%# stonemites is to just 'zoom out' with my mouse wheel so i'm watching myself from behind. then I can go ahead and fight right 'on top' of them and they'll be happy that I'm close enough to beat on them and not try to summon me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see how you can tank there with your ac so low...But yeah the mobs targeting system esp in RS is very weak..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see how you can tank there with your ac so low...<br />
<br />
<br />
That is why he is useing Stonewall enough to be miffed by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have 3/5 of the OoW defnsive (both of them). I only use stonewall / defensive on the named.. <br />
<br />
I have Pan of Vie (2000 points of damage reduction over time), Mayhem (500 reduction) and DI and Conviction up 100percent of the time. <br />
<br />
I spam CH and with all those things up I dont have any real problems if the warrior holds 100percent of the agro. Well and I have chanter slow as well 100percent of the time. <br />
<br />
Its when the warrior loses agro that I die lol... (still ususaly I mez and log agro).<br />
<br />
RS is tough zone but my six box crew and a necro took out a named (compainon perfect or something) - I hoping for a new BP, might get it in a few days heh.<br />
<br />
Im kinda low on keys for straffing but maybe I work something out .. <br />
Well my wizards chain spam spark of lightnig so its very tight they are alwasy just a little below the warrior and a few misses is bad news...  I can't use my big nuke (3K and crit for 6K) or I get summoned immdiatly.</div></div><hr />
