<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went there last night.  It is Chardok part 2.  Mobs seemed same as mobs near herb hut/dog pound.  Lvls around 55-58 max hit I got all night was 170.   Loot seemed geared to 52-60 folks.  Some focus 3 items.   Now Krokust is a different story and I believe the zone centers around him and everythign else is fluff.   Theres also a quest skeleton and a room that talks about four sarnaks who &quot;chant&quot; something... /shrug<br />
<br />
Krokust has some nice loot and is supposedly do able with 8-12 folks 61+<br />
<br />
The zone in to Chardok B is located near herb hub to the far side of the back enterance to the dog pound.  Little lever on the wall.  If you've never been to Chardok well now is a good time to go.  Chardok is and has been one of my fav dungeons and ChardokB is a nice compliment.   You can get to herb hut by leving up to the &quot;cave&quot; to the right of the front fort down from zone out.  Go all the way down the 'cave&quot; past the bridge keeper, at the T left is bank, right then left is herb hut.<br />
<br />
Lotta no drop quest stuff.  Only 12 people were in the zone the whole 4 hrs I was there last night with a group.<br />
<br />
Again, don;t think its an &quot;exp&quot; zone, re pops were 18-20 minutes.  I think its centered around two &quot;rings&quot; and Krokust battle being the highlight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The faction messages on those live mobs are just bugged. They say they give +Betrayers of Di`zok, -Betrayers of Di`zok, -Brood of Di`zok, and -Followers of Korocust (Not posative on last hit.) I am certain the -Brood is actually just a text error and should be +Brood, since I have spent 15hours in the zone clearing it from end to end and still max ally to Brood.</div></div><hr />
