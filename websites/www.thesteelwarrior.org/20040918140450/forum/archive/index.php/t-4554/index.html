<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Although my guild hasnt tried xegony yet, it gets to be really funny when my guild's warrior channel gets riled up over all the knight loot that drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enable CoH, reduce the yard trash by 25% and HP by 40% or so and PoA would be a pretty good zone on par with....<br />
<br />
Except for that fucking SK 1HB i'm sorta curious what &quot;Knight Loot&quot; your refering to tho in PoA, there is that pretty nice belt but thats usable by all hybrids not just knights - rest of the stuff seems to be not really knight specific - at least in my view, maybe i am missing a few peices zone we didnt farm it much, avoided the zone like the plague if at all possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">POA just plain is not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">theres enough sparkling shortswords to give to wizards for dual wield now. The &quot;rings&quot; take to long, it takes twice as long to get to them, the monsters are pathetic... You ever try to die for call of the rogue? i find myself having to get a whole island full of mobs to kill me.<br />
<br />
in summary its one of the worst fucking zones out there, and before i basicly retired we'd hit it cause not enough fucking people would log on for time when RAID TIME would start...<br />
<br />
I'd rather do phase 1 lootless for 24 hours than spend 30 minutes in poair</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would be perfectly happy if I never see another translucent spider for the rest of my life /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It makes no sense that you cant CoH there....since you can summon corpses. <br />
<br />
I must be crazy though, I kinda like PoAir...except for those little armor guys that split into 3...and the asshole spiders of course...and the dispelling birds...and the bees that root everyone OOR...<br />
<br />
Hmmm, on second thought, I think i will go delete the zone files now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sounds like they wanted to recreate the nostalgia on Plane of Sky :)<br />
<br />
and they have suceeded</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any zone that is not under-water is better than PoWater, then Poair is the most suck zone after powater to me.</div></div><hr />
