<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got a nice main hand weapon and cant decide what to put in offhand. I have 2 crappy 1handers atm:<br />
<br />
Disemboweler (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16408)<br />
12/20 +3bane<br />
Shortblade of Lightning (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17387)<br />
13/19<br />
really dont feel like doing parses on what does more dmg. What do you think is better for dps. I ask since I have very limited experience with bane weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not exactly bane dmg but me personally, without technically parsing or anything, I've grown to dislike +magic +poison, ect. weapons because they're just too unreliable.  Sometimes the magic dmg hits and you'll see the bonus other times it doesn't, it's just not reliable in my opinion to use it over a 13/19, just too streaky to give it the edge in the experiences I've had.  I'd use the shortblade of lightning personally, reliable dmg and also better stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sell the Disembowler and the SBoL and get one of the new 1handers coming out in the new zones....copper hammer of striking or sword of the bloodsworn.  Either would be much better agro than what you have right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">did I say I want agro? I said DPS plz. Would cooper hammer be actually more dps with that proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DPS, pick up a two hander<br />
<br />
For both DPS and aggro, Go to Droga or buy the weaps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i gotta go with the 2Her option too for more DPS..one of them widebladed greatswords ( i think that is what they are called, 35/35+AC+stats ) should out-DPS anything in that price range and a bit more.<br />
<br />
i don't think anyone else likes to parse out DPS either for ya :D take the 5 minutes and do it yerself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">damn it Shikari making me go all the hard work.<br />
actually did parsing with Bloodfrenzy/Disembowler was doing 70-100 dps - average beeing about 95<br />
with Seru sword 75-135 average beeing about 110<br />
<br />
2hs much more streaky for dps, but still does more dmg. Althought parsing 12/20+3bane and 13/19 in offhand is probably close to imposible with tools I got. Just gotta wing it I think thats why asking opinions.<br />
<br />
You are right thought I should just go camp the cursed droga where I spent too much time factionin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if i would have done the math for ya you would have ended up with &quot;cat&quot;. i h8 maths.<br />
i forgot to add if you're going for parses i don't even count +mod bonuses like them magic or  cold or fire or whatever...it's wayyy too streaky to rely on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bridgecrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have a chance Casai consider getting into a BoT towers raid and try snagging a great blade of storms.<br />
<br />
14/18 with 179pt DD + stun (though it is resisted alot without tash) would be a very worthwhile dps upgrade, with some agro bonus on the side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Casai, the splitblade from Glykus is about as good of a droppable 1-handed DPS machine as you are going to find.  They sell at a premium, but you can take a GP group and kill him yourself (and you can see ahead of time if he's got the sword in his hand, so just make a habit of checking him once a day or something).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yah I've killed Glykus with 1 groupish a few times havent seen the sword yet thought. Thanks for advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">what offensive AAs do you have Casai?<br />
<br />
for me BBB is doing on average 90 DPS but spikey as hell with parses showing anywhere from 230DPS to 40DPS on XP mobs (and yeah the 230DPS was from a 30sec+ parse).<br />
<br />
My 1hs combo of Twin Blades of Sorrow main hand (15/19 +1magic damge) and BoC offhand does on average about 85DPS but is much more consistent and alot safer when it comes to not pulling agro off the MT.</div></div><hr />
