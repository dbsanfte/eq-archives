<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a MOG you have not like for the frist 2 weeks or the first free month?<br />
<br />
I have played a goodly number of MMOGs now and I even liked EVE for the first couple of weeks. Its only after the first month that people begin to get to the &quot;is this all there is?&quot; part of the game. <br />
<br />
Most reciently I can point to CoH. I and 2 of my friends all picked up the game and had a blast the first month and even signed up for a second month. But since then only one of them has gotten any more months (and he let his account lapse for a while and has just picked up the EQ platinum pack).<br />
<br />
So while we are hearing all these rave reviews of WoW--do you really think that the first month is at all a realistic review of the game?<br />
<br />
As a PS...the EQ Platinum pack is one hell of a deal for anyone starting or not upto date on EQ. EQ + all 7 current expantions (no OoW) for a mere $30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm leary of trying any more mmog's; but for reasons more than just hating the treadmills. i really liked CoH too but it just got too time-restricting to continue levelling.<br />
<br />
i'm back to EQ playing on Test when I can log on; and it's good enough to keep me doing something for a few hours and seeing friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think a month is more than enough time to decide if you like WoW or not and want to continue to subscribe. You log in, make a character, and do quests. If that's your thing, you're gonna like WoW, if that's not what you enjoy doing, then you probably won't have alot of fun. Personally I enjoy it because it doesn't feel like a treadmill. You get caught up in doing a bunch of quests and you level. Do some more quests and level again. I enjoy it a great deal, but it's not for everyone, but again, yes, I think the free month will give you ample time to decide if WoW is a game for you to continue to pay to play.</div></div><hr />

You still don't know if you will hit max level in 2 months and then have nothing to do etc.  But that still doesn't make it a bad investment if you get 2 months out of it and go back to EQ IMO.  I pay $50 for FPS games that last maybe 2 weeks, and that's with playing them in between EQ raids and such.  Kailyn makes a good point though, that you should take reviews by people that have been playing 2 days with a grain of salt.  A MMORPG isn't a game you can really know in a week or even a month, and most games seem pretty fun when you first start them but the vast majority of them don't have the staying power of EQ.  <br />
<br />
On the topic of treadmills, I have decided that's what I want in EQ.  I have no desire to race against the release date of the new expansion to try to beat the content as quickly as possible and be at the top of the EQrankings list.  I just want a game with enough content that I can log in every night always have a goal and a good excuse to play the game and have fun with my friends.  At the rate I play now there is no danger of ever running out of content to do unless they stop making expansions, and that's just fine with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A buddy of mine was in the WoW beta as soon as they signed up people outside Blizard. He liked it for a few weeks, but then played CoH for awhile until the new Doom came out, burned through Doom and is now playing around with FFXI and M:TG Online.<br />
<br />
There are no revolutionary MMoRPG's that I know of on the horizon. A different take on EQ isn't going to do it for me. About the only thing that has even a ghost of a chance would be a D&amp;D branded product with thousands of Modules - I soooo want to play Flint Fireforge's 2nd cousin twice removed (no Boom Sticks fer this Dwarf!).<br />
<br />
You youngsters are pretty lucky. The genre is in it's infancy and eventally someone is bound to put serious money and effort into making another defining product. I'm not expecting that product to be WoW, FFXI, or EQ2.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe well we were around for the second genre defining game...(I think you would have to call both Ultima and EQ are class defining.<br />
<br />
Then agian I remember that people claimed that EQ would die with the release of AO, DAoC, AC, SWG etc. While WoW might rock the EQ community a bit more than most--the most harmful thing to EQ has been EQ itself. GoD seems to have done more damage to SOE's product that anything done by anyother game yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I've played UO, EQ, SWG and FFXI, played UO for way to damn long before I got convinced EQ was teh win.  SWG and FFXI I determined I didn't like within the first 2 weeks.  So what I'm sayin is, it doesn't take me a month to determine whether I like a game or not.  Usually within a week I can say forget this or hell ya.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten to play WoW yet, so I'll hold my opinions.  The thing is I never rely on others reviews of a game, especially an mmo, everyone wants something different and there is a very slim chance that what the guy that wrote the review wants the same thing as the guy reading the review.</div></div><hr />
