<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our entire morning trial crew from yesterday is currently locked out of the main instance for us in Time. Had 2 tries at it last night using different people that had been with us in P1-3 and Saryrn the night before to start up yet none of the people that did a trial for loot after we finished can zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems pretty similar to http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2991</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Similiar but not the same as more info:<br />
<br />
We had a raid Tues night do phase 1, 2, 3, some Gods in 4 and finished for the night no problems.<br />
<br />
We had 18 people on Weds morn do Phase 1 and do 3 trials then camp.<br />
<br />
Weds evening a new raid starts up Phase 1 to get to phase 4 and kill more gods.  The people who were in the morning raid are now unable to join.  Even those these overlap the people who were there Tues night.<br />
<br />
It's as if by doing the Weds morning raid (Even though they didn't even finish Stage 1) They were branded with a different instance then they had the day before.  We can check to see if one of those morning people start the instance if everyone can zone in, but if they can, then what happens?  WIll they zone to phase 4?  Or will we have to clear 2/3 again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its not surprising that this intancing is buggy. I'd say you shouldnt let anyone do the trials for loot outside of a normal raid, just to avoid all the problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hasn't caused problems for the two weeks prior till Tuesday's patch.  Given the guilds in time if we didn't do so outside of raid hours we wouldn't see loot at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KhalimBloodhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, this is a problem on my server as well.  My guild, the only one in time atm, often would do momps (er, non official mini-raids) on Time tier one in the evening after normal raiding was finished.  Then when we went to raid Time the night after doing a momp, almost all the people who were in the raid the night before could not even get in to the trials.  The way we're figuring it is that if you begin a raid the night before, the instancing for that raid is still going the next day, but if someone who was NOT in the raid the night before zones into the trials first, it creates a new instance and locks the people who were in the &quot;old&quot; raid out.  Almost like it thinks there are two seperate raids.  <br />
<br />
This really sucks atm, because doing Tier one almost once a night was providing a fairly nice influx of loot for new members =\<br />
<br />
As well as some much needed enjoyment, heh.  <br />
<br />
So yes, this is definitely a bug, and a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe our problem is that all of our Tier1 loot rots :(<br />
<br />
When we get some newly flagged Time apps, they basically get 3-5 free Time Tier 1 loots instantly.  Only thing that doesn't rot currently is the earrings, which seem to be the most rare. So there's really no reason for us to farm Tier 1, thank god.</div></div><hr />
