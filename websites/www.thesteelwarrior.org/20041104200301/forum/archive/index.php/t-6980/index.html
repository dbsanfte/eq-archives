Can anybody with this weapon please explain your experiences with it? Like good aggro , DPS ect..... I'm really looking into getting this weapon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />

If you kill TRC you can do Time. Grab an EoE (or a JoS a bit later).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">with much better just barely around the corner i wouldnt even think of getting it.<br />

let some ranger or rog pick this puppy up and use it.<br />

if its rotting .. buy it cheap heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even augged with anger 3, I think it is a sub-par aggro weapon, and the proc adds a buff icon, which sucks nuts imo. Good toy, yes. Good DPS, yes. Good aggro, no.</div></div><hr />

When you need those buff slots, it's far from great.<br />
<br />
Edge of Eternity , Ethreal Destroyer , Darkblade of the Warlord (low chances) , or Blade of Carnage.<br />
<br />
At the level of the game where you're killing The Rathe Council and entering Time, BoC is twink gear and ED is garbage. Just my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

No, not a joke, i was referring to the Blade of Carnage's proc rate compared to the Hategivers, the Hategiver has a better procrate im nearly certain.  <br />

<br />
  This has been so completely disproven that people are simply in awe that you missed the memo. HG has the standard proc rate, just like virtually every other weapon out there. The notable exceptions from Luclin are BBotE and BF.<br />

My guild had about 10 BoWar from farming RZtW upon reaching Time. And two warriors with augmented SEWS.  Nevermind the other weapons available like BBotE, BF, HG, CHSD, GBoS... and whatever else they can't sell in the bazaar for ~400k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild had about 10 BoWar from farming RZtW upon reaching Time. And two warriors with augmented SEWS.  Nevermind the other weapons available like BBotE, BF, HG, CHSD, GBoS... and whatever else they can't sell in the bazaar for ~400k.Your guild also got to kill RZtW uncontested. Judging from how far behind other guilds on your server where at the end of 2003 you got him uncontested for quite some time. 10 BoW is also a pretty good drop rate, I would bet that the vast majority of guilds stop farming RZtW long before they get 10 BoWs. Might as well drop CHSD and GBoS from your list, neither is even in the same league as BoC and other EB weapons. You could make an arguement for BBotE (only because of proc rate), BF, and HG - but the insane drop rate and fact that most guilds abandon Luclin as soon as humanly possible makes it pretty hard to equip everyone with those weapons. There is no disputing that you would be better off with BBotE, HG, BF, or BoW in place of a BoC, but that simply is not the case for everyone. BoC is so much more common and easy to get that it doesn't make sense to hold up guild progression to keep farming for those weapons when you get much better in Time anyway.<br />
<br />
BoC works well enough to get you in to Time and you get to sell it for way too much when you upgrade. What's so wrong with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wasn't in Hoss at the time, I was on Morell-Thule, and my previous guild was the second there to kill RZtW (not counting the defunct Asian guild who technically was 2nd). He was always very contested. Took over 30 kills to get that many BoWar, but we consciously farmed BoWar for our warriors (to upgrade their CHSDs, BoCs, BBotEs, and even BFs) - the drop rate is far superior to that of BF/HG, and the weapon is far superior to BoC. RZtW script is also enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The other two elemental guilds on the server farmed RZtW for BoWs, too. Fury's Edge had 10 or so, Triune had 10 or so, Reviction probably has around 10 or so now. I wouldn't be surprised if the guilds killing him now have 10 or so each<br />
<br />
drop CHSD and GBoS from your list, neither is even in the same league as BoC<br />
<br />
Not the same league? I think you're giving BoC way too much credit. And you said it yourself, you get to sell it for way too much. Why not sell it for way too much while you're weilding something similar, and use the plat for other needed upgrades? Most BoC-weilding warriors I've known do exactly that; plat now &gt; plat later.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the topic is SoPP. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Anyway, the topic is SoPP. =pGood point. By the time you have the chance to loot one, you are very likely a couple of weeks from the opportunity to loot much better. EoE is pretty common and most guilds are killing Saryrn within a week or 2 of entering Time. No point wasting merit/DKP on a SoPP when you can get an EoE instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Rathe isnt always the last step for guilds for PoTime anymore sometimes its coirnav (But your right regardless, by time you Get Rathe down its better to wait for and EoE/JoS or imo even a VDD, let rangers or some other class take SoPP!<br />
<br />
 I think we had like 6-7 BoW's in like 18 kills, but we also had a few warriors with BoC's when we got into time. BoC + A3 + a suitable offhand (or BoC in offhand with EoE/JoS (a3) or something mainhand) work pretty well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Anlas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm using an Anger III auged EoE in mainhand and unauged SoPP in offhand, and I'm pretty content with the aggro. I realize most of the aggro comes from the auged EoE, but a SoPP is nice DPS. And it not only procs a rune, but a 80hps heal as well. The heal is nice for farming stuff, solo'ing etc.<br />
<br />
For MTing it isn't the ideal combination, mainly because of the lack of aggro on the SoPP and the extra buff, but you can tank with it and hold aggro pretty well.<br />
<br />
What most people seem to forget is the fact that with dual-wielding you're gonna need two 1-handers  :eek: The chances of a person getting an EoE or JOS and DBoTW within a few weeks are slim, so picking up a SoPP to fill up one of the spots until you get an EoE/JOS and a DBoTW is actually a pretty good option  ;) <br />
<br />
I couldn't find what weapons you're wielding right now, but if you're wielding a Bloodfrenzy or something else that would go well with an EoE or even a DBoTW, you might consider passing on the SoPP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26973<br />
<br />
any guild capable of downing TRC shouldnt have any problems moving through disscord to this point.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt waist raid pts or whatever u use for this weapon. if its not dbow, eoe, bf, or jos i wouldnt bother. stick too a good 2her auged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I wouldn't mind a SoPP for exp groups with a dps aug in it.  I wouldn't use it on raids unless it was a dispell fight or something though.  The buff bar filling up is a problem often enough that I wouldn't want to worry about a weapon proc blocking DI because I'm dotted and have AE heals on me or something.<br />
<br />
The only real upgrade to a BoC pre-time is a bloodfrenzy or a blade of war, and even if you have a BF you have to offhand something.  There are plenty of weapons in between that will &quot;work&quot; but not worth spending DKP on if you have a BoC imo.  Elemental planes warriors won't be buying upgrades in the bazaar in most cases, so selling your best aggro offhander for plat seems pretty silly to me but people do silly things all the time.  Anyone that sells a BoC to use a CHSD should be shot.<br />
<br />
Considering the drop rate of the frenzy/hategiver compared to the BoC it's not at all suprising that people wield a BoC well into time.  Hell I know a warrior that retired from Triton not too long ago and he has Quarm loot but offhands a BoC.  If your guild doesn't farm Rallos, which a lot of guilds don't, then the old BoC is as good as anything else before time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well some of us DO know about the agro-holding weapons that you guys keep mentioning... BoC, BoW, BF, etc. etc.   BUT, im still curious as to how SoPP + anger3 performs... so please lets skip bout the lecture bout what DKP to spend, what to wait for, etc. etc.    I JUST wanna know first hand information on an SoPP auged with anger3.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I like the graphics of this sword, and Im all about the looks... and thats one of the main reason why I still want this sword.  I got an auged EoE already, and wud like to get a cool looking sword to match it... DBoTW is a weapon I also want, problem is Im like the 5th warrior in line for it, I dont wanna wait, and I still dont like the graphics of it.   Maybe with an anger3-ed SoPP, I can look good for the ladies and still hold agro while tanking LOL. and oh, I got WA5, so no worries bout proc rate, and my EoE is auged with Ykesha (125DD+stun).  Also, JoS (glowing stick graphic) looks lame on a warrior... so I kinda dont like it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well it's not too tough to figure out how much aggro it's gonna be.  It's a good dps weapon with a fairly low aggro proc.  A little higher than something like a ifir, a little less than your EoE.  Anger III works the same no matter what weapon it's in.  I'm sure you will be able to hold aggro with this combo.  I'm also sure it will be less aggro than say a Bloodfrenzy and BoC with Anger III.</div></div><hr />
