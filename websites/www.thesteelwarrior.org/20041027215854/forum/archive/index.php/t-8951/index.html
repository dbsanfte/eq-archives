<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">recently my friends' bot squads have aquired a SoS rogue and 2 coth bots (we might make more) and a rez stick.. i was wondering which VT named can you easily set coth to and kill with minimal amounts of clearing... i know for sure one of the diabos has 1 roamer in the coth spot then he's in room alone.. and i assume theres other like this.  any infos would be much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The first blob is perma rooted, so you can coth to that room for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doing a VT named with one group, god that must take forever... Keep in mind you have to kill certain named to despawn the warders that protect named deeper in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, every named in VT is easily 6 mannable by crew of time+ characters, the issue is that more often than not the named might be 6 mannable, but it is impossible to clear up to him with 6 people, or have a safe CoH spot.<br />
<br />
The following mobs have 'obvious' CoH spots that do not require clearing warders to get too.<br />
<br />
DXV is trivial to 6 man.<br />
DXXT is trivial to 6 man<br />
DXX is trivial to 6 man <br />

Hide in the hallway besides the named room invis, time the roamer roaming away and Coh while roaming is away :)</div></div><hr />
