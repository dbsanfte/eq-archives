<br />
Anyone have any parces?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah had a cleric tank Andad filla in sro, and then I tanked him for a while after.<br />
<br />
- Min hit the same on warrior and cleric.<br />
<br />
- Max hit on me vs cleric did match up to 1 less DI<br />
<br />
- The absolute numbers I got hit for versus what the cleric got hit for were indeed different so it is not DI-1, or 20-&gt;19. I could not get the rounding to match up exactly though, and I think I deleted the logs recently. But generally I think its just DI*0.95(or close enough to not worry about it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
So say a Valorian Guard min hit is 122 vs a monk with no shielding.  Then it would be 1 *DI * 0.95 + DB or 22 * 0.95 + 100 = about 121.  But at max it would be 20 * 22 * 0.95 + 100 or 518.  Compared to 540 on a monk.  <br />
<br />
Of course that is just an example.  There are some rounding involved.  But the more you get hit for, the better it is.  ANd if you get hit for min, you won't see much of a difference.<br />
<br />
Basically it is just like a mini defensive.  It modifies the DI of a mob by 5% compared to the 50% of defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you using monk as an 'any other class' comparison? If so, that is a bad example because monks have a separate mitigation computation, different than any other class and the worst of all classes (believe me I have tested, my 62 cleric takes less max damage sitting than my monk standing and facing versus the same mob).<br />
<br />
Don't believe me? Go to monkly business and ask about the mitigation nerf, just make sure to wear your flame-retardant suit.<br />
<br />
So use something like beastlord since they are more inline with 'average' mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That isn't true.  Under normal conditions max hit is the same for all classes just as minimum.  DI and DB is the same and isn't class specific.  The distribution of hits however IS class specific.  And yes, monks are very poor when it comes to the effectiveness of their AC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">am curious to see however if this increase the number of max hits.<br />
And in theory it should.<br />
Removing 1 DI Value, will mean that the number of hits of that DI value <br />
will now have to be distributed between the remain DI values.<br />
Keeping however the usual distribution scheme.<br />
You will get more max hits, but that max hit will be lower.<br />
<br />
Now as for the real % ...<br />
<br />
You get a 5% DI reduction if the mob hits for max every time.<br />
You get a 0% DI reduction if the mob hits for min every time.<br />
<br />
huh?  You aren't removing 1 DI value.  <br />
<br />
All it is doing is multiplying the DI of a mob by 0.95.<br />
<br />
Min hit is DB + DI<br />
Max hit is DB + 20 * DI.<br />
<br />
Now if the normal DI is 100 then for a warrior it will now be 95.  And while defensive it will be 50.  The distribution of hits won't change at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah my bad :) <br />
Hasnt hit European servers yet so didnt get a chance to really look at it.<br />
<br />
Deleting the post since its based on a wrong idea.<br />
Thx for the correction.<br />
<br />
For a mob like FR ( DB=1000 DI=45)<br />
<br />
Before the Patch : Min = 1045  Max= 1900<br />
After the Patch : Min = 1043 Max = 1855<br />
<br />
Thats from 0.2% (min hit) to 2.36% (max hit)<br />
<br />
Which leads to 2 things :<br />
- The higher the mobs DB is the less effective the bonus will be<br />
- The higher the mobs DI will be the more effective the bonus will be<br />
- On low ATK mobs, the bonus loses a lot of its interest<br />
- On high ATK mobs, the bonus is at its best potential<br />
<br />
On Valor Trash (DB=200 DI=25 ?)<br />
Before the Patch : Min=225 Max=700<br />
After the Patch : Min=224 Max=675<br />
<br />
Thats from 0.44% (min hit) to 3.57% (max hit)<br />
<br />
2% Overall DPS reduction seems very generous to me.<br />
Since we see more min hits than anything else during tanking sessions.<br />
1% yeah at most 1.5% on some really weird mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said I haven't actually sat down and compare hits and shielding does make things a bit more annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish people would stop calling it a 5% mitigation bonus, because its nowhere near 5%.<br />
<br />
1-20 to 1-19, or 19s to 20s...  Either way, the innate mitigation gets less effective the more AC you have.  The latter would make the innate mitigation even less effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5% mitigation bonus doesn't mean that you will see a 5% reduction in damage.  So, calling it a 5% mitigation bonus is correct.<br />
<br />
The amount of damage taken is less than 5%, for reasons already pointed out in this post.<br />
<br />
&quot;The 5% mitigation works against the hit - the DB.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's definitely a modification to DI, not DB.  Look at the FR numbers posted in this thread.  If it were a DB modification, then FR's new min/max hit would be 995/1850.  The real new min/max is 1043/1855, which corresponds exactly to a 5% reduction in the interval value (the random 1-20 multiplied against DI).<br />
<br />
&quot;Multiplying DI by 0.95 has the same result as minus 1 DI on max hit since 20DI becomes 19DI when you multiply it by 0.95&quot;<br />
<br />
For the max hit, you're right.  It's not really just -1 from the interval, tho.  If it were, then min hit would be exactly DB, which it isn't.<br />
<br />
The warrior damage formula becomes<br />
<br />
Min hit: DB + .95DI<br />
Max Hit: DB + 19DI<br />
<br />
They reduced the random 1-20 by 5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erhh .. don't you mean :<br />
<br />
Min hit: DB + 1 * (DI *0,95)<br />
Max Hit: DB + 20 * (DI *0,95)<br />
<br />
Or in short for all the values :<br />
DMG = DB + RND(20) * (DI * 0,95)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind you, there is still some fuzzyness here and there, but according to my parses pre mitigation changes, 97% of all hits I took, fit into the DMG = DB + RND(20) * DI formula.<br />
<br />
There was some hits that deviated from those values thuogh, but I never managed to figure out the formula for the deviations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, calling it a 5% mitigation bonus is not correct, because DI is only a portion of the damage of the hit.<br />
<br />
EVEN if you exclude the DB, it would still not be 5%, because if it really was DI * .95, the min hit would change, like it does under defensive, and it does not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The minimum hit does change.  What are you talking about?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is my opinion that they simply changed the DI range from rnd(20) to rnd(19) for warriors.  This is based on analysing my logs of VT clearings from before the patch, and after the patch.  This included trash mobs and bosses.  In all cases, the minimum hits were the same, and the max hits where in line with the &quot;DI capped at 19&quot; theory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting theory has that would mean less of a bonus than what we thought.  We've been thinking it's 5% off the DI.  What you're describing is closer to 2.5%.  The average roll on a rnd(19) would be 10.  The average on rnd(20) would be 10.5.  The difference, 0.5, would be divided by the total possible variance in the DI multiplier (20 - 1 = 19), so 0.5 / 19 = 2.63%.  So if you are correct, our DI advantage is a mere 2.63%.  <br />
<br />
Niir and Anker's formulas would both change the minimum hit.  So if the min hit has NOT changed, they are incorrect.</div></div><hr />

Throwing this quote out, for reference purposes:<br />
Originally posted by Kavhok <br />
It (defensive) operates in almost the same way.  Instead of reducing the damage interval by half, it reduces it by 45%.  The other 5% comes from the innate warrior mitigation that also went in.  You will take the same damage while in defensive that you did before the patch. <br />
And the LUCY description of defensive:<br />
Defensive Discipline<br />
<br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Increase Melee Mitigation by 45%<br />
2: 	Decrease Damage Modifier by 55%<br />
3: 	Chance to Critical Hit(0)<br />
Mebbe some reference of value there; I've drawn my own conclusions which work so far for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed the min hit changing, tho, so I dunno what to say.  If it turns out that it hasn't changed, then yes, the 'new' formula needs to be reworked.  But just from looking at various logs, what I've seen matches exactly a 5% reduction in DI.<br />
<br />
&quot;Min hit: DB + 1 * (DI *0,95)<br />
Max Hit: DB + 20 * (DI *0,95)&quot;<br />
<br />
Uh, you said exactly what I said :)  The only difference is if they do all this in integer math, and round the DI calc down before multiplying by the interval part.  Then you'd see a difference of up to whatever the random interval value was between the two.<br />
<br />
But, with floating point math, <br />
<br />
DB + 20 * (DI * .95) is the same as<br />
DB + 20 * (.95 * DI) which is the same as <br />
DB + (20 * .95) * DI since multiplication is both commutative and associative, and since 20 * .95 is 19, all that equals <br />
<br />
DB + 19DI<br />
<br />
The same holds for the other 19 values.<br />
<br />
Virtually all the deviations from the 'accepted' formula that I've seen were due to kicks or bashes, or due to the person taking the damage having some sort of rune-spell up.</div></div><hr />
