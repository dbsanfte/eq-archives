<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friends have started a war of sorts by playing pranks on each other. There are basically two &quot;teams&quot; of us who are pranking against the &quot;members&quot; of the other &quot;team.&quot; I use the quotes because alliances are shifty except for a few solid allegiances.<br />
<br />
Here's the history of our little war:<br />
<br />
We have all been hitting random people together for awhile now, but the current war arose about a month ago a girl named Monica started talking smack to myself and my friend Colin in our Art class. At this time I was on the same side as Monica, and before this happened, myself, Monica and other people toilet-papered Colin's house and Monica and I also shoepolished his car at another time. Colin and I made peace over what I did to him by me helping to get Monica back, and I owed her too because she broke our alliance by flouring my car (dumped flour all over it and scribbled on the windows with shoepolish, its a bitch to clean if you try to hose it off). So Colin and I set into  motion a plan to get even (err, tip the scales in our favor) by pulling a huge prank on Monica. We planned it for about 3 weeks and even got her boyfriend to help by taking her to a movie (his job was to get her car to his house and then get her away. Monica's parents sit outside on the porch alot and Monica's car actually belongs to her dad so we couldn't do it with their being a chance of them seeing. Her boyfriend, Garrett, went as far as to tell Monica that he left his lights on all night and needed her to jump him) Once Monica's car was where it needed to be and they were well away, Garrett texted Colin saying &quot;ok&quot; and Colin and I, with about 7 other people, drove over and wrapped her car with 800 meters of Saran Wrap and finished it off with some shoepolish.<br />
<br />
You can see our handywork at my team's website here. (http://www28.brinkster.com/l33tpranx0rz) 800 meters is quite alot of Saran Wrap. (PS, thats me on the left of the pic on the homepage with my sleeves rolled up).<br />
<br />
Obviously, after that happened, Monica wanted revenge. Her plan was to round up a few big guys (I'm on the wrestling team, and she had a Heavyweight and the 215 lber enlisted along with another huge football player) along with Garrett (152 lber) to kidnap us and then do something else (I think it involved stripping us and dropping us off in a public place). Last night, we were all planning to go to Hooter's (minus Colin) and when I opened the door, 6 people jumped me. Luckily, all 3 of the big guys backed out (they were afraid of teh me~) and it was just Garrett, another friend who is about the same size as us, and 4 girls. They brought with them some cable ties and managed to get one around my feet, but I broke it. I was starting to get out when my dad came in and asked what they were doing to me and told em not to break any furniture since we were thrashing around alot. They claim they didn't get me because my dad intervened, but I know it was because I was already on the way out of their 6-person lock when he came. If the 3 big guys had come, however, I'd have been screwed. So, after their failed kidnap attempt (from which I still have cable tie burns) I was pissed at them and I left a warning message on Colin's cell telling him to be wary of those girls.<br />
<br />
And now we are at today, about a month and a half after the initial incident, and the ball is in our court. I am sure they still plan to get Colin, as they weren't able to kidnap him that night because it didn't work on me, but we need a plan, and I need your help coming up with some creative, possibly painful, but definitely humiliating methods of payback. Pranks at school are not an option as next week is the last week.. exam week.. and people will be in and out of school at random times because of exemptions. We have called houses and cars off limits because [a] Monica's truck still has some red residue from the shoepolish we used when wrapping her car and the other girl has no car (neither do I, but Colin does) [b] the other girl's parents are tight-assed old asian's and would actually call the police if their house was toilet papered, and Colin's house and car have already been hit, and so has my car (my dad's van actually, heh). <br />
<br />
So, I need prank ideas that do not involve cars or houses (however, we might be able to get into their bedrooms and do something to at least one of the girls). Spending money wouldn't be a problem, as long as its not a ridiculous amount, but $20 on each girl would be well worth it. If you have any questions or want some more detail or whatever just ask and I will provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One good way to get back at least at that girl whos room you can get into is this. Pour a glass of milk on the bedspring matress part of her bed so she wont feel any wetness. Its getting warmer now so in a week she will start noticing an awful odor. I dont even want to think about what it will take to get rid of the smell. Or if one of the girls is really dim and works at a place where she pages people over the loudspeaker, you could always call in a request to page a Mike Hunt :D  Hmm, you said no cars, too bad I got a good one. Cover her car with wet sloppy mud. If she tries to just wipe it off, she will scratch the hell out of her paint job from all the dried sand and pebbles that gets mixed in with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We don't want anything that causes lasting damage like scratched paint or ruined mattresses.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind the targets are two girls, both 17. They are both athletic and tough enough to withstand a little pain. Monica's parents are cool and might even help as long as we don't damage anything, but the other girl's parents are on the total opposite end of the spectrum and would not see anything funny, making the attack on her best suited for something in a public place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gerick.. super glue on a door is an attack on their car or house which violates our truce, which opens us up to attack on our cars and houses which we want to avoid, plus the reasons above.<br />
<br />
And Kiya.. tsk tsk you know you had fun doing much the same thing when you were younger! Share some of your wisdom :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, you could always do things like nailing their purses to a bench or something if they leave them for awhile. Its good for a quick laugh as long as they arent really expensive purses. Or alternately, fill them up with some washable glue and ask for a tissure or something.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, the last one I did just to see the expression on their face was with a video camera.  What I did was took a video camera and taped the main bathroom.  Nothing inside the bathroom what so ever.  Did this for about 10 mins, making sure to get the toilet area.<br />
<br />
Once the intended victim went to use the bathroom I popped the tape I made earlier of the bathroom in the VCR.  She came back out and we were laughing at the TV.  So wondering what we were laughing at she looks at the screen, and turned bright red in the face.  Tore into that bathroom looking for some hidden camera in the wall.<br />
<br />
Never heard so much cussin in that few minutes that I normally do in a day at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fun? No, I didn't.  The one time I TP'd a house, I could not sit for week after my mom got done with me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Russian Pranks from my teens<br />
<br />
stuff you learn in pioneer camp<br />
<br />
- switch toothpaste with something nasty that comes in tubes of same type I think we once substituted that for black shoe polish. Was nice to see that smile<br />
- put ants in the dressing draw one with panties works best<br />
- put a bee or bumble bee in the car<br />
- hide an alarm that goes off at sunrise<br />
- multi-purpose - mice/frogs spiders are not recommended since they are too hard to notice.<br />
- sneak into girls dorm and put their hand in luke warm watter...<br />
<br />
cant remember anything else. Except once my friend who was 11 at a time found an empty vodka bottle half filled it with water and wobbled around with it in hand for our the dorm chaperon. That was hilarious.<br />
Oh another good one I heard from my friend. Someone had a pet baby python in school and he had let it warp itself around his arm. In Russia in each school desk sits two, so when our girl classmate came to take a sit next to him and he put his arm on the table.... It was priceless.<br />
<br />
Stuff I just made up:<br />
- put a dildo somewhere so parents/friends can find it or some other nasty sex toy or lube</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Of course as soon as pranks are talked about I get hit by one.  It was an e-mail postcard from a buddy of mine, that when I opened it I thought it crashed my computer.  Got the blue screen of death...then got a pop-up asking to re-build my database.  Clicking on that caused a small amount of nekked women t ospawn all over my screen.  Didn't help matters I had the volume up when this happened.<br />

Finally found where he got it from.<br />
