<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnowm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I feel the need to vent after the last few nights of idiocy. <br />
<br />
I 2box a 55 warrior &amp; 55 cleric, I invited my 55 rogue friend &amp; searched the /lfg window for more. I invite a 56 druid, 52 chanter &amp; 57 pally &amp; we decide to head off to Sebilis. The druid &amp; chanter dont know how to get to Sebilis &amp; appently dont know how to auto follow &amp; get lost multiple time. We finally make it to the zone in bubble &amp; the druid says, &quot;sorry something came up I have to log&quot; .  Well there goes snare &amp; evac. We zone in &amp; begin killing &amp; make do with root &amp; stun to take care of the runners. I put &quot;Sebilis Group looking for SNARER&quot; in the LFG window&quot; &amp; get a tell from a 58 necro, I tell her to come on down. It takes us about 10 min to fight down to the bug camp when we get there the chanter announces, &quot;well its getting late, I gotta log&quot; WTF did you join for!!! So now we are down to my warrior, cleric, the pally &amp; the rogue, we fight back up to zone in to wait for the necro. The necro joins us &amp; I tell her the importance of snare in this zone. Well the very 1st frog we pull start to run off at sow speed, luckily we manage to root it &amp; kill it off. Necro; &quot;sorry was changing spells&quot;.  I think, ok np it happens. We fight back down to bugs, a frog again runs off at sow speed aggro's 4 more frogs, we kill off the train my warrior dying in the process.<br />
<br />
me: &quot;snare??&quot;<br />
necro :  silence<br />
<br />
I rez my warrior &amp; rebuff &amp; we beginning pulling again. 2 kills later another FUCKING RUNNER!!@@# we didnt manage to catch this frog &amp; it pulled a huge train down on us killing the necro at bugs &amp; rogue who died just before zone out. My warrior cleric &amp; the pally managed to zone out.  <br />
<br />
me: &quot;jesus christ is it that hard to snare!!!&quot;<br />
necro:  &quot;it resisted&quot;<br />
<br />
Now if you knew you only job in the group was to snare wouldnt you try snaring at 50% &amp; not 20% when the mob is already starting to run???<br />
<br />
So now its up to my cleric warrior &amp; the pally to do the CR.<br />
<br />
me: can u guys consent me please?<br />
<br />
rogue gives consent<br />
<br />
nothing from the necro<br />
<br />
Well we manage to fight down to the corpses but it takes about 30min, the whole time me asking for consent from the necro ( her corpse was closer &amp; I could of rezzed her in to help CR the rogue ) as I'm rezzing the rogue...<br />
<br />
Necro: &quot;sorry I went AFK to make dinner&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
GRRRRRRRRRRRR<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My best expirience was in BoT. I was puller and tank for lower water group. The other member were druid (group leader), cleric, rogue, wizard and chanter (2 boxed by wizard). Everythign was fine, but then I announced I would need to leave soon. Since I am pulling an tanking would someone find a replacement for me, so I don;t have to slow exp for the group to stop and send tells. All is good until we find out the group leader invited a rogue to replace me. Needless to say the group split up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. this should be in outhouse/tavern<br />
<br />
2. rogues can tank in bot depens on the gear ofcourse and they do produce decent agro without evade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NhuakofBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have you all beat !....  the other night i was playing Nhuak my 48 warrior. I have a number of 65 toons 1 a  ranger with  VT/elemental gear and 425 aa needless to say i do know the game.   Well  anyways I dont mind how others play their class as long as they do some resemblance of what their class should be.  IE the  cleric  actually  heals  the  melee  actually  attack  .. and so  on .    Well I get  into this Mistmoore Catacombs Adventure. Groups is 50  Enchanter, 47 Shaman,  51 Cleric, 48 Warrior, 47 beastlord, 52 beastlord.   Sounds like almost the ideal group  right??....  No..<br />
<br />
The enchanter is pulling  and mezzing  and  stuff and doing a  all around  killer  job tossing in nukes  and  stuff when mana allows.   :cool: <br />
<br />
The  cleric at first  started out  chain healing me with  superior heal....  I  then  announce to the cleric that i was  &quot;raid buffed&quot;  and had 5500 hp or there about.  and that  i  wasnt  scared  of dying  that she could use Cheal.  Which  she  refused and  told me that it is  unsafe when  pulling  singles to  let the tank get under  80 %  health /boggle ...  :confused: <br />
<br />
I have a  65 shaman  who had  buffed the  group  so the  shammy  didnt  need to buff.  he has  his pet out and  was dotting and  such.. but not slowing.    :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The 47  beastlord had his pet out and  was  assisting me  waiting  3 to 5  sec  then  heading in to melee.  he was  either  procing or  casting  dots/nukes, and never  grabbed agro off me  .  he was just like the  chanter  doing a killer  job.   :cool: <br />
<br />
The  52 beastlord was standing the entire time in the back of the group No  pet  a  shield in one hand  and a  weapon in the other.  this is where it gets good.  The  beastlord was the one  slowing .. supposedly. He  refused to melee , said  assist  is  worthless, said  he new for a fact that  medding did nothing, refused to  attack the mob in any way. The entire time   yelling that he was oom and that we needed to stop to wait for him.  He was  also  the  looter of the  group, and  took off with all the  loot.  Not that  it is much at that level nor that i  care  about any  loot, but it is the principal of it.  He  also had no idea  what  spiritual light or that line of spells was at all. :eek:  :mad: <br />
<br />
Sorry   for the  essay  but that was about the  worst group  i can ever remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The most special group I was recently part of was in BoT (this was the last time I was in BoT).  I forget the classes, but it turned out to be the greediest group I have ever seen.  They wanted to KS all the named in the tower that were up, there were like three.  We killed the one in our area.  Then  we heard that another camp opens in /ooc, so we motor (along with 5 other groups in the zone) to the new camp and it becomes a real feces fest of stupidity.  People train us, our puller trains them.  A new camp gets invented, and supposedly the other groups are ok with us being there.  I had smelt the foul stench of 13 year old ass hats, and I knew something was wrong.  Well, our puller pulls a named from one of the &quot;real&quot; camps there.  We kill it, and it drops ornate silk sleaves.  I decide at that point if I win it, I'll take it to the people who'se camp it came from.  <br />
<br />
Well, when the rolling starts, one of the people (a necro I think) throws a shit fit that a plate class is rolling on silk items.  We debate, and he begrudingly lets me roll for it (against his better judgement!).  I loose them, and decided that before I get trained again by the angry group who'se name we had killed, I should leave.<br />
<br />
They were just a negative loot-whoring group of whinners.  I've now swore off BoT forever =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, the worst group I was in wasn't quite as bad as some of these and actually it turned into one of the coolest groups ever.  It was an LDoN group in while I was in my mid-40's.  Group consisted of Enchanter (friend) Necro (friend) Bard (probably 15 years old) Shaman (probably 10 years old) and another melee that I can't recall.<br />
<br />
We got to the zone-in and the other melee goes LD, never to return (hence why I can't remember the class).  So, we figure oh well, we still have 5 and it is a mid-40's normal so should be no problem.  We zone in and within 8 kills the Shaman says 'I have to go now my dad says it's my bedtime.' Ummmmmm, ok, at this point we had collected about 5 of the 25 needed so we decided to trudge on and see what we could do.  That was the bad part, we went from a group that probably could have finished the LDoN in 30 minutes to a group that would be lucky to finish an LDoN at all.<br />
 <br />
This is where the group got good though.  I decide that the Enchanter and I would pull so that the bard can stay in range of the Necro for regen/mana song.  That and the Enchanter and I pull quite often and work very well together so I felt better about that than I did about having a bard whom had questionable pulls earlier in the adventure do it when we were on such a short time schedule.  <br />
 <br />
Somehow between the enchanters slow, the bards regen song, the necro chaining his gimpy heal and me binding wound we were able to finish the adventure with 4 minutes left and preserve my then perfect LDoN record.<br />
 <br />
------<br />
 <br />
Just thought of another one, a little shorter.  Joined a MM LDoN in mid-30's, at beginning of LDoN the cleric said to the group looting will be NBG and we will roll and split anything we get after the adventure, anybody has a problem with this leave now.  Nobody said anything.  <br />
 <br />
During the course of the LDoN a little 4 wis 6 str 25 hp 25 mana earring drops.  We get done with LDoN and another warrior in the group (Jukkor, I'll never forget you) says ok, roll on earring.  Cleric says this is a significant upgrade for me and links a 2 wis earring.  <br />
 <br />
The other warrior proceeds to make the biggest fuss I've ever seen.  He claims that he never said he was ok with the looting rules and that nobody ever does NBG.  While he and the others were arguing this I went back and looked at my log file and he specifically agreed to the looting rules.  So I brought that up and he finally gives up, disbands and shouts OOC you guys just lost the greatest friend you would ever have.  Been hanging with the cleric and bard from that group ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My worst grouping experience happened in 3 zones actually.<br />
<br />
Ok, its me(65 warrior),and a 65berzerker,65cleric,65chanter,65necro,65paladin.<br />
<br />
We started off in BoT doing Icestorm Tower(The one you need key to get into).<br />
<br />
We were doing great there, but we decided difficulty was stupid for the exp we were getting. So we debate and decide that we will go to Sol Ro. Now, I was puller for this group, and am not that great of a puller in Sol Ro, so i decide to let the Necro Pull in Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
We get there, and kill a few mob,Necro doing an all around good job. Then we get 4 mobs at our group, and I am thinking &quot;Wtf is this&quot;. I ask the necro if FD failed, and he simply replies. &quot;O, I didn't know i had 4 mobs, I woulda FDed if i would have seen them&quot;. Simple mistake, so we have the necro kite the 4(Or attempt to, doing a very bad job of it) while the cleric heals him so he doesn't die. And everyone else gates out. Cleric and Necro then gate out.<br />
<br />
So, then we decide to head to Vxed. With this group, should be very easy. Now, we havn't doubted the chanter, because he is a very good enchanter from what we have seen.We get to Vxed all in one peice, and Tell chanter that he needs to charm a pooka, and he agrees he will.Well, the first Pooka we get is a blue one to us, and he charms it. So necro pulls a Hynid. Well, 20seconds aftetr the pooka is charmed, and we are in mid fight with Hynid. Pooka charm comes undone and kills chanter with lighting fast speed. So now we have a hasted pooka, and an unslowed Hynid to deal with. No problem really, we have a great cleric, and Paladin is offtanking the Hynid(Was at around 50ish% hp). He is going down to 20% alot but, keeps getting heal back up, while I am tanking the Pooka, which is quite literally Kicking my ass.So, i throw on the Old king Tormax axe, and Hit Furious. Just then, the Cleric grabs agro from the Hynid, gets down to 30% hp and the pooka agros on the cleric. The Paladin luckily got LoH off, and Cleric lived. Pally gets agro on ynid again, I grab agro on Pooka again, everything going great when the Chater tells group&quot;Sorry guys, i gotta log&quot;. Then the cleric zones.<br />
<br />
/w all random_cleric_01<br />
random_Cleric_01 is in PoK, she tells group&quot;Sorry guys, i gotta go&quot; then leaves group. So now we have to zone out. O and btw, Berserker has been afk for like 30minutes in Vxed, and dies from the train. <br />
<br />
So cleric, after senseing she might be in danger, log, chanter logs after he dies. Berserker dies from a train, and gets royally pissed, And Now weonly have a Warrior/Paladin/Necro.<br />
<br />
So Necro announces that this was the worst group he has ever been in, and could solo in Vxed, if it wasn't for us asshats.(I later found out the REAL Necro's Brother had logged onto his acct and started F-Ing with stuff).<br />
Paladin gets pissed at me because i lost agro on Pooka, causing Cleric to leave. When i mentioned he lost agro on Hynid first, he got pissed at me, and Left group(He was a guildy, who later that night Guild Removed himself) So basicly. Was all around bad experince and worst groupage i have ever done. Granted I did make a few mistakes, but nothing Major~<br />
<br />
Sorry for Ze long post, heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i had a ldon group the other night that just fucking scared me lol<br />
<br />
group was me, 65 druid, 64 shammy 2 65 necros and some other class, i forget what, but not a vital class by any means-zone is miraguls<br />
<br />
got adv and a couple of us notice its a hard and we are like umm wtf?<br />
<br />
druid says, &quot;i was told to get a hard, i dont care what we do&quot;<br />
<br />
shammy says &quot;umm i cant slow hard&quot;<br />
necro 1 says &quot;i dont have my 65 pet yet&quot; (found his magelo well under 2k hp unbuffed)<br />
<br />
necro 2 goes on to argue that we can do a hard thats undead heavy cuz we got 2 necs to help slow and necros can offtank adds with heals to pet (couldnt find his magelo, but dont remember him in a ele+ guild and he looked liek he had a zland heart in hand which in necro terms equals a lamentation or maybe a frostbringer. you know, it was cool at one time, but now its a situational toy at best and only gimps equip it as a normal item)<br />
<br />
i point out that i have an elemental geared necro with 340+ aa and oddly i dont think my pet ever offtanked mobs that hit for 900 for more than a few seconds no matter who was healing him and that miraguls is NOT an undead heavy dungeon, there are a few skellies but mostly its live<br />
<br />
necro2 contines to argue that we should do hard and the druid seems to think we can do it too (ive grouped with her before and i wasnt impressed on normals) me shammy and whoever te mystery member was leave adv and convice the rest to do so<br />
<br />
druid gets normal adv then buffs us and says &quot;lets just zone in and kill&quot;<br />
so i zoned in, then she is like umm im oom why did you zone in?<br />
<br />
she then denied even saying &quot;lets zone in&quot; til we force her to scroll up and read her own fucking typing<br />
<br />
necro2 who was sooo sure we could do hard, is now freaking out that we might lose 5 minutes while the druid buffs and this will cause us to lose the normal<br />
<br />
i point out that if a 5 min delay means we will lose a normal we had absofuckinglutleyzero chance of doing a hard with no real cc and no cleric<br />
<br />
first pull necro1 pulls aggro off me and starts kiting the mob. im like wtf are you doing and he said FD failed. all i can do at this point is cry<br />
<br />
we did manage to finish the adv but it was just a normal, if you dont finish those you had some truly fucked op folks in yer party or a lot of loooong linkdeaths<br />
<br />
next installment i will tell you about the ench who didnt mezz adds til after they killed the lone healer in the group-every pull with adds without fail. sge also would ae mez shit on inc, then not bother to single mezz ANY of them til after ae wore off and they were beating on someone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was on an open Vox raid recently.<br />
I see that a raid is forming up, send tell asking if they can use a 52 war (yep, he's been waiting to raid Vox, heh, because I've never done it before). They say come on.<br />
I don't know the raidleader, but he is a member of a guild I've had very good experiences with, so I'm encouraged. We have an unfortunately high % of melee, maybe not enough clerics and those we have are pretty low level, and we have a low % of nukers, and since it's pick-up things take a while to get organized, but eh, everything looks okay to me. I watch raidleader and gradually become convinced he knows quite well what he's doing. He is dogged and patient and has killed Vox before. Despite how things turn out, I'd fight with him again anytime.<br />
We go to Perma, get some instructions at zone-in. Among the instructions: no pets. One raidmember starts arguing. Raidleader is busy, of course (we're not in final groups yet, people are still getting there, asking where is Permafrost, blah blah) so he says Look, I can't expain everything, this is the rule on pets, if you think it's so bad you can't raid, leave, if you want to raid, stay and follow the rule. Others in raid offer explanations, etc. Raidmember is pissed, though.<br />
We go to King's Room. Instruction: do not go beyond double doors (beyond this are ice giants, btw, then Vox's lair). We're disbanding from temp groups and getting final group assignments before buffage and suddenly pissed raidmember appears with giants in tow. Mass barfight. I'm ungrouped at the time &amp; tanking as many giants as I can get to play with me. <br />
Then Vox comes through the wall into the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; I think. &quot;Come to me dragon. Come to me now.&quot; <br />
<br />
So briefly I tank her, get feared, fear wears off, giants kill me, then raidwipe.<br />
Raidleader boots member who trained the raid. This pisses the character off even more. Re-forming takes a bit of time, so I run back and am naked just inside Perma when pissed character arrives at zoneline with giant. I commence to tank giant naked, though have some problems holding aggro barefisted, lol. Everyone at the zoneline at the time, naked or not, pitches in (except pissed character, who I think zones to clear her aggro). We kill giant. Then I get rezzed, am in King's Room, more giants arrive, kill kill kill. By now a guide or GM is watching this. Vox shows up again (yes, trained on us), I punch fearless and <br />
<br />
I think: Ah, dragon, come to me. I forbid you to kill any of my companions before you kill me. That's right, obey me: Come. Heel.<br />
<br />
So briefly once again I'm tanking Vox in the midst of a barfight, heh.<br />
Most of the raid can't zone in time to avoid death.<br />
I run back naked to just inside Perma. Pissed character is standing there talking trash to any who will respond. Finally, character logs off (or is removed by GM?). Off once again to Kings Room. <br />
We're four hours into the raid now, at least. Maybe five. It's so long that people have come and gone, so I just loot my corpse without waiting for rez to speed things up.<br />
Raidleader forms final groups. I'm assigned MT duty. Relatively civil discussion ensues about whether this is the right call. Some other melee do indeed have higher hps, but not higher AC or resists. (Raidleader has made this assignment without asking me my stats, I assume because he believes that what we most need right now in an MT has little to do with stats.) The others yield. I will not survive this fight, in my estimation, even if raid is successful: being MT is a death sentence, and I'm MT and I'm happy. We make a tank order three deep. Plan is for me to go in first with one cleric, engage Vox, position her, call assist. Vox is the only one left now, since we have managed to kill all the other mobs over the course of having them trained on us.<br />
We're down to 17 people, very few twinks, no real nukage, lots of melee. Personally, I'm glad I don't know what level of MR people have, because that would just scare me. But we've come this far. All casters with any stun at all load it up, final instructions, we're assembled outside Vox's lair. Amazingly, we get there without anyone falling in pits, lol.<br />
Everybody ready? Yep.<br />
I move rock at lair entrance and charge. Vox is pretty far back. Bellow, autoattack, slam, call her a bitch to her face. <br />
<br />
Ah, yes, come to me dragon. Come to me now.<br />
<br />
Get her positioned, call assist. Vox's lair is big, especially when only you and her are in it (unbeknownst to me, my cleric has been feared away already).<br />
The thing about tanking Vox or Naggy is that the game doesn't get any better than that. Vox, monstrously rearing and striking, is where I want her, aggro looks good, raidmembers are in position. The fight is on.<br />
With Vox at 88% ( or so), though, I notice a disturbing trend: I'm below 30% and I'm not getting healed. When I'm at 23% I hit my heal me now please hotkey. Nothing. Hit it again at 13%. Nada.<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....<br />
Turns out two of three clerics were feared instantly, including the one who went in with me, lol, and the remaining cleric couldn't get to me.<br />
Raidwipe with Vox at around 40%, I think, though I wasn't there, heh.<br />
Ah. I would have tried again, but it was nearly 3 a.m. and I had work the next day.<br />
Final score: Vox 3, Raid 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I go LFG the message I type most of the time reads simply  ~ NO BOT ~<br />
<br />
After reading some of these posts I think you can see why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had a remarkable LDoN group last week.<br />
<br />
It started off as a normal-difficulty pickup group. Then we moved to EC and the leader ninja'd a hard on us. Now, that's ok. I like hards. It gives me a reason to be the puller, even though I don't usually like pulling. We had a cleric, warrior, enchanter, monk (me), mage, and ... something else i can't remember.<br />
<br />
Now, this group was not at the level of equipment that usually does hards, but I knew the tank from other LDoNs and I knew the enchanter's name and his former guild (which died, unfortunately). So it wasn't looking too bad, right?<br />
<br />
Right.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the group did a great job. I tried to chain-pull singles, and announced / asked when I would get 2.<br />
<br />
I shit you not, on every pull the mage was sitting, and got a whack to the head as a greeting from the mob.<br />
<br />
30 minutes in, I ask him if he needs to sit on inc, I am announcing my pulls so they have time to stand up from medding.<br />
He goes on to tell me that casters need mana and shit, y0, and wouldn't you think.<br />
His buddy tells the group that the mage hasn't been playing since only yesterday and *giggles* or some such shit.<br />
I decide to not tell them that I, too, have a caster, and that I, too, haven't been playing since only yesterday *GIGGOLE*, and instead go on pulling.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you know mister supermage has a special habit of nuking the mob and sitting down immediately after.<br />
Smart.<br />
<br />
He died no 5 minutes later.<br />
<br />
We're running short on time towards the end, so I try to bring the new mob as the old is falling. Or slightly earlier. The warrior is doing a great job (hi Proceed, group with you anytime again). Now on one single incoming, while the group is finishing off the earlier mob, the mage pet is beating on #1 and i bring #2 into camp (announced, of course), the mage is sitting, the mage purples in one round and loads a zone.<br />
<br />
I try hard to stay on my seat. I no longer care about win or loss, it just got funny by now.<br />
<br />
In the end, we won with 1 minute on the timer.<br />
Not going to group with that mage ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hehe Brabble! :) That brought back similiar memories of one of my first times raid tanking.Punch fearless,charge Vox...mmm MA dead...&lt;&lt;&lt;tanking VOX&gt;&gt;&gt;...got good aggro weee...kewl got her off the wall...erm ...hey no heals landing wth...look around...doh no clerics.All feared with most of the dps hehe.I was laughin so hard I couldn't see the loading screen thru the tears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've got waaaay too many to list. But one particularly funny group that comes to mind included a dorf warrior who died to enrage over, and over, and over, and over. Each time he would die, he would carry on about how his character was bugged, how he would take tons of fast hard hits whenever mobs got low on health, how he's been petitioning and talking to GMs about this character bug but they would never resolve his problem. Last I'd heard (a few months after this group), his character was still bugged, but he was still petitioning every day. Someday his persistence might pay off.<br />
<br />
Oh, the laughs.</div></div><hr />

I love hybrids that ask for group to wait to let them med...<br />
I love when people steal agro and bitch when they go splat. While my druid is the only healer in group and no slower in Tactics...<br />
I love people who always listen to directions. Not form a group leader, but from their inner voice...<br />
<br />
But to tell the truth I havent been in bad pick up group for years. I always lead my own or play with guildies/friends. Sometimes when I invite random people....the people I love so much as shown above join and spread the love!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ragnarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think my most memorable experience in EQ when I played was a bad Vox raid.  I was 1% from level 53 and my wife at work that night so I decided to go on the pickup raid for Naggy.  For the first time ever I got to be the MT.  The fight to right before her room went fine.   Everyone medded up and our group was doing the usual go in alone and then I call in everyone.  We had me (52 warrior at that time), 2 clerics, 52 bard, shaman, and a wizard.<br />
<br />
This is where it got fun.  Our group rushed Vox, bard has resist song rolling, everyone still there no one got feared.  I call the raid in to come help and the raid leader says &quot;they wiped stay here&quot;.  I was like WTF, we are all alive bitch come in.  Raid leader again saying they wiped stay here.  This whole time our entire group had not gotten feared one time.  I am spamming the channel for help, no one is coming, so our group said fuck it we are going to drop him alone.  Wizard was dropping bombs, shaman going nuts, all 6 of us standing right under naggy laying into him.  He gets to 80% with just us 6 and I am thinking to myself let the other 50 people stay in the hall, we are gonna take him alone.  I'm so hyped up I am shaking by now, still spamming for help.  No one is gotten feared yet, I am screaming in the channel saying he's down to 80% get the fuck in here. Now he is down to 70% just us 6, 65%....at 60% the cleric got feared and everything went to hell.  We all died with Naggy around 55%, right as we died and I am spamming the channel that's he was down to 60% the raid just ignores the raid leader and rushes in.  They took him down after everything else, we just helped the other 50 along some by us 6 dropping him to almost half life.<br />
<br />
It was the most memorable moment from EQ for me and the worst raid I had ever been on only because of the raid leader.  The raid leader was lucky we didn't kill him, because I would of said we wiped and let the timer run down until our group could of looted him alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lol I had another Really bad group last night.<br />
<br />
It was me, 65 warrior<br />
65pally,Shaman,Mage,Necro in Sol Ro Tower, exping(Mage ws being played by his RL bro since his bro chanter can't get into Sol Ro)<br />
We having fun, but amazingly, im losing agro every fight, which is really crazy. They start talking shit about how i can't hold agro, so I tell them to stop overnuking. They continue to, so I tell the Pally to tank. He is losing agro now to. So, I tell wait 5 seconds after they nuke to renuke(so, Cast Time,5seconds, bout 9 seconds). I switch to my Smouldershank and Pebble Crusher, and Keep agro. The Mage say&quot; We can start nuking again, he is keeping agro&quot;. So they start nuking hard again, and Keep gaining agro(By this point, i have stopped inciting/taunting if they want agro so bad).<br />
<br />
Well the necro ends up pulling 2, and me and pally split tank. Shaman slows Pally's First, so im fighting this Protector of Ro with no heals, and unslowed. Just then the Mage overnukes, grabs agro, and dies.. Very Quickly. We get it under control, and Live. Then the mage is like&quot;Wtf, I thought Warrior's were suppose to know how to taunt&quot;<br />
<br />
So I say&quot; I thought mages were suppose to know how to not overnuke&quot; So we start argueing, and the Necro pulls while we argueing, apparently the Pally is afk, and no inc message, so all i know, I see Necro Hp drop, then Shamans start to drop. I run over there and incite Trying to get agro, and get it. Just the mage comes back into zone, and kicks me from the group. So now, im tanking the Protector with NO heals, because Shaman is to retarded to target me. I throw on my Windblade, Hit furious, and hope to god the shaman is worth a damn. No heals, Protector at 74%, furious goes off, I hit mightystrike, 69%. No heals, im at 1%, and I die.<br />
<br />
I ask the shaman why no heals, and she says &quot; You weren't in the group, so no reason to heal you&quot;. So, thats another REALLY bad group i have had, unfortunetly~ :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had alot of bad groups, but the one I remember best was when in PoI shortly after PoP came out.  The Chanter in the group nuked the whole time.  Didn't slow or mez.  Everytime we got an add I would scream for her to mez and shed say she's OOM.  After 2 wipes due to her not mezzing I told the group I would not group with her ever again and disbanded.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't do the pickup group thing anymore, its all friends and guildies now, but the last time I did I decided to have a little fun. It was in Sol Ro with a couple of newbs that have had leeched there flags and somehow gotten into Sol Ro, well after 2 wipes cause the monk didn't know how to pull less then 3 at a time and the chanter thought kitting was better then mezzing I had had enough and was ready to go. So I decide to have a lil fun, monk pulls 3 again, when he is inc he's like wth is that funny weapon your holding...LOADING PLESE WAIT...Where did the tank go....wth how are you in OT dude? None of them had heard of the OT gate hammer so I decided to have some more fun and blame it on the wizzy newb who was quite fond of chain nuking on INC. So the group gets mad and boots him, he gates, the cleric and chanter are dead,  the monk is FD, the rogue popped escape, and the there both say screw this, where's the zone out here? I disbanded and had to sit down for a while and laugh it off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>lamgwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am new here, as I have just started a Human Warrior. I have been reading some of the posts, and wanted to relate this story to you. <br />
<br />
<br />
My worst group was with my Beastlord main, at level 46. LDoN in BB, I was saving up points for Pack Shrew. <br />
<br />
There was a 50 War in Time gear, and with his Epic, Me, 49 Cleric, 48 Chanter, 46 Mage and a 47 Shaman. Seemingly a nice setup, with War and me to do DPS, Chanter for croud control, Healer, Shaman buffs and Mage for nuking. <br />
<br />
Before we zoned in, I asked the War to wait till I got my Warder up and buffed before pulling. The warder does more than half my DPS output, and can off tank adds till the war gets to kill them. Chanter askes him to designate what adds to Mez. He does not reply, just zones in. <br />
<br />
The rest of us zone in, and the War is fighting 3 mobs and down to 80%. WTF!  :eek: The Chanter asks him what mobs to mez, and when he dosen't answer, just Mezzes all the adds. The War changes targets, and breaks Mez. I'm summoning my Warder, and sent it in unbuffed, and start buffing it while it fights. The War steps back till my warder gets aggro, and goes and pulls another 3 mobs! At 70% health!One of the mobs follows him, and brings back 2 friends, so now we have 8 mobs aggroed, and the WAR hasn't killed any yet. We are all yelling WTF, stop pulling! and he just ignores us, and moves back into the zone in room, and brings 5 mobs with him. They aggro on the Cleric, Chanter, and Mage, who go down in seconds, And HE zones out.  :( <br />
<br />
The son of a bitch was the only one to survive. We run back, collect bodies and decide to wait for rez till after, and get ready to start again. Again, the WAR pulls 3, and does not wait for me to summon Warder, and the Cleric and Mage hadn't even zoned in yet. This time I keep my warder next to me till it's buffed, and I get aggro in one mob and start banging on it with my Warder. The stupid war switches targets to my mob, and turns his back on the other 2. He gets whacked pretty bad, and is down to 40% health when we finally finnish off the first 3 mobs. <br />
<br />
10 minuts gone, and only 3 mobs dead. Sheesh. <br />
<br />
The Cleric casts HoT on the War, and he runs out to pull before it takes, and gets out or range. Pulls 4. Back to the Zone in room, where the mobs aggro the Cleric and Shaman when they try to heal him. <br />
<br />
Wipe #2. <br />
<br />
We go back to Zone in, and WAR announces &quot;REZ me&quot; to the group. The Cleric does, and he says &quot;This group suks&quot; and disbands. JEAZE! :mad:</div></div><hr />

I'm going to hazard the guess someone was yanking your chain.  Isn't there a level requirement to even get in the higher tiers of PoP?  I'm pretty sure there is.</div></div><hr />

Can't even zone into PoTime if you're not 65. The gear is all min level 65 as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On top of needing to be 55+ to enter a number of zones where you get early flags, and level 62+ to enter a number of zones where you get other flags, before getting anywhere near Time.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing someone heard the term &quot;Time geared&quot; somewhere along the line and assumed it applied to any very well equiped character.  This level 50 may have been top geared for his level bracket, and they mistakenly refered to this as being &quot;Time geared&quot;.</div></div><hr />

They invite a necro thinking it is a chanter. Then once in there  2nd or third room there was a mob that cast AE mez.. we barly excaped.. i think one or two dies and then we tried again  T<br />
he mob meezed us again then we ran to the zone and quite the adventure that was my first failure..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Not happened to me, yet this happened to my wife whom plays an Ogre Shaman.<br />
<br />
She was in a LDoN group with a decent well rounded classes (warrior, cleric, chanter, etc.)  Inside the dungeon the first few mobs came and died.  They came across a mob that after it was slowed it would not get off of the shaman.  Tank was trying to pull it off, and the cleric did nothing to save the shaman.  Needless to say LOADING Please wait... flashes across the screen.<br />
<br />
So she asks why in the hell didn't you heal me?  The cleric responded that her heals are only for the tank, and the shaman's job was to watch everyone elses health.  After getting rezzed back in, scraping some mana together they pressed on to the next mob.<br />
<br />
Except this time she didn't slow the mob.<br />
<br />
Cleric drew aggro from too much healing and died very quickly.<br />
<br />
Complaints of why she wasn't healed, wife responds Oh I'm sorry but my heals are for the rest of the group only.<br />
<br />
Cleric left the group, but not the mission.  Managed to point that out to my wife before the group went any further.  They left the mission.</div></div><hr />

If you delevel even to 64, you can't equip any Time gear. Even elemental armor is required level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Lol, aye, Dubb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Tanking Vox was the probably my peak EQ experience. What a rush the first time I rushed into her lair! I was 7-0 against her (we had a great raid-leader then). Once we fought her with 28 people and didn't have any deaths. Still can't believe that. Single best raid I ever saw. But that was nearly 4 years ago I guess.<br />
<br />
Nagafen was a different story. Maybe because he's easier/easier to get to, but the Nagafen raids were always bigger and dumber. Lost once in a public raid of like 65 people to Nagafen. What a mess. Think I was 1-3 in raids against Nagafen. <br />
<br />
Worst pickup group? Hard to say. I guess the group of morons who couldn't snare, mez or do anything in Sebilis, and when the final train came they all scattered and simply left me to die down there alone. Then they wouldn't even help with CR. Some guildies had to come and rescue me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had to pay the enchanter to slow/haste, like 100pp everytime it was dispelled/ran out, slowing was outta the question, so was mezzing.<br />
<br />
Wizard evac'd everytime we had 2 mobs pulled...countlessly I see myself back at the zone in due to a pull of 2 mobs in normal which have gimp hp etc..<br />
<br />
Cleric who was using great healing and healing at level 65. Told me heroic bond was better then virtue because its less mana.<br />
<br />
Necro in the group spent more time talking to himself through his voice grafted pet then he did fighting/twitching the cleric, but other then the constant getting low life aggro due to liching down to 10% hp, he was alright.<br />
<br />
Rogue... SoS'd around the adventure for the whole 90minutes taking screenshots of mobs to send to allahkazam because he hadn't seen them before and he just bought his new rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
and me, the warrior... forced to use champions breastplate for heals, willsapper for slows, kizrak's bp, kizrak's legs, faded skull medallion, kizrak's gaunts and other misc shit for self buffs since the group lacked the brains to cast the ones they should have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">well there was this one groupd I was in the warrior refused to say his hit points because he felt it demeaning and then he through a fit about how he had a hat graphic on his head then to top it off he kept moaning about how his knight alt wouldn't have this aggro problems but his warrior tanked 12.5% better.  He was so busy posting on boards and whining that ultimately the ranger tanked the whole ldon and when we finished the war deleted and rolled a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">worst group in ages was one where the wizard would pull 4 mobs without warning without permission .. would get people killed and then boast that he can get away with this because of all his aa and because he hasnt caused any wipes. later he ninja looted a pretty good drop item as well.<br />
<br />
not as bad as that one but more interesting was one where a very drunk mage died to who knows what and then the cleric went ld and the mage kept whining that she needs escort back from pok and how come we havent rezzed her yet. she got so mad that we wouldnt escort her back that she finally ran back just as the cleric got back looted her corpse without asking for a rez and then left. the beastlord our only slower then went ld and never came back and another member (dont remember class) thinking the group was splitting up ran off to a raid. that left me (warrior) the cleric and a 64 ranger to complete the mission. we only had the full group together for about 5 minutes and after that it was the world's worst dps group with no slower to try to finish a collect. we almost did it too until the cleric ran the wrong way and trained herself with just a few more to collect and time running out. so we finished in overtime and patted ourselves on the back for not being quitters and for showing ourselves that even an underpowered group could come close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Oh man the worst pickup group for me was in PoN.

<br />
On the way there, the cleric grabs agro from one of the trees but dosnt notice.  Once we get to the rock, the tree with a few birds are on their tail trained into the group.  We tried to fight them off, ench no where to be found.  Well we all died, and had to rez back at the GY.<br />

Heh, I've found that getting people to look up when going over the gobbies to be about as effective as getting people to click off sow on a fearing mob. /sigh...some people just won't listen.<br />

On a related note, I just can't understand what is so hard about reading your chat text for important messages. I hate having to call for buffs/rezzes/paci...whatever 5 time before peope finally catch the message. Maybe its just a pet peeve, but it drives me absolutely nuts.<br />

Oh, and those people that I seemingly attract with increasing frequency that think its ok to just go afk to take care of your kid. Hey, I completely understand RL comes before the game, but damn it takes 2 seconds to type &quot;one sec, kid problems&quot;. If you want to put RL before your kids thats fine, but don't make everyone else suffer because you refuse to play when its not an issue.</div></div><hr />
