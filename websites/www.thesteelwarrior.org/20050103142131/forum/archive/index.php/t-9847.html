From what I read on Alla's, it seems there are actually shields of 1000+ armor, which seems to be pretty significant when some armor posted there seem to have values below 1000. <br />
<br />
Maybe the gear list is misleading, but the value of the shield seems to be much bigger in WoW than it ever was in EQ. Any thoughts/comments from those playing?</div></div><hr />

On my shaman my shield has like 385 armor, i have 804 armor total...so almost half my armor is from my shield, makes a huge difference for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played in both STs and I've pretty much wound up going offensive talents with a 2hander for soloing. Was taking 2-3 mobs at level 20ish solo, granted I had potions from Alchemy. Doing the same for retail, but will probalby switch to defensive at 60 for raid purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another thing I didn't see mentioned, with a shield equipped now in both Battle and Defensive Stance, you can Shield Bash, which isn't nearly as lame as in EQ, in WoW Shield Bash has a very very high chance of interrupting casters(and preventing them from using that spell for 5seconds or so), and can make the difference between getting wailed on by casters or dispatching them with ease.  You also have an innate chance to shield block any attack, although this is very low, but in Defensive Stance at level16 you get an activated Shield Block which blocks one full hit, with talents you can block up to two hits.</div></div><hr />

I was mostly a 2h warrior in CB, tanked most instances 2h but I whipped out the 1h/shield combo when needed.  The sheer beauty of the warrior in WoW is its versatility (at least compared to my EQ experience).  Switching from one weapon set and stance to another gives a new set of tools to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dual wield in WoW isnt much of a warrior thing really, its 2h for soloing and 1h/s for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A question for the beta people though:<br />
<br />
Did you notice any better aggro when you dual wielded? Or is the difference negated by more damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that I ever dual wielded in a group setting.  Generally I held aggro just fine with 2h.  I never tanked the very top end instances so I can't say how that would work.  Usually 2h attacks and using the attack debuff worked well enough for most things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time I use dual wield is when we're way higher level than the instance and aggro doesn't matter much.  Then the mobs die much faster but aggro jumps all over.<br />
<br />
As far as instances go, shields are huge.  Someone needs to interrupt those spells.  Also, I really like using revenge for aggro...only 5 rage so its easy to use.  With shield you've got more chances to use it.  Improved revenge talent makes it where you end up stunning the mob a good chunk of the fight.<br />
<br />
At 29 the shield takes my damage reduction from 34% to about 43%.   Thats not counting what it actually blocks...thats just from the armor of the shield.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heleron</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I normally come out of a fight solo with 3/4s or so of my life when I keep my shield up.   I did the 2hs way and I have a bit more downtime between fights.   The shield abilities are quite nice.  Even at my low level (20).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using sunder armor and revenge in defensive mode, a shield bearer does very well in groups.  I was able to hold 3-4 mobs last night on me with no problem at all.  You get more rage when you're getting hit, so that rage is put to good use.   Also having the warrior quest shield was pretty awsome too.</div></div><hr />

My little level 17 warrior goes from about 700 AC to over 1k with a shield.  For soloing though I'm mainly using 2H and picking on mobs a level or two lower than me.  Just goes a ALOT faster.  Then again I'm not really speccing in the defensive line.  I haven't done much high end grouping, but I hear you need shields for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  Just so everyone knows, if you're going defensive, Parry &gt; Block, so get Deflection first.  <br />
<br />
Jury is still out on dual wield for me.  Generate rage a fuckload faster which helps me keep aggro better, even tho I lose a solid 1/4 of my AC without my shield.  Some parsing will need to be done later when I start getting bored with this game.<br />
<br />
So umm, A LOT later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine that, as people said, shields are actually useful in WoW (Unlike EQ and other MMOs), due to the HUGE armor boost you get from using one, as well as chances to block. On 1h+shield vs dual wield, it'd be a tough call. With 1h/shield, you don't get hit nearly as often nor as hard, but with dual wield, you'd probably notice that you get a significant amount of extra rage, which means you can use your abilities more often.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see some parses, but it seems like everyone is too busy actually playing to actually parse and analyze stuff, heh. I don't blame them :)</div></div><hr />

I know they changed the values around a bit to make it harder to hit the cap without a shield but I do not recall what the current # is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">meaning that adding a shield (despite its huge ac boost) was essentially meaningless.<br />
I don't think it's just the armor that people see in a shield.<br />
<br />
Plus it allows you to experiment.  There's some rumors going around (on the main forums, however reliable those may be) that agility could help with the miss rate.  Until parses come through with results, if there is a 7k armor cap you could buffer your armor with a shield while taking a lesser armor item with more agility...never know, it'll be a bit before people test it out.  However, it does essentially allow you to experiment with combinations and such.<br />
<br />
BTW, is that an overall cap or is there just a cap on armor from items?  Would stuff like priest talents (armor increase on crit heals) and devotion aura from paladins go even higher?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's not a new cap - they switched it from a line to a curve with steeply diminishing returns, so that going from say 3000-4000 was a much bigger jump than going from 6000-7000. This was why there was a huge bump in shield AF at the same time ( otherwise they would be fairly meaningless).  IIRC someone tested it being 55% mitigation around 8000AF, which means getting the cap of 75% would require some absolutely insane AF.</div></div><hr />

Where is the line drawn with using a shield and taking lower DPS, to using a 2hr to get higher DPS soloing?<br />

<br />
When soloing I don't believe there is a line. DPS all the way. If there were situations where doing less dps but having more defense meant that you survived a fight where you would not do so if you went full dps it would be a consideration, but solo I have never encountered this situation. Generally being defensive and taking 30 seconds to kill something ends up with you taking more damage than going offensive and killing it in 20 seconds anyway.<br />
<br />
Of course, use common sense, if you have a 45 dps 1 hander and a 30 dps two hander whipping out the two hander is not really going to help you.<br />
<br />
Oh and as a p.s. to an earlier post - block is actually reasonably competitive with parry, mostly because of shield spikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't see myself ever going 2h for anything.  Quality 2h just aren't that spectacular compared to a 1h with 75% of the DPS, and 6-700 ac on a shield.  On top of that, there are so many mobs that you absolutely NEED a shield equipped for to even have a chance.  Murlocs my level rape the living fuck out of me, the only chance I have is to shield bash and revenge stun my way thru them.<br />
<br />
I'll kill a little slower..but I also don't ever need to heal either.  I like the way that works out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelision</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem with shields is that if you are tanking higher level monsters,  &gt; 3 levels above yours.. your taunt works about 50-60% of the time, and you cant do enough damage to match the other party members.<br />
<br />
I can handle the damage from these types of monsters but just have a helluv a time controlling aggro.  Mobs less than that are cake tho, I took 4 level 30 mobs at once with my shield ( as a level 31 )  only used one health pot.<br />
<br />
I plan on going defensive route because the shield is amazing!  I do keep a big 2 hander in the sack for when I need to do some serious damage.<br />

<br />
I fail to see the logic in this.<br />
<br />
If you're tanking higher level mobs, you're gonna miss a shitload too..no matter what weapon you're using.  Best tactic for me is to keep the 1/3 of my AC that the shield provides, turn on bloodrage and toss sunder armors on until it sticks a few times.  Sunder doesn't burn much rage if you're missing.  Taunt only turns the mob to you if it's not attacking you, so it's a moot point really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem with shields is that if you are tanking higher level monsters, &gt; 3 levels above yours.. your taunt works about 50-60% of the time, and you cant do enough damage to match the other party members.<br />
<br />
You see, the flaw in everyone's logic is that everyone keeps thinking &quot;b-b-but what about my DPS?&quot;. It's not about your DPS, if the mob is ping-ponging at all, you're not doing your job (I'm not talking solo, I'm talking in groups). Remember those annoying EQ druids who would chain nuke instead of heal when there is no other healer in the group? It doesn't seem that you do.<br />
<br />
If you guys would just get off the DPS track for five minutes you would realize your groups will run a billion times smoother if you just hold agro so the other classes can get to work. I'm sure clerics can produce good DPS, but that doesn't mean they should be doing it. <br />
<br />
By the way, yes, I have seen shields with over 1500 armor at level 40 I believe they have around 20 block, so I'm sure there are even better. Think of it this way, block = damage reduction, all of that damage you're preventing adds up. You say &quot;but if I kill the mobs so fast it will save mana!&quot;, well so will preventing damage to youself dummy, and I'm sure there are more efficient ways to do it than trying to max out your dps. Sure you can heal fast in-between fights, but in your big rush to kill mobs at higher levels I garantee you your healer (if not someone else) will steal agro at some point, die and you'll wind up wasting more time getting him rezed than you would've if you had a slightly longer fight.<br />
<br />
Once a warrior starts grouping I don't see any reason why they shouldn't atleast get Improved Taunt, and the Talent that can add +15% to your abilities agro in defensive stances. If someone can actually prove to me that it's possible to hold agro as well in offensive stance as in defensive (with defensive talents), then I'll drop my argument. Until then, I'm sticking with it, and I'm about to the point where I'm done trying to convince people to switch. If you want to suck, you can go right ahead as long as you don't wind up in my guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually the flaw in your logic is that you believe dps and aggro are unrelated, when actually they are *the same thing*. No rage, no sunder, no dps no rage.<br />
<br />
Rage from being hit doesn't actually do anything unless something is hitting you and if you have no rage then it will not be hitting you.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people have blinkers on with respect to the talent trees - a key thing to keep in mind is that a person may spec arms, including mortal strike, and still  have 98% of the tanking ability of a full protection spec tank by taking anticipation, toughness, defiance and shield spec, while still having 3 points left over.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem, to my mind, is mostly that shield discipline, while better than it's predecessor, just is nowhere near as compelling as it's counterpart mortal strike. I'm not in any way suggesting that it is useless, just that it doesn't provide sufficient incentive for speccing 31 protection. IMO shield discipline being a passive would do that well enough. <br />
<br />
In any case, it will be interesting to see what impact the rumored changes to warriors and rage generation will have next patch. ( The proposed improvements to berserker stance certainly make tactical mastery more appealing - being able to switch from defensive to berserker and then whirlwind looks to have some interesting potential )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tactical mastery is already the best talent there is.<br />
<br />
I guarantee I can put down any equal level tank who doesn't have it.  I've done it several times now.<br />
<br />
Oh, and lets be serious for a second here about 2h.  Here's what I did last nite...I did Blackfathom deeps, then we booked over to Razorfen Kraul and took down Charla, and then we went back and finished up the elite Hillsbrad quests in Dun Garok.  I was 32 at the beginning of the nite, 33.5 or so at the end.  Here's what I got last nite.<br />
<br />
From Blackfathom quest...Arctic Buckler -- http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=5606<br />
<br />
From Charla in Razor Fen...Pronged Reaver --<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=11766<br />
<br />
And from the end of the Battle of Hillsbrad quests --<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=9818<br />
<br />
Don't even fuckin talk to me about how the Reaver is blue and the Darkblade isn't.  This is the way the game goes...sometimes you get blue loot, and sometimes you get green.  The fact of the matter is that any time I've looked, anywhere I go, 2h is not anywhere near being enough to give up a shield for, especially with the quality of the 1h I'm acquiring.<br />
<br />
For me to give up 642ac, 17 block and the ability to Bash, I'd need bare minimum, a 35dps 2h, and I don't have one...how about you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yes I do, that's to be expected given I am higher than level 33.<br />
<br />
However that is not particularly relevant, for something that is - at 34 I picked up a <br />
whirlwind axe (http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=4187) , something that is well within your capabilities if you are doing razorfen kraul, particularly given that the elemental charms are tradeable.<br />
<br />
Some quest rewards are uber, some suck, but two handers, by design, have a 30% higher dps than 1 handers. The ones *you* have gotten may not, but  that doesn't mean that this is true for everyone.<br />
<br />
P.S. I have no problem with shields, I simply stated that when soloing that high dps was the most effective path in my experience. When tanking instances I usually use shields, unless encountering large numbers of non-elite mobs.<br />
<br />
P.S.S You should go get a forcestone buckler from the crimson monastery quest.</div></div><hr />

I still wouldn't use that axe over a 24 dps sword and 1/3 of my total AC.<br />
<br />
If you want to, great.  But I definitely don't see gimping myself in the slightest by going sword + shield.<br />
