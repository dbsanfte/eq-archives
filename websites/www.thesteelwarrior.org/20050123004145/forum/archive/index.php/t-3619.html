<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyxander</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I'd like to thank the folks who responded to my Mentor seeking thread.  Hopefully I'll be learning quite a bit from them in the near future.<br />
<br />
But I have a serious question.  I know that everyone's class boards basically consist of them complaining about how everyone else is so great.  And I completely understand that Knights have stolen our thunder by becoming competent tanks with superior aggro control.<br />
<br />
But does that mean that my little up and coming warrior (22 now, gotta update that .sig) should just sell his 1HS, and fork his armor over to a newbie SK, so that I can continue to enjoy the game?<br />
<br />
The main way I play is by searching for a group with my g/f, who plays a similar level druid.  I've enjoyed the one LDoN adventure I've gone on (even though I was told I wasn't allowed or capable to tank, and there was a Pally and an SK) but I always figured a Druid and a Tank pair would be desirable enough to keep us in groups for a good long time.<br />
<br />
But was I fooled?  Are warriors no longer tanks, even from 20-50?<br />
<br />
Note, that it's unlikely I'll ever be PlaneRaiding, Elemental/Time-Equipped, or even have useful items in all of my slots (What kinda warrior wears earrings anyway!?!?)<br />
<br />
::wink::<br />
<br />
Any thoughts appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are tanks, you just have to work harder to get aggro. A SK is a load of fun, but I prefer my warrior to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">20-50 you shouldn't really have a problem. Anyone at those levels who says Warrior's can't tank have truly been brainwashed by message board propaganda. It's not as bad as it seems in all cases.<br />
<br />
However, a Warrior, no matter what level, revolves around his gear more than anything else. If you never expect to upgrade beyond Crustacean Shell Armor and a Frostbringer/Snowchipper combo, a Knight probably would be the way to go since they have the extra utility of spells that helps alleviate the gear crutch we have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mebbe a Shammy is a better choice, but I leveled with my best friend (Druid) from 25-60 or so. <br />
<br />
We duo'd quite alot, and grouped with friends and guildies when available. There are many places a Druid/Warrior combo can exp in, you are in for a treat!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oooh, ooh!  Where!?  I'd love some suggestions.<br />
<br />
Having a real blast already... glad to hear optimism on this front.  I have truly enjoyed playing a nice straight warrior.  Magic is for nancies!<br />
<br />
(Apparently so are boots.  I just realized I'm not wearing any.  Earrings, I get, but what am I doing going into dungeons without boots?  I'll catch my death!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes make an SK and be done with it.   Remember, WARs sack and pillage and have no time to hold hands, share moments and look for groups with girlfriends.</div></div><hr />

One word, critters! Have your Druid-g/f fear kite, and play rogue, run behind and whack em, also good for working those lagging skills. (/cheer Lae, 1hb-2hb never woulda gone up without ya dear!)<br />
<br />
Worked for me, and enjoyable. Eastern Wastes in your 40's will be nice exp.<br />
<br />
22...hmm, mebbe hoppers in Marus Seru? Then 30ish try Dawnshroud Peaks. <br />
<br />
Really, anyplace with animals will work, experiment with aggro kiting too.(doesn't have to be a animal then) Have her snare, then have her run the MoB around while you poke him in the back, etc. <br />
<br />
Play the zone if things go bad. a Druid can be a grand partner, and once she gets the 300pt heal you can start to straight up melee some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyxander</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great!  Maybe I'll drag her out to Marus Seru today, and take a little break from the xp grind in PC.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love sitting down to med up my stamina and noticing that the 3 pulls while I fumbled for my bandage hotkey have given me 9% toward my next ding...<br />
<br />
But sometimes it's fun to strategize, plan, and execute...<br />
<br />
Now to see if I can teach her to fear kite!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids can only fear kite animals, make an SK though and you can fear anything up to a certain lvl.  <br />
The decision really comes down to two things:<br />
1. Do you want /defensive to tank uber mobs way down the road from now or possibly never? or...<br />
2. Do you want FD, snare, IVU, fear, dots, aggro control with a rusty dagger if need be, self heals, harmshield etc.?<br />
<br />
If I had to start over, I'd go with no. 2 and never look back :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, what he said.  A druid and an SK would be a much better combo.  You can fear kite all sorts of stuff then.<br />
<br />
Also may wanna think of a BL.  They can melee and their pets are really nice.  I just made a BL alt to 2-box with my 30 druid and its pretty insane the stuff I can kill.  Went through 61 levels 2-boxing cleric/warrior, and I can tell that this new combo will level much much faster.<br />
<br />
A fun (and a little out of the way) place is the giant fort in Warsliks Woods.  Go there at around 20 and beat up some giants for nice exp and ok loot.<br />
<br />
When you get in your 40s go to CoM.  Still one of my favorite spots.  (havent been there since the revamp though)<br />
<br />
Have fun!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyxander</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's CoM?<br />
<br />
I'm going to think about making an SK... but I'm just not sure how much I want to mess around with a hybrid... my first toon was a ranger, which of course is kinda like playing a red-stain on the monsters swords surrounded by green armor.<br />
<br />
Then I played a Necro... so I kinda got my fill of being KoS and evil, etc.<br />
<br />
You're right about the giant fort in WW... I levelled my necro there, and it's a fun place.  I'll add that to the checklist of places to tour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sk is fun, mine is 48 now and is a blast.   I still think warrior is a better class in the higher levels of the game, even with agro issues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol A should be good for your level as well(get an anizok minimizing divice, vah shir are large race so might be a problem running through here), at 29 go to IC and fearkite cougars with your GF or head into Crystal Caverns to kill orcs (better loot, maybe more risk) or try crypt of dalnir (thats the 3 places i have been at the time aside from soloing in warsliks with lots of bandages).<br />
Druid healers are perfectly fine until low 50s and work well after 58 again.<br />
Remember that a druid has the same heal from 29 to 51 and then superior heal isnt that great for a warrior who probably has close to 3k hp then (depending on gear).<br />
So it might get a lot of downtime medding if you cannot fear the mob you fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venz</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play both classes...55 warrior and a 57 sk. I also duo with my girl, but lately we've been having some trouble finding a spot to duo with my warrior. Meanwhile we're having little or no trouble finding spots to duo with my sk. She has a few classes in this level range..cleric...druid...chanter.  I guess what im saying is...both classes are a blast to play, but if you plan on duoing through your levels the sk is more logical. In a group situation, the sk will be better with aggro, but i dont have THAT much trouble gaining aggro with my warrior that its an issue. Both work fine in groups in my experience, so pick what you like. This post is mindless anyway...im tired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slayerofwurms</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, if id didnt overlap with druid so much, I would say ranger- I found them really fun to play, and track and spells really useful. Once you get SoW, its all cake from there. <br />
<br />
If you are both willing to re-roll, ranger and shaman makes a pretty nice pair. Straight up melee is not always an option, but with both spell casters, and the shamans regern and pet, and archery... You can do pretty well. Rangers can also fear kite animals, which is nice. As for fear kiting animals with the druid- go to Stonebrunt. Now, you can kite the cats close to the zone, around 30, you can head into the hills, and kite the pandas and granitebacks, for some good exp and gem drops- up to 90pp. <br />
<br />
If I were suggesting, though, I would say Ranger and Shammy, or any melee and cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo'd/grouped with druid healers quite a bit right til around 55 or so (waaaay before druids got anything more than superior heal past lvl 51.)  We'd fear kite animals, or we'd aggro kite (him playing bait, me following and smacking the mob).  We'd even kill in skyshrine, him being the healer.  Of course, having an enchanter and bard in the group was a huge boon.  (This being back when the pool area was pretty nice exp in the 40s, not to mention decent plate melee drops.)  You may need to be a tad creative, but druids can heal just fine, especially with the advent of spells like Healing Waters and Tunare's Renewal.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you both enjoy your current classes, keep going with them.  <br />
<br />
A thought for duo's with lvl 52+ druids, go to western wastes, have a druid charm a bronto (charm does not break as much on them, in my experience), snare another animal, fear it, melee partner plays 2nd pet.  If nothing else, this is a nice way to farm velium hound furs for 8th shawl or mastadon furs for wood elf illusion crowns, which sell nicely for me in the bazaar.   Once you two get realllly gutsy, ya may wanna try kiting ice burrowers.  (Eh, make your guildy/friend/twink monk/beastlord happy on the off chance you have a tunic drop.)</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to help me make a decision, don't post in the thread.  I didn't ask for a hug, I asked for input.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I didn't say &quot;I don't like the class.&quot;  If I didn't like the class, I would in fact start a new one.<br />
<br />

I am having fun playing my class, reason I asked is because I wanted to see if folks thought my choice would allow me to continue having fun in the future.  <br />

I'm pretty reassured that within the scope of the game I'm likely to see, Druid/Warrior will suit us well.</div></div><hr />

I think you know what you will do and in the end you will do what you want to do rather than what we tell you what to do (and have done ourselves). Obviously most of the people here &quot;toughed&quot; it out and play warriors as their main characters and many are 65's. Most will tell you they enjoy playing a warrior despite many believing there are agro issues to be fixed. If you don't enjoy playing a warrior and want the utility of being a knight, then by all means make one. It's a pretty clear cut decision in my opinion. And the whole group help thing was a joke in reference to the movie fight club. This is a warrior forum and warriors are supposed to be tough :D. If you can't stand the heat then get out of the kitchen! If you want advice on being a warrior, there's plenty of that to go around here. I'm just tired of the &quot;should I make an XXX class&quot; posts. If you wanna roll a new character, do it. You don't need us to tell you to or that it's ok. Judging from the fact most people here primarily spend their time playing warriors in EQ, most people here by admission of their own actions wouldn't go that route.</div></div><hr />

I know how you feel but he seems sincere in what he is asking. He wanted to know what the levels ahead of him held before he made a decision. I know we have seen a lot of threads with people dumping Warriors for Knights but there is no need to assume everyone has the same agenda. He asked what we thought and a lot of people seemed inclined to answer.<br />
<br />
Someone get Gerald a stress relief ball and hurry!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its all about you and if you will have fun with the class, the fact that you pick another class wont &quot;allow&quot; you to have fun, no class has a built-in &quot;fun factor&quot;, if you like your warrior, you will keep playing him and having fun, if you like your SK, you will keep playing him and having fun. What I mean is, there is no fixed point, when you play a warrior, where you &quot;stop&quot; having fun, the warrior class &quot;allows&quot; you to have fun (like any other class) till YOU decide its no longer fun; if you play a SK, there will be no fixed point where you stop having fun unless you decide its no longer fun to play, and it doesnt have to be at lvl65 with 400 AAs, it might be at lvl20 *shrugs*.. In conclusion, ANY class &quot;allows&quot; you to have fun, its just a matter of YOU deciding what are you gonna do, I dont think anyone else can have a say in that decision.</div></div><hr />
