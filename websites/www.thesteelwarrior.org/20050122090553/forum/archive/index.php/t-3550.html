<br />
I just recently reactivated my account, and am faced with a difficult task - re-equipping my warrior, right now i am pretty much broke (500ish plat to my name) and am at a loss as to where/what i should do to get back into business.<br />
<br />
If anyone could guide me in the right direction with maybe a helpful hint or two, i would be much appreciative, the magelo is in the link - don't choke laughing please. I know its bad :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance ~ Iban.<br />
<br />

Just try to get a full suit of bronze and just level, doesnt matter that much at the lower levels ;) Good Luck!!<br />

<br />
Find some friends and farm plate as much as you can. A full set of Champions armor would do you wonders. If you have access to HoT groups go that route instead but if you can only pull a few friends then farm Kael and do the Thurgadina armor quests.<br />
<br />
Kill in maidens eye for Vah shir claw earrings, that's an easy upgrade while getting exp.<br />
<br />
/shrug.  I'd go with Kael for now. Concentrate on that till you get decked out and maybe you'll pick up some extra pieces to sell the MQ on for some cash!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't care about faction, its pretty easy to farm the high elf guards in Felwith near the zone.  They are palidans but they drop 2h swords that sell for 20 plat each and occasionally they drop a fine steel weapon.  There are 2 wanderers and 2 on bridge, then 2 behind wall by bridge.  Also one on a catwalk past bridge and another up on the cliff you can get to come down by taunting.  I usually make around 1000 plat in 4 to 5 respawn cycles with a charisma buff selling just the swords to vendors.  They respawn just fast enough that I can sit and regen to full after each round.  Be careful of the exterminator, he is green but agros and has a lot of hit points so you can not solo him.  He is easy to avoid though.  Take an invis potion so you can get by the higher level guards just outside the zone since you will be too encumbered to run.   If you have a non-kos hydra, sell the swords to  the NPC merchant next to the bridge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What to do?<br />
<br />
Dulak harbor kill the green drunken Pirates and their friends. They drop some gems to sell for 100 PP each and should be green. Bring a bit of a healer with you and that would fit it.<br />
<br />
Rathe mountains kill Hillis.<br />
<br />
Lower Guk farm and kill and sell the stuff dunno if youre kos to froggies in gukta ( ex grobb ) so way could be short to sellers.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the money head to the bazaar and look for some stuff, Lots of things are real cheap now ( last seen a 50 AC BP for 2.5 k ) so you could upgrade youre stuff real fast.<br />
<br />
Or when there real old friends on that server maybe someone could give you around 5 to 10 k to buy some HP.. stuff and then go to dulak ... .<br />
<br />
But Dulak is a part of an extra expansion dunno if you have it.</div></div><hr />
