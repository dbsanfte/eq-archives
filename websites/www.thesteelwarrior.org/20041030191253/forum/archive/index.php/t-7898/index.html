<br />
<br />
personally i would stick with using CHoS and Sand Sword you already have them and cause every other warrior is weilding a CHoS+SotBS and i HATE looking cookie cutter...</div></div><hr />

Not sure of the status on your bank account but there's a few things you can buy in the bazaar that will be good upgrades for you.  If you came into some money, I'd look at getting<br />
<br />
1) Elbow Spiked Armplates (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16485).  You'd lose STA but you'd gain 40 raw hp.<br />
2. Replace at least one earring with a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement.   Should run ya 15-18k ideally (?)  maybe less.  Alternatively, you could camp the Lizard earring in Cazic Thule zone (not sure where it drops).<br />
3. Amygdalan Chain Mask has 85 raw hp on it.<br />
4. Valorium Ring of Gallantry would also be a small boost.<br />
<br />
You might find that levelling to 60 is worthwhile.<br />
<br />
About weapons: I used Frostbringer and the snare whip when POP was still kinda new, then used a GSoT (was rare back then, had a lot of inspects), then I used CHoS / SoTB for quite a while.  They held better aggro than a GSoT.  I fooled around with a Stormrider Carapace (FB3) but I can vouch that not only did I lose DPS with a shield, I also found a noticeable loss in aggro.  I'd reallly vouch for the CHoS / SoTB combo... or at least your CHoS / sandstone sword... either of those would work tons better than your shield.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

I'm ranting, I know, but if you come here for help or to ask a question, you would be best served stating yourself clearly.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, it's particulary difficult to understand what you want when english is not your primary langage, because you have to find a translation in english fisrt and then another one in our own langage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it adds flavor to the post. The majority of the posts in here are gear evaluations. When it is presented like this, it is a bit different atleast. Anyone remember CJ ? He did the same, people seemed to enjoy it. Altough I'm sure a few flamed him for it...<br />
<br />
Hello derailment !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Destroy anything on it with Furious Bash.  It's the biggest joke in the game in terms of what it LOOKS Like it does compared to what it actually does.<br />
<br />
It's great for AC, and great of Rampage tanking (one of my main duties as a non-MA), otherwise situational.  <br />
<br />
Using that shield in an XP group is not worth the lost DPS, the reduced aggro, etc.  Put it in your bank or click yes on Destroy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orngart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tanks for da weapon smarts Torulf, FurryCrew and korgo. <br />
<br />
Mez will use da CHoS / Sandstone Hilt and put da bad shield back in da bag.<br />
<br />

What you probably don't realise is that if you look at his profile it says:<br />
<br />
Location: Australia<br />
<br />
Now you've probably seen Russell Crow at the Oscars or something and think that all Australians speak pretty normal english, but Russell Crow is actually a Kiwi which is why he's pretty articulate.  Poor Orngart isn't actually roleplaying, he's just speaking Australian English (otherwise known as &quot;Munter&quot;).<br />
