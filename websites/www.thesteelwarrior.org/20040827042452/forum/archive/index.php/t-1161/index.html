<br />
Same as an Air Conditioner (That's why an AC and a Fridge blow hot air out their vent) it's basically taking a Vapour, condcencing it into a liquid (The vapor takes up more space, and has more heat in it, the liquid then has the same heat in a much smaller area, so is hotter) Then runs the liquid passed a fan to cool it off (blowing the hot air out) then lets the liquid go back to vapor form inside the fridge, which absorbs the heat there, and cools the inside.<br />
<br />
The liquid/vapor mentioned is the CFC's that enviromentalists care about... Freon, or now R-22(?).<br />
<br />
What you did was let breeze that cools off the liquid flow faster, with less resistance. So the compressor and the fan don't have to run as often. So it runs quiter and uses less elecricity.<br />
<br />
Make sense? a HVAC mechenic could probably explain it better. I'm just a geek who enjoyed high school physics.</div></div><hr />
