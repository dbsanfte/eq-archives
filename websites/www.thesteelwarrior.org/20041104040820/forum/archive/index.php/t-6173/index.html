<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smfannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys i recently picked up this <br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23837<br />
<br />
and im wondering on the effect, does it work with area effect ? :) <br />
15% chance of reflection, it seems to proc alot. But im wondering is it one of those weapons you want to keep ? EG will it reflect MT DD spells how exactly does it work ? is worth putting the anger 3 aug on it ? or go the ykesha stun/dd. But really interested in effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The first thing to notice is that Mirror III only lasts 3 ticks.<br />
<br />
The second thing to notice is that Mirror III only reflects player castable spells.<br />
<br />
The third thing to notice is that Mirror III has close to no aggro.<br />
<br />
Remember that with 305 dex, on average, it will proc every 5 ticks in your mainhand, or every 10 ticks in your offhand.<br />
<br />
Since it takes an average of 5 ticks to make it proc the first time, this doesn't leave much of any fight, in which you are being cast upon by player-castable spells, for the 15% chance to actually fire.<br />
<br />
The best thing about this weapon is that it sells to ignorant players for great coin.  This is a Splitblade of Destruction for non-warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bought a Mirror I augment and put it on my sword of the bloodsworn back when LDoN first came out. Mainly I wanted to see if it was good, because reflecting spells sounded like it would be handy. <br />
<br />
Basically, it's junk. In all the time I've had it on there, I have seen it bounce one spell - against a mob in Plane of Hate. One time since the first week of LDoN, and it procs constantly. Soon as I have points to add a damage increaser or some other proc, I'm replacing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I currently use one in offhand, because of the lack of having anything else. The proc generates  no agro, and for the amount of times this procs it is pretty useless. It may proc a bit more then I think because I offhand it, but not a keeper for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it's the murphy's law proc brought to relality well as real as eq anyway.<br />
<br />
you will proc every other swing on a non casting mob.<br />
it will never draw agro unless you don't want it to.<br />
when it works the only person to care will be you.<br />
the wizzy you just dueled will spend the next 30 min trying to figure out how you just nuked him for 2.5k, and spend the next 3 days calling you a cheat in every zone while trying to get a rematch.</div></div><hr />
