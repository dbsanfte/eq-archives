<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally scraped together enough points to buy anger III this weekend after selling back my AC augments, Anger II, and a couple of other augs.   I have 25 wins at the Everfrost camp for a total of 1310 points earned there.  My available points were 1188, 38 more than is needed for Anger III.  I had seen Anger III listed in the past on my screen when I looked at an EF LDoN merchant, greyed out due to lack of avail points, but when I went to buy A3 this weekend, I couldnt even see it.<br />
<br />
After about 4 petitions, I got 2 different answer back from SoE folks.  First response was this was a &quot;known&quot; game bug and to /bug report it.  The next 2 replies told me I didnt have enough available points.  Finally, a human being contacted me and let me know that I needed more wins at this camp to open up the item.<br />
<br />
I'd thought you just had to earn the points to open up the items.  Did this change??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bet on the first responce : it's a bug<br />
the two second are dumb as shit and should be /feedback half of your GM aren't competant<br />
the third responce is possible but I doubt it's true because 25 wins of normal LDoN is more points than A3. Moreover you were able to see it before and you don't consume wins when buying stuff (only pts). So if you need more wins to see it it means they bugged the win limit since you were able and you can't anymore. thus it gets back to the first solution.<br />
<br />
so your parse on GM capacity is on 4 GM:<br />
2 are incompetents<br />
1 is competent but to tired to understand your situation correctly and gave you partialy correct answer. but still he may be right since you may see them after a given # of wins (above 25 at least). thus getting over the bug issue.<br />
1 is competant and gave you correct answer even if it doesn't help you.<br />
<br />
Note : if both #1 and #4 GM are correct then a full answer would have been :<br />
&quot;this is a known bug that will be corrected with next patch. the visible items on merchant list is based on the wins #. there is a bug that make wins count for 0.x instead of 1. thus if you don't want to wait for the next patch (unknown shudle), you can increase you wins score to get over the new step. for 1120pts you now need xx wins instead of xx.&quot;<br />
thanks SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, so im not 100% behind the times.<br />
<br />
I gave up, went back to Anger II for now and got my AC augs back (ended up with 1 more than I had so 5 more AC for me =).  I'll grind out the missions for A3 at a later date.  Just freaking annoying.  I waited for months to win a roll on a GBoS, finally win it and now I cannot put A3 on it.<br />
<br />
I ALMOST put the FoY aug on it, but thank god I didnt have enough points opened in sro to get it. The push on the GBoS by itself is enough for me, I'll stick with anger (and I dont give a hoot which is better aggro, I dont play in riftseekers yet).  I'm enjoying my AC augs again though =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this problem a little while back when I was grinding points for my Nro breastplate.  I had 1400 points at one point and couldn't see the armor at all.  It seemed to fix itself after OoW came out and I updated my UI.  If you're using a custom UI you could try to update it or reload your default when you're attempting the purchase.  Worth a shot I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I did reset to the default UI.  Even renamed all my .ini files with my char name in them and downloaded fresh ones.  Neither worked.  I made two bug reports about it, so hopefully that help them clear up the sitiuation.</div></div><hr />

I hope they get it all worked out man, I would be so pissed if after I did all those damn EF LDoN's that I couldn't get my Anger III Aug.  You definately deserve it after the 50+ hours of stupid crawls.  GL   :cool:</div></div><hr />
