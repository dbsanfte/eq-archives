<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanerin</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello there everyone.<br />
<br />
   I have recently picked up LDON and GoD after taking a break since PoP came out.  I am looking to play a new class, and a warrior seems like it would be very fun.<br />
<br />
I am looking for some information about gear and starting stats.<br />
<br />
I will be making a barb., and was wondering if it was best to put all my points into STA?  I am mainly going to be playing this warrior in xp groups, and don't plan on raiding for high level gear for awhile.<br />
<br />
As for gear, could you help me with some good choices?  I have 20k to spend to twink him, and was wondering what would be the best way to spend that money.  What haste item should I look for?  What weapons?  What armor?<br />
<br />
I could prob. get 30k if needed, so any help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
And one last thing....<br />
   When i left, the warriors were still in need of love for agro/ect...<br />
Has the melee revamp made a good effort for warriors to be able to hold agro?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help you can provide!</div></div><hr />

Soulscream belt + copper hammer of striking + sword of the bloodsworn would be you best option, just see what you can stretch your plat to afford.  Get 2x Velium Fire Wedding rings aswell.<br />
<br />
Then make sure you either hit tribunal or rallos as your diety and save up for / collect the components for Fierce Heraldic / Helanic Tundra armour which will fill every other slot apart from ears/range as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30k.. on my server soulscream is 20k. then get two lammys for 22<br />
next full set of some type of good armor.. nothing amazing just good. you'd be lucky to get a full set of FH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanerin</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies so far.  I was leaning towards getting that soulscream belt.  I am not sure about the lammys though, and i think FH armor would be too expensive (for now) on my budget.  I will worry more about the FH when i get near the 40's.  I was basicly thinking of getting that soulscream belt, and buying crusty or acryila armor.  A main thing im stuck on is the weapons.  I don't think 2 lammys would be good for this low of level.  Any suggestions?  Thanks again!<br />
<br />
Also, the sword of the bloodsworn has a rec. level of 56.. and the copper 1hb also has a rev. level.<br />
Should I get those so early? What about getting a frosty/something else instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rec lvl means nothing, you'll still hit for full damage reguardless of what the weapon says, you just dont get all the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you talking about zynth?<br />
<br />
Recommended level surely does mean something.  You telling me a level 1 can use a weapon with recommended level 60 and have it do full damage?  I'm calling BS on that one unlesss you can prove it.  That goes against everything I've thought/been told about recommended level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a low level warrior Gothic Steel Plate (LDoN smithed armor) is some pretty nifty stuff too.  Should be cheap (75pp-300pp depending on which piece you're looking at), and nicely complements some of the other sets out there. (I wouldnt buy a full set of anything, except maybe cultural, :) I'd mix and match crusty, crafted, acrylia, gothic and get the best piece for each slot).  And if you're going to level past the mid levels, pick either RZ or tribunal and get some FH or HT, I prefer HT, but that's because I'm still wearing alot of it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone can test it. grab any weapon with a recomended lvl (1 damage at lvl1) and a fine steel dagger (3 damage), put them on a fresh lvl 1 character and tell me which does more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The recomended level for weapons is broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're probably thinking about the damage cap. Your max hit before 20, is still below 30, so the rec level is br0ked.</div></div><hr />
