<br />
Going back to elemetry school, as I recall, that is actaully a funny ha-ha line. Cracking corn is turning corn into moonshine. So Jimmy is the local bootlegger, and everyone in the county knows where his 'secret' still is. Old Master went away (again from memory) was that he was drunk on Jimmy's shine when a fly bit his horse and he fell..or some variation there on.<br />

It's all Truth, Honor, Integrity and shit until some young half elf exposes the Brown Eye, then its like a prison movie. Don't be all like &quot;But The Quon, I'm really not gay, you're just looking a little under the weather, let me rub it better...&quot; I swear to god if you ever inspect my equip, I'm gonna light your shit up, Yo.

Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, &quot;I think I'll squeeze these dangly things here, and drink whatever comes out&quot; <br />
Ya see; when you're a newb and suckling on yer momma; the knowledge is there and instailled. Unfortunately; someone replaced their mum with a cow and the rest is history.<br />
<br />
Who was the first one who thought that the white thing that came from a hen's butt looked edible?<br />
See beforementioned youth who replaced their mum with the cow. unfortunately; one sunny afternoon while frying ants with his trusty magnifing glass; a hen in the henhouse knocked one of her eggs down upon the floor; and the kid saw how the ooze curled and turned hard while chasing the ants who were flocking to the mess. ants became trapped; ants and egg got roasted under magnifying glass..kid was hungry...mmm <br />
<br />
Why do toasters always have a setting that burns the toast to a horrible crisp which no decent human being would eat?<br />
This predates the toaster; almost returning man to his Neanderthal state; who thought for some odd reason after lightning struck a tree dow; to throw as many dead antelopes on top of the burning tree in order to make their meat more pleasurable to consume. the Neanderthals; taking a hint from their distant cousins the Australopithecus who learned to corral and breed loaves of sabertooth bread. To tame the sabertooth bread; they had to insert them between two rocks under which a lighning felled tree was burning. Unfortunately; not many trees grew under rocks nor were hit by lightning; henceforth the sabertooth bread were spared this horrible death and suffered extinction before the first Cretaceus period. But they like burned bread. So did the Neanderthals. It became a recessive trait still to this day; and why people still make brnt toast without knowing why and never questioning the producers of the Toaster who also are compelled to add that option.  <br />
<br />
Why is there a light in the fridge and not in the freezer?<br />
That's an Easy One. Elephants don't live in Freezers. The Mastodons that inhabit your freezer have infravision and don't need lights. <br />
<br />
If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares, why is there a song about him?<br />
The Master Went away; and only he knows the answer to this age-old riddle. Kailyn summed up the basic facts of this but i'm sure The Master knows the Truth. <br />
<br />
Can a hearse carrying a corpse drive in the carpool lane?<br />
No. Corpses don't belong in Car-Pools. Only Cars belong there. Corpses go into Corpse-Pools, or Dead Pools. Ask Clint Eastwood. He's been there. <br />
<br />
If the professor on Gilligan's Island can make a radio out of coconut, why can't he fix a hole in a boat?<br />
Ahh, the sad sad story of the RPofessor. HIs only contact with women was to on THAt island; and he knew if he went back to civilization he'd be swirling his graduated cylinder with his lab mates if you know what i'm sayin'...The Professor I am certain is behind the altered weather reports that showed a clear sail for their 3 hour tour. <br />
<br />
Why do people point to their wrist when asking for the time, but don't point to their crotch when they ask where the bathroom is?<br />
Because they know where there watch is; but when nature calls they are usually holding thier crotch, not pointing at it. also, an errant poke might dislodge some urinary fluid and totally make a wash of things. <br />
<br />
Why does your OB-GYN leave the room when you get undressed if they are going to look up there anyway?<br />
I'm not sure of this one. The last tiem I was in an OB-GYn's office they asked me what the hell I was doing there and threatened to call the police. I left rather hurriedly and unfortunately; we may never know. <br />
<br />
Why does Goofy stand erect while Pluto remains on all fours? They're both dogs!<br />
Obviously; Goofy is only half-dog. His roots follow a twisted courting of Donald Duck and some unknown 'toon who chose to remain anonymous at this time.  If you look close enough you see that Pluto is 100% dog; while Goofy's pants hide his true secret.<br />
<br />
What do you call male ballerinas?<br />
A Ballerina. any dude who runs around in his Danskins and Leg Warmers while dancing around like an idiot SHOULD be called a ballerina. Pretty Easy.<br />
<br />
If Wile E. Coyote had enough money to buy all that Acme stuff, why didn't he just buy dinner?<br />
The McGyver principle explains it best. Why do it the easy way when you can grab the most ineffective tools and means of completing a task and gain all the wimmens love and affection for being &quot;such a smart chap&quot; and completing the task like no other ever would have thought. <br />
<br />
If quizzes are quizzical, what are tests?<br />
Testicals. Males can symphasize with me here on this one; when you happen to jump over a fence and not quite make it over..that's how it feels taking tests. Test was the shortened version of Testicals for that reason alone. Pain.<br />
<br />
If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, then what is baby oil made from?<br />
Usually from Babies who were tossed out with the bathwater. Bathwater; being an already moisturizing substance; startd to be in short supply. Especially in Europe during the &quot;Black Plague&quot;; and people forgot to straint misplaced babies from the bathwater and used them as loofah sponges. This practice has been banned in most countries and now synthetic babies are squeezed and made into oil. <br />
<br />
If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from morons?<br />
Yes. and No. moralty usually is a by-product of watching some moron rather than the moron itself. Osmosis takes place and knowledge is gained. Thank any moron you see for teaching you morality.  <br />
<br />
Is Disney World the only people trap operated by a mouse?<br />
Jerry, of Tom&amp; Jerry fame; is also behind this plot. I bet you never see a cat leave Disney Land have you? Kinda like chinese restaurants. <br />
<br />
Why do the Alphabet song and Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star have the same tune?<br />
Blame the Australopithecus. They weren't accomplished Jazz musicians or anythign you know.  <br />
<br />
Do illiterate people get the full effect of Alphabet Soup?<br />
Unfortunately; no knowledge is gained from Alphabet Soup. Unless you know the prearranged combinations of words themselves it gives no desired effect. Ever go see a Guns and Roses concert? Same thing. Someone feeding you lots of letters that mean nothing does nothing but irritate you. <br />
<br />
Why is it that when someone tells you that there are over a billion stars in the universe, you believe them, but if they tell you there is wet paint somewhere, you have to touch it to make sure?<br />
because men; being of clearly superior intellect; know when someone tells them no it clearly means that &quot;this is mine and you can't have it&quot;; or if a woman says &quot;no&quot; it really means &quot;you know i am so upset over this and i know i shouldn't be saying this but my friends told me that if i were to sit on this bench i would stain my dress i got from the gap for 19 dollars and if i had to return it i'd have to see marcy who is really a bitch and charged me too much not like sally who she gave the discount to&quot;..so to put an end to the possible scenario the male sticks his hand on the wet paint. it's now clearly his territory to claim over other males waiting to touch the bench; and to women it means not standing in line for 3 hours at the gap to return a dress that isn't yours.<br />

Bizare facts<br />
<br />
If you yelled for eight years, seven months and six days, you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it!)<br />
<br />
If you pass air consistently for six years and nine months, enough gas is  produced to create the energy of<br />
an atomic bomb. (That one's easy to understand, isn't it?)<br />
<br />
The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 9.5 m. (And you<br />
thought those Monty Python guys didn't do any fact checking!)<br />
<br />
A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life I want to be a pig!)<br />
<br />
Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (Still not over that pig thing!)<br />

<br />
You can't kill yourself by holding your breath.<br />
<br />
Americans on the average eat 18 ha of pizza every day. (It shows.)<br />
<br />
Every time you lick a stamp, you're consuming one-tenth of a calorie.<br />
<br />
You are more likely to be killed by a champagne cork than by a poisonous spider. (Moral: Always be willing<br />
to pay extra for good champagne. Cheap champagne is not worth the risk.)<br />
<br />
Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do. (So those teachers<br />
that used to whack your left hand with a ruler and make you write with your right hand were actually trying to do you a favor, the miserable, misguided,<br />
fascist, sadistic bastards.)<br />
<br />
In ancient Egypt, priests plucked every hair from their bodies, including their eyebrows and eyelashes. (That's a real leg crosser!)<br />
<br />
A crocodile cannot stick its tongue out.<br />
<br />
The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30 times its own weight and always falls over on its right side when intoxicated. (How did they know<br />
that?)<br />
<br />
Polar bears are left-handed. (This means they live, on average, nine years less.)<br />
<br />

have an order of 6, 9 or 12 Chicken McNuggets. I asked for a half dozen nuggets. <br />
 &quot;We don't have half dozen nuggets,&quot; said the teenager at the counter. <br />
 &quot;You don't?&quot; I replied. <br />
&quot;We only have six, nine, or twelve,&quot; was the reply. &quot; <br />
 So I can't order half-dozen nuggets, but I can order six?&quot; <br />
  &quot;That's right.&quot; <br />
 So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets. <br />

I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her car. &quot;Do you need some help?&quot; I asked.  She replied, &quot;I knew I should have replaced the battery to this remote door UN-locker. Now I can't get into my car. Do you think they (pointing to a distant convenient store) would have a battery to fit this?&quot; <br />
&quot;Hmmm, I dunno. Do you have an alarm too?&quot; I asked. <br />
 <br />
&quot;No, just this remote thingy,&quot; she answered, handing it and the car keys to me. <br />
As I took the key and manually unlocked the door, I replied, &quot;Why don't you drive over there and check about the batteries. It's a long walk.&quot; <br />

Several years ago, we had an Intern who was none too swift. One day she was typing and turned to a secretary and said, &quot;I'm almost out of typing paper. What do I do?&quot; <br />
  &quot;Just use copier machine paper,&quot; the secretary told her. With that, the intern took <br />
her last remaining blank piece of paper, put it on the photocopier and proceeded to make five &quot;blank&quot; copies. <br />

I was in a car dealership a while ago, when a large motor home was towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle was in dire need of repair and the whole thing generally looked like an extra in Twister. I asked the manager what had happened. He told me that the driver had set the cruise control and then went in the back to make a sandwich. <br />
~~~~~~ <br />
Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania, interrogated a suspect by placing a metal colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy machine. The message &quot;He's lying&quot; was placed in the copier, and police pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect wasn't telling the truth. Believing the &quot;lie detector&quot; was working, the suspect <br />
confessed. <br />

<br />
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied, &quot;When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.&quot; <br />
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. <br />
Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:<br />
 <br />
1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. <br />
<br />
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. <br />
<br />
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. <br />
<br />
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. <br />
<br />
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass. <br />
<br />
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C. <br />
<br />
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook. <br />
<br />
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him. <br />
<br />
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass. <br />
<br />
10. We do not refer to the cross as the &quot;Big T.&quot; <br />
<br />
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, &quot;Take this and eat it for it is my body.&quot; He did not say &quot;Eat me&quot; <br />
<br />
12. The Virgin Mary is not called &quot;Mary with the Cherry&quot; <br />
<br />
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: &quot;Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yay God &quot;. <br />
<br />
14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's. <br />

1. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit. <br />

3. How about &quot;never&quot;? Is &quot;never&quot; good for you? <br />

10. Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the subject. <br />
11. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. <br />
12. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce. <br />
13. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. <br />
14. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid. <br />
15. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!? <br />
16. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. <br />
17. Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view. <br />
18. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. <br />
