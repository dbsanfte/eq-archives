<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been tossing this idea around for a while and thought I'd get some input from some of those who seem to be in the know.  When I first started my warrior, December of 1999, I had really really bad gear but as a barbarian I did ok.  Recently for change of pace I started a half elf ranger in equally bad gear, and an iksar monk in mediocre gear.  In both of the smaller race incarnations, it SEEMS like I spend alot more time stunned than I did at that level with a barbarian.  (as a matter of fact I deleted the ranger for just that reason) I know that Ogres have front arc melee stun immunity, but I'm curious if the rest of the large races have a smaller degree of front stun immunity.  In other words is it something like Ogres - totally immune, Trolls - can be stunned but not frequently, Barbarian - More frequenly stunned than trolls, but less so than Human sized and smaller?  Just based on my observations and I don't have any numbers to back it up.   Was just curious if anyone else has had similar experiences.<br />

There's a certain level that once you get over it, you never take normal melee stuns, and only get stunned from bashes.  That seems to be the case as far as my recollection goes too...because I remember being level 10 or 11 and getting stunned by normal hits from mobs, and now the only hits that stun me are bashes/kicks.<br />
<br />
Don't recall specifics, but that stuck in my head for awhile.</div></div><hr />

I know my base sta was waaay higher as a barb than it was as an elf or iksar.  Might have to see if I can dig up that old thread.  Also it would be another factor in the consideration of which race to play if that is the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haas said unbuffed stam and not base stam that might related to being stuns.  So it really doesn't matter what race you want to play as over time gears will overcome any low base stam char you might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right. I misread what he was saying. Does anyone know what range of sta you have to get to before you start seeing this?  I hate to admit it, but the monk is really fun to play and I'd like to get his sta high enough that he doesnt spend half of every fight stunned. :)</div></div><hr />

I believe somebody posted that they removed this stamina based stun immunity when they introduced the Stalwart Endurance AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wouldn't it be hard including if you fight different mobs longer fights etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't surprise me at all.  While we're on the topic....<br />
<br />
I remember the patch before PoP came out, I was getting stunned like a goddamned rag doll, and I literally never got stunned before.  I had to get stalwart endurance asap just to get back the same level I had prior to this new expansion coming out.<br />
<br />
So, since a lot of what is being said here is based upon our memory of stuff that we saw a long time ago, and EQ has changed quite a bit since then, you may wanna check into it again yourself if you're not capable of directly influencing your stun chance via Stalwart Endurance (bullshit, imo.  Introduce an AA, and take away something you've always had and make you get it again.  Major reason a lot of people have quit EQ.  But that's another story for another time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;and an iksar monk in mediocre gear.

<br />
Some things to keep in mind ...<br />
<br />
1) Iksar are a LARGE race. They have to duck in Sol B, humans do not. They have to duck in a lot of places humans do not. Humans are a medium race. Iksar have shamans. All large races have shamans.<br />
<br />
2) Monks get stunned more than warriors. The change in monk mitigation created that FUN little problem there. More max hits = higher chance to get stunned. Esepecially, it seems, from behind, while PULLING. Getting raped on pulls is always such a joyous thing for a monk. It's like, hey, let me do my job (pulling) but get wrecked doing it, die, and slow everyone down! Yeah, that'll make me the most popular toon in the zone! <br />
<br />
Ok, enough ranting by me, point is ... if your monk was getting stunned too much it has nothing to do with him being a smaller race, cause he's not. It has to do with him being a MONK, and him wearing crappy armor. Which brings me to the FINAL point that needs to be made about stun:<br />
<br />
3) Rangers and Monks don't mitigate as well as warriors.</div></div><hr />

I wish they were bigger.  You know how many I have to kill just for one meal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as my experience shows, I only get stunned when I get bashed for max (or VERY near) max bash damage.<br />
<br />
I'm a half-elf with 95 base sta, and around 130ish with gear but not buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had already 200+ stamina when pop was released and i remember very well how annoying the first groups in PoV were (especially in wastelands with the spiders) and how often i was stunned.<br />
Of course i had only 23 AA(run3,regen3,nd3 and aetaunt) and was level 61 when i got flagged for PoV/S last November but it still was annoying.<br />
Now with 271 base sta i still get stunned regularly although stalwart endurance 1 seems to help a lot - I love the 'You avoid a stunning blow' message.<br />
As soon as I have finished Innate defense (at level 2 now, 8 more AA to go) I will finish Stalwart Endurance for that very reason.</div></div><hr />
