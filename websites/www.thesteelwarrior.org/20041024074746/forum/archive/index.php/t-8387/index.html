<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karthanon_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All right, I know that I can pick up many of the pieces for the warrior epic pre-51 (which seems to be a 'break even' point for many classes to start their epic), however, I haven't seen any authoritative information anywhere as to what level you are required to be to do turn-in's (for instance, Rangers cannot speak to the individual to start their epic quest before level 51).<br />
<br />
At first glance, I'd guess that 46 is the requirement (due to needing to get into PoA for the Wingblade, PoH for the Hand of the Maestro, etc) but I don't want a bunch of NPC's to chew up the pieces I've managed to get. :)<br />
<br />
Any idea if that is indeed correct? Or should I wait until 51? (Yes, I'm currently only level 48, don't hurt me.. /wink)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance.</div></div><hr />

with my necro i did a few of the early stages that included handing in certain<br />
not all to hard to get items, had no problems and i was in the 30-35 range.<br />
<br />
But if anything is hard to get or you have to start over like for beastlords i would<br />
wait just to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">iirc, you can do basicly all of the early hand ins pre50 no problem, but you can't do the final hand ins  (wingblade andsuch) until 50. <br />
<br />
Personally, I would wait until 50 to be safe.</div></div><hr />
