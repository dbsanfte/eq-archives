<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not exactly sure where I should be putting this, but I figured the class balance area is best because it deals with hp totals between tanks.  They've added new placeholders for the OoW spells and while some are interesting (A new cleric symbol with more hp than Aegolism), one really caught my eye.<br />
<br />
The new Paladin upgrade to AotC is now on the same line as Focus/Shielding/Armor spells.  It won't stack like AotC did.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not trying to start an argument, just thought I'd let people know where they put the spell at first.  I don't know whether it'll be moved or not, since Paladin spells have already been adjusted for OoW.<br />
<br />
You can see all the placeholders for OoW spells here (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?searchtext=Omen).  Some, like the druid and cleric spells, have been altered already but others like the shaman, enchanter and bard haven't been touched.<br />
<br />
What really is interesting is that Symbol and Nine upgrades alone will put you at 1990hp in buffs, and the new cleric large heal is 500hp more than it's GoD upgrade...makes me wonder just how hard they expect the mobs to hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They fook with AoTC, they better screw with ranger/sk etc self only buffs as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting, no meele abilities :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All in all, extremely disappointing so far.<br />
<br />
From a quick perusal of the spells, it reminds me of nothing so much as 5 levels worth of GoD spells.<br />
<br />
There's very few significant upgrades in any of those spells, certainly not the same kind of stuff seen in PoP.<br />
<br />
I'm seeing no new disciplines or abilities for the melee yet. Hope we don't get screwed again and get nothing for new abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Int casters stuff are obviously not done.  Pure melee stuff is obviously not done either.  Bst/Sham stuff are missing too (spells are just placeholders).<br />
<br />
Nothing horribly exciting from what I've seen.  Paladin shouldn't be getting another line of upgrade to AoTC but it's a relatively small problem.  The bigger problem is their ability to stun level 70 mobs for 80 mana.  That will break a lot of old encounters, and I don't mean like going back to Luclin with level 65, we're talking about 3 Paladins can prevent anything that can be stunned from ever doing damage at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;They fook with AoTC, they better screw with ranger/sk etc self only buffs as well&quot; - quote<br />
<br />
You do know that AoTC was never meant to stack in the way it does, right? i.e. the virtue + focus + brells + AoTC wasn't meant to be able to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They fook with AoTC, they better screw with ranger/sk etc self only buffs as well<br />
Except that the shadowknight buff is a self-only Brell's.  We can have either brell's, cloak, or strength of tunare(depending on the situation).  It already doesn't stack.<br />
<br />
And anyway, they're not testing any changes to your Brell's line, but rather to your watered-down Armor of the Zealot clones, which never should have stacked with focus to begin with.  SK's have no spells along that line(or, more parent-class appropriate, along the Shielding line) to screw with, and even Sony might have problems changing spells that don't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's looking like a lot of the stuff is just the old spells with 30% added.  They should be doing some tuning in the next couple of months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SK only have a gripe about AotC because whenever ppl comapred end-game knight vs warrior hp it was always a paladin used to do the comparison... Forgetting that SKs are 200+ hp behind because we don't get an extra hp buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ariakkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">depending on how the buffs come out...(someone with mroe time an energy can figure it up if they like)<br />
<br />
<br />
if the new AoTC+cleric buffs isn't greater than, new cleric buffs+focus+old aotc, noone is going to use the new version.<br />
<br />
and if new version does net more hp, than all we lost was some mana regen and ac, which i personally don't give two shits about, its the hp that matter to me. the hp advantage over SK's or closer to warriors doesn't really mean jack to me, i don't play to measure my dick to the guy standing next to me, it's about practicality.<br />
<br />
but on another note, can anyone...even warriors, look at our spell line up for OoW and tell me it was in any way shape or form imaginitive?</div></div><hr />
