There are a few ideas for you on some upgrades.  It all can be single grouped no need for a large raid force.<br />
<br />
That should keep you busy adventuring for a while. Providing much satisfaction and enjoyment in the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulic</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an alternate to royal attendant greaves, I would suggest:<br />
<br />
Malevolent Greaves of Suffering ( 760 AP in Miragul's )<br />
AC:44, Sta:8, Cha:8, Wis:5, Int:5, HP:70, Mana:65, CR:10, MR:10<br />
type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
Depending on how quickly you acquire points, these are a much better buy imo even though royal attendant are obviously better.<br />
<br />
Think about it...if you spend 1492 ( almost double ) you get:<br />
<br />
8 less stamina, 4 more ac, 15 more hps.<br />
<br />
Decide which is more suited for you, should you go the LDoN route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a few more suggestions:<br />
<br />
First, how's your dual wield setup working for agro?  I'd personally be using your GSoT in your bag, but if you wanted to dual wield I'd of course recommend the Droga weapons to start.  Your current dual wield combo seems a little iffy for agro at your level.<br />
<br />
Next, haste.  Your Dragonborn sash is only 2ac, and no other stats.  Enchanted Sash of Wonder or Soulscream Belt are excellent candidates for an upgrade to your sash.  Not only are they 31% haste, but have nice stats too.<br />
<br />
Next, there are several &quot;areas of opportunity&quot; in your armor.  Your wrists probably could use immediate attention.  Velious armor would be a nice AC boost, a spot where you're a little behind at.  I'd also look at your legs, as the AC is a little low here too.  Velious is an option, but Kylong Darkmail would work here too. Lastly, the AC on your shoulders is a little weak, considering it's essentially a cloth item you've got there.  <br />
<br />
And of course, Ornate and LDoN armor would be upgrades too.  You should probably be shooting for either/or as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have been trying to Upgrade to Bone Golem Greaves.(from SSRA, great stats)<br />
I actually have 700 something in EF but saving for an Anger 2.<br />
<br />
My duel wield works great for agro actually, infact, i ussually can tank with my 2hander, and keep agro.<br />
<br />
Ornate would be great, but im broke lmao.<br />
<br />
THanks for the advice, i have been trying tp upgrade. Lata</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baashem</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quests. Think quests. Faction in droga and do the Spirit Wracked Cords and Regal Band of Balthazid quest. If you can get 2-3 groups together, get some crystalized acid bracers and shoulders from Cazic Thule, or farm some of the earrings that drop there: Mosquito, Lizard Bone and Lizard Tooth earrings. Do that Loyalist Shield of Honor quest. 50 AC, 75 hp cloak.<br />
<br />
PS - I'm tired. I know this is incoherant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see you are apparently in Kael. I would get a vindi or even the Doorf plate bp. Look for hp's and AC on all items you are upgrading. You will most likely find lots in the bazaar. A new haste item with some stats would be nice, but if you don't have that kind of cash atm. get the haste last</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good upgrade for your shoulder slot would be draconic pauldrons.  Easy quest, 12 sta on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fierce heraldic would be the fastest upgrade....if you had chosen to worship Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
My recommendation is to delete your war and start over ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">any heraldic armor would probably upgrade some of your slots and can be had for far less than the fortune it use to cost.  fierce heraldic is just better because all the pieces get an additional +30hp.  Don't discount heraldic if you're not the right deity for fierce though.  <br />
<br />
I second the draconic pauldrons suggestion.  Go read up on the quest.  All you do is kill those gimp dragon slayers in WW.  You take their heads to some npc in SS and get ac15 +12 str/sta shoulders.  I wore them for a hell of a long time until I finally finished the strength of the elements quest recently (ac15 +15 str +100hp shoulders).<br />
<br />
Sorry, I can't view magelo from this old browser right now, so I don't know what weapons you're using.  But I probably wouldn't spend a bunch of points on an anger aug if you're putting it in a sub par weapon.  Get the club of the mad researcher for 1150 pts in EF and then augment as you can (anger III for 1150, +2 dmg from takish for 1150).</div></div><hr />
