Just wondered what everyone's preference for an OS is.  I'm currently using Windows 98 *only upgraded from 95 when/because Luclin came out :p*, and I'm quite happy with it.  But, I'm just wondering if something else works better ?  Thanks in advance for your input.</div></div><hr />

Maybe not a big deal for you, but XP won't run some versions of old school Doom :)</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm . . . I'm currently using win2kpro on my two machines, but my main machine has a gig and a half of DDR, would I see a performance increase by kicking up to XP or does win2k have what I need to fully utilize my memory?  I feel so out of it, I used to be the kinda person that answered that question not asked it  :(</div></div><hr />

You should see a performance incresse going to XP becuse it SHOULD mange the memory better, not saying it dose but should<br />
<br />
If You have more then 512 In your system tho get XP it will fully utilize the memory 98 I am sorry to say wont, win2K had some Major bugs in it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?  In my experience 98 crashes 10 times as much as XP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heck i still played on my p2 450mhz 384mb till last december when i finaly gave up on it. and upgraded. only reason it had xp was school had the discs for $35 usd.<br />
<br />
it's realy hard to belive howmany people hang on to 98, so many that ms had to continue support for like another year or so.</div></div><hr />

I also agree with the 1gig of ram comment, no matter what OS you select... feed it lots of juicy ram, as much as you can afford. <br />
<br />
I bought my PC entirely to play Everquest, other than that I would have no use for it. <br />
<br />
Best operating system overall is Mac OSX but I won't elaborate since I'm not looking to start a flame war.</div></div><hr />
