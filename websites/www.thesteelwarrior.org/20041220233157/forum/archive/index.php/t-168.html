<br />
I've gotten 8 knights gleaming maces in a row from the jopal village.  Killed jopal crafter, chieftans, and the obsidian war spider.<br />
<br />
All there is, has been that fucking mace so far.   The nameds are rare enough (50 hours i have logged there).   I put in my Nth /feedback with reminding them not to fuck the warrior class for the enjoyment of the knights.   <br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong here?  Should i bother?  I'm guessing that this is the right camp... I can't see where else it could be in fire.</div></div><hr />

You'll get a tonne of those dumb maces. <br />

Way back early Elementals, I saw a few of those Staff of Eternal Flames things that drop from the Phoenixes now. The loot table used to consist of those 3 items (I think,) with the Sword being the rarest it looked like.</div></div><hr />

and ya its rare... i think there are 4 on torv...<br />

<br />
Haven't gotten one of em yet, but also really want one just for the niftyness factor (already have the other 3 items that can make warrior pets- brasier of elemental summoning, gnollslayer, and puppet strings) but swarm pets sound like just soooo much fun.<br />
<br />
Anyway- could someone with one and AE rampage do a test for me?  Get a shammy to slow you (increase chance to proc due to longer effective weapon delay), get dex to 305 (increase proc rate), main hand the pet sword (maximum number of attacks since no dual wield check), pull 40-50+ mobs (more is better!) and hit rampage?  <br />
<br />
Then, if you don't go LD, go 3rd person, take a screen shot and post it. :)<br />
<br />
I'll give it a shot when I finally get one of em, but I'm dying to know how many you can spit out at once...<br />

The 13th name dropped the sword for me. Took  2 months of killing names every patch/reset of the zone. Plus about 20 hours of clearing the area.<br />

But it was worth it. Really fun sword.</div></div><hr />

I think in total I have gotten about 12 maces. We were able to get all our sk's and pallies that stupid ass mace. Shit, I even looted one as a trophy for spending all that time.<br />
<br />
Two of our warriors did get it but by complete luck. One thing that seems to work is going to Fire after a patch or zone reset. This is how the two warriors in the guild got it.</div></div><hr />

I never really camped it either. Tholuxe Paells had just crashed after my guild had killed Rallos Zek. So I start setting up an exp group for fire.

Anyways , in my guild most of the warriors have this sword. Those who dont have it, didnt camp it for very long i think. Its not that rare in my experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have been in Plane of Fire since January 7th. We got 1st and only sword in the first weeks of Febuary. 2nd EP Guild got access about a few weeks before they servermoved to Venril Sathir. None dropped. 3rd EP guild got access late Febuary / early March none have dropped for them. 4th guild got EP access in early May, of which none have dropped.<br />
<br />
Please.. tell me once again how common they are. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Afterlife has quite a few also i believe, probably more than we do. <br />

Perhaps they are more common on Mith Marr than on other servers, we have some problems with getting bard Call weapons ourselves.. think we have only one of those.</div></div><hr />

Don't think of the sword, it won't drop anyhow!<br />

<br />
Anyone made a list of which of the mobs in the camp are PH for the named?  So far I've only seen ONE named memphit + lots of war spiders.<br />
<br />
Ele island: ph is one of the roamers, seems like some spawns are either trained spiders, elementals, or the war spider<br />
<br />
Small island: 4 memphits pop inside hut; ph for Seer seems to be 3rd from left, facing in (maybe 2nd?).<br />
<br />
Haven't yet seen any named on the main island; can kind of guess which ones might be PHs, but would love to hear what other folks have seen.<br />
<br />
Tally so far: 5 maces, 0 swords.  Did get a mace, rune, and spectral off one spider tho... made the damned casters happy at least.<br />

There is a small clearing straight out and to the left of the lava falls.  If you have lev, you can get there uninvised.<br />
<br />
A monk pulled mobs from all around that island but the one that comes to mind is mob outside one of the huts closest to the lava falls.  I think that is where I got my sword to drop.  I do not know which is a ph and not.  Though I would guess at the statics as being PH.</div></div><hr />

It took me 4 Crafters, 3 Chieftans, a Spider, and then the first Seer I saw dropped it.  It took me over a month of visiting this place off and on.<br />

Let me summarize PH locations:<br />
Chieften/Crafter are the two mephits in the middle of the 2nd hut from the left in the row of 4.<br />
Seer is in the hut on its own island, 2rd from the left, mystic ph.<br />
War Spider is on the little dinky isle infront; I only got him after he was left up by another group - don't know ph.<br />
Flame Protector ph is in the forth house from the left - he is the 2nd spawn from the left.<br />

Absolutely love the thing.  It can be a very high damage proc, with zero apparent aggro.  Nice for non-MT stuff.  Also a blast to pull it out in xp groups and get 3 or 4 Gronglpets chewing up the mobs with double 94s.<br />

It's too much trouble for something that's merely a toy. Think about the hours of your life wasted so you can just have what is for many, a far too rare sub-par weapon that makes neat looking pets. It looks crappy too :(.<br />

Risk vs reward... risk hours upon hours of your time and the reward is a neat looking particle weapon pet that lasts for 20 seconds :p :eek: :rolleyes: :p :eek: :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

This came up in chat the other day, and got me wondering how often the pet will shield a low health tank.  And how long it would live shielding you.  Several people said they had seen the pet shield before - I'd just never looked for it.  If anybody has extensive logs using the pet sword in low-health circumstances, it might be worth it to check the frequency of its shielding.  If it automatically pops shield when you go low health, it could be a useful tool.  If not, then oh well.<br />
<br />
Assuming it does auto-shield at low health and assuming 2ppm, that's up to 20 seconds per minute (most often less due to overlap) that you could have a free shield tank.  If it worked, you'd only have to slap an Anger 3 aug on it to make it reasonable for tanking once you were locked on the mob.</div></div><hr />

Trying to find the right place where I can pull 80+ one-hit kill mobs, make a key to rampage, /hidecorpse all, then quick take a couple screens.  Been thinking Kurn's.  Any other ideas of a good spot?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is getting that many mobs to follow you actually; if you want stuff to die in one swat, you'd probably have to try a newbie zone.  Another option would be to do an AE pull on the bears/cats in hollowshade (you can pull a LOT of mobs in the south town), and have another warrior friend pop a rampage with a shaker after you pop a ton of pets...<br />

I camped it pretty hard - solo'd the non-named phs by 2-boxing, and called for help (slow) on any named pops. The XP was decent, and the pulls were *cough* easy.<br />
<br />
I got 3 hopestones, 15+ essences of fire (gate talisman part), countless bloods and skins, 10+ magma crystals. I got NO saps from the spiders, and killed an awful lot of them, since I was keeping the spider isle clear. I suspect that the trained spiders do not drop saps.<br />
<br />
In any case - this swords kicks ass. The proc is non-aggro, and each pet does a pretty impressive amount of damage. I haven't found a blue mob to do serious analysis yet (8+ hour parsing).<br />
<br />
Good luck to those of you camping this - it's, imho, worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lilmissy</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some analysis. With 36% haste, dex of 250 or so, against a L61 blue mob, I logged 32,600 seconds (a bit over 9 hours) of OBS usage.<br />
<br />
OBS proc'd (I think) 765 times. Since there's no emote, it's difficult to tell for sure - I had some periods where I had pet activity for close to 2 minutes straight! Based on looking at a 'normal' pet's total attack events (hits &amp; misses), I figured each pet got in an average of 15 swings. So, total lines of attack(11480)/15=~765.<br />
<br />
Each pet averaged 404 total damage. (309,252/765)<br />
<br />
Taken over the entire battle, the OBS pet dps was: ~9.5. (309,252/32,600)<br />
<br />
OBS main-hand seconds/proc: 42.6. (procs/min=1.4)<br />
<br />
I didn't post the dps for the sword itself, since that would be (imho) irrelevant, and would be pretty variable based on the user's attack rating, haste, AA's, etc. However, based on some quick parses I did with Ornate Great Blade against the same mob, OBS+a decent OH nets about 14dps higher than the 2hs.<br />
<br />
I'm currently using OBS+Vyzh`dra's Render of Souls for my dps setup, and am pretty happy with the results (and the lack of aggro).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed OBS and BF for 30 min, rolling the pet damage into the total DPS, unbuffed, ATK was 1562 (max veng), 41% haste, 305 str dex agi.  DPS came out to be 104.  My Blade of War was parsed on the same mob for 30 minutes unbuffed as well, DPS was 108 on it.  Seems like it is a decent viable DPS weapon with another decent weapon paired with it.  I assume it would be spaced more though with haste on, I would think BoW would pick up alot of slack with buffs and haste.<br />
The mob I used was the red con guy in PoI factory, his name escapes me atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i got my luck when server reset, 1/1 on named spider. never do fire field 1 xping (coz it sucks in xp/unit time). there are lots of wizards and druids kiting in field 1 and field 2 (on DRo at least), so just track for named to see if they are up or off to do something else ;)</div></div><hr />

On the large island, you have the lone hut on the right then a big gap til the next hut. That next hut is where the Flame Protector spawns.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is after we killed him and I got my OBS, we went to zone in to farm spider saps and the same named respawns. So wtf, we go pull and kill him again and wtf, another OBS. /w GUILD war, none on. So we end up calling another guilds flagged warrior over to come loot it. <br />

Lo and behold, after about an hour there, the Seer pops, and has the sword. I was utterly shocked, I've heard this thing is rare as shit and was only there to grind some AA.<br />
<br />
Using it, I agree with folks that say it's not worth camping for hours on end. It's pretty much just a toy, I might use it in situations where I want low agro and have access to the mob's back. It's cute that the pet is wielding our epic, although I guess they all do that. ;)<br />
<br />
So, 1/1 from the Seer...</div></div><hr />
