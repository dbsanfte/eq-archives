<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mightie Gnome</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I duo with a 53 cleric a lot and we've been wanting to go to the plains for a bit now but I've heard it's hard without a slower.  Would it be possible for me to use my Trunceon of Doom (50% slow) in PoP and be able to duo efficiently?  Does the proc even stick to most mobs or is it resisted often?  I've grouped in velks and sol b, but one blue XP every 2 hours kind of agonizing.  <br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

PoJ has some good camps that are popular for duos that should be pretty good for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I primarily group with some friends.  Our group lacks a slower so the Ranger and I perform &quot;Ghetto&quot; slowing.  I have had no problems using ToD in PoJ/PoN/PoI and PoD.  Occasionally Ill get a resist but usually 1 or 2 swings later I get a hit.  Of course I kinda like those resists cause of the aggro :)<br />
<br />
Most of the other times I Duo with my lovely Druid partner and use the ToD all the time. :)</div></div><hr />

I'd say it gets resisted about 30% of the time there. Other char is a 65 cleric petty well equiped. As long as he has KEI or better, theres no down time for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the stuff in PoD CY slow usually lands for me when slower is afk/none at all. barely get resists. might wanna hunt in PoJ till like 55 before trying tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the ToD a couple of times in hoh, duoing with a 65 cleric, got mostly slow message, resisted a couple of times. Aside from taking 10 minutes to kill a mob, wasnt too bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long as you stick to tier1, a war/cleric can duo fairly well with a slow proc'ing weapon.  Anything beyond tier1 tho requires some pretty good equip or a real slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in Plane of Valor definately will eat through you fast if you don't have a slower. That's not to say you can't group there... you can, and I have with no slower (except me and a ranger trying to proc slow) and only a druid to heal, it's just hard on your healer.</div></div><hr />
