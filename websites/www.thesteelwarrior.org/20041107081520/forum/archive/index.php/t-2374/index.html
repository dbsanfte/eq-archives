<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There must be some 300 hundred + people who use this board, most agreeing that warriors must be fixed and EQ isnt much caring about it. So why not have a good ole walk out. Write them a little note, with all of willing participants names attached, give them oh lets say a month or two to do something about it, if they dont we all cancel our accounts untill they do. This would have to be 3000 plus dollars a month. Hit them where it hurts and put action behind our demands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wtf we're not ranjahs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">=\<br />
<br />
actually it would be 600 plus, so 6000 + dollars.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I am saying is why just complain, act on what you want, if you wont act, why should they.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Because unless something was organized that hit them all at once with a loss of a significant percentage of their subscription base they won't even notice.  If I thought every other warrior on every server would follow suit I'd happily cancel my account and not play for a month in protest but it won't happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a good idea, one I wish more dissatisfied warriors would choose (because they don't want to play, not to manipulate SOE into giving them what they want), but $6000/month = a drop in the bucket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No.<br />

THREAD FAILURE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Ninja<br />
<br />
A thread does not &quot;fail&quot; just because you don't agree with it.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There must be some 300 hundred + people who use this board<br />
<br />
We have 2,954 members, and quite a few people who aren't members but browse the boards daily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why would I leave if I enjoy playing my warrior?  I don't believe things are balanced, but it still is fun to log in and play 4-5 nights a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not leave, but cancle the account, even for just a tiny bit...<br />
good moment to take 1 week of vacation off EQ.<br />
I wouldn't mind doing it.<br />
<br />
Face it,<br />
SOE are going &quot;Theyre still playing the game, so there are no problems&quot;,<br />
and to some extent, they're right.</div></div><hr />

I know, but this has been mentioned many times and shot down many times.</div></div><hr />
