Will spend some time in these forums triying to learn from the more experienced. First question is about equipment, here u can see my magelo.<br />

<br />

<br />
Your stuff is near the best possible droppable equipment you can get your hands on. (You probably know the remaining items/will get them out of Tak/will get them aug'd)<br />
<br />
So there isn't really any purchasable direction you should go.<br />
<br />
To get your hps higher, you can dig up the Shaderock Amulet from the Va'dyn in Akheva 100 hps in neck slot. sucky AC, but 55 more hps is a lot compared to your limited options atm.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it seems to be as though you need Vex Thall/Elemental flags to get your stuff to start going up again.<br />
<br />
Not sure what your raiding profile is, but that is your next step.<br />

Sol C is still up? or its no more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure if it is still there or not so I can not give you a straight answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jacobpr</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Krorghar...One upgrade that you might want to look into would be boots...I suggest &quot;Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites&quot; as aa non-no-drop purchasabe upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The black plated collar drops (or also drops) in Tactics off Swordshitter or one with about identical stats as it has been a while since we killed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amazingly everyone has missed the most obvious big ticket item - get a BoC. I just got mine a couple of weeks ago and I can't begin to tell you how much better this weapon is that anything in your current arsenal. BoC+GBoS is flat bad ass. Great DPS, great agro and fairly easy to get, particularly if you have a load of plats.<br />
<br />
The rest of the items you could upgrade to would be marginal upgrades at best, save your plats and get a BoC, you won't regret it.<br />
<br />
And as far as I know, Black Platred Collar drops in Tactics, not SolC.</div></div><hr />
