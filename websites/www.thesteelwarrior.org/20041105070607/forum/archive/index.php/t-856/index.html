<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was so happy last night. 2nd night in my new guild, and I rouse a bunch of people up and we go run through the Hollowshade War 2 times. <br />
<br />
Got two of these to drop: http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=7168  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=7168) <br />
<br />
And one of these: http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=7167 <br />
<br />
Got a Sonic Wolf Fang Earring too, but couldn't find a link for it on lucy or alla's (didn't check Magelo, since it went to another warrior) but it had 4AC 20 HP 20 MANA 10 SvD if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Not knowing enough about the war really, We just killed the boss twice (sonic wolves) Now that I have read a bit about it, I have found out that you can farm some items from each camp, once it has been taken over. New info in hand, I will be talking to my guild about doing this some more :) <br />
<br />
All in all we had a bunch of fun, and those drops we got were an added bonus (one of the masks went to my wife's druid) I even got abot 10% of a level LOL.</div></div><hr />
