Its procs seems to add 400hate directly. Is this weapon good agro? procs fast?. Is better than my GBoS? should i use main or offhand?. Ty for info.</div></div><hr />

It procs 450 hate. I do not use the GBOS but from what I have read the two weapons are identical in aggro generated. <br />
<br />
I would use the GBOS main and CHSD offhand if I were you.</div></div><hr />

However, driver is still a very solid weapon until you can land a BoC/Bloodfrenzy/etc.</div></div><hr />

I also find that driver procs a lot more than blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">generally, the GBoS will do better for agro than the CHSD due to it's much better damage ratio. i use to use both while MTing. if they both had the same ratio then i'd say they both had identical agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can get both, rawking!  But the CHSD for me was an incredible agro upgrade!  When I got it I was using Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana (12/16 +1mag dmg) and a Frostbringer for agro.  Needless to say, it was rought.  When I got the CHSD, It was like night and day.  While agro wasn't solved, it was signifgantly improved.  450 hate from taunting blow once before a slow made it much easier to get agro off the slower.<br />
<br />
The GBoS &gt; CHSD though.  Paired up with GBoS pri / CHSD off hand, it was great.  I almost felt like a real tank!  My guildmates saw a big difference.<br />
<br />
Good luck and enjoy the CHSD, its a good weapon.  Should be good first step up in agro for most warriors out there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Augment the GBoS, it's the superior weapon and you won't upgrade it any time soon. I put anger2 on my GBoS and I have insane aggro now with CHSD offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to duel-wield a CHSD and a GBoS.  I put the GBoS in primary.  It's a very nice agro set up, and somewhat easy to obtain.  I have also recently acquired a BoC, and have replaced my CHSD with it.  Persnoally, I feel that the GBoS &gt; CHSD, but they are both nice weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">from what ive experienced with both they both have situations to mainhand over the other. the GBoS is undoubtedly better snap aggro imo, even better than a BoC but i feel lacks in sustained aggro.  whenever im on a ldon or in an exp group and im switching between the two i almost always feel that the gbos out aggroes the chsd. however when im MAing a raid fights that tend to last 3-5 minutes my aggro felt alot more solid with the chsd main.<br />
<br />
as for anger 3 aug id go with the GBoS, it would be better snap aggro and would help maintain aggro over the course of long fights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... well, I have a CHSD &amp; really want a GBoS. I was thinking... maybe I should aug my GBoS w/ the Ykesha aug &amp; my CHSD (offhand) w/ Anger II? That way I'd have good DPS on mainhand &amp; good agro on secondary... not to mention the agro coming from the stuns on primary. Would that work well?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on your role for tanking, which augs you'd go with.  Since Anger2 has been upgraded to 400hate (vs 200 a while back), it appears that it generates more aggro than ykesha (125dd + 0sec stun).  Folks were guessing that ykesha was around 300ish hate as it seemed to compare favorable to the anger3 at that time.<br />
<br />
If you're going to be MT or want certain aggro, go with 2 x Anger2 (preferable anger3) procs.<br />
<br />
If you want some DPS while keeping decent aggro, go with 2 x ykesha or ykesha + anger2.  I'd think if you want DPS, then stick with the ykeshas.  Keep in mind you will get resists on the DD.<br />
<br />
Would doing ykesha and anger2, one for each weapon, work well?  Yes.  So would ykesha on both.  It's just more of what you want and how many points ya think you're gonna be getting in LDoN.  If ya think 1150pts is easy, then experiment a bit and go for the higher end procs.<br />
<br />
Just don't forget when you remove the aug from a weapon it is gone forever.  Keep in mind anger2/3 is unresistable and a fixed 400/600 hate.  Ykesha DD can be resisted, but that still adds hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just augmented my GBoS with Anger III.  Prior to this I was experimenting with GBoS and CHSD.  There were times when I preferred CHSD main as the proc seemed to get the mobs attention better than the GBoS proc.  I prefer the DPS of the GBoS though and figured that would be best for the aug.  I have to say I am quite impressed with it.  Anger III is a lot of LDON points but I think you would be very happy with a GBoS aug'd with it, I know I am.<br />
<br />
The CHSD will be a very solid aggro partner for your GBoS.  I would use GBoS main and CHSD offhand unless you lose aggro.  Then don't be afraid to try reversing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roshinbertson</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i figure this...what makes the GBoS so great...ratio + stun + dd proc(added dps)....well...why not yak this baby...get 125dd + stun again.....makes the GBoS x2 better......<br />
<br />
<br />
i have both a CHSD and a BoC...i use BoC now...but my theory is this....what makes the CHSD or BoC great? the proc....so i'll throw an anger3 proc on it...make it x2 better.../shrug<br />
<br />
keep GBoS main for its dps..and the other off for its agro...with amidex its great agro for what my guild can do....until i get a BF or BoW ../shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
and i know you all fear my sig</div></div><hr />

I'd have preferred anger III but I just don't have the time.  Working great so far :)</div></div><hr />
