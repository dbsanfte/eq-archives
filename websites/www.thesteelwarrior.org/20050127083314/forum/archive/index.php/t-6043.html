My guild is doing Luclin atm and as a warrior have a quesiton regarding the 2 2handers which drop from Lord Seru and Emp.<br />
I've been hearing different things regarding the aggro on both weapons.  Bloodied bezerker's blade had a rune3 proce while the Sword of Ssra has a not so good serpents bite(100dd or so) proc.  But ppl have been telling me that the Sword of Ssra actually holds better aggro than that of the BBB.  <br />
<br />
Which is better for aggro?  Bloodied bezerker's blade or the Swrod of Ssra? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info in advance :)<br />

Lifetaps are hardly good aggro at all, and while rune 3 isn't amazing, it's definitely more. Combine that with BBB being 52/40 (+1 cold) compared to 52/42 (+2 magic), the BBB beats out for straight DPS as well as aggro proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decaillin</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBB is better aggro without question; rune 3 might not be as nice as EB, but once you get a few procs in a row, it is decent. One nice thing about rune 3 is that it will build aggro on all mobs that are close to you when it procs. Kinda like a small ae taunt proc =p<br />
<br />
Go for the BBB, itll easily hold you over until you manage to get a BoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cimmar</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBB easy. Several in my guild have BBB and Sword of Ssra and we are currently in Ssra/Seru/VT. From what i have seen the bbb is a better aggro weapon and dps weapon, But not so much of an aggro weap that you will pull aggro off your guilds MT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBB, emp 2h is way past it's age for any class that can use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh i take offense to that.  I use the Ssra sword and have tanked xegony and fennin with it as well as every elemental mini there is whithout losing aggro.  It jsut needs a little help in the way of an anger 3 proc.  To give an example.   I always consider perfect aggro as when you get pushed away and summoned back.  If you don't have perfect aggro the minute you get out of range it attacks someone else.  In PoW where aggro can be hard to obtain i have achieved it with the Ssra sword =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say get both if you can(that's what I'm working on doing via my pickup raids). <br />
<br />
BBB=good aggro tanking sword.<br />
<br />
Sword of Ssra= good low aggro dps sword, with a nice little proc that won't steal aggro.<br />
<br />
If you have to make a choice though, go BBB from Seru and Acrylia Handled Broadsword from Emp!. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">both about the same<br />
I grouped a few times with a guy with EMP sword and whoever was taunting had agro.(I use BBB) Rune proc is very negligeble amount of agro for single mobs. It helps when you have more then 1 mob thought and no one fucking with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use my BBB with anger 3 aug pretty much full time for tanking in xp groups and never lose agro.  I use it in LDoN hard, GoD trials and anywhere else you can think of.  With WA trained up the rune proc really helps on the healing too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh another interesting note about BBB rune 3 proc is that the proc isn't really a large taunt, but it is an area effect taunt.  I have had mobs that were agro on someone else, turn off them and agro on me just due to rune 3 proccing on my BBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talun</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a BBB and even without anger3 if it procs rune a few in a row ill pull agro off another tank that groups with me pretty regularly and he uses a BF and a BoC.It is a dam nice sword for as easy as it is to get now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Batem Tuhates</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the Sword of Ssra, Its not that greatest for agro but itsn't awful either when combined with incite it holds it's own.<br />
I'm  not a MT in my guild so it works great for off tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talun you can steal agro from BF/BoC only in the beginig of the fight before the proc. BBB does a lot more dmg then BF/BoC as well so till the proc there aint much agro.<br />
<br />
I have BF and I can tell you right now even with anything half assed in offhand it is a hell of alot more agro when BBB. I used to wield BBB when duo and BF/some lame offhand in groups just so ppl can go nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i used to use BBB and a few procs together would pull agro from a warrior with a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nosfentor</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last I'd read Ssra sword was working against things in the Plane of Fire for the extraplanar bane - making it 59/42 for sure, 61/42 at best. <br />
<br />
Anyone tried it? Never see anyone using it in the Elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until i get a blade of war its the only weapon i use.  I hit around 480 ish with it in pof (using it on mobs in the 2nd castle) and it holds aggro very well on bosses.  Basically i've used it on Fennin Xeg, and all the named in the planes except those in poeb.<br />
<br />
the only mobs i have problems with are those that memblur (but im sure everyone has problems with those)<br />
<br />
**edit** im the main tnak of my guild (and the only one without a sews or BoW)</div></div><hr />

First I've heard of this.  Does the extraplanr bane now work in all of POP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as someone explained to me before ExtraPlanar is the bonus for old world gods aka Cazic in PoF and Inny in PoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBB is what I'd go with, I dun have either so i can put in a unbaised opinion.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, Thun, your sig still scares me after 2 years bud @@</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to tank with an un-augmented BBB against ele mobs and in hard LDoN's, the biggest thing I ever tanked with it was Reparm and it was decent for agro.<br />
<br />
Never had an emp sword so haven't been able to compare the 2, but I still consider a BBB too high an agro weapon to use for DPS when not tanking, a couple of early procs have often pulled agro and got me splattered.</div></div><hr />
