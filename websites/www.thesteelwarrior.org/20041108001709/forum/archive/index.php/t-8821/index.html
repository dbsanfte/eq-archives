<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well although not new EQ,.<br />
<br />
I have played a Mage Rogue and Cleric all into there 50's on SZ. And I fancied a change.<br />
<br />
So I am new to steelwarriors and <br />
I am new to Warriors/Tanks in general.<br />
<br />
I rolled up a Bertox worshipping Female Gnome Warrior on Morden Rasp the other night.<br />
<br />
Heh New to Gnomes - Wanna try and Tinker a bit.<br />
And New to MR - so no twinkage at all going on.<br />
<br />
I know all about the Plague Rat Tails Spider(ling) silks Bone chips etc etc etc, so I hope to start building up my stash pretty soon, but I do remember it being a long slow job.<br />
<br />
Was going to try and complete most of my newbie armour quests to get me started.<br />
<br />
I do not intend to start another character on this server.<br />
<br />
Hmm so what am I asking,<br />
<br />
well I am asking some of you to cast your minds way way way back to those very first days when you were cutting your teeth as a young warrior, and especially those of you who were untwinked, and see if any memories come to mind that will be very useful to me.<br />
<br />
Things I am interested in mainly (although open to advice on this too)<br />
<br />
Quests that are easily do able for half decent gear.<br />
Cheaper items that are essential Warrior Equipment.<br />
Basically I am thinking AC HP &amp; Sta items pretty much in that order.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Guys, go on dust down those memories and let me in heh heh.<br />

PS is it also true that your sta score at ding time including gear and buffs effects your own natural HP pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hiyas Mihtee =)<br />
<br />
With regard to your last question, I'm pretty sure that your STA at ding time does not effect your HP pool.  My magelo profile is accurate, and I did not have to enter anywhere what my STA was every time I dinged.  I think current HP is always just a function of current level, skills, stats, gear, buffs, and AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">An ogre warrior and a gnome warrior with the same STA at level 65 and the same gear will have the same amount of hp. :) So no, it doesn't matter what it is when you ding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok thanks for that guys,<br />
<br />
What about the any must have cheaper pieces of equipment or quests I can do that are worthwhile apart from my Newbie Armour quests</div></div><hr />

There is so much gear around now it's impossible to keep track of it all.  The best solution is to do some searching in the bazaar using ac and hps and see what will get you the most bang for your buck on your server.  Your newbie armor will last you a while, so just stop in periodically at the bazaar and see what the biggest upgrade you can afford is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use 1ac = 6hp = 2sta for a while in rating gear. It's a good enough formula for you right now, and it'll give you the idea of reasonable tradeoffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't go for STA much until your 40s and 50s.  It's pretty useless at low levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well for some starter cash, the goblins in butcherblock drops a head and blood that sells for 4pp and up depending on cha, great for low level casters anyway to get spell money, mobs are lvl 10 and not all bad xp.<br />
<br />
As for quests, i have done the cuburt quest in qeynos sewers, rabid wolf pelts/rabid grizzly pelt in qeynos hills and the gnoll fang quest, but since you are bertoxx might be a bit hard since i doubt the pally guild will welcome you :)<br />
Can't say i know that many quests the, ones i mentioned are okey but not to good if you are an evil char since you loose factions with the bloodsabers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it's a wickedly dangerous trip; but if you can find some lighcrawler shells laying around you can go to Sanctus Seru and hand them in for some armor....I think it fits gnomes too. It's very difficult running through Netherbian and across Dawnshroud tho and, well, I doubt you'll make it unscathed.<br />
<br />
But overall; quest wise for cities on Norrath and the 2 bigger ones on Luclin ( Katta Castellum and Sanctu Seru )...Bertoxx faction might hinder the progress.<br />
<br />
Overall; there's always the lightstones path, hand them in into gypsy camps ( you are relatively safe at the Rathe Mtns one ) for a tome that sells for a few gold ( lightstone ) or about 9 plat ( Greater Lightstone )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Er, I think Bertox worshippers are KOS in Sanctus Seru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did you go Bertox for a certain reason, like roleplay, or whatever? If not you might find it better as a RZ worshipper for better cultural armor.  This is definately not a huge deal, but at only level 4 it would not be a biggie to change.  Can still make and use the clockwork armor, but the fierce heraldic is a lot better to tank with and super common.<br />
<br />
Like i said though, this is not a huge deal. Just wanted to throw it out there because a lot of people that have not played a plate class dont know how much better fierce heraldic is than brellium or clockwork to tank with.<br />
<br />
edit 1: one quest i would look into before you level up is the OT gate hammer quest. Great reward from that and if you can do it before you end up leveling in places that hurt your faction you'll be a lot happier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be one advantage of worshipping Bertox.  I know gnome necros aren't kos at TO Outpost, but like Sassinak said, they're most likely KOS in Sanctus Seru and definitely in Katta.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS is it also true that your sta score at ding time including gear and buffs effects your own natural HP pool. <br />
<br />
No, that was something that you could do in some MUDs back in the day, until they fixed the code.  You won't ever have to worry about getting robbed of any HPs or anything when you level.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mihtee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey well, Thanks for the great responses guys will look into some of them.<br />
<br />
Did not get on to well with MR this weekend got the shout back to SZ to help out one day, and I spent the other dat trying to set up my system to two box and it worked so I now have Mighteetoo the Bertox Cleric tagging along hee hee.<br />
<br />
And yes I did make them Bertox for Roleplay/Difficulty reasons. I wanted a real evil character but I did fancy a warrior as I have never had one and I am loving it..<br />
