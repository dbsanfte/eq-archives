<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynetta</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya, <br />
I will probably be asking questions answered somewhere else so please forgive me ahead of time.<br />
<br />
After taking a break to run up a cleric for my guild I have been trying to work my warrior again because I just love being a warrior.  I am level 63 with mid range gear ,ie. cultural and a couple pieces of ornate thrown in...<br />
<br />
Recently while in BoT I heard a monk tell a level 64 warrior he should go back to PoV until he had more hps. <br />
<br />
Question 1. What is an appropriate amount of hps to tank named in BoT? hps/aa's actually<br />
<br />
<br />
Now having leveled a cleric to 65 I will tell you that I do not notice much difference in healing a pally and healing a warrior that has spent a few AA's in the defensive area... as a matter of fact it is actually easier to heal the warrior because they lose hps in a more linear fashion and I can time my heals better. I dont mind waiting for the slow because I know by the time I actually have to CH the warrior &lt;at which time my chanter hubby throws on the slow&gt; the warrior will have built enough aggro not to matter.<br />
<br />
The point of that whole long winded paragraph IS ....<br />
<br />
Question 2. In experience groups only why don't people seem to notice this?<br />
<br />
I accepted a group once and actually got a tell saying &quot;NM we got a pally&quot; At which point I logged and cursed for a half hour or so.<br />
<br />
If this is the wrong forum for this feel free to move this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answer for 2. People don't see it because with a pally thye do not have to worry about aggro so they can cast that big nuke quicker and slow the mob quicker.  They don't have to learn how to control aggro and it is easier for them.  So the extra healing doesnt matter to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Question 1. What is an appropriate amount of hps to tank named in BoT? hps/aa's actually&quot;<br />
<br />
The appropriate amount of Hit Points to tank XP mobs in an XP group in BoT is 3k or so unbuffed. It's not about the amount of hit points you or the tank has. It's about the attentiveness and mana of the healer, and how good the slower/crowd control is.<br />
<br />
To tank nameds ... well, it depends on the named. Some are easier than others.<br />
<br />
I know the boss of upper sand is very hard to slow, so he's much easier to kill with a defensive tank and a cleric that knows to cast CH earlier, or has the mana to spam faster heals like a fiend. (Usually the latter is a BAD idea). But if I'm in a group with a chanter AND a shaman, I know I, a crappy mitigating MONK could tank the guy. (I know this from firsthand get-my-ass-beat-down experience, heh).<br />
<br />
To answer question 2 ... BoT attracts lazy people, who want lazy XP. So they really don't want to have to work WITH a tank to get their XP. They wanna show up and click their buttons like good little gerbils.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd go dungeon spellunking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynetta</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess my point was I didnt actually use anymore mana as a cleric on a warrior then I did with a pally.  Chanter didnt use anymore mana, and the nukers actually used mana conservation and keep the pulls consistant w/o med time.  There has been no net exp loss because less nuking meant less downtime.<br />
<br />
That being said....Taunt is still an issue. I wont even start that here. I have watched my mobs go crazy because of over nuking and fast trigger slowers. I know the problem. <br />
<br />
My issue was in places like BoT where each camp has a finite amount of mobs why the casters are making it sticking point. Either you kill em fast med and wait or you kill them evenly over a period of time. Its not going to make them spawn any faster. In my humble opinion their perception is skewed due to higher encounters.</div></div><hr />

I'd say you need 4k HP unbuffed. 3k unbuffed is for level 52s raiding Vox and Naggy.<br />
<br />
If you're not close to 6.5k fully buffed (virt, focus, sta,SV/SoT/BSS), you shouldn't be in BoT.<br />
<br />
#2<br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone knows Warriors can tank better than Knights, they just opt for the easy way and would rather spend a little extra mana healing in exchange for a nice increase in DPS. One could even argue that the extra DPS and the fact that the mob is slowed on inc counters the Knight's lack of tanking ability because the mob doesnt have time to do as much damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About #1, just wanted to add that I think 4khp unbuffed is a good mark and that you should have some basic defensive AAs or some of the mobs, specially the named ones, might eat you alive. I personally went the Evasive way (CA-LR) and will start the Mitigation (CS-ID) way now, and I have to say evading was really really useful for me, always keeping in mind most of the mobs have innate procs that range from 500-1500 (so, you evade more innate procs).</div></div><hr />
