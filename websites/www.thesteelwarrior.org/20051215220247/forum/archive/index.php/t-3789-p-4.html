<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trying to work out the relative hate effects of damage bonus and weapon damage.<br />
<br />
I am avoiding ascribing any fixed amount of hate to ToT casts, as people have mentioned the hate generated isn't always linear in the number of casts.<br />
<br />
We have a test where the weapon delay, hence the damage bonus, is constant, while the weapon damage varies.  This is the 12/50 and 22/50 test.<br />
<br />
So, I can do some algebra on this.<br />
<br />
SmallHate = hate from 12/50 weapon per swing.<br />
LargeHate = hate from 22/50 weapon per swing.<br />
SKHate = amount of hate the SK built up that the weapon had to beat.<br />
<br />
From the 12/50 weapon tests we have:<br />
34 SmallHate &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 33 SmallHate<br />
From the 22/50 weapon tests we have:<br />
30 LargeHate &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 29 LargeHate<br />
<br />
Now, we know LargeHate is more hate than SmallHate.  Call the difference in hate Y, and renamed the small hate to X.<br />
<br />
Then,<br />
SmallHate = X<br />
LargeHate = X + Y<br />
<br />
Rewording<br />
34 X &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 33 X<br />
30 X + 30 Y &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 29 X + 29 Y<br />
<br />
Rearranging, and making the inequalities strict:<br />
34 X &gt; 29 X + 29 Y<br />
30 X + 30 Y &gt; 33 X<br />
Or<br />
5 X &gt; 29 Y<br />
30 Y &gt; 3 X<br />
<br />
Y is the hate caused by the 10 extra damage, and X is the hate caused by the 12/50 weapon per swing.<br />
<br />
Ok, now lets try out the two theories.<br />
<br />
The first one is that every point of damage adds a certain amount of hate, and every point of damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Call the amount of hate per damage D, and the amount of hate per damage bonus B.<br />
<br />
Then X = 51 B + 12 D and Y = 10 D.<br />
<br />
Using:<br />
5 X &gt; 29 Y<br />
30 Y &gt; 3 X<br />
<br />
255 B + 60 D &gt; 290 D<br />
300 D &gt; 153 B + 36 D<br />
<br />
255 B &gt; 230 D<br />
153 B &lt; 264 D<br />
<br />
0.9 D &lt; B &lt; 1.73 D<br />
<br />
So, the hate from a point of damage bonus would be anywhere from 90% to 173% of the hate from the &quot;weapon damage&quot; field.<br />
<br />
The other theory is that aggro is steppy.  There is the hate from the damage bonus, and a constant amount of hate that goes up as you break certain thresholds.<br />
<br />
Let T be the hate caused by a 5 to 14 damage weapon, and 2 T be the hate caused by a 15 to 24 damage weapon.<br />
<br />
X = 51 B + T<br />
Y = T<br />
<br />
Using:<br />
5 X &gt; 29 Y<br />
30 Y &gt; 3 X<br />
<br />
We get:<br />
255 B + 5 T &gt; 29 T<br />
30 T &gt; 153 B + 3 T<br />
<br />
255 B  &gt; 24 T<br />
153 B &lt; 27 T<br />
<br />
Rewording as T = K B.<br />
<br />
10.625 &gt; K &gt; 5.67<br />
<br />
Someone thought that K might be 11 (ie, 11 &quot;hate&quot; for a 12 damage weapon and 22 &quot;hate&quot; for a 22 damage weapon, and 1 hate per point of damage bonus).  This is inconsistent with experiment.<br />
<br />
I'm definatly going to set up some controlled experiments.<br />
<br />
A&gt; 14 damage offhander vs 15 damage offhander, determine if there is a hate step based off min damage (or discontinuity).<br />
B&gt; &quot;one more hate spell&quot; comparisons with the same weapon, to see if we find a conversion value from +hate spell effects and our unconstrained weapon hate.<br />
C&gt; Compare hate from same-damage, different bonus, weapons.<br />
D&gt; More comparisons of hate from same-bonus, different-damage weapons. (vs same amount of hate)<br />
E&gt; Some 1 H primary weapon tests.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thrashette</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember that weapon damage bonus, at least for 1HS, is table driven.  That makes any formula involving it behave piecewise.   At one time the formula was, X being weapon delay:<br />
<br />
X &lt; 23 DB = DB/3<br />
22 &lt; X &lt; 29 DB = DB<br />
28 &lt; X     DB = DB + Y*X, where Y is a level dependent factor<br />
<br />
<br />
I've never seen any numbers for X &lt;= 14, and no numbers for level 65s.  But I expect they are similarly steppy.</div></div><hr />

Very interesting and seems to explain some of the things I've noticed.<br />
<br />
Certainly Rogues with the 15+/dly weapons are WAY drawing more agro than 14-/dly.<br />
Where dly fairly similar.<br />
<br />
I've often seen Paladins claim they get too much agro from Slay Undead but I've been pretty adamant that the bonus damage from slay is agro free. Plenty of times I've had seriously lucky runs of slays and never once drawn agro.<br />
<br />
Ghouls require a magic weapon to hit them.<br />
They may prove usefull for longer tests.<br />
<br />
Assuming DoTs generate the same APS as DPS I will get my wife help me run some tests. Assuming I can find a good variety of non magic weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate values are different per class, for you Brodda it appears that monks have a smaller hate modifier than Knights, atleast on 2h weapons, and it is larger on 1h. I was planning on making this info aviable to the general public in a couple more days after I had more work done on it (I wanted all formulas for SK's solved first), but my testing partners have been busy so in the intrest of moving this testing along I'm posting it early.  I believe your formula is incorrect, and that damage does not have a modifier on it.  Instead I believe it is the damage bonus which contains the modifier.  Taking your 12/50 weapon and 22/50 weapon for example try using this formula instead.  Damage+Damage Bonus*Modifier for a monk using a 2h weapon assuming this formula is correct your moifier would be between 1.05 and 1.11.  For 1h given the limited testing of it the valid range is quite large but I believe your modifier on it to be between 1.27 and 1.49 however, since I'm an SK (and being primarily concerned with solving my classes aggro formulas first) I do not have an offhand weapon to test with so I cannot offer a valid formula for that which would work as I have not been able to test it.  I do believe 1h/2h bash and slam aggro will be the same formula as an offhand weapon though and given your testing of it I would bet that the formula of it is simply Damage*Modifier, which does work within the range I stated for you earlier for 1h weapons, and would actually assist in narrowing the range down.<br />
<br />
If anyones interested with more of my theory on this, I have it posted here (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=18154).<br />

<br />
Sure, if your purpose in using it was to get attention, its working fine then.<br />
<br />
But otherwise that statement is pretty ignorant.<br />
<br />
Most things that gain a lot of attention are bad. People like to talk about bad. When good things happen it rarely sticks in peoples minds.<br />

<br />
oops /derail off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other possibility for the formula is that its using division instead of multiplication.  The reason I think this is awhile ago aggro modifying spells were changed (maybe some of you Warriors remember on Lucy when Echo of Anger got changed from increase by 15% to decrease by .85%).<br />
<br />
This makes me think that instead of the formula being dmg+(dmg bonus*mod) its actually dmg+(dmg bonus/mod).  This would mean that the modifier on 2h weapons would actually be in the range of .88 to .93 for a Monk (or atleast I think you're a monk Brodda, correct me if im wrong).<br />
<br />
Also, in the thead I linked above I have far more proof posted that supports this formula  (so far it's worked successfully for 12 different weapons, but not all have been posted in it, only 9 listed there.  Once I'm certain on offhand and bash/slam aggro I will be testing on mobs of various level ranges).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran some more tests.  I doubt I will run more as these are a pain in the ass to do.  I used a paladin this time against a centi dator in ME.<br />
<br />
First, I wanted to set a baseline and make sure each stun was adding hate linearly.<br />
Tests using 8/20 in offhand to get agro<br />
<br />
Initial Agro <br />
1	7<br />
2	6<br />
3	6<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + one force of Akera (4sec/61)<br />
1	69<br />
2	68<br />
3	68<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + two force of Akera<br />
1	132<br />
2	132<br />
3	132<br />
4	132<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + three force of Akera<br />
1	194<br />
2	193<br />
<br />
I did do the tests more than I had planned to because the results were coming out way different than I thought.  I was getting agro at what I thought was greatly varying swings.  Turned out I was just looking at hits and when I added the misses almost all the numbers came out the same.  So again I will say a miss = hit for agro.  Also the dators seem to have a pretty large bonus hate for agroing first.  Also from these tests I would say that each stun added the same amount of agro.<br />
<br />
Next, I wanted to see if stuns generate different amounts of agro.<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + force of Akilae  (4sec/65)<br />
1	68<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + Quellious Word of Serenity  (10sec/65 + 108dd)<br />
1	85<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + Desist  (2.5/55)<br />
1	68<br />
So from those tests a stun is a stun is a stun.  And DD adds decent agro. <br />
<br />
Playing with the numbers a bit, the formula DB + 11 * MINIMUM seems to be a reasonable fit for all types of weapons. Sounds like the kind of thing someone might have hacked in as a guess of average weapon damage (11 is close to the average of a 1 to 20 roll).<br />
<br />
MINIMUM is the minimum possible damage for the weapon ignoring damage bonuses, i.e. RND(DAM/10), so 2 for a 15 dam weapon. <br />
I wanted to test this, but I couldn't find a 14 damage weapon.  However if the formula was correct then a 9/36 would be the same agro as a 8/20 so I used a 9/36.<br />
<br />
Changed to 9/36 in offhand<br />
Initial Agro + force of Akera<br />
1	62<br />
2	63<br />
3	62<br />
<br />
Next tests use Initial Agro + two force of Akera<br />
Changed to 9/36 in primary<br />
1	49<br />
2	49<br />
<br />
Changed to 8/20 in primary<br />
1	54<br />
2	55<br />
<br />
Changed to a 8/28 in primary<br />
1	54<br />
2	54<br />
<br />
Changed to 15/32 in primary<br />
1	39<br />
<br />
Changed to 15/32 in secondary<br />
1	71<br />
2	71<br />
<br />
I think it is safe to say that DB + 11 * MINIMUM does not work as the damage rating of the weapon does come into play.  I through in the 8/28 to show that agro is determined by damage and damage bonus alone.  We can see that a 9/36 has approximately 10% more agro than a 8/20.  And if the agro was determined by Damage + damage bonus then the agro would be 22 for the 9/36 and 21 for the 8/20 and 28 for the 15/32. So we would have 39 * 28 = 1092 and 54 * 21 = 1134 and 49 * 22 = 1078 which are pretty close.  The 54 * 21 seems to be the farthest off, but it only really needs to be withing two swings (one from double attack and one from being on the 'edge', and it is damn close.  But that still seems fairly loose.  Also, when you are looking at this the values don't actually matter.  This is all relative.<br />
<br />
With the 1.25 * damage + damage_bonus we get<br />
23 * 54 = 1242<br />
24.25 * 49 = 1188<br />
18.75 * 39 = 1238<br />
And in secondary for the 15/32<br />
18.75 * 71 = 1331<br />
<br />
So to get some comparison I did a two hander test.<br />
Changed to 13/50<br />
1	19<br />
2	20<br />
<br />
With the initial test seeming to support agro as damage + damage_bonus we have 13 + 51 = 64.  Or agro of 1260. Which seems to be far closer to the 1.25 * damage + damage_bonus for the one handers. Unfortunately the offhand 15/32 kinda screws that one up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wanted to see how + cold or magic or whatever type of damage was being used for agro.  So I found a weapon with a +5 magic damage.<br />
Initial Agro + three force of Akera<br />
Changed to 18+5/38 <br />
1	28<br />
2	27<br />
3	28<br />
<br />
According to these tests this weapon is as much agro as a 23/38 weapon.  23 + 40 = 63  63 * 27 = 1701 which is about right for three force of Akera and initial agro.  Yes, this conclusion is a tad loose.  But I am really tired atm.  But I still think we can safely say that +5 of the resistance types are effectively the same as +5 weapon damage as far as agro generation is concerned where as BANE TYPE DAMAGE IS NOT.  (See first post.)<br />
<br />
Hate values are different per class, for you Brodda it appears that monks have a smaller hate modifier than Knights, atleast on 2h weapons, and it is larger on 1h.<br />
<br />
I found this interesting so I wanted to test it.  I grabbed a warrior.<br />
<br />
With warrior<br />
Initial Agro + two force of Akera<br />
15/32 secondary<br />
1	71<br />
2	71<br />
<br />
15/32 primary<br />
1	39<br />
2	38<br />
<br />
13/50<br />
1	19<br />
2	19<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is the same as the monk.  So I find that Brael's conclusion wrong at least for warriors and monks.  I did go to your link though, and I can't find fault with any of your conclusions there.  The only thing I can think of is that the hate generated by the spell was somehow different than the hate it generated for me.  Mob differences?  /shrug.  It is still all relative.<br />
<br />
I think if someone really went through all the data with a fine toothed comb they could probably figure out what exactly was going on.  But I am far too tired to do so and I won't pursue this any further as far as me logging data goes.</div></div><hr />
