<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drumni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was asked to group with two very high players (I was a level 3 Troll Warrior) and they gave me 50 gold, and told me to go buy some armour and weapons.  This made my next several levels so much more fun as I wasn't constantly worried about getting money.  I don't remember their name but am very grateful.<br />
Thanks to whoever does that sort of thing!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe, that kind of thing is it's own reward.  Just finding a real newbie that would actually appreciate 50 gold is pretty rare these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pay it forward as they say.  Some time down the road do the same thing for new warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah pay forward. There really is nothing you can do, well other than say thank you and mean it!
