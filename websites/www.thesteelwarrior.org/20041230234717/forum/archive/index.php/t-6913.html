<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so my magelo is fake .. well kind of that is, in that i dont yet have my full defensive aa's and/or GoD aa's yet.  I'm presently grinding out LR4 atm, and will promptly finish off my ID5 before moving on to GoD proc and hp aa's (and maybe stun immunity).<br />
<br />
I duel wield 2 anger3 augmented weapons, so i dont have much as per aggro problems ever, unless the RNG is just plain mean to me.<br />
<br />
my question is, how do i deal with having mobs hitting for 900-1300 with a single healer and duel wield?  i'm presently at 6k unbuffed (magelo is kinda fubar'd if you subtract the 500 GoD hps) with OK ac.  i can tank a hard just fine, and even do the first few GoD trials with no significant problems assuming my healer is talented and attentive.<br />
<br />
What kind of strategies do my fellow duel wielders (in the same hp's/aa boat) use when tanking mobs.  My general strat has been to tag w/ incite and duel wield praying for an early proc, swapping out to my shield in offhand until the mob is slowed.  I'm fine once they are slowed .. it really isnt to bad buffed at 8400 w/ the aas i have at present.  The problem is that occasionally they come in hasted and/or get a few fast rounds for full dmg ... not to mention if slower is resisted a few times.  Those are the times when the extra 100ac + less ripostes come in very handy.<br />
<br />
Will any problems i have clear up with max defensive aas?  or do i just need more hps/ac?  The only 2hander i'm willing to give up my present dual wield combo for is a BoW to anger3, or maybe the 2hs off of Seru to anger3.<br />
<br />
how viable is efficient tanking in these cases with duel wield?  the extra ripostes are very noticable, and sometimes i need to switch off attack for a heal to land (if its gonna be close).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend you go to a 2h to avoid the extra riposte damage.  My regular group is a shammy/druid/mag/wiz/bard, since we don't have a cleric, they helped me get a GSot4w.  I just put an anger 3 aug on it and almost have WA 3.  It holds aggro very well, I don't have to worry about the riposte damage, the healers can keep me up in 99% of time and they can still nuke to their heart's content.  We also spend a bit of time in God in the sewers or ferubi.  It makes alot of difference to the healers if you are not taking all those ripostes.<br />
<br />
You also need to work on getting your AC up.  It makes a noticable difference and your healers will appreciate you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question, before your question. Why put something on your Magelo that you dont have? IMO thats sort of like lieing on a resume.  :confused: to each there own though.<br />
<br />
Now your question<br />
Duel weilding in GoD,HLDoN, High end PoP = DEATH  :eek: <br />
Sure you get a little extra boost in HP by duel weilding, but for the amount your gaining in extra HP you'll loose ten fold by the riposte damage. That and your cleric/druid/shammy will be pissed for having to heal you so much more.<br />
This may be different for a highly equiped Elemental tank or Time equiped tank though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">back a while ago i wanted to know how many aa's it would cost me to be done with all my tanking/hp/defensive aa's.... so i put em up to get a number count.  i'm simply lazy and never took em down  :D  .  Besides, at ~3 aa per day, i'll be there in about a month as it is, so no worries on this end.  I'm straight with any group/healer i'm working with as to what aa's and hps i have, and i dont plan on applying to any other guilds to use it as a resume, so /shrug .. never thought it would hurt anyone to simply grind to my goal.<br />
<br />
i'm not convinced that the gsofw + anger3 will hold the kinda aggro i'm needing and looking for.  back when i swung a my GSoT w/ anger2, i would pull aggro off an a3 GSoFW pretty regularly.  i group with a monk wielding and 18/19 weapon .. and something else comparable and a rog with WA5 rujarkan procs ... the ldon dagger and the tower dagger, not to even mention the mage i also run these ldons with...  the dual anger i have is a metric crapload of aggro, and both my slowers and my dps really appreciate me having it.  So unless i can find a 2hander with nice stats/dps + an innate aggroish proc, i wont be burning 1150 points on it.<br />
<br />
I've only died once (hasted w/ slow resisted ... + enrage at the end) with my guildy cleric i like to run the missions with, but randomcleric01 often has a hard time keeping me up unless they have good mana regen and are used to running these these kind of encounters fairly regularly.<br />
<br />
I've watched a tank in my guild ~9500hps buffed with duel wielded BoC + Researcher club (a3) tank hard ldons with literally no problems whatsoever, so i know it can be done.  it isnt 100% suicide.<br />
<br />
will LR4/5 and ID5 make that huge a difference?  does anyone have any tricks up their sleeve or use the shield tactic for rough spots?  or am i just crazy for attempting these encounters with 2 fast weapons.<br />
<br />
ps- its good to keep a healer on their toes now an then eh?  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tanked alot of hard ldons. I have about 6.8k unbuffed HP with tribute, which I always have. I have over 1500 ac. So it is easy on ldons to have 8.5k hp and over 1600 ac.<br />
<br />
I have used two setups.<br />
<br />
BF anger3, and blackout anger3<br />
<br />
Bloodied Berserker Blade 125d ykesha<br />
<br />
I personally would never use the BBB on ldons ever again unless I was an add tank.<br />
<br />
I usually have a wizard+ another crazy dps class their and I fight to make sure I have agro. I do not like that lack agro of switching to the 2 hander. But one thing in my groups is generally the mobs live for about 45 seconds on average, and usually someone dropps some stuns in, so about 10 seconds of that the mobs is stuned. I do get less ripostes while useing a 2 hander, but I get more ripostes with one handers because of the mod on BF (+15%).<br />
<br />
So here are my suggestions. You get low on life and the mob is beating on you, turn attack off at 30% or so. So you don't risk a risposte at a bad moment. The other thing is have a smart stunner there and have em use a duration stun when you are around 30%. I have a kick ass wizard friend who is great about managing stuns on ldons.<br />
<br />
Note: Last week I did a hard ldon in 35 minutes with a druid as the healer. I was tanking...hella fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riposte damage isn't THAT significant. It's 1 attack back at you. Double the swings you make, and it doubles the ripostes for sure, but the swing of the mob is like a normal, single attack. It's not even an attack round. If you're tanking an EP god or something where a spike from a riposte can finish you off, then worry a little. Otherwise, it's not really that significant. Go for aggro over anything. If you can tank with a lesser aggro 2 hander without the DPS classes holding back much, go for that. Otherwise, DW aggro is much easier to find.<br />
<br />
  Your tactics sound fine. <br />
<br />
Another 2 hander you may look into: Anathema (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52058) off of Inny in Hate. Very decent ratio, and EB. It IS missing ac, but it's much easier to get than a BoW. Better aggro than a BBB too.</div></div><hr />

Actually, theres probably dozens of stratigies that can be used sucussfully in these situations, find one that works for you and run with it  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burol</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I agree with Slovak. It seems to me that a Magelo profile will serve you better if it is loaded with the correct info. Then you can accurately test how a new piece of armor or AA may effect your stats.<br />
<br />
ID5 and LR5 will help you tank in GoD and Hard LDoNs, but a far better boost to you will be if you give up dual wielding in both. I was in a similar situation as you and I felt that I had to dual wield in order to hold agro. But, even at 8600 buffed HPs, the ripostes were shredding me. Recently I tried tanking Hard LDoNs and GoD Trials using my GBoS and Stormrider Carapace. It has made a huge difference in how much damage I take. And even though my GBoS is currently not auged (72 more points  :)  ) I still hold agro pretty well with this setup and I am definately taking the beatings better. So, I recommend that you bag one of your weapons and see how you like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dual wielding just isn't a big deal in ldon or GoD, doing hard ldons and sewers/vxed/tipt I've never found it to be a problem.  I wouldn't even bother switching out a shield once the mobs is slowed, if you're going to switch out weapons you should go ahead and switch to a 2 hander once you have good agro, any decent 2 hander is going to be about as good as an anger3 BoC + shield for your purposes and the mob will die quicker.   I keep a few 2 handers around but don't use them except for when i don't want to tank or for furious.<br />
<br />
If dual wielding is giving you problems in these situations, it probably not your weapons that are your problem but the rest of your gear.   Getting your AC to at least 1400 unbuffed (and preferably a lot more) will help you a lot more than switching out weapons.</div></div><hr />

Ripostes Are Not An Issue<br />
<br />
That beeing said, while there will be a small DPS difference (5%) it will<br />
not be really important because you rarely get CHed with less than 1Khp left.<br />
It happens, but should not be too often.<br />
<br />
Slovak you are really really far from reality.<br />
While using 2H will give a real bonus compared to dual wield.<br />
Dual wield doesnt mean death touch, on the contrary.<br />
It usually means better agro, which implies faster slowing &amp; more aggresive nuking.<br />
However i will not deny the fact 2H &gt; DualWield for Tanking (Tanking not Agroing)<br />
<br />
If you really want to improve your tanking, max all defensive AA.<br />
And for GoD &amp; PoP focus a lot on AC.<br />
<br />
The HUGE difference people see when using a shield is .. THE SHIELD.<br />
You cant compare a 13/19 65hp to a 40ac 100hp shield.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : To look at some real hard data on 1K hitters &amp; ripostes :<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2867<br />
<br />
Going from a ZERO riposte world to a REAL world will increase the DPS you take by 12% <br />
<br />
Thats with 2x 20 delay weapons &amp; vs 400-1200 hitters in Time</div></div><hr />

This may be different for a highly equiped Elemental tank or Time equiped tank though.<br />

Its not Tenfold :)<br />
And i cant really say &quot;will be pissed&quot; because you will have a noticable agro gain as a tradeoff :)<br />
As for the Time+ , the 20% rule of thumb still applies.<br />
<br />
Of course there are dozen strategies, but i am tired of people talking about<br />
&quot;ever present mostrous killer ripostes&quot; specially this isnt true.<br />
<br />
Remember ripostes became really really dangerous when you entered PoP.<br />
In SoL the max hit was 1700 (without disc) on slow hitting AHR Blobs.<br />
In PoP you had some 3000 (without disc) ... and these were deadly.</div></div><hr />

Ripostes Are Not An Issue&quot;<br />
<br />
when tanking for a raid with healing chains etc ... or with phenominally good gear i can understand how the afformentioned would be true, but when youre running on mid-string gear without all defensive aas, and in a hard ldon where an extra landed riposte really spikes the dmg ... and you only have 1 healer, it does matter.<br />
<br />
ripostes are real, but i'm told that once you finish up all defensive aa's it doesnt make as much difference.  LR5 will help you miss the extra hits, and ID5 will smooth out the dmg spikes for mitigating what makes it through your avoidance.<br />
<br />
a quick fyi .. i have 8400 hps buffed up in these .. most heals i take are btw 5500 and max, and a heal for when i have less than 1k health isnt entirely rare.  it happens.<br />
<br />
i want to do more than just &quot;get by&quot;.  i want to be a tank that the cleric and group remembers as being exceptionally good at rolling with the punches.  from what i can gather, only gear and finishing up my aa's will help me with this.  my ac is pretty low (have yet to break 1300 naked but should with my next upgrade), and my hps (though decent) arent too terribly hot.  <br />
<br />
thanks all for the input, and thanks for affirming that i am not retarded in sticking with my duel wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8400hp vs 400 hitters = no real danger.<br />
8400hp vs 900 hitters = starting to get dangerous.<br />
8400hp vs 1500 hitters = deadly<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with the gear (unless there is a huge gap).<br />
Its mostly between the mobs max hit vs your HP.<br />
<br />
You will rarely die because of &quot;one extra hit&quot; from a 400 hitter (Normal)<br />
An extra hit from a 900 hitter can be dangerous (Specialy if you are unlucky with 2 ripostes).<br />
A 1500 hitter is deadly (one/two bad ripostes = disaster)<br />
<br />
Ps : Correcting the ratio to 15% its more realistic.<br />

Note that your AA/HP/AC will increase overtime while mob MaxHit will remain static.<br />
Which means you will surely get over the &quot;danger zone&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I have a pretty good 2her and I only bust it out for the occassional fellstrike/mighty strike big hit parade. Even when I am in DPS or offtank mode, the most I do is swap my weapons to tone down the agro a little bit.<br />
<br />
If A Mob Does Not Hit Over 15% Of Your Buffed Hp Ripostes Are Not An IssueAgain, I couldn't agree more. Unless you are dealing with heavy hitters, the difference is not worth losing the agro. Even against heavy hitters, I STILL duel weild until defensive runs out. Depending on the mob I may swap in a shield then, but never before. The more agro you can build, the faster the mob dies, and a dead mob can't riposte.<br />
<br />
I think the problem you have apolyon is your AC. I have been doing LDoN hards since I was at 6k/1300ac and those where as you describe. With only 1 healer, they were a bit rough. Since then, I changed my focus and started working on my AC. With upgrades and AA, I picked up another 300hp, but more importantly I picked up 200ac unbuffed. I noticed the biggest differences in mob DPS when I got substantial AC increases. Moreso than a level or 2 of any tanking AA.<br />
<br />
Last night I did an LDoN hard with just 1 cleric, 8500hp/1600ac/all tanking AA save SE. It was pretty easy, with only 1 close call when the cleric got stunned by a mezz resisting add. Other than that it was smooth with no problems. I am sure you will find the same when you get your AC up over 1400 unbuffed. I would HIGHLY recommend getting 5x 10ac augs from the LDoN vendor (Nro camp I think, been a while), that's 50ac raw you can put on for 2500ish points. Next to A3, those are the best points you will spend. I would also recommend trying to get a couple groups to go do the Ferubi named. You can pick up 2 15ac augments there for a total of 80ac raw from jusy augments, which would be a significant boost for you. There are also a few slots you could do a lot better with if you spend some time farming the bazaar or some small group raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm gonna toss my 2 cents in.  I have between 9.2K-9.8K hps buffed and around 1800 AC buffed and have probably 30 LDoN hard wins in the last few months and maybe 6-8 tipt / vxed / sewers wins in GoD.  My weapons are either anger augged BBB or anger augged BoC and unaugged hategiver. (also have aten gloves and WA5)<br />
<br />
I have found that FOR ME, I take much less damage with the BBB than with dual wield.  This is partially due to the rune proc on the BBB (procs a lot with WA5), the lessened riposites from using 2h and from the 40 raw AC on the BBB.  The damage taken is very noticable just from the naked eye as I go berserker a lot more often on heals using BBB than when using dual wield and some clerics I group with complain if I use dual wield because it makes them work harder. <br />
<br />
That said, that is only my situation.  You will always take less damage using 2h than dual wield, but the real question is do you have a 2h weapon that you can keep agro with.  In the old days I couldnt keep agro with unaugged BBB that well, but since LDoN with anger augs, WA5 and incite the agro situation for warriors has gotten a lot better.  If you can keep agro with 2h there really isnt a downside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I second that completely. If you could hold aggro with a shield, that'd seriously kick some ass too, though the lower DPS would hurt sometimes. Remember: Lots of ac, hp and DPS are worth nothing if you can't hold aggro.</div></div><hr />

If you need dual wield to hold aggro, my guess is you must use it.<br />
If you can hold aggro tightly with a 2 hander, do so.<br />
<br />
Only way Ill ever use dual wield is if I start to have aggro issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lr will defintly make the mob miss you more when it riposte, and id will lower the damage a landed riposte does.<br />
<br />
prolly what your running into is lesser mana healers trying to cast cheal to save mana, or ones who got chewed out for casting sl or whatever it is to much and running out of mana.</div></div><hr />

I have to be VERY aware of rage though. I never get 1 rounded, and don't think i can, so I don't really think dual wield is an issue. I do know that I can use all the aggro i can get in hard ldons atm, without augs and WA.<br />

A warrior can NEVER have enough agro for &lt;insert class here&gt; to &lt;insert high agro job here&gt; at max efficientcy in a group setting.<br />
<br />
Read that carefully because it is true, even for top end Time+GoD geared warriors. The key here is &quot;in a group setting.&quot; Group agro is a lot different than raid agro. Not only is agro a lot more likely to be lost in a group setting, but it is also exponentially more important that you don't lose agro.<br />
<br />
If you are not getting the maximum amount of agro possible, then you are holding the rest of your group back. That means slows and debuffs go in slower. That means clerics have to wait longer to throw heals and will often get stuck having to toss in a couple of small fast heals so that they can buy back enough time to use larger more agro producing heals. That means your DPS classes are having to throttle their damage back, letting the mob live longer, leaving more opportinities for the mob to do damage and possibly kill someone.<br />
<br />
The question is not CAN you hold agro with a 2her, the question is can you get as much agro with your 2her as you can with your 1hers.<br />
<br />
In the vast majority of cases, the answers is no, you cannot get as much agro with your 2hers. For endgame warriors, this is less of an issue due to the gap in agro generation from high end gear. For the people that worry the most about riposte damage, they also are the ones who need to squeeze every bit of agro they can to make the group more efficient.<br />
<br />
Trading 15% more mob DPS for 50% more agro is a small price to pay when you factor in the added benefits your groupmates will get from thr extra agro you have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got that right Haass. If you are dieing frequently because of riposte dmg in &lt;insert zone here&gt; you should NOT be tanking in that zone.<br />
<br />
And any warrior who is using a shield in exp groups needs to be beaten and thrown to the pallies.</div></div><hr />

This is false.  There is a point where agro gets to be too over the top, especially in xp groups.  WA5, anger augged weapons, innate procs like call of fire, incite, taunt, how much do you really need.  As long as you have enough agro to keep the mobs on you that is enough.  I would say that dps classes are &quot;throttling themselves&quot; in xp groups due to not enough agro is mostly a myth. I mean maybe if you are a time ++ geared wiz grouping with a bazaar geared level 65 0 aa warrior this happens, but if you are grouing with similar geared / aaed folks it just doesnt.</div></div><hr />

There is no way I could nuke as hard as I want and not get agro. I can certainly do a lot more than I could a year ago, but I can still take agro basically at will.<br />
<br />
Here is the real kicker. Due to my gear (concusion pants, better damage focus), I do a lot less agro/DPS than a lower geared wizard who would be grouping with lesser geared warriors. But, a lesser geared wizard can still nuke nearly as hard as I can because we are using the same spells. The difference is they have a lot harder time controlling agro without sacrificing DPS.<br />
<br />
If you believe that your agro is over the top, then you are sadly mistaken. You are mistaking enough agro to keep the mob on you with the group letting you keep agro. Your group's ability to keep agro on you does not mean you have over the top agro, it means they are losing efficiency by keeping agro on you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a hard LDoN once with 7200 hps (no cleric or shaman so my only hp buffs were 9 and SoT) and a non-uber druid healing me.  Bard slowing.  I was dual wielding.  Druid had mana problems, but I didn't die once.  Dual Wield in LDoN Hard is certainly not &quot;DEATH&quot;.  Not even close.<br />
<br />
If you're having a hard time staying alive, work on your AC/hps, don't gimp yourself by using a subpar 2-hander for aggro, and leave the shield bagged unless you just can't stay alive.</div></div><hr />

The problem here is probably that your group isn't pulling fast enough.  If you are sitting around waiting for pulls and regening your mana back, lack of warrior agro isnt holding you back it is lack of mobs in the camp to use your mana on.  I'm only in elemental planes, but I group wtih wizards with max aas, and max FT, and most of the nifty focuses quite often and they aren't ever sitting around FM waiting for me to get more agro so they can nuke.  <br />
<br />
In fact wizards are probably one of the classes that give me the least trouble with agro out of all the dps classes.  Wizards can easily wait until I have fought the mob for a few seconds then dump a lot of mana / damage into the mob quickly.</div></div><hr />

Sure cant argue the logic.<br />
I might get the GoD AA, buy a BoC/CHoS combo and toy around with dual wield, but I honestly only have a problem with the occasional necro.<br />
<br />
I got a hunch the only thing Im going to see is less DPS dished out and more damage taken though.<br />
<br />
Then again it may be because I dont really play with any ele/time flaged folk.<br />

But if the day comes when I do and the situation you described is true, it wouldnt hurt to pull the one handers out of the bag and see what happens.<br />

<br />
that really depends on what youre looking for in the weapon itself.  if youre looking for dps, then youre right .. no buyable weapons are as good.  for aggro and stats there are a plethora of options which will outperform it.<br />
<br />
its a great weapon .. dont get me wrong.  i would love to pick one up for dps ... or to slap a yak augment on and tank in groups w/out high aggro individuals.</div></div><hr />

I often group with a very zealous beastlord, good friend and very skilled player, and I must say that when she goes into dps mode, pet, dotting, slowing and nuking, agro becomes insane, and if you don't proc on schedule, you lose agro. That's with DBotW+BF/EoE+2xA3+symbol+ce15+wa5.<br />
<br />
If, when unexpected things happen and group needs to step up pace, and everyone who can goes into dps, you cannot keep up, the group is poorer for it.<br />
This is of course unlikely to happen in your general dull 1-mob-at-a-time exp-grind, but if you're crawling a tough place or experimenting, this is a very real issue.<br />
<br />
Apart from paladins, beastlords are a very good class to inherit agro off, they can generate a lot of hate to a mob.</div></div><hr />

Anyway I do agree that there are times when you need more agro, even in xp groups than 2h will give you, but for me those times are rare.  I can't really remember the last time I brought out the dual EB augged weapons for an xp group.  The main time I use dual wield really is on raid bosses, with disc up.  Once disc drops I swap out to 2h</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as some helpful tips for stayin alive in hard LDoN:<br />
1. Dont be stingy with using defensive/evasive, and furious/fortitude. Depending on how fast your group is killin you should be able to use furious/fortitude twice in a hard LDoN. Also, you should be able to us Def/Evasive (you choose, i use Def myself) every 6th -8th mob. Dont just save discs for nameds is my advice. This can save a lot of mana, keep you alive in tight situations, give crowd control folks time to lock things up, etc...<br />
<br />
2. Kinda basic, but worth mentioning in my opinion is using /shield. Can buy healers or crowd control a little time, and keep the damage where it belongs....on you.  Kinda a &quot;keep them alive so they can keep you alive&quot; sorta deal.<br />
<br />
3. If you have room and you get in a tight situation waiting for a heal and you need to turn attack off, I will sometimes kite a snared mob around a room and let pets/casters/etc finish it off. Be aware of your surroundings and dont agro any extra baddies :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, my 2cp. Good hunting to you.</div></div><hr />

If they aren't pushing agro to the limit they aren't doing their job. If a wizard goes all out nuking, they are going to be tanking and there is nothing you can do about it. You are delusional if you think otherwise.<br />
<br />
Of course, you pretty much verified exactly what I am talking about ...<br />
<br />
Wizards can easily wait until I have fought the mob for a few seconds then dump a lot of mana / damage into the mob quickly.Waiting around for you to get good agro = not doing DPS = not being efficient. The longer I stand around waiting for your weapons to proc, the less DPS I am doing. If your wizards have to wait to nuke, then your shammy has to wait to slow, your chanter has to wait to tash, exactly what you are trying to avoid.<br />
<br />
Every other class (well, maybe not bards) in the game can out agro a warrior if they want to. If you are gimping yourself and only doing half the agro you could be doing you are gimping the rest of your group in the process. Play the game any way you like, but the fact is that dual weilding = more agro unless you are comparing a BoW to a couple of noob weapons.<br />

My basic point is, if mobs are being pulled rapidly and constantly in camp don't tell me that as an &quot;uber wizard&quot; you never stop for 5-10 seconds to med.  Put those 5-10 seconds of med time right after the mob is engaged so that agro locks down.  If this puts a crimp in your burst DPS (aka you can't nuke non-stop as hard as you can on a single mob) then I don't care.  It isn't going to affect your total dps over the course of say a complete LDoN mission.<br />
<br />
As for the point about the beastlord, they make a lot of noise and agro with all their spells but the dps they do is pretty low compared to what other classes can do with 1/3rd the agro.  If a beastlord wants to slow the mob, then dump on 5 dots that each produce insane agro for 30-40 damage per tick only, and then plink mobs with their sucky low damage nukes WHILE meleeing with proccing weapons, well no one in hell is gonna keep agro off them, but dont' call that dps mode, call it insane agro / while approaching half the dps of a real dps class mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sitting indoors is just as bad. If you only have 1 mob in camp, you are not pulling fast enough. You do know about sitting when there are mobs around right? 5-10 seconds of med time when a mob is engaged is a drop of  10-20% on a mob that dies in 60 seconds, for a typical HLDoN mob, 45 seconds per mob including pull time is pretty reasonable. Waiting 10 seconds for you to get agro is costing me 20% of my DPS. Hell, why don't I just take off my damage focus, after all its just 20% more damage right?

You really need to educate yourself on the value and skills of a beastlord. You'll probably be surprised.</div></div><hr />

Gartuff's point was not that beastlords are not good damage, but beastlord damage is 'disproportiante' with aggro.  Rogues do a fair bit more sustained damage than beastlords and generate a tiny portion of the aggro.<br />
<br />
Finally, I play a 65 mage with 400+ AA.  I have Emperor Robe, Water form 3, Shield of Aura, and basically the maximum possible mana regen a caster can have outside of buffs.<br />
<br />
Assuming mobs are coming non stop, and there is no charmed hasted dual wielding pet, I can nuke reasonably on each mob and be OOM at the end of the adventure.  Nobody is arguing that dual wield would allow you to nuke harder on a particular mob, the point is that hard LDoN adventures tipically last long enough that you can go OOM and be absolutely efficient without chain nuking each mob.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, if you tried chain nuking as much as you could on each mob, I am pretty sure you could go OOM within less than ~10 minutes of the adventure, then the only thing carrying you through would be your mana rege.</div></div><hr />

I read that differently.<br />
I thought he meant that if the BL was in DPS mode he wouldnt be generatting aggro, and if he was doing all the aggro generating stuff he wouldnt be doing DPS.<br />

*Re reads*<br />
<br />
Im still not sure what he meant *LOL*<br />

I tried a CHoS/SotBS combo today and got different results than I thougt.<br />
<br />
1.) The Cleric said any additional riposte damage I was taking was hardly noticable<br />
<br />
2.) My DPS was gimped all to hell.<br />
<br />
3.) The groups DPS remained the same.<br />
<br />
4.) Although budget 1 handers they held aggro as well as my GSot4W on incoming, but if they dont proc I actually begin to lose aggro mid fight. (Nothing serious that a taunt/incite cant handle, but less endurance for discs)<br />
<br />
5.) Everyone was in agreeance that dual wield makes mighty strike look cooler. :)<br />
<br />
My conclusions be that either the 1 handers I bought are simply subpar (Really wanted a BoC/CHoS combo)<br />
<br />
I need the GoD DW AA<br />

And either the regs I hang out with either arent pushing their DPS, or I simply domnate in the AA/gear department.<br />
(They are all 65's but their AA and gear are wildly irratic)<br />

Coulda swore I was taking more damage, but my cleric assured me it was nothing.<br />

Oh yeah, even with dual wield the Necro gets occasional aggro and makes snide comments :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hi i have duel anger3 auged HATE weapons.  i grouped with a BL today in several hard ldons ... and yes ... a good beastlord puts out a hell of a lot of aggro when they go into full efficiency dps/auxillary mode.  when i had lots of procs (most of the time) i was fine ... but there were some fights where i just could not get them to blink in my direction.  nuking with every refresh on top of slows<br />
<br />
if you play a BL and you dont generate lots of aggro, then you arent playing your class to its full potential.  I dont necessarily mean stealing aggro from the designated tanks, because you should always be warry of them, but you should pretty much always be right behind them as per generated hate.  btw slows, nukes, cripples, and procs ... there should be a metric buttload of aggro. i've had lv 62 BL's with ldon procs on non hate weapons peel aggro off me in BoT xp groups when they are efficient in nuking.   Rodney, if you dont generate lots of hate then you suck as a BL and need to reconsider your playstyle... perhaps even &quot;get a clue&quot; ... then again ... youre only 62 and you could have shit for gear and mana regen ... which means that:<br />
1. you cant toss up your nukes every time they refresh, <br />
2. your weapons arent too hot ... thus your melee dps is no good<br />
3. you havent invested the time into ldon procs to maximize dps<br />
4. you have not maximized offensive melee aa's<br />
5. you havent maxed out your spell/proc crit aa's<br />
the end.<br />
<br />
i played a ranger up to 65 with 250+ aas before i rolled a warrior.  anytime i went full offensive from melee range, with nuking every time the refreshed (max crit aa's too) and putting out nice dps with ldon procs, innate procs, and a killer 2hander, i would generate tons of hate.  now imagine tossing melee debuffs and slows into the mix, on top of not having a jolt line of spell to ditch unwanted aggro, and you'll &quot;get a clue&quot; as to why any higher end BL who's worth anything will be generating tons of aggro.<br />
<br />
ps-  i love grouping with BL's.  aside from bards they are the most versatile and often useful class in the game.  I dont group ldons with shamans much anymore unless they are close friends who i like to spend time grouping with.  BL's are just that mucn better.</div></div><hr />

Never once have I said that I nuke non stop as hard as I can without ever running out of mana.  Those are your words. What I did say is that you not having the max agro possible limits the amount of nuking I can do. Not having the max agro you can have hinders every other closs in your group. This is not a difficult concept, how hard is that to understand?<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
There have been SEVERAL Hard LDoN parses done on this board and on Graffe (which resulted in wizards crying nerf btw) which showed warriors did comparable if not greater damage than wizards over an LDoN (hard) length group at high up time.<br />
<br />
Yet, you insist that unless a warrior goes into maximum aggro mob, you cannot 'spend' your mana fast enough over the course of the entire adventure to not have mana left over?<br />
<br />
I am sorry, I flat out do not believe you.  Assuming the warrior is not using shitty as hell weapons, the difference between an anger3 augmented BBB and double EB dual wield set up is not enough so you won't be able to fully express your DPS.<br />
<br />
You 'mention' that waiting till 80% gimps your DPS.  I am absolutely positive, that in every single hard LDoN with uptime higher than 70% I could go OOM if I began nuking at 80% easily, and I 'channnel' mana slower than a wizard.<br />
<br />
On bosses, on clearing trash on a raid, I fully agree casters are aggro limited.  Over the course of an exp session, unless the group is stacked as hell with mana regen and pulling slowly (think Mod Rods, Beastlord using paragorn, bard, Sk, Necro doing MW, etch) you will not be having issue with not being able to go OOM.<br />
<br />
I play a caster with maximum possible mana regen, LESS ability to shed aggro than a wizard (I only got SCS3 to help with my aggro) whose nukes use less mana/second and I still have no issue going OOM in a Hard LDoN group provided a) no Enchanter charmed pet b) reasonably high uptime</div></div><hr />

  Apo no BL in their right mind slows, 5 dots and then nukes non-stop.  In the first place we only have a few good dots (at 62 only 1).    And yes a BL can pull agro any time he wants and I am always testing the limit on it.  I start slow and work it up till I get agro and find out just how hard this mob hits a leather class pc, then I decide if and when I want agro.   With a tank that knows me there is no problem, I dont die (much) from over agro but some pick-up tanks get a little upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;you could have shit for gear and mana regen&quot;  with my gear and mana regen I can match your DPS and not get killed doing it.  I can see that while you give BL's mouth service you dont really know much about em.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for the point about the beastlord, they make a lot of noise and agro with all their spells but the dps they do is pretty low compared to what other classes can do with 1/3rd the agro&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
my good bst friends put out over 200dps btw pet/melee/nukes/dots<br />
<br />
so yeah, a good beastlord does slow, then load in all dots and nuke to hell.  its called being efficient and making the most of what you got, and its what separates the truely good players (not just well equipped) from those who simply get by doing barely enough.  a bl working efficiently produces a lot of aggro, and if you find yourself not agreeing with me, you need to reconsider your choice of class, because you obviously arent playing it well.<br />
<br />
its like saying that a good necromancer doesnt generate tons of hate. good necros, beastlords, rogs, and wizards are why a warrior needs to get strong aggro weapons and procs in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never played a wizard, but concerning the general rule that aggro generation on the part of the tank is often a bottleneck in single-group damage output, I have to agree with Wandor.<br />
The better the tank's aggro, the faster the mob can be killed and the less danger non-tanks will go splat. From the point in the game when it becomes dangerous and mana inefficient for casters to get hit through the point it becomes dangerous for non-plate melee to get hit clear through to the end game, this is always true.<br />
Something else that's true: if you are a good player and people like you, your groupmates will not announce in /g that they are throttling their damage output because your aggro blows. If they see you are doing what you can, and you simply don't have the best weapons/gear, they'll quietly adjust. So, just because you're holding aggro just fine doesn't mean better aggro would be wasted, or that you have &quot;enough&quot; aggro.<br />
There are all sorts of situations where using a 2H weapon might make sense, but all other things being equal, the trade off is that it will cost you aggro and almost certainly force others in your group to back off on the aggro they are producing. Generally, that means they will be doing less harm to the mob.<br />
A 2H weapon, then, is sort of like insurance. You trade some aggro for a decreased risk that riposte will kill you. Since the AC/hp/mitiation of each warrior is different, and since mobs vary quite a bit, the risk you face might be different from the risk another warrior faces. What you need to do is figure out whether the decreased risk is worth it for you.<br />
If you are grouping often with the same people, it seems logical to me to ask the healer what he thinks: are ripostes causing spikes to the extent that they give him problems healing efficiently? If no one knows, then experiment and see what happens.<br />
I'd say in many cases, some riposte issues can be solved by getting a few hundred more AC/hps and more AAs. Of course, that's like saying poverty is easily solved by getting rich. <br />
But when Haass says he thinks 2H weapons are overrated, I'm fairly certain that what is behind his thinking is that you must deal with AC/hp/mitigation development in your character. If you do, the added safety value of using a 2H weapon decreases, particularly against non-named, non-boss mobs.<br />
I don't necessarily agree that a warrior shouldn't be tanking in places where mobs are causing him problems. I'd say every once in a while you should tank in situations where it's very difficult for you/your group to win.<br />
Finally, fighting in an experience group always involves negotiating where you are along a risk/benefit curve that can move around a good bit as you go from pull to pull. I'm always extremely leery of statements like &quot;If the wizard isn't out of mana, the problem is you're not pulling fast enough.&quot;<br />
The easiest skill in the entire game is to pull faster in an experience group. Too bad really fast pulling is almost never a solution to the problem of maximizing a group's kill rate. A wizard who isn't out of mana is *not* a problem for a group. But a wizard who can't nuke when and how much he would like because he has to wait for the tank's aggro to build and build *is* a problem for a group. And it's certainly not a problem that faster pulling will solve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got lucky with a BOW as we broke into EP's and tank with it for the most part now.I think it's been a significant advantage on some of the heavier hitters on raids,but,most of the time aggro is the only real concern with weapon choice.<br />
<br />
With a little bit of luck; chanters tash on inc now, wizards chain nuke,beasts slow and go nutz... life is good. :) Raids can be more unpredictable and my crazy necro friends who insist they can tank pop mobs have me running sometimes.We're always subject to luck,but, you can stack the odds in your favor now better than ever.On Stromm I was in banded and crafted well into my 50's with no haste till 53 or so in Veksar.I quested aggroy weapons with neat procs or decent ratios and aggro was hell.Besides the great people I've met on Stromm and especially in my guild Final Door ;nothing has made tanking more enjoyable than the aquisition of decent aggro.<br />
<br />
Theres tons of great info on these boards about maxmizing aggro output.Within reason that should be a warrior's primary concern IMHO.It's made tanking a lot more fun for me.</div></div><hr />

If you have never played a class, don't try to tell somebody who plays that class as a main how to play it.  You always come off looking like a fool.  And Wandor is the last person I would want to try to tell about wizards.<br />
<br />
That said, there's no way you're helping your group by lowering your aggro to get a tiny reduction in dps taken from ripostes.  <br />
<br />
In my experience, Beastlords are one of the tougher classes to hold aggro off of because they are meleeing while they slow and sending in the pet etc, so they are much harder to get early aggro from than a shaman (assuming the shaman doesn't dot on inc).  Not that I'm criticising, I love Beastlords.<br />
<br />
Necros are the undisputed gods of aggro, and if you have one in your group you can't possibly have enough aggro hehe.  Aggressive wizards are right up there though.</div></div><hr />

Reading comprehension is your friend. Again, you are making assumptions and not ready what I am posting.<br />
<br />
Let me post it again so we can go over what I said -<br />
Those are your words. What I did say is that you not having the max agro possible limits the amount of nuking I can do. Not having the max agro you can have hinders every other closs in your group. This is not a difficult concept, how hard is that to understand?Notice that I never say anything about running out of mana. My point - which I have a hard time believing anyone would refute - is simply stated - Not having the max agro you can have hinders every other class in your group. Please explain to me how this could possible not be true. If the tank does not have max agro, then every other class in the group has to tone down what ever it is that they are doing to keep from getting agro. All other classes have to play to the agro of the tank.<br />
<br />
I am well aware of the limitations of wizards in high uptime groups in LDoN - the parses you are refering to are mine. I am pretty sure I have a handle on that. My class is good for one thing other than transportation, and that is getting shit dead. When the chanter dies to a bad pull and the group has a couple of unslowed 900 hitters loose, they need to die right now. If the newb tank is using his lame ass 2h weapon because he thinks riposte damage is making a difference, I can't unload on the mob as much as I can if the same tank is using a pair of A3'd Droga weapons. That my friend, is called limiting my DPS.<br />
<br />
The examples are limitless. When a tank has less agro for what ever reason, everyone else in the group has to alter their play to match the agro of the tank. That is a simple, undeniable truth. The fact that we are talking about a 50% increase in proc agro - the single biggest agro generator a warrior has - makes this a no brainer. If you can't understand the math of 1.5 agro &gt; 1.0 agro then you are beyond help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This all depends on what classes you are grouping with and what your diff options are for weapons setups and stuff is.  Fact is I do plenty of LDoN hard missions with wizards with rogues with beastlords with necromancers with rangers and 95% of the time I use 2h because the agro from it is enough.  Like I said before for me the advantage isnt just less rips from using 2h the breakdown is<br />
<br />
augged BBB: 40 raw AC more, rune 3 proc for less damage taken, more melee dps for me<br />
<br />
dual EB augged combo: 80 more hps or so, more agro<br />
<br />
Now if I can keep agro with augged BBB (and I can) and I take significantly less damage while using it (which I do) I will.  The tradeoff is that I have a much higher survival rate and do more dps, vs a wizard not being able to instaburn a single mob down asap.<br />
<br />
Obviously this isnt true for everyone, I do agree if you have a bazaar warrior with crap gear and no aas, they probably won't have good enough agro with 2h and will have to use the droga weapons.  But you can't honestly say then you make warriors in your guild bag weapons like anger augged BoW and force them to use BF and BoC augged to &quot;maximize agro&quot;</div></div><hr />

Unless, of course, the aggro of the tank as it is is enough for everyone in the group to do their jobs to the best of their ability.<br />

In that light, you going oom over an adventure is KEY to this discussion. If, nuking as well as you can given your tank, you can NOT go oom at the end of the adventure, then either (a) pulling wasn't fast enough or (b) tank needs more aggro.<br />

If you CAN go oom, then whatever combo the tank is using is GOOD ENOUGH. In fact, if the tank optimizes for aggro PAST that point, they are nerfing the group's dps by not using a more dps set of weaponry.<br />

Where exactly this &quot;oom&quot; point is for a given wizard / warrior match up is difficult to formulate in abstract terms, but when Gartuff says using his 2hs things are fine FOR US -- believe him.

Unless, of course, the aggro of the tank as it is is enough for everyone in the group to do their jobs to the best of their ability.Since every single class in EQ (other than a bard) can take agro from a warrior by casting too early or doing too much DPS too early, how can anyone ever do their job to the best of their ability when they are tied to warrior agro??? Waiting until 80% to nuke, hitting FD, evading, turning off attack, using high mana/low agro heals is NOT doing your job to the best of your ability.<br />

I can sit around and nuke just enough to go oom on the last mob, that doesn't mean I did my job to the best of my ability. See above example on the need to burn a mob down, or the need to slow sooner, or the need to debuff sooner, etc.<br />

We group constantly with a necro, wizard, a beastlord, and/or a mage -- and all of them blast away to their heart's content with nary a problem.Hurray for you, your group mates know how to keep agro on the warrior. That doesn't mean they are operating at their best efficiency.</div></div><hr />

You have a very strange idea of &quot;doing your job to the best of your ability&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is a DPS classes job? To kill the mob fast. It doesn't matter which part of hte mob's health (first part or last part) you administer your beat down to. And since we've already established you can't chain nuke throughout the LDoN, you'd have to take a break somewhere. Obviously, the right point to do this IS AT THE BEGINNING.<br />
<br />
Obviously, FOR ANY TANK EVER, you can take aggro from them in the first 5 seconds unless they get really luck on procs. However, after those 5 seconds are up -- you're in the clear. What's so hard about this concept?</div></div><hr />

  How common are BFs? How many warriors do you think have a BoW AND a BF? Beyond that, what Wandor is refering to is NOT aggro over time. It's also early aggro. If the enchanter has to wait to tash, if the shaman can't slow from the get go without getting aggro and so forth then you aren't not optimizing the group. BoWs are very nice for getting early, reliable aggro AND very nice aggro over time. Are they maximal for aggro over time? No. Is their DPS combined with the proc very, very reliable for getting aggro early? Yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm.  We got 3 blood frenzy in guild (out of 38+ cursed kills) and 3 blades of war (out of 2 RZ  :D  ) <br />
<br />
We have 8 ACTIVE warriors on our roster, plus a very active two boxed warrior.<br />
<br />
Most warriors have at least double EB+ type aggro set up.<br />
<br />
One warrior in particular, with the highest hp/LDoN points has Blood Frenzy/Hategiver both augmented with anger3 and WA 5, yet in every LDoN group we do he uses an Augmented Emperor sword instead to tank.<br />
<br />
Why?  Yes, more aggro is good.  Nobody would ever turn down more aggro for their main tank.  The issue is if the opportunity cost for aggro is worth it.<br />
<br />
Nobody is arguing going with a full out DPS set up if you are struggling with aggro.  The argument seems to be more like how much aggro should be worth it.<br />
<br />
Wandor believed that no matter the aggro a warrior has it would never be enough because no class can 'express' itself fully without aggro constraints.  My argument is that once you reach a certain threashold, extra aggro is always great, but not nearly as valuable.<br />
<br />
In particular, dual wielding EB weapons an entire adventure instead of using a solid aggro 2h with a good augment in the chance an enchanter dies a wizard can chain nuke the add is down right stupid.<br />
<br />
Is more aggro good?  YES<br />
Is aggro worth sacrificing everything over once past a certain threshold?  No, expecially if the increase is miniml for a sacrifice</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're still subject to the ominous RNG.If you're a warrior and you want to tank you can NEVER have too much aggro because the timing and frequency of procs is out of our control.Auged BOW's &amp; BF's both give great aggro for a warrior,but, due to unlucky and ill timed moments other group members can and will steal aggro and die.When the day comes that no one peals aggro from me when I'm tanking I will cease worrying about maxing my hate output.Of course that day better not come or EQ is toast.<br />
<br />
Now, I've never had an auged BBB so im talking outa my ass.However, my auged BOW and  BF/BOC are not ENOUGH aggro for me.If there is a Significant reduction in aggro from your dual wield setup;then 40ac, a lil riposte from xp mobs, a rune and a small dps improvement on your part do not substantiate the switch IMO. <br />
<br />
Yeh stuff is way better then it used to be.Hate augs,WA-5 and incite has people wanting warrior tanks...I love it. :) Unless you're duoing with a priest who's not dotting or nuking much your dps is not a primary concern.The group's consistent output is.Your job is to give the group time to resolve problems.As you exert more control over the mobs you'll have more fun and groups will be more effective.Aggro first IMO.</div></div><hr />

Still, though, if my guild were rapid paces and moving quickly to time, i wouldnt jump for a BoW, as i would save my dkp for the amazing weapons in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree with wandor that having more agro can only be beneficial to the group.<br />
<br />
However he is exagerating (damn gnome).<br />
After a certain point more agro means absolutely NOTHING.<br />
Let me explain...<br />
<br />
I have BoW+Anger3 &amp; Sews+Ykesha ... And Raex BP &amp; Saryn Range &amp; Combat Effects<br />
<br />
I never use the BoW in LDoN, and while the agro on the Sews is really inferior.<br />
And i mean really INFERIOR, i can feel it, every time we have to burn.<br />
Because  i loose agro to trigger happy burning wizards. <br />
There is no real &quot;penalty&quot; to the group between the 2 combo.<br />
<br />
Of course, when we have 3 adds, and we have to burn, i get the BoW out.<br />
Because ... Well i need all the Agro i can get.<br />
<br />
Sulvar is right, BBB+A3 or Super Ultra EB combo ....<br />
Well under &quot;normal&quot; LDoN conditions (thats in hard missions) the difference wont<br />
really hinder the group.  As wandor said LDoN = Endurance, and even himself<br />
agrees that wizards are really feeble in this domain.<br />
<br />
Like i said before : <br />
<br />
If you have a GOOD 2Hander KEEP IT , LOVE IT , CHERISH IT, USE IT .<br />
<br />
As long as you realise you will have to switch whenever max agro is required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally,I'm lazy and an aggro addict so I lean to more hate.If you're thinking about augs and wapons to come get the most hate you can.You can always swap in what works if you can turn it up on when you need to.<br />
<br />
Btw, I'm glad I got the BOW. I'm tanking all the time.When the day's getting long and the clerics are logging/going LD and we're doing a heavy hitter I'm glad to have it.Since we hit EP's my aggro isn't what it used to be.In earth and air I often see other names flashing through the HOTT.On mobs who are hitting for like 1k I'm often tempted to switch in my BF/BOC.I love the BOW though and this came as a surprise to me.It's really grown on me and I wouldn't trade it back for double the DKP.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the point is messing around with less agro ever. I plan on upgrading straight to Time 1hers for agro and a VDD or SEWS for DPS. If my job is to keep a mobs attention, then I will go all out always, because you never know when the shit is going to hit the fan. Before I moved my warrior I did 30+ levels and 60+ aa with my wizard and warrior grouped, even with BoC+A2 and GBoS+A2 my agro was never quite enough. I quickly realized the mistake I made in not getting A3.<br />
<br />
I think you guys are putting way too much importance on the damage savings of a 230 pt rune. Even with WA5 the best you are going to get is 690 pt of damage saved per minute. Unless you are getting under 5% health every single heal, the difference is not even going to be noticed by your healer, particularly when the minimum hit of an HLDoN mob is enough to kill the rune. I would much rather know that I can engage a second mob and still keep agro on the first while the group finishes it off than save 690hp/min and pick up 10 dps for myself.<br />

<br />
My personal opinion is Sulvar is better off with his eb weapons equipped.I don't believe I ever would have picked up or tanked with the BBB in any situation with EB weapons in my bag.If you're having fun with your friends though, /shrug relax and enjoy.<br />
<br />
When asked by warriors in my guild what weapons they should save for my list is pretty limited.Atm EB weapons and Sews(never had one but you guys seem to like them :) ).In the past I included things like CHSD,Blackout and GBOS.I've never had a Blackout or GBOS,but, I've seen them work well.One day in time I may go back to 1 handers as my primary setup... still a ways off tho.<br />
<br />
BTW, my guild's SA seems to do fine with hate auged dps weapons.But he's a crazy kitty.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was duel wielding BoC (aug'ed with Ykesha) and Rotting Fist (other Ykesha) for a long time. With WA3 I had solid aggro - got told by my slowers and nukers that they felt very comfortable with me a s tank.<br />
<br />
A Month ago i got a BoW - tested it out ... and experienced a loss of aggro (naturally because Enraging Blow is the same and i lost the 2 stun aggro procs). But then i put in Anger 3 in BoW and got WA4 and feel comfortable again.<br />
<br />
In regards to healing (I have ~9.6khp and ~1700 AC buffed): my clerics noticed a HUGE difference in healing me since i got the BoW. I myself noticed that too when i box my cleric in SolRo/Torment/Valor etc.<br />
<br />
That goes especially for hard LDONs (1k hitter), PoWater upper (800-1k) and PoWater lower level (900-1200)  and PoFire on yellow/red field 2 mobs (800-1k).<br />
Duel wield is not so to worry about in PoEarth and PoFire (field 1) against blue con mobs there. Majorly because mobs dont hit that hard (only 400-800)<br />
<br />
And if its only that much damage from ripostes - it is a difference if you need 2 CH per mob - or group finishes the mob with you at 70-80% where the healer has to throw another heal on you to to you off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see the point is messing around with less agro ever <br />
<br />
I use the Sews for the fun factor (looks &amp;  runes &amp; ykesha). <br />
If i had a Vazanir i'd be using that (looks &amp; lifetap probably)<br />
That beeing said ... (BoW is fucking ugly ok ?)<br />
<br />
The people i hang out with see almost zero difference between the 2 combo.<br />
That is under normal conditions (non full burn). Under burning, i find agro severly lacking.<br />
<br />
If the shaman/ench/bst can slow almost at inc.<br />
And the wizard start nuking at like 90% then you have sufficient agro.<br />
<br />
Getting &quot;MORE AGRO&quot; will not increase your groups kill rate or efficiency.<br />
Getting &quot;LESS DMG&quot; wont really increase your groups efficiency either.<br />
<br />
Once you reach a point when you generate enough agro to permit everyone<br />
in the group to perform efficiently under normal conditions...<br />
You are free to do whatever pleases you.<br />
<br />
Wandor would you radically change your playing style in LDoN if your MT switched<br />
from DBoW/EoE + A3 to something like Vazanir+Ykesha ?<br />
Probably nuke a little bit slower, wouldnt really hinder your group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its like saying : I use BF+A3 &amp; BoC in LDoN , because Emp 1H sucks offhander.<br />
<br />
Thats retarded, Emp 1H while it is indeed worse than the BoC offhander will not make/break a group.<br />
You could use it if you want, and still not hinder/slow down/gimp your groups efficiency.<br />
<br />
Why use it ? For the fun, for the looks, for the cool critic lifetaps.<br />
And because it will have ZERO negative side effect under normal conditions.<br />
<br />
Of course, when you have a 4 pull, and you have to burn stuff down ...<br />
Get the BoC back offhand, no questions asked, just do it.<br />
<br />
But saying &quot;Dont use EMP, because no agro&quot; is stupid.<br />
<br />
If your group can fonction very efficiently under normal conditions.<br />
Then do whatever you want (increasing agro is an option not a necessity).<br />
As long as you have the possibility to do it when it is required.<br />
<br />
I use a sews, because it makes me happy, and does not gimp down my group.<br />
However when the shit hits the fan, i get the BoW out ..<br />
Why ? Because I need all the agro i can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its like someone asking : I have BoC+Anger3 Mainhanded.<br />
<br />
The 14/18 Stun Offhand, with what should i augmnent it ?<br />
<br />
Of course A3 will be better (more agro cant be bad).<br />
However he will probably do just fine with Ykesha (Agro difference will be minimal)<br />
Or just leave it like that (which is not too wise as a solution)<br />
<br />
Why Ykesha and not A3 ?<br />
Because of WA5<br />
Because of EB/A3 Mainhanded.<br />
Because of the Critic Fun Factor.<br />
Because its cheaper.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will totally agree with Wandor, having MORE agro can only be BETTER.<br />
However its not a necessity, it has to be a possibility.</div></div><hr />

My question at this point is I use the cookie cutter CHoS and SoTB and am very close to Anger 2 augments. My aggro is pretty good only if the shammy gets resisted do I loose aggro would it make sense to put two anger 2 augments on my weapons or just one on the CHoS first in primary? <br />
<br />
I am a casual player no raid and my server does not do open raids. I do not see a upgrade in the future and I have seen that the GSoT does not hold aggro for me as well as DW. I am one yellow from 60 and doing good equiptment wise for now and only have 20K in the bank needed for my wife's cleric spells. <br />
<br />
Let me know what you all think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you get to a 305 dex, the mainhand gets 2 procs/min and the offhand gets 1 proc/min.  If you have 2 anger 2 augs that's a total of 1200 hate/min (3 procs * 400 per proc.)  If you have a single anger 3 aug in the primary that's also a total of 1200 hate/min (2 procs * 600 per proc.)  So, the hate generated by the setups is equal in the long run, although the 2 proc setup is a little better on initial agro because you are procing more often.<br />
<br />
So....my advice is, get anger 3 and save up for another agro proc in the offhand. (either anger 3 or ykesha)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you see yourself getting better weapons sometime in the near future, I dont know if I'd anger III either of them.  Anger II on both weapons won't be the be all and end all of aggro, but it's a very nice aggro combo, and it doesn't take as many points to aug both of them that way.  If you don't see any better weapons coming your way any time soon, Abinormal's advice is dead on.  I dual wield droga weapons with anger II and rarely have any aggro problems at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Gartuff's main cleric (we group together almost exclusively), I can say -- the difference between BBB (2h + rune) is VERY noticable over dual weild. Would it ruin me if he switched? No, I'd have to be a bit more on my toes etc, heal a tad earlier. I personally prefer him to take slightly less damage and give me more time to lock down other heals as needed (if we get multiples and we have no CC - as is usually the case - whomever is doing root CC usually needs a heal or two). Anyway, it all comes down to group makeup and personailities. But for me -- yes, I can notice the difference.<br />
<br />
(When we're slumming it and doing easy LDoN's the difference is even more noticable)<br />
<br />
I would rather have max agro all of the time and not worry about switching.<br />
<br />
We like to annoy Gartuff by making him switch his weapons in and out over and over. Its our primary form of amusment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't help myself, I am a min/maxer hardcore. Once the math shows one way to be better, it's that way or die! ;)<br />
<br />
Incidently, the A2 v. A3 thing really got me. I bought up a pair of A2s without doing the math and now I kick myself every time I look at my weapons. If you have the Droga combo, I would recommend picking the one you like better and putting A3 on it and use that mainhand. You get the same net agro/min for nearly the same amount of points. Augment the offhand when you can, if you get an upgrade while you are saving points, at least you don't waste an augment.<br />
<br />
Also Caldron, your server may not have open raids available right now, but there is no reason why you can't run them yourself. Get 65 and some AAs, then start with something small. There are several lists on these boards with single group/small raid mobs. You might want to start with the BoT tower. Start a channel and run events on a regular basis. Before you know it, you will have enough people to step up the size mobs you can kill. There is a public raid channel on Prexus that routinely has 150+ raider just waiting for something to go down. Eci has an excellent public raid system that has made it to Time. You will find that there are many people in your situation or in casual guilds that would love to get some PoP flags done.</div></div><hr />
