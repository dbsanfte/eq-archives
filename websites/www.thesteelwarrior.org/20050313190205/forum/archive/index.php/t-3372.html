These are 5 minutes with Avatar and my soloing buffs.  1470 ATK and 30% spell haste, 41% item haste.<br />

The VDD is augmented with 100 Ykesha, and my dex with it is 267, and the VDD tests are all run with CF1 and 1389 ATK. Each test run was 5 mins, as you can see there's a lot of variance with such a small data set.<br />

The PPM info is basically worthless as the sample size is too small.  But the DPS parses over 5 mins are pretty accurate, I did a few of them a couple of times and came up with basically the same #'s.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I thought there might be issue with that.  Parsing unbuffed might give an unfair advantage to 1h weapons unless you have 1h weapons with a large delay.<br />
<br />
Since there is a minimum delay cap for all weapons, if you parse hasted your 1h weapons are likely to hit this cap and your 2h'ers are unlikely to hit the cap.   If you parse unbuffed, neither will hit the minumum delay cap.  The reality is that you are almost always hasted and thus will always be hitting the 1h minimum delay cap unless you are using very slow 1h'ers like SoPP or DBotW.<br />
<br />
I beleive the minimum delay cap is about 10.<br />
<br />
Of course the problem with this for my parses is that I only had 71% haste and not the normal 109% haste that I would have on raids.  I guess it does show some valid data for soloing though, but doesn't take into effect the damage lost by the NPC by stun procs.<br />
<br />
From these parses though it looks like I wasn't hitting this cap as 1h'ers performed even better when hasted then without.  It was worth testing though, I'll try another parse with Speed of Vallon sometime to see if that makes a difference.<br />
<br />
I'll also try to parse them over approx 30 minutes and see if that makes a difference, but I doubt it.  The 5 minute fights had a sample size of around 400-600 hits for 1h and 150-200 hits for 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhm, that cap was debunked a long time ago. There is no minimum delay cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The minimum delay cap is 10.<br />
<br />
From Trolkin:<br />
<br />
also i notice some one posted that the min delay dosnt exist on your post<br />
<br />
so i was runing more tests<br />
<br />
it def there<br />
<br />
2 20 delay weapons.. 10 minutes testing no haste.. 14-15 delay<br />
<br />
2 20 delay weapons.. 10 minutes testing self haste (30%).. 11 delay<br />
<br />
2 20 delay weapons.. 10 minutes testing WR(70% haste no stats).. 10 delay<br />
<br />
you dont gain 1 delay for 40% more haste<br />
<br />
so the caps def there at 10<br />
<br />
EQ Companion has a field on fight parses that lists your combat delay for all attacks, procs, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't EQ Companion have problems showing &gt;10 delays because the smallest unit of time displayed is the second?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  10 = 1 sec and the EQ log timestamps only show time in seconds.  There is no minimum delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolkin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i decided to do some testing on weapon delay's.. Cause im pretty sure my 2h always benefits alot more from high haste, then my 1handers ever did(being that the dps is close when im unbuffed, yet when im buffed my 2h blows the 1handers out of the water)<br />
<br />
     I ran 3 tests.. ranging from 5-10 minutes each all test's use 1393 attack, max all offensive aa's 18/20 1hs +15/20 1hs<br />
<br />
Test 1 NO haste<br />
<br />
test time:5.1 minutes<br />
Total dmg:25722<br />
DPS:84.06<br />
Attack delay:14<br />
<br />
Test 2 30% self haste(ornate gaunt's)<br />
<br />
test time:4.95 minutes<br />
Total dmg:31771<br />
DPS:106.97<br />
Attack delay:11<br />
<br />
Test 3 70% haste(Wonderous rapidity) no stat/attack boost<br />
<br />
test time:4.63 minutes<br />
Total dmg:32466<br />
DPS:116.78<br />
Attack delay:10<br />
<br />
<br />
Used yalp 2.3 to parse. Did the test cause i was wondering about min delay after the last post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok that is interested about the 10 delay = 1 second thing.<br />
<br />
I guess to test this you would need to parse once with some haste = X where it made your delay = 10.<br />
<br />
Then parse again with some haste = X + Y, where your delay was still = 10.<br />
<br />
With the same weapons and then compare the DPS.  Parses would need to be run at least twice each and for at least an hour+ or so each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolkin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya i think you are right, if you look at the DPS numbers.. it still gained a good 10dps with 40% more haste, altho the delay didn't seem to drop, but i would need to run a much longer test, to judge it that way :(<br />
<br />
Ya brutal you are right, i just wanted to run a quick test on it to see, and i agree;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been done.  Sorry I don't have links for you, but this is very old stuff.  There is no minimum delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't matter what parser you use, none of them accurately calculate the delay of weapons once you get &lt;10 because the smallest possible increment of time in a log file is 1 second, or 10 delay.<br />
<br />
There is a very simple way to test this however. All you need to do is get 100% haste and a 20 delay weapon and count the number of attacks with that weapon for 10 minutes. Then rinse and repeat with a &lt;20 delay weapon. Over a period of 10 minutes the number of double and triple attacks should normalize and you should see a significant difference in the number of attacks the lower the delay of the weapon. Equip a shield or held item in your offhand so you only count main hand attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point I really doubt there is a minimum dly.  With it, a weapon like the twig (3/10 I think) would have sucked bad compare to a jade mace (9/18) 9/10 if you accept the min dly thing with haste.  9/10 &gt; 3/10 by alot.  Since this was obviously not the case, the minimum dly of 10 doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
The end.<br />
<br />
Now, of course 1-hander and 2-handers will not react the same in regards to haste.  Since 99% of my eq time is personnaly spent fighting with at least 70% haste from shaman+, I don't see parse for dps with lower buffs to be really meaningfull.<br />
<br />
The reason of the difference is easy to explain.  2-handers generally have better total ratio then 1-handers.  They also rely less on their dmg bonus then 1-hander since you get less total attack (even thought bonus is higher on 2-handers in general).<br />
<br />
So : more haste = more dmg bonus, general advantage to 1-handers.<br />
<br />
More atk (with more buffs) = higher hit ratio, will generally advantage the 20handers.<br />
<br />
By removing haste and atk you are basically hindering both the 2-handers and the 1-hander setup, but not necessarily by the same ammount.  This is hard to prove and I would recommend you always do dps parse with at least max haste and some basic  atk buff like the ranger predator.  This would help reduce the amount of skewedness possible and would generally give a much more reliable result (I know it's harder to do then use self-buff).<br />
