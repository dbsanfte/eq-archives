<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive kinda been wondering, as we are hoping to enter qvic, is there any settled upgrade path? I have a magelo and dream magelo which is mainly items from potime. i know vladds seems to be faily easy to upgrade to, but are there straightforward choices for the non-vis slots in qvic and beyond? im dont rack up dkp as much as others so tend to have to wait a while for prices to drop.</div></div><hr />

I'd go after Vadd's Gauntlets since you don't have a Raex's Chestplate and Boots since yours are pretty bad.<br />
<br />
There's a Ceremonial Jade-Inlaid Cuirass that drops in Uqua and would upgrade your BP quite a bit and would work ok with the Gauntlets mentioned previously, but I'd try to skip it and build DKP for the Vadd's if I could.<br />
<br />
Either in PoTime or GoD try to get 45%+ Haste I'm think. I went with Weighty Spined Shoulderguard from Uqua, but I doubt it's the very best choice for a Warrior.<br />
<br />
You do seem to have an aggro weapon problem as well, but I don't see how you can best solve it outside of PoTime.<br />

<br />
mistiv  i used the JoS/DoD combo quite a lot till i upgraded to EoE. with symbol stun proc and anger on the jos, which i forgot to update, it held aggro fine in exp groups and was more dps than my 2 handers.<br />
<br />
for raids, as im low down the pecking order, im just dps warrior so again i used that combo most of the time.<br />
<br />
Even now when i use JoS/EoE for most tanking duties and exp grinds, when on raids when i need to be careful of aggro ill swop out EoE for the DoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Qvic armor is common as hell, espcially if your only guild that farms msha's, can get 12+ (Granted some come out as augs) a day if your guild really works at it<br />
<br />
Most suggestions on this thread are mark on though, focus on trying to get qvic armour, and do a few single group stuff for glyphed/augs if you can, then should be fine.<br />
<br />
mask is weak too dunno what there is out thier for masks in god tho, beside barxt mask, which is pretty solid, even tho it has QoM, which might make you shy away from it, take in consideration its melee only, but really beneficial spell haste is really only important for paladins melee wise so might not be that bad of an idea.<br />
<br />
grab a fleshbiter if one drops imo its pretty solid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or even just buy some 85 hp bazaar boots?</div></div><hr />
