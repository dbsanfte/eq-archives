<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Briq</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was thinking, I know the people who visit these boards are all in different ranges of levels/aas/tiers etc and I was thinking maybe that there would be different forums for say, the High end people, mid level, low level, etc.  Just some thoughts.  I'll post more if I think of any. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the new sig Briq :)<br />
<br />
But I don't like that idea... it seem kind of.. I dunno.. unwelcoming? Kind of like making a rift between the different kinda of people who play EQ that is kind of counterproductive to the friendly atmosphere I'm sure we want to maintain here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I like the simplicity of the 5 forums that all see about equal traffic, less clicking :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me too.. when I go msg boarding, I have like 1090138 windows up.. I right click each forum and hit &quot;n&quot; for Open Link in New Window, then I go through each forum, opening new windows for each interesting thread, then I start reading and replying and closing the windows when I'm done. Sometimes I have more than one message board up at a time, like my serverboard, here, necro board, and guild board are my main ones.. also is a raiding alliance, some uber guilds, other guilds, alla's, casters'realm, unsolved quests... I &lt;3 msg boards :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only problem with that is the newbies would post in 55+ part because they know if not they'd be ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if they even had access to that section, I'm sure us mods would make sure irrelevant threads were moved to their proper forums, not a hard thing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">would take alot of work and people could just make new accounts to ask the questions. it probably could be done but raaj and shorty deserve a break. i mean atleast for a couple days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yes it starts with a harmless 55+ forum, then you add a 60+ forum, then a 65+ forum, then a forum about teir 3+, then a forum about what to do on a Tuesday afternoon in California when Micky Mouse crosses the street and gives you a glass of tea and all of a suden everyone just ends up posting crap in &quot;general&quot; anyway because there are too many forums to read.<br />
<br />
Less forums = more good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, plus when I have a question about progressiong how do I ask that in a board of my peers?<br />
<br />
It just doesn't make much sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think seperating them like that is not that great an idea. I like to think that even though you have a few people that ask the wrong question in the wrong place this will not change just cause people to feel more removed from the community as a whole and besides I am only level 53 You can't be moving me from the forum where I get to drink beer and read Azlana's posts. *Stomps his foot* Hell no I won't go. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been brought up before, on the old boards, and the idea was similarly rejected due to the potential for angst and conflict. Personally, I think its far too close to discrimination for me. <br />
<br />
We have a level playing field, and this kind of decision has far too much potential to tip equillibrium one way or another.<br />
<br />
Basically, it turns into a status collecting popularity contest at that base of a level, but that's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />
