The single most important thing you are missing is haste.  You must, must, must get yourself a haste item.  If you only have 10K to spend, silver chitin hand wraps are probably your best bet.  Instead of a frosty, I'd get a stonebladed axe of dismay (2HS, 44 44).  The ancient seahorse hide cloak and the barbed ringmail for the empty slots, and you're good to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stone bladed axe of dismay is a decent and not bank breaking DPS weapon too, so for a DPS toy when not tanking this is nice.  Frosty is the way to go for a cheap agro proc, but might not fit into your budget.<br />
<br />
I'd go for either Cloak of the Maestrom or Direwolf fur cloak over ancient Seahorse tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would pick cloak of the Maelstorm over Ancient too, it has more HP.<br />
<br />
a Barbed Ringmail for chest, or maybe an Engraved Royal Velium Field Plate, just to throw another option (maybe you have a friend smith).</div></div><hr />
