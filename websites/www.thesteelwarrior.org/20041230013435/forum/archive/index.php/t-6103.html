<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting level one of this skill has made a huge impact in my day to day endurance management.<br />
<br />
This is very similar to hybrids that got their first point of flowing thought... it doubled their standing regen for mana. In the same fashion, I'm willing to bet good money that even one point of endurance regen doubles our standing regen -- and this makes a huge impact.<br />
<br />
Given our newly expanded endurance pools with the new itemization out, this AA becomes especially sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzme</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're not kidding.  Until today (Melee Enhancement part II), I could use incite and fellstrike in a battle.  My END would regen enough for me to use Spirit of Rage the next battle.<br />
<br />
Here's the interesting part, I've got +END on some of my items now.  Giving me more END, errr suposedly.  I've never been out of endurance and it always regened enough for me to use a disc when timer came back.  Not anymore!!  WTF?  What I haven't tested is did they fix the Invigor line to affect END now?  I had to log so I'll take a look at it tonight.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I'm wondering how I can't use my discs now (as I did before).  I was finding myself not even being able to use Incite for the next 2 mobs after I used a fellstrike.  Are there END regenning items out there, other than AA's (i.e. Flowing though for casters..)?  <br />
<br />
I'll have to get this AA next.  Untill then, I guess I'll have to not use any discs but Incite, or /assist for the next few mobs after using anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimwit</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My standing regen is about 180ish per minute with attack on and 300ish per minute with attack off. There is no difference between standing and sitting as far as endurance regen is concerned, its based on attack being on or off. <br />
<br />
1 extra point of endurance per tick = 10 extra endurance per minute. That isn't anywhere close to 'doubling' our endurance regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to rezme, it sounds like they just made whatever raw endurance is on the items IS the endurance pool, and they got rid of the other melee stats increasing base endurance.  This boggles me, and I am definitly going to bug and feedback this if it is the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzme</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To add to my post above, is anyone else seeing the issue of running out of END faster than normal or not regenning as fast?<br />
<br />
 Perhaps I was just bugged.  Yes, we were chain pulling and I was inciting every mob on incomming, but this is nothing out of the norm that I always did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">once i get home from work, ill check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up 725 End from items, and Incite still seems to lower me by the same % as it did previously... Maybe 1% difference at most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzme</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up 725 End from items, and Incite still seems to lower me by the same % as it did previously... Maybe 1% difference at most. <br />
<br />
I didn't pick up quite as much, actually, nowhere near as much END.  I'm using the stardard EQ UI and never saw the exact percentage that incite was using before as some UI's may show.  Hoping to see that I was bugged.  <br />
<br />
In any case, I think END regen is the way that SOE is going and I'll spend my AA's on it.  I just hope I'm not spending AA's on something to make me the same tank I was yesterday.  If that be the case, I guess that's why they called it Melee Changes not Enhancements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnimwit, I don't think it adds 1 point of endurance per tick... I don't know the exact number because I haven't analyzed it before and after AA.<br />
<br />
All I know is my END regen has gotten noticably faster.<br />
<br />
As for these post-patch issues with endurance, I haven't played yet today so I can't comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got end regen AA the day GoD opened because I always had problems with keeping endurance, didnt seem to help at all imo. I havent checked regen since todays patch but it was 1% regen per tic before AA and after, no idea what it is now with larger pool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not correct, I summed up and have 480 END on items, that is by no means my END pool, if it would be so, I could use Incite 2 times and run out of END.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mczern</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite took me down to 92% before patch, 95% after.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: after playing around in teir1-3 I noticed I was always pretty low on endurance... seems they might have toned it down and the AA's bring you up to where we were before. No testing just guessimating now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">however they tweaked the system, I chrewed through my endurance on chain pulls in Sol Ro towers.  I got MUCH lower than I ever normally did.  Would be nice if some of my PoP loot items would have +end on them like the rest of it.<br />
<br />
Though I imagine that the system will be adjusted in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same... i seem to have less endurance than befor the patch and now i have more endurance from items...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good to hear this may actually make a difference.  Going into Xegony the other night I was worried about endurance being a factor in tanking this fight, turns out it I was right.  I might have to invest in this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i didnt see a problem with it. of course my gear is EP and time gear but from what i saw my End is about doubled what it was pre patch.  1 incite cost me 4% end which would put my end pool at 6250.<br />
<br />
here is the formula i used, its basic algebra.<br />
<br />
A=(250x100)/B<br />
<br />
A=total endurance pool<br />
250=endurance cost of incite<br />
100=100%<br />
B=cost of incite in %<br />
<br />
<br />
so for me, my formula was A=(250x100)/4...A=6250</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before patch I was using the same amount, 4% per Berate ( yeah I know but I am only 62) checked this morning and now is 7% per Berate, I have a huge jump on END in gear and was buffed exactly the same (had written down stats and buffs up last time I checked this) before was showing a pool of around 5000 now seems to be 2857... anyone have any idea why this would be?<br />
<br />
**edit - damn spelling errors**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cause before you didnt have 5000 Endurance.  before the patch i had 3100ish using the same formula i posted above, so your calculations were way off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan on doing this after I finish Sturdiness....bleh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gained 1300ish Endurance from items and my pool goes a lot further now. Never been OOE since the items were updated. Can chain furious, stonewall, mighty strike and incite a few times. Healing Will only takes 30-something% as opposed to 50% before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edone</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">endurence ticks every 3sec like brd songs for upkeep when using disc's, it might regen every 3sec in same way<br />
<br />
so 1pt would add 20 x whatever regen the aa gave per minute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belwolf</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have done a couple runs though LDoN and a couple raids without that problem. i use incite on every pull and don't run low on END. i even now can use mighty strike then healing will after fights when farming and still have END left. i may get it in a couple weeks but atm need sta for hp and pb3 since i am not MT on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Thunndarr using your formula<br />
<br />
A=(200x100)/B<br />
<br />
A=total endurance pool<br />
200=endurance cost of Berate<br />
100=100%<br />
B=cost of incite in %<br />
<br />
<br />
so for me, my formula was A=(200x100)/4...A=5000<br />
<br />
<br />
so according to your formula before the patch my Endurance Pool was 5000, I posted about that in another thread asking why mine was so way out of line, and got no responses, so yeah before patch mine was at 5k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">something is wrong, cause there is no way that a level 62 and not all melee stat meaxed is gonna have more END that a level 65.  obviously it cost you more than 4% prolly like 8% but there is no way to prove or disprove that now.  If you believe that then you are seriously screwed in the head man.  <br />
<br />
test it now, then come back and let us know.  also just by looking at your magelo, you did not get a &quot;huge&quot; jump in END, you gained at most a few hundred points of END.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe at lower levels of endurance this aa is worthwhile. I bought it before the patch, It sucked.  After the patch it still sucked. Takes a year and a day to regen endurance for me.  Can't really justify 15 more aa to complete for something i'll never see work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought lvl 1 of this AA over the weekend.  It made quite a difference is AA regen, basically I could chain incite and disc and not run low in END.  Also in non combat the recovery is really noticable.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest for 3pts lvl 1 is a nice thing if you use incite and your discs frequently; regardless if you are &quot;high end&quot; or not.  Its more a question of how active you are in END usage not how big your pool is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">branaelan</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up buying HE1 last night, mainly because I was having serious endurance issues at the time and was curious if it would help at all.<br />
<br />
Normally on raid bosses or experience groups (including LDoN) I do fine with endurance...I have to manage it mind you but it always works out.  When I run dry though is when tanking for a raid clearing trash.  Due to the constant pulls and fast killing with no pause between mobs incite (or bellow of mastrauq) drains all my endurance quickly.)  <br />
<br />
First I checked my endurance regen standing not in combat by waiting for the % to move then timing 2 minutes.  It was 6% gain per minute.  I then bought HE1, camped, and tested again.  Hmmm still 6% per minute.  I then scratched my head and zoned and tested again, still 6%.<br />
<br />
Either this makes so little difference it can't be measured by my crack test or the AA is broken.  One other possibility is that it only improves endurance regen while in combat?  I didn't check the regen rate in combat before buying the AA but it appears it is now 6% a minute as well?<br />
<br />
Oh 65 warrior btw, same buffs on during the course of the testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assumed it did exactly what it says it does. Adds 1 point of END regen.<br />
<br />
And from casual observation.. it seems accurate enough.<br />
<br />
Guessing its about a 3-4% gain in END regen off the top of my head. /shrug<br />
<br />
kinda pointless really, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />

<br />
HE 1 was not noticable at all. HE2 was noticible, but trivial.<br />
Hopefully HE 3 will prove a bit better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guessing its about a 3-4% gain in END regen off the top of my head<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that endurance regen with maxxed stats at 65 was 30 points per tick, so a 1 point gain would be 3.3, 6.6 and 10% increase for the 3 levels.<br />
<br />
On in other words, 1 extra point of endurance regnen would allow you to use incite one extra time every 250 ticks ( 25 minutes )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at it the same way you look at all the other multi stage AAs: small, incremental changes that added up can make a noticable (not massive, noticable) difference.<br />
<br />
CA1 isn't even noticable. You probably would be hard pressed to find a difference with a large parse. Getting CA3 and then going on to LR5 is a noticable difference though. Just think of the End Regen AA the same way.</div></div><hr />
