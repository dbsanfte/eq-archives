<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I'm sure this has been mentioned before, but I didn't see it.  My apologies in advance.<br />
<br />
But wtf is up with LDoN augments ??  I just spent some time going through the available list of gear and augments at http://67.113.229.226:8080/skp/eq/ldon/list.cgi  *a very handy list btw, if anyone doesn't have it yet*, and sort of made up my list of stuff to /drool over as I possibly spend the next 6 mos grinding away in LDoN for enough damn points.  There is some awfully sweet gear in there, sure enough.  <br />
<br />
While it's bad enough that the basic gear is all/all with HP/Mana on it, I just realized that a lot of it carries over to augments too !!  I mean, wtf, it's bad enough that all the armour is that way, but at least I could see Sony saying &quot;sure, it may be all/all and with HP/mana, but at least you can customize it !!!&quot;... Sure, I can, with fookin' HP/Mana augments !   Dammit, on an awful lot of slots, the highest available HP augment was a HP/Mana augment !   While there are indeed HP only augments, they are only useable on about 5-6 slots or so.  Now, not only do all other plate classes get our same gear *sure absor, we use it better, ya silly fuck, I know, sorry..*, but now they also get the same augments, which I have to overspend my damn points on, and buy THEIR fuckin' mana augment !  <br />
<br />
For whatever good it's going to do, I'm going to continuously /feedback on this.  While a somewhat trivial/petty issue, this on top of everything else is enough to really discourage me from continuing to play EQ.  Sadly, I think the only other game that can capture my imagination anywhere near as close will most likely be EQ2..<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, this is just really pissing me off.  And yeah, I realize I'm slow, but oh well.  I just had to vent.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
