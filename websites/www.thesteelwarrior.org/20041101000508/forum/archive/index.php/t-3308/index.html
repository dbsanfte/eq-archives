<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a decent 2hander and hope to spend my very hard earnt DKP wisely.<br />
<br />
Some background of where my guild is at, my guild just started doing VT. If VT is cleared, the usual targets we will be looking for are Ssra, PoP contents: BoT Towers, T1 to T3 flag mobs except RZTWL. (NO S Ro Tower flag)<br />
<br />
Several 2handers I have in my mind are:<br />
<br />
The Sword of Ssraeshza  Dmg 52, Dly 42. +50 AC +20 Str +20 Sta +20 Dex +18 Wis +18 Int +10 vsMg +10 vsFire +10 vsCold +10 vsPos +10 vsDis +125 HP +125 Mana +2.00 Wt <br />
Slot types: 4  <br />
<br />
Greatstaff of the Four Winds  Dmg 41, Dly 31. +15 Dex +10 Wis +10 Int +7 vsMg +7 vsFire +7 vsCold +7 vsPos +7 vsDis +125 HP +125 Mana +2.50 Wt <br />
Slot types: 4  <br />
<br />
Which one would you take if the dkp points are the same? I lean towards Emp 2hs<br />
<br />
How about the cost for the Emp 2hs is 3 times higher than GSo4W? (This is the most realistic base. GSo4W has a real low dkp coz of the rarity) I still lean towards Emp 2hs coz it is more rare!<br />
<br />
Any other good 2handers I am missing and should consider given where my guild is at?<br />
<br />
Many thanks!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Imo this is better than all of those.  And the key isn't too hard can be done in 1 night if all of the mobs are up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh yeah that is nice!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your respond Cipps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go Great Staff. Fairly sure it will out-DPS the Luclin 2H options. And it's very cheap obviously. It's ugly as sin and the proc is lame, but you didn't say anything about looks. Also has no AC, but I really only use mine for DPS.<br />
<br />
 You didn't link your Magelo but you say your just getting into VT. I'd want to save points for some of the nicer VT stuff. Fiery Might pants, BP of Speed or AHR BP. AHR neck/Gloves. That type of stuff.<br />
<br />
 Only other similar 2H that comes to mind is Basalt Greatsword of the Protector (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17780) from Protector of Dresolik in Sol Ro. Sounds like you're not too far off from there so maybe a good option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GSo4W will out dps emp and seru sword. The seru sword is closest ratio and has a nice proc for tanking or ae mobs.  If you are looking for just pure dps,. GSo4W is easy to get and is one of the better dps weaps you'll see until Elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I picked up a Basalt Greatsword of the Protector several days ago.  So far tanking in both raid and xp situations has been far smoother than scraping aggro with my DW setup.  It's only taunting blow but I've never had a weapon that procs +hate and at the moment I'm in heaven.  It procs quite a bit too although fairly streakily.  <br />
<br />
I picked up a Darwol's Cleaver (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18969) about a week before I got the Basalt Greatsword.  It isn't much for aggro, but the ratio and the 125 unresistable dd is nice.  I might stick a lifetap proc on it at some point.<br />
<br />
If your guild does SSRA, then look into Norge'tal (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11739) from HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SamirDaStinky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have sword of ssraeshza and i like it alot :) it's very nice to use on fights when you dont have to tank but you still need to keep your hp up (cuz of ae's and dot's and stuff like that). plus with ingenuity 3, it'll crit for double often and heal you twice as much.</div></div><hr />
