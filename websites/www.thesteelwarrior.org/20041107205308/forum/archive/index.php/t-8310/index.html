<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NAVCOK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok my main is a 65 druid on e-marr.   I  just started a Ogre war and wanted to know if you all could please clarify the diffrent types of tanks.  What I mean is, what is the roll of the MA, SA, and Rampage tank.  I have a good idea, but to tell ya the truth if I am not in the cheal cycle, I normaly am assigned a tank and heal them.  I would rather have some clarifcation now instead of in 20 levels when I am told 'NAVCOK is the Ramp Tank'.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, the Main Assist is the person everyone assists for a target.  They are often the Main Tank, the person who actually tanks said target.  the SA is the second assist (or tank for ST).  They back up the MA/MTs incase they eat it.<br />
<br />
Rampage tanks are the folks who get on the agrolist right after the MT and take the rampage damage.  This is usually done by plucking an arrow into the rampaging NPC before they get to the raid to be engaged.  The rampage list is a nasty confusing list, and if you're unfamilar with it, you will kill all your clerics.  Best bet is to have a number of tanks try to get on rampage along with the RT to keep those clerics a live.  AE rampage is rampage that happens over an area.  IE, when fighting RZtW and he does his AE rampage, everyone in melee range will get hit.  There for, when fighting mobs with AE rampage, laugh at people who say they are rampage tanking.  Then after they die, tell them to back up and get out of melee range =)</div></div><hr />
