I also suggested (along with others) that they go buy some strats.<br />
<br />
The Arch fight is really a lot of fun, but what a handful of things you have to juggle at once in order to win it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my favorite fight was actually the indiana-jones-chick.  not only is the door opening bit pretty sweet but we had never seen a 500+ elite and didn't know what it meant.  figured it meant we weren't supposed to fight her so everyone was running around freaking out while our hunter sat from afar plucking arrows until finally he told us to get our shit together as she could actually be killed.  :p</div></div><hr />

So did you guys actually kill her??</div></div><hr />

Of course we did.</div></div><hr />

Having a difficult zone is fun if I am given enough reason to want to do it.  Desperately needs some new loots or quests in there.<br />
<br />
I beat arch once, lost roll on armor ring to a hunter, and said F' this, never doing that again.<br />
<br />
Now, any guildies who get into their 40's and want help in there, I just tell them to get a few more levels and I will take them to Mauradon.   :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed entirely.  When I farmed it, we just farmed it up until Grimlok, the rest can kiss my ass.  <br />
<br />
50ac upgrade to the Seal of Sylvanas isn't worth plowing thru all those fucking dwarves.</div></div><hr />
