<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssuruss</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, the logic for the BoC being in offhand is BS. Everytime it procs it gives more agor, otherwise it would be a worthless piece of junk as would a BoW, Bloodfrenzy, Hategiver, and everything else that procs EB if only one proc counted on the mob.<br />
<br />
As for which one in primary and which in secondary, I prefer the BoC in primary as EB is unresistable hate, the SoD proc however is similar in agro and does give a slight DPS boost if the proc is not resisted. Basically it doesn't matter which is in primary/secondary although I'd slap the gimp warrior that said the BoC proc only counts once per mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will get considerably more aggro with the BoC mainhand...and your boy doesn't know what he's talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wield both as my main agro weapons.  And while I think the slight margin of agro loss from the stunn/dd from SoD is there, I don't find it an issue of contention.  I like the SoD mainhand because I like the DD boost in DPS more than the small ammount of agro loss.  With WA aa and an ang III aug slapped on it, that dps just increases and agro is a total non issue for me, even on raids.  BUT that is the ONLY reason I choose to mainhand it.  The spew that's coming out of your boy's mouth is total supposition and completely innacurate.  As the others have said, each proc adds X amount of agro with each proc.  It's not some fruity debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, think I'd mainhand the BoC, aggro is key and the DPS from the proc from the SoD is probably nearly nullified by the lesser ratio I would think.<br />
<br />
Either way, ya the warrior you were talkin with is a boob .... hmmmm, boobs<br />

/em wanders off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck, even debuffs stack in aggro. A slow proc that doesn't land due to the mob already being slowed still generates aggro. The only aggro that DOESN'T stack is when your incite is overwritten by another warrior's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Simple question, was this true or not? It isn't true. It was answered. The background information is completely irrelevent to this discussion. We're not harrassing you, he's not posting shit about you on this board. You did. We don't care. If you want to post on YOUR server board about this, go ahead. Don't waste our space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's not a simple question, he's using this board as a link whore for a quote that I made on a private forum about a person, which I misquoted in the first place.<br />
<br />
Get over it man, stop harrassing me. I don't like you. To be quite honest if you were to annoy me like this off of the computer, face to face I would hurt you. Don't even reply back with some snobby answer. You got nothing for me. I'm sick of the bullshit. it stops now.<br />
<br />
my suggestion go back to class, study do something but leave me the fuck alone.<br />
<br />
This board should remove this whole post due to the fact that this guy copied my quote from a private forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Get over it man, stop harrassing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Please, do so. None of us had any clue about any drama before YOU posted. That's why Raaj removed your stuff and not the main post. The first was a legitimate question, your stuff doesn't contribute in any way to warriors. That's all. If he posted drama, I would have given him the same response.</div></div><hr />

keep server drama off the boards.<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />

Im going to hope that post wasn't directed at me. <br />
<br />
This is not your guild forum and I don't care what drama your guild is going through. I don't see a link in his post, nor did he say who he quoted that from. You're the one who brought your guilds personal issues here and put them on display.<br />
<br />
I'll say it once more: Play nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if it were a simple question he could have simply asked<br />
<br />
&quot;What is better BoC in mainhand or SoD?&quot;<br />
<br />
But no he takes a quote from me, calls me full of shit, post it on this forum and on then post it on my forum board because he wants to harrass me.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that's not drama?<br />
<br />
I would appeciate it if my quote that he cut and paste which was used in a private forum was remove from this board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for you guys not knowing you were never supposed to. His idea was to link this post on other forums to harrass me. Which he has done. I'm asking you to remove the quote, it's not needed. <br />
<br />
the questions is which is better sod or boc for mainhand.. there's no reason why you should let this guy use this post to link to other forums to try to discredit me.</div></div><hr />

If you never came here and posted, we'd never know or care, in fact I'd never thought twice about any underlying ideas in the original post. The only one discrediting you on THIS board is you. I don't know you, I'm not on your server, and in fact the only reason why I now think very little of you is that you're not realizing the the only drama this post is causing on this board is YOU. Again, we (the warrior community in general) DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR GUILD/SERVER DRAMA. There'd be no reason to remove the quote if you hadn't come here and owned up to it, and I seriously doubt any of our mods will remove it for you.</div></div><hr />

it's ok I don't care anymore. have fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apostello</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's ok I don't care anymore. have fun =)<br />
<br />
<br />
just one more thing. it was never about you guys caring or knowing.. It was when he used this post as a link to post on guild boards stating here's a little something about your comment..<br />
<br />
<br />
You see where I am coming from? it doesn't matter if you guys know. What matters is that he used this post as a tool to link on other forums saying this is what apostel said.<br />
<br />
Do you understand why it pissed me off? It is also why I felt I needed to respond. If he's going to give this link to people of my circle and of my server letting them know it's me then I need to say my piece.<br />
<br />
It was a shady move on his part to discredit me.<br />
<br />
<br />
So even if the few of you would never have known, he has made attempts to make sure that people that I know and play the game with knows who the quote came from.<br />
<br />
<br />
So as I stated before it was never a simple question asked it was an attempt to lash out at me. That is why I think his post to this should be edited.<br />
<br />
After all you guys said it yourself that this board is not for drama.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so rather than just look like an asstard to the folks who read your private board you chose to look like an asstard to the entire warrior community in general? bravo sir<br />
<br />
/golf clap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steelcoin</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the drama guys.  I will no longer try to help people out by informing them of wrong assumptions.  All in all though, I appreciate your responses so that maybe someone that wanted to be imformed could know.  <br />
Hell, I could have been wrong, wonder how that would have gone...</div></div><hr />
