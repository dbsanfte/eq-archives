<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimpond</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New Thread on this subject because the origional thread turned into a mini-flame party.<br />
<br />
Last patch said that Verrell Cogswin can help convert Red Dragon Scales into Green Dragon Scales.  I started my epic back when it was semi-useful.  I'd like to finish it, just to say I did it, and to see myself with light-sabers.<br />
<br />
I think we can rule out Plane of Knowledge, I've had several trackers assist me in looking there at different times since the patch, with no luck.<br />
<br />
If anyone else out there is actually interested in completing their epics, please let's get some informative posts on this long-awaited change to our epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DragonHerald</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've checked all Kunark zones except Cabilis, ChardokB and Veeshan's Peak (will check them all later as they require a bit more involvement). Starting on old world zones now (using rogue with SoS/druid track). I'm assuming he's either in original Norrath or Kunark since that's where the warrior epic is contained (Beastlord being the only one that involves mobs post-Kunark).<br />
<br />
The &quot;Cogswins&quot; besides Nayr in PoK, have been a recent new quest implementation beginning in the revamped Hole where Pellillo Cogswin talks of his &quot;lost brothers&quot;. One ending up in Chardok (Tani), the other in Dragon Necropolis (Stiggle).<br />
<br />
Verrell might be in another mid-level dungeon, perhaps SolC or ChardokB as well. Someone in this thread http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=4087 stated he's in The Hole, but I'm pretty sure they're just confused about Pellillo.</div></div><hr />

I have also been to PoK and PoT.  I would very much like to find this guy too, do not forget there is supposed to be a way to improve the war epic in PoP somewhere.  Hopefully it will make it worth having again :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A ranger named Tunzee posted in response to a request for help I made with my ranger Feetolas on the Ranger's Glade that he had seen Verrell tonight in n.ro near the docks <br />
<br />
Thanks Tunzee, lets see if we can get this working now.</div></div><hr />

Verrell Cogswin says 'Leave me be, I have a very important meeting to get to and I must conserve what energy I have to finish the trip.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Have tried a variety of phrases asking if I can help, what meeting he's going to, if I could finish the trip, etc.. no go.<br />
<br />
Gave him a red scale, heard the experience chime, but no experience message, and he hands the red scale back. Might have to do some mini-quest to do the conversion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:47:49 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Sorry Barbarian but I am a very tired gnome. I am returning from a trip to Halas but this desert heat has worn me out and for some reason my gate spell keep failing. If only I had some water then I could make it to the wizard portal and wait for my brother Pellillo to pick me up.'<br />
<br />
- Hand Verrell Cogswin a Vial of Water-<br />
<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:48:06 2003] Verrell throws back his head and empties the flask of water in one gulp. . . 'Thank Brell your kindness will not go unnoticed. I am eager to get back home I have been in the cold environment of Halas for so long I thought I was going to turn into a snowgnome. I am just glad we finally figured out the [recipe] for that concoction.'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:48:21 2003] You say, 'What recipe?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:48:21 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'My old shaman friend Shamus Felligan has been working on some way to change the color of items. He was very close to completing it but for some reason everytime he applied the mixture to something it would change the color temporarily. So he asked me to come down and help him. After a few months we realized what the problem was and we are now capable of changing things from red to green and from green to gray. I kept a sample for myself so I could turn my friend's red drake green as a surprise, but I would like to test it on a [red scale] first.'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:48:58 2003] You say, 'I have a red scale.'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:48:59 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Yes the red scales of a dragon would be perfect for a test now that I think about it. Do you know anyone with a red scale that would be willing to let me use it in the pursuit of magical studies?'<br />
<br />
- Hand Verrell Cogswin a Red Dragon Scale -<br />
<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:10 2003] Verrell pulls a vial out of his pocket and places the red scale on the ground before pouring some of the vials contents on the scale. The scale begins to bubble and fizz as the liquid covers it entirely. Verrell looks at you and smiles <br />
before looking back at the scale, gasping and snatching the scale up from the floor. Verrell says, 'Hmmm. . . well I have some [good <br />
news] and a lot of [bad news] which do you want to hear first?<br />
<br />
- Receive two items: Verrell's Box of Potions, Potion Vial -<br />

<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:18 2003] You say, 'What is the good news?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:19 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Well the good news is the scale changed color but. . .'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:23 2003] You say, 'What is the bad news?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:24 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'The scale is no longer red it is gray. I confused the color change it is red to <br />
gray and gray to green, no need to fret tough I can just apply more and change it to green but there is a [catch].'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:32 2003] You say, 'What is the catch?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:33 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'The scale split into 4 pieces and the only way I can fix it is by applying a <br />
special [adhesive].'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:38 2003] You say, 'What adhesive?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:38 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'In order to make this special adhesive you will need to combine some [glue powder] and some [Deep Barley Brew] in this container with this special vial. Return the result to me and I should be able to fix the scale, but please try to hurry I have to meet my brother Pellillo Cogswin at the wizard platform so he can take me home.'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:57 2003] You say, 'What glue powder?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:49:57 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Glue powder can be made from a fractured centaur hoof, some fire giant embers, and some jagged permafrost shards. The hoof can be found on centaurs in the Karanas, the fire giant embers you will have to retrieve from the fire giants in the caverns of exile and the shard can be found in the keep of Permafrost on a chilling terror. When you have collected these three things use a mortar and pestle to grind them together and make glue powder.'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:50:27 2003] You say, 'what deep barley brew?'<br />
[Sat Nov 08 03:50:28 2003] Verrell Cogswin says 'Deep Barley Brew is easy for someone with a bit of brewing skill. Just buy some deep fungus mold, some barley, and a bottle of distilled spirits, combine them in a brew barrel and viola.'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to work up brewing, the glue powder is probably NO DROP. Assuming the mortar and pestle isn't a poison / alchemy check.</div></div><hr />

Lava giants in Sol C are past the goblins, they use the solro tower giant model, and like the giants in sol B, are immune to spells outside of melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed the Chilling Terror last night with a group of Cleric 58, chanter 65, wiz 65, rouge 65, and shm 65. I think the place holder is a spider in a room by itself on the way towards the ladders on the bottom floor but not certain as we just cleared everything but it was an out of place mob. There are two terrors at the top of the 3 ladders also that you might have to kill. Mob spawns at the bottom of the 3 ladders just back where you can barely see the ladders. Was a tough fight really, two healers helps. Mob will summons, we lost our Wiz at about 20% due to over nukes. Hope it helps. <br />
<br />
Edit- Spent the day combining Fishing Grubs and Water Flask yesterday to bring up brewing. At skill 82 decided to see if by chance I could get lucky and viola, 1 Deep Barley Brew=) Now to get the Sol C Fire Giant Ember. Still trying to verify if the combine on the other ingedients are a no fail or not. <br />
<br />
Question- When it says to use a mortar and pestle to grind these part, is that a skill and can it be failed? I could only find it on one site and it said unfailable but i don't trust it because I could only find that on the Allahkazam site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mortar and Pestle are mainly used in the rogue poison skill...or even the shaman alchemy.  Since warriors don't have Make Poison skill, it should be no-fail.<br />

What does the Terror hit for?</div></div><hr />

Not sure if you found the Chilling Terror yet, but if you go the Ice giant area leading to Vox, at the main gate, turn right and go down the hall.  At the &quot;T&quot; turn right, kill the giant (usually magus there)  then take the first ramp and drop down to the pit.  Terror spawns in that room.  Hope that helps you find him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kaesorn,<br />
<br />
Terror hit me for between 150 and 350 with defensive up.  Took 65 shaman, 65 mage, 62 wiz, 61 cleric, 65 druid, and myself to drop him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hit me for about the same as Griglon. In the 150-350 range with an AE that I think was 650. Thanks for the info. Hope to get the Sol C piece tonight will let ya's know on the combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goarbash</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is there any catch phrase that will get him to give u the box so u can just put the glue and brew in the box and turn in? or do i actualy have to get a RDS? and if by some miracle do u also get a red scale back on return? (im poor.. hard for me to gain enuff money to buy one RDS let alone 2...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was one of the early ones to attempt it Goar so I am not sure if you can or not without turning the scale in.  I figure eventually you will have to turn the RDS over to finish the quest and no, I don't think you get a RDS back because it shatters into pieces and turns grey in color.  All you get back is the box and the vial when you follow the quest brackets information until the quest is completed.<br />
<br />
Depending on your level and amount of people who perma camp Talendor in Skyfire, he is single groupable and drops the scale if you need to get one again.  A well balanced group of mid 60's to 65's can drop him easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished this yesterday. Here is some info<br />
Water Vial= Water Flask standard drop off the mad men or   bought<br />
<br />
When you turn in the scale you have to follow the lines. Ask about good news, then bad news and after that he will give you the box and liquid. Do the combne and hand that in and he will give you the fractured scale. Hand that in and he will give you a grey scale. Hand that in and he will change it to green. It was a bit scarey. I thought I had lost the red scale at first but once you follow the lines he will give you the product. Hope it helps. If not post up and I will try to answer. <br />
<br />
Off to POA for my last piece=)<br />
<br />
He will not give you the box and vial unless you give him the scale. He will not return your scale so i would get all of the parts first before turning it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info Wraq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tumili</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just posting to say that I got the box/vial without turning in a red scale by saying &quot;what chance&quot;. I&quot;m not sure if i'll be able to complete it all the way, as i have not yet finished, perhaps turning in the red scale gives you the faction you need to finish the quest with the guy, as someone mentioned hearing the quest sound file after turning in the scale.<br />
<br />
In either case, i'm sure they will fix it in the next patch if it allows you to do the quest now w/o the scale.<br />
