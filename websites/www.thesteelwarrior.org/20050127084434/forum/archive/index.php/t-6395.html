<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">genesislogic</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question for all: <br />
<br />
My magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=785075)  will give the details of my gear. I am about to hit 65, and am in a guild that is now doing Emperor Ssraeshza (took him 2x), XTC, Creator, Vindi, AoW, Xanamech (PoI dragon), and BoT mini's. I am not the guild MT, although i have MT'd on several smaller raids (Kael Drakkal, Veksar, etc.)<br />
<br />
How do I get up my HP (first goal) and then my AC (not including AAs i have to go after; only have 5 now). I only have about 4k in the bank.<br />
<br />
Anything obvious?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

That will give you 6hp per stamina up to 255 stamina and in your case thats a lot of hit points.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you focus on gear with just the most hit points you can get until you get over 6k unbuffed.  By then you will probably have some SSRA loot and (possibly VT stuff since your guild is killing the emperor).  At that point your AC should be close to 1400 somewhere.  When you are in elementals focus on getting AC up as well but for now just work on hp primarily because that will help the most.<br />
<br />
You also should work on some of the defensive AA like ND1, 2, and 3 and PE etc. since they will increase your hp and help you tank a lot better.</div></div><hr />

Try to pick up a GBoS and BoC/CHSD to improve your weapons. Once you get into VT upgrades will come along nicely and there are a few good pieces from SSRA.</div></div><hr />

Much better weapon and  you will then have a hefty amount of plat to upgrade with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravik</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">get rid of that champions armor asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sell sbod and use the leftover cash, after buying bloodsworn ... to upgrade your gear.  a few relatively cheap upgrades are:<br />
<br />
valorium rings<br />
solstice kit<br />
putrid belt<br />
kingly boots (see my magelo)<br />
amulet of mummy wrappings (see my magelo)<br />
<br />
just noticed you have no haste .... sell the sbod and get a cloak of flames.  then spend whatever cash you have leftover for a sword of the bloodsworn and any of the 3 above.  orcish greaves are nice.  bracers are hard to buy unless you can wear cultural.  if you really wanted to makes some cash .. ditch both your 1handers and buy a greatstaff of thunder.  it will give you much more aggro than you have right now.  period.<br />
<br />
get haste!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine Heraldic to replace champions legs and bracer, maybe boots and arms aswell.  (get ornate if you can, but Fine Heraldic alot cheaper)<br />
<br />
You dont have haste so I would look to replace your belt with either a soulscream belt or RBG.<br />
<br />
I recommend selling the split blade and buying a sword of the bloodsworn as mentioned above and using the large wad of extra plat you have left over to finance the haste belt / armour upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some free upgrades to hold you over would be:<br />
<br />
1. Greaves of the Orcish Master from EC LDoN (normal setting)<br />
2. Steelslave Bladed Boots from EC LDoN (normal setting)<br />
3. Face Mask of Frozen Mana EF LDoN (normal setting)<br />
4. Soulscream Belt from Vexsar<br />
5. If you're in to questing check out Loyalist Shield of Honor (dont have it myself, but its nice)<br />
<br />
Also, agree with sellin the splitblade and gettin some valorium rings, etc. With the stuff you guys are raiding you will loot better weaps very soon. Sell now and put that cash to work for ya :)</div></div><hr />

I am planning on starting working on Everfrost camp.  They have 760 point armor that is nice ac and HP on them.  I was thinking about doing NRO all the time but The Everfrost is good enough for me.  Also you can aug them nicely with an 1150 point no lore hp+20 sta +7 aug from guk.  Look at my magelo and look under my alternative profile called LDON you can see what I am talking about.</div></div><hr />
