/bow<br />
I am new to the board and just returning to the EQ community after taking an extended hiatus due to RL.  I dinged 60 back in Jan and had grand aspiratins of completing my epic etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Well, alot has changed since then as I can see from reading the boards. Seems I missed alot of the being broken part and I'm getting back just in time to be fixed.  :)<br />
<br />
As to my request, I would be tremendously grateful if some of you would look at my magelo profile and give me some advice on what equipment  I need to upgrade and were to go to get it. (please limit responses to things doable by one group)<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=366436 (magelo profile here) <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, my guild fell apart while i was gone, hence my resources are somewhat limited.  I can get 5-10k in plat immediately (more will take time) and I have one decent well-balanced group of old friends who don't mind helping out in fixing an old broken warrior.  You can assume I will have LDoN (did I miss any other expansions that i need?).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear is actually fairly ok, but let's see what we can do...<br />
<br />
First of course, let's talk weapons.<br />
<br />
Most efficient to get in terms of price, availibility, and effectiveness would probably be a Greatstaff of Thunder.  Check your local Bazaar, laugh at the price, then pick one up.  <br />
<br />
For dual wield, grab your friends and head down to Droga.  You'll be able to one group the camps for the Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn.  Or you can usually buy them at a reasonable price in the bazaar (but why if you can hunt for it).<br />
<br />
With these 3, you're set for agro for now.  <br />
<br />
Your haste is fine.<br />
<br />
Next would be HP.  Basically anything without HP you want to find a suitable item which is similar in AC but gives HP too.  I'd replace the arms and feet first, and more Champion's is probably the easiest.  For your earring, I'd pick up a Jagged Bone Earring - fairly cheap and decent hp.  Another cheap solution would be Earring of the Solstice or even trying to camp a Forgotten Ebony Earring in Velks if you're desperate.  Velks + camping = bleh, but still it's free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bloodmetal earring of engagement, goes for 15-25k, but you can also get the components and have it crafted if you know a jewelcrafter.<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry, nice upgrade from your velium ring and will run 5-10k tops.<br />
<br />
By doing LDoN you can get a nice neck item, Amulet of Mummy Wrappings, or you can buy one for 5k or so depending on your server.<br />
<br />
The Droga weapons suggested are very nice, as is GSoT.<br />
<br />
Also, you could do HoT with one group if you are careful and get nice gear upgrades there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarhl_MT</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you both! <br />
I found the thread on CHoS and SotB, i knew weapons would prolly need to be first and so I'll head to Droga.  With the weapons fixed I can do some LDoN and mebe go to the manor in kael for some plate drops. I am also friendly with a large guild that does HoT once a month so I can try that since CoV is max'd.  The rest of your suggestions are great, i'll make a list and get started.<br />
Thanks so much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like you're on the right track! Definitely go after the droga weapons and the GSoT, that's good advice.<br />
As for the valorium ring of gallantry, the major bottleneck if you want to have them crafted is the metallic liquid. It's a pretty rare drop in the plane of valor - I think it goes for around 2k if you want to buy it. Of course, you can get the rings themselves for about 5k if you're patient.<br />
The bloodmetal earrings are very nice, but expensive! Plus I think some of the components are elemental planes drops, so may be hard to get without some friends in high places. This earring is teh win though =-o<br />
As for legs, I picked up a pair of kylong shin guards for about 5k - 35ac and some stats. I believe they drop in veksar (a newish zone off of LOIO) and should be 1 groupable.<br />
You might also go after a putrid belt of rotten hide - Yeah, it's another 5k but it's a nice belt.<br />
Definitely do HoT =-o My guild got sooo many plate drops when we were there last. I got the helm and arms, and like 2 other helms, another set of arms, a pair of legs, and a set of boots went to the other clerics/warriors. And that was just the plate lol! It was a lucky trip for sure, but the more you go, the better your chances =-D</div></div><hr />
