<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently, the 3rd guild on our server has hit the Elemental Planes.<br />
A few days before, their MT warrior made a post about finally reaching the 9000hp status.<br />
<br />
I found it pretty sad that 3 of our paladins replied saying &quot;Grats, I was happy when I reached 9k too...&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's a 65 Warrior, &quot;Master of Combat&quot; with &quot;unequal ability to survive the most brutal fights&quot;.... that is a wimp compared to a paladin with just a couple months in advance...<br />
<br />
I guess Absor was right... &quot;Classes aren't that out of balance&quot;.. clueless incompetent retard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heh; my guild's paladins are jacked up like that too :D<br />
funny thing is though; they are prob the BEST damn paladins to have in a group and know their role and gameplay inside-out.<br />
They want aggro; the tell you first off they will have aggro. If they want YOU to have aggro; they will do their best to keep the aggro off them.<br />
<br />
players like that make it hard to h8 teh pallys. they're just so damn versatile and user/group friendly. makes things SO much easier and less time consuming.</div></div><hr />
