<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenyanan45</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes the DPS is going to suck and the Rage of Zek can be resisted quite often.  But how will the aggro be with this combo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">500+600 hate = decent for 2hander. DPS would be lacking, but should work ok. I used mine (un-augged) to tank TZ in tactics (just as something different) w/o and problems hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I finished my epic for kicks a few weeks ago.  I had all items for my epic sitting in the bank for 3 years except for the red scale.  On a whim I bought a red scale in the bazaar and did all the turn-ins.<br />
<br />
I then went straight to a Guk LDON and decided to try the epics for kicks.  To my surprise, the 2 hander was a total aggro lock.  A necro was in this group and they typically give me aggro fits in LDON with my normal anger3 setup.  The 2h epic unauged with WA5 performed perfectly well.<br />
<br />
The dual-wield epics by comparison were disappointing; they felt about like my unaugmented Ornate Greatblade (anyone who's used one can tell you it has terrible aggro).</div></div><hr />

Yup ... better dps and dps aggro + similar aggro from procs.</div></div><hr />

Better looking weapons always perform better.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This still doesn't make sense to me.  <br />
<br />
Stun = 450 aggro - as far as i'm able to tell from generally accepted numbers<br />
Rage of Zek = 500 - well, because that's what it says on the spell description<br />
<br />
No doubt about it, the GSoT is better DPS.  But with the two effects above, shouldn't the JBoW be better aggro?  Does the JBoW proc less because its slower?  Thought weapons all generally procced at the same rate.  <br />
<br />
I'm not about to organize a sit in or anything, it just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I estimate JBoW proc aggro at 616 (500+175*2/3) and GSoT proc aggro at 350 (simple stun~350 because droga combo is around 400 and 450 each).<br />
<br />
with WA5 CE0 and 305DEX, and no augment, we end up with around 1900 hate for the JBoW and 1100 for the GSoT.<br />
<br />
and with 36% we may expect at least 3000 Hate from dps for the JBoW and 3700 for the GSoT.<br />
at 100% haste we end up with at least  4600 for the JBoW and 5500 for the GSoT.<br />
at 130% haste we achieve at least  5200 hate from dps for the JBoW and 6300 for the GSoT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so they are globally the same, it depend on your toon to prefer one or the other. But remember that Hate from dps is best for short fight (trash, LDoN easy, ...) where we don't have many minutes to let the weapon procing alot.<br />
Moreover as Wandor said, any procing weapon become a strong aggro generator as soon as you put A3 on it.<br />
so if you are afraid that JBoW proc will stop generating aggro when resisted (even if I don't think it's possible), or if you always fight at max overhaste, or if you prefer the sure basis of dps' haste then go for the GSoT.<br />
on the other hand if you think the a resisted proc draw as much aggro than a normal one (no metter which spell is it), and that you don't have confidence on dps aggro because it has been underparsed, and that you want to wield a weapon that you can be proud of, and that you don't have much haste most of the time then go for the JBoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not about to organize a sit in or anything, it just doesn't make sense.Sure, if you didn't swing your weapons at all and they just proc'd on the mob, the JBoW would be about 100 hate/minute better. However, in order to get those procs, you have to swing your weapons. I would guess that a GSoT makes up that 100 hate/min proc advantage in the first 10 seconds of combat - which also happen to be the most important 10 seconds since that is when you are most likely to lose agro to debuffers.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the epics are certainly one of the best looking combos in the game, it's just a shame that they suck so hard. Equip your epic for looking cool in PoK, bust out the cheapie bazaar weapons when you need agro/dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Any weapon+WA5+A3 = pretty good agro.<br />

<br />
err you mean: Any weapon+ INATE STUN/HATE proc +WA5+A3 = pretty good agro.<br />
<br />
Not that changes your position at all above....but I can see some yoyo walking away from thinking a SBoD is good agro if they put an anger 3 on it.<br />
<br />
I see no reason not to play with the 2 handed epic...its only pp to swap augs around if you have a spare Anger aug floating around...the look on peeps faces would be priceless when you hold agro with it  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Has anyone proven whether or not the epic proc builds 500ish aggro on a resist? If it doesn't, GSoT wins in every way except looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure this is the case regardless of whether or not a resisted epic proc still adds hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">err you mean: Any weapon+ INATE STUN/HATE proc +WA5+A3 = pretty good agroNo, I mean anything + WA5+A3 is pretty good agro. An SBoD+WA5+A3 is going to have agro just under an unauged Bloodfrenzy back in SoL when it was a godly weapon. I would classify that as pretty good agro.<br />
<br />
What people need to realize is that &quot;pretty good&quot; agro doesn't stack up when you have a weapon with agro proc+A3. Any weapon with an innate stun/hate proc is going to have much better agro, and is always preferable to a weapon without an innate agro proc. There simply is no comparison, the point I am trying to make is that the answer for these threads is always the same: Weapon_01+A3 is going to be good agro. But, why bother when CHoS/SotB+A3 is going to be much better agro?<br />
<br />
Pretty sure this is the case regardless of whether or not a resisted epic proc still adds hateI would imagine that this works like the wizard spell Concussion. Take a look in the library over at Graffe's for the agro thread. Conclusive tests that can be duplicated that proved resited concussion still removed hate. Hard to say for sure if this works the same for hate generating proc without conducting some testing, but I would tend to believe that they still generates agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, I mean anything + WA5+A3 is pretty good agro. <br />
<br />
No it isnt.  Against legit dps classes (ellie &amp; better geared) you will look like an idiot trying to hold agro w/o an inate agro proc on the weap to go with that anger 3....cause guess what?  They get WA5 too....not to mention their dps agro may be a *little* bit better than it was back in SoL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Yoda.  <br />
<br />
Had no idea how to quantify the DPS aggro effect.  It IS a shame that the epic is beat out by a 100pp bazaar trash weapon.  It would be cool if you could get some use out of it.  Where it is close, maybe when I get another Anger III going I'll pop it on the Epic just cause I'm a sentimental fool that way.  <br />
<br />
I guess Epic 2.0 will make them really worthwhile again.</div></div><hr />
