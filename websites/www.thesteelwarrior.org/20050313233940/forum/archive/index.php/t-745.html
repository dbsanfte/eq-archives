Parses taken from 3 Xegony fights (Probably one of the best &quot;boss&quot; mobs to test AC on, due to the duration of the fight.)<br />
<br />
1886 AC <br />
37 Minute fight<br />
944 DPS.<br />
--------------------------------<br />
2012 AC <br />
34 Minute fight<br />
889 DPS<br />
--------------------------------<br />
2248 AC <br />
39 Minute fight<br />
811 DPS<br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
This shows (although the sample size is still a little small) that AC is still showing decent returns as your AC increases.<br />
<br />
You cannot effectively &quot;feel&quot; if your AC is giving returns (which is what you're saying,) you have to parse it. And even then, the sample size has to be very large, to remove any inconsistencies. Even my above sample size is too small, and there will be variables altering the test results -- Such as how many times I managed to hit Evasive, etc.<br />
<br />
*** POST 2 ***<br />
Xegony is slowable, and is not resistant at all. She stays slowed the entire duration, and is tanked by me from beginning to end.<br />
Max and Min hit %'s. With 2440 being max, and 612 being min:<br />
<br />
1886 ac<br />
Hit 2440 1.86% of the time<br />
Hit 612 27.58% of the time<br />
----------------------------------<br />
2012 ac<br />
Hit 2440 1.33% of the time<br />
Hit 612 30.72% of the time<br />
----------------------------------<br />
2248<br />
Hit 2440 0.86% of the time<br />
Hit 612 36.4% of the time<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this was with me Evasive, so Defensive mititation doesn't skew it.<br />
<br />
Another interesting fact.<br />
My avoidance with Evasive was 40.11%<br />
My avoidance with Defensive was 34.22%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------- Comments -------<br />
1)How do you compare Evasive &amp; Defensive avoidace ?<br />
Since you said you didnt use defense ? Were you meaning Discless ?<br />
In that case evasive is useless vs Xegony.<br />
<br />
2) Would you say that giving up HP for AC (ex AoW ring vs Moss)<br />
Is worth it ? I'm starting to have the feeling that HP are kinda useless.<br />
<br />
3) Dividing the total of max hits by 2 is immense compared to<br />
the minimal reduction in DPS (940 to 811). <br />
Even if we could lower xegony's DPS to 500, that wouldnt change the pause (imo).<br />
Since its the spikes we fear and not the overall dps.<br />
<br />
4) Do you feel that PoP is becoming more :<br />
&quot;Trying to avoid the spike, instead of soaking it&quot;.<br />
All other wars in the guild disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since defensive effects mitigation instead of avoidance, he probably just held constant that the avoidance wouldnt change under defensive from without disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) My parser can parse my avoidance, and I've tanked Xegony using both Defensive, and Evasive. I simply cut/pasted the parts where I was in those discs, and saw what my avoidance was with both. Just to see how much gain I was getting using Evasive. <br />
Since Xegony hits for minimum hit so often, it's pointless to go Defensive, since the gains are so small (612 min hit while Non-Defensive, 514 Defensive)  -- where as using Evasive, the gains are larger.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) In most long duration boss fights (when you're tanking without disc for long periods of time), I think using AC gear is better over HP, but still the majority of our gear is high hp/ac -- just be certain when you're looting, that you're not getting screwed on either of these stats :P There is no reason to be. <br />
AOW ring is still very nice imo, but no -- Moss band is still nicer overall.<br />
<br />
3) Your Clerics pause should always be running as fast as possible. There is no reason at all they should be running OOM. They can chain CH indefinately. Fyi -- The only mob I have my Clerics using a CH chain on, in PoP, is Xegony and Fennin Ro, iirc.<br />
<br />
4) Defensive &quot;avoids the spike&quot; since it flattens damage out. When you switch to Evasive, or disc runs out, that's when you run into the danger of getting a bad spike and dropping dead. Gear is alot more important now, than it has been in previous expansions; and really, Warriors are the only class that can reliably tank -- which is how it should of been. They &quot;fixed&quot; Warriors this expansion, in ways we didn't think of :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Evasive seems to own Fennin, too.  And I agree with Ainian, cleric mana in ch rotation is indefinite.  We use rotation on the Rathe council members, Blazzax and Magmaton as well as Fennin and Xeg because it tends to smooth those encounters out for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kriegartorv</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for other mobs how do your clerics heal? just curious i have no idea how mine do, but i always assumed at least a 3 cleric rotation... random spam heals and random cheals or 1 cleric chain casting cheal just doesnt seem very dependable on mobs that hit/ae for 2K+ on fights that last over 1 minute...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">6 clerics pause 10 for every mob so far.<br />
And backup healer spam when disc drops.<br />
<br />
Exept :<br />
Rapem (2nd rotation pause 10  drood/cleric/sham Normal heal)<br />
Fenin : 8 clerics minimal pause<br />
Xegony : 8 clerics minimal pause<br />
<br />
Used to have 10-12 clerics per night for 55. (But crappastic DPS)<br />
Like 3 wiz 3 mages 3 rangers and a few melees .....<br />
2 stopped 1 ebayed 1 poofed. So gonna have to adjust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For non-rotation fights our clerics ghetto heal.  They just watch the cleric channel and if no one has done a cheal for a few seconds, one starts a CH.  It reminds me of the days in NToV when we didn't rotate on anything, totally ghetto.</div></div><hr />
