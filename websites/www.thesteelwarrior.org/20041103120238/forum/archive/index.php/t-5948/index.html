<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weedas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone could give me suggestions on what to look at for gear.   I only have about 1k in the bank and no source to get much money.  <br />
<br />
I know arms really need an upgrade but I can't seem to find any good arms to get bought, quested or otherwise.  I've been looking at getting Bracers of Benevolence to upgrade wrists but can't get a group together to do the quest.  Would like to get rid of that Ring of Thunderous Spirits, can't stand not to have any AC on that thing.<br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions I'm welcome to hear them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">crystal spider eyes for the 1k<br />
arms: maybe some type of velious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There really arnt that many rings that would be upgrades for you, the velium fire wedding rings have 6 ac, but you loose 10hp.  You could start hunting in PoValor and work on getting componants for the valorium rings. Getting the metallic liquid is the most expensive peice. Check out the combine at eqtraders.com or something.<br />
<br />
Crystal spider eyes are a decent upgrade to your face.<br />
<br />
I reccomend doing lots of adventures and try saving up for the everfrost plate armor. It's about 750 points a peice, but huge upgrades. <br />
<br />
LDoN is huge for gear upgrades now adays, and it's relatively easy :)</div></div><hr />

Easy drop in Torgiran's (for 0K :D) ... Grobb Hide Mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=40128). <br />
<br />
Zone into Torgiran from Nadox, go forward thru the door, and down the stairs.  There's a good camp spot on your left after you come thru the door, a wee bit down the hall.  Pull from farther down the hall, and watch for a fake floor along the way - it drops into a water filled tunnel with a luggald at the end of it.  No biggie.   A high 50/60ish group won't have any problems there.  There's a troll treasurer type that spawns every four hours or so, drops 6 gems.  Nice bonus.</div></div><hr />
