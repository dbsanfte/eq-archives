<br />
The people who choose to go against the flow and go with a harder/gimped spec don't come here bitching that it's too hard. Because they knew beforehand it was gonna be more difficult, and wanted the challenge. It's pretty common knowledge that Fury builds atm are crap compared to Full Protection or MS/Arms 31/5/15 builds. So you can't really expect alot of sympathy on a forum thats dedicated to helping warriors become better rather then worse.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone can argue against some upgrades so we can get a valid 3way interdependant tree system going on. <br />
<br />
Honestly I wouldn't touch a thing in arms except for perhalps adjusting improved rend to have some type of debuff applied as well. Overall it's a great layout and shows some actual thought went into the tree and it's order rather then just throwing darts at a brainstorming board and getting your tiers that way.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I am still a full prot war. While there are aspects of it that are shitty compared to ms - arms bretheren I am still playing said warrior, and enjoying the game for what it's intended to be -- a fun game. That doesn't mean ignorance is bliss tho.</div></div><hr />

Monday afternoons at work are so utterly boring..</div></div><hr />

It might just be mana though. I noticed my druid losing a lot more mana than he should when he was fighting them and could not understand why until I checked the combat logs. Not sure if its health as well mind you, but they do seem harder than your average mob.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the rest, my warrior is still a lowbie :). Gotta level him up soon.</div></div><hr />

They have some crappy poison that really takes its toll eventually.  Those bastages gave me some difficulty too.</div></div><hr />

I think it was something relatively minor but it's annoying in that it lasted something stupid like 2 minutes. Kinda throws a wrench into any sense of bandaging.</div></div><hr />

By the time I was done my arms and shirt were covered in blood - it looked like I just murdered someone with a hatchet. I went to a 7-11 and asked for a box of tampons for my girlfriend. The cashier was mortified.<br />
<br />
Well, the whole cafe is mortified here, not knowing why on earth I'm cackling so maniacally and loudly.  I dunno when that started being your sig, but a few folx here know the time I first saw it ...</div></div><hr />
