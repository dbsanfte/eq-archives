<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthax</div><div class="date">03-31-2005, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has been farming ubrs a lot over the past few weeks and I wanted some other warrior's opinions on aggro control for The Beast.<br />
<br />
I have no problems with all the other bosses... Rend, Drakk, and the other two losers are stuck on me like glue.  I can keep aggro easily for the entire fight, but The Beast is a disaster.<br />
<br />
He &quot;punts&quot; the first person who attacks him into the air.  Our current strategy is for a Paladin to run in and take the punt then I go in second to tank.  The Beast does an AE fear that I can resist for most of the fight due to some priest buff, but it seems like my aggro is wiped with every fear whether I am affected or not.  Then it is just mass chaos of me chasing the mob around and only able to hold aggro briefly after a taunt before he starts ignoring me again.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have any better luck with this thing?  Am I right that his AE fear also wipes aggro?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-31-2005, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We generally have 2 tanks on him.  Even inbetween the knockback, sunder revenge and bash means we have aggro &quot;most&quot; of the time.  You get a temporary period of being ignored during fear, but its very short duration and fixable by fear ward, or a blacksmith trinket.  <br />
<br />
Its interesting to point out that a lot of times, when you &quot;think&quot; you've lost aggro on the beast you actually haven't.  He has some random secondary targeting where he runs off and charges someone else, much like the guards in UBRS and the scarlets in stratholme... even though you still have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-03-2005, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charge him in the cave and wall him, shouldnt even need a paladin to take after punt aggro. <br />
<br />
Best way to hold aggro is to keep enough rage at all times so that you can taunt after he deaggros and shieldbash immediately. Shieldbash should seal your aggro then throw in some more sunder/revenge love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seveirn</div><div class="date">04-20-2005, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">above mentioned are great ideas.. but keep in mine due to his size you can do abilitys alot farther than you would expect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Always drag him to a cornor, if he punts taunt. Punt has an agro removal componant</div></div><hr />

But like it was posted above you dont need a pally for this or anything else! warriors will keep the aggro, best group for this as a 5 person would be, Warrior,preist,Hunter,Druid,Warrior/pally, that way u can have 2 maybe 3 healers a nuker a tanker and the hunter comes in real handy with his arrows or bullets and his pet as long as one of the warriors keep aggro on the beast everything rides cool. plus im an arms/furybuild and with like no proc and i keep aggro and tanking just fine! i mean i could do much better with proc but u should have a proc and a dmg dealing warriors in the group :)</div></div><hr />

Do you have any clue what or where the beast is, and consequently, what you're posting about?</div></div><hr />

EVERYONE VOID MY POST ON THIS PART! Now saying i was at a friends house and watched him do this, since hes a higher lvl than me, also being a warrior i should ask him to post here and give his adivce sorry! hehe :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireiina</div><div class="date">04-22-2005, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've never bothered walling him or fighting him in the caves. And personally I adore the air time he can grant you. With 3 warriors there's always someone to grab aggro when the MT get's punted or feared. Of course we (horde) don't have fear ward so we have to accept that fear is going to hit us harder.<br />
<br />
Now conflagarate, that I don't like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-22-2005, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear ward doesn't seem to help on beast. I've been feared by him with fear ward still sitting there in my buff list.<br />
<br />
With 3 warriors I suppose it would be easy. I get use to being the only warrior in the trip.<br />
<br />
I must be really lucky on conflag btw, did general with 11 on wednesday and it's the only time I remember conflag actually landing on me. The rest of the time it was either resisted or hit someone else I guess. (I've never lost aggro on him either, so wonder if he just picks people at random)</div></div><hr />

Conflag is random on targets within melee range, we usually use some sacrificial pallies to assist in soaking it for us. :D<br />
<br />
I really think for UBRS in general with minimal crowd control you probably need 3 people who can take some sort of hits (Druid, pally, war, whatever) for the latter part.  Captains are virtually totally attention consuming to tank, and then typically you can split the remainders.</div></div><hr />
