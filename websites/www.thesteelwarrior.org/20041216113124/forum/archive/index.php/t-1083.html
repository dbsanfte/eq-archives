<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I grouped with an SK the other night in PoD, same level as me (55), who not only did everything in his power to work with me on aggro ( he occasionally pulled aggro off the shaman after one or two resisted slows, but gave it right back to me after), but even went so far as to help me educate one of my guildies/buddies who is a paladin, on how to avoid pulling aggro off me unecessarily(when to cast, where to stand, etc).   (The pally was 52 and not really ready to tank some of the stuff we were fighting, especially unslowed).  It was a real pleasure to be in a pickup group with an SK who not only didnt want to have a pissing contest to see who could get aggro, but was willing to work with me to piggy back aggro when necessary, and didnt mind memming/casting voice on me.<br />

On a related note, there's a ranger in my guild who's my level and epic'd that almost NEVER pulls aggro from me, and jolts if he does. (max melee range, turns off auto attack once in a while just to be doing it) I can't tell you how much fun it is to group with him just because I dont have to worry about aggro so much.  <br />

Most will work with me no problem to get the best situation for the group, and therefore the fastest exp.  I remember at 62, just flagged for PoV/PoS, got my first group in tier 2.  Shortly after I arrived, another group member left, and some one invited their 65 SK friend to join us.  The SK insisted I tank, asked if I wanted voice, and kept it on me, only grabbed agro when I lost it to slower, and took over pulling, pulling with darkness and then letting me taunt off to piggyback agro.<br />
<br />
I think everyone on this board has knight friends, and knows that most are not bad people.  I am frustrated with the disparity between their agro ability and mine, but I don't hate them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other night we had an oddball group, so we headed to Valor for some safe easy exp...<br />
<br />
The group consisted of the following:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
2 Paladins<br />
Monk<br />
Mage<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Basically... we pulled 4-5 mobs at a time and everyone tanked em and everyone killed their own mobs.   No one gave a crap about who was tanking or anything, we all just killed mobs... when one person was done, they'd move to the next mob and so on and so forth.   The experience FLOWED I tell you and the shaman had *no* problem keeping up with healing with the pallies helping.  It was actually amazing, and a hell of a lot more fun than the standard group.<br />
<br />
Also, I didn't have any aggro problems.... it was refreshing... never mind that I was the only one fighting the mob at the time.</div></div><hr />

Remind him how much of a pussy he is, and that it's in the groups best intentions that you, the tank, are actually tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exp sucked though :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So like the first month PoP opened, I was in PoD with a group of friends.<br />
<br />
This was a tad before all the camps were firmly established, and back when people were still up for exploring.<br />
<br />
The group makeup was something like me (57 monk at the time), 61 warrior, 61 shaman, 58 bard, 60 shaman, 60 cleric.<br />
<br />
We were in the middle of the green lake there ... fighting bugs. And rats kept pathing by.<br />
<br />
2 solid hours of non-stop killing.<br />
<br />
It just didn't stop.<br />
<br />
The shaman kept everyone healed with ease, to the point that the cleric was mostly crowd control with roots and the like.<br />
<br />
Was the most fun I ever had in that godforsaken plane.<br />
<br />
In fact those first five weeks of PoP were great, because people were trying new things and exploring and fighting whatever. <br />
<br />
It was the only time I ever was in a group that actively sought out the CH-ing spiders.<br />
<br />
Nowadays it's either goos on the wall ... non-CHing spiders, or one of the courtyards.<br />
<br />
So sad.<br />
<br />
But anyways, that day in PoD, aggro was never an issue. Staying ahead of the mobs before root broke was. Heh.<br />
<br />
I find the game is much more fun for everyone involved when you get a group that wants to push things a bit.<br />
<br />
That way everyone's participating, everyone's doing their job, everyone's playing the game and having fun.<br />
<br />
Safe XP tends to be safe and boring. Once PoP got ESTABLISHED, the expansion got really safe, and really boring.<br />
<br />
I remember those first few weeks, even all the big guilds' message boards were filled with the wonder of exploration and the fun of running around in the planes.<br />
<br />
These days, it's just a chore it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can tell the cool ones cause they dont give a shit who tanks.  Its also a way to see how smart the Warrior is from their perspective.  If the CHer has no issues keeping up with them then let them Tank.  Since I do BoT mainly lots of times we will have Pally MT till a named pops then I take him.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes its funny cause we argue back and forth who should be MTing, and /ran for it.  Low roll has to MT.  Either way works just as good.  Especially with a piggy back.  My favorite was having Pally stun pull, then I would womp mob in rear and Taunt while he was running to camp.  Got the timing so I would be taunting off right about when he got to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinadier</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me start out by saying that every class in EQ has its share of a*sholes.<br />
Yeah, there are some paladins who won't admit that generally, warriors can't keep agro as well as they should. And yeah, there are warriors who want pallies nerfed to the point where we would have to become male prostitutes (or female I guess) to be able to even survive in EQ... /shudder. There's always gonna be a*sholes on this planet.<br />
With that said... sometimes pallies can and should be a better tank ... I've read through your forums a little and seen a lot of you talking about how when a warrior and a pally are in the same group, they wanted the pally tanking. I encountered a situation a couple nights ago in PoI ... the group was:<br />
58 Mage<br />
53 Cleric<br />
58 Shaman<br />
56 Rogue<br />
53 Warrior<br />
57 Paladin (me)<br />
Now I have average equipment for my level ... mainly Luminant Heraldic shiznat, and while I never actually checked what gear the warrior had, I could tell it was fairly crappy.<br />
Well, me being a few levels higher and having generally better gear, it would be natural that I would have a tad more HP + the ability to agro, yet the group insisted on the warrior tanking. I didn't complain or argue ... hell its hard enough trying to play SOCOM on the PS2 and keep agro on EQ at the same time.<br />
<br />
A couple months back when I was level 55 or so (IB sucks ... not enough time to play EQ), I was in a group with a 59 warrior, I kept getting agro without even trying. I wouldnt taunt or stun AT ALL, and yet I kept manage to get agro from the warrior using only the proc on my epic. I don't know if this warrior was e-Bayed, had really sh!tty gear, or simply didnt know how to play her class, but that is just WRONG. And yet ... while some of the warriors here may make it seem like the problem is that severe (see first paragraph), I don't think it is ...most warriors that I have grouped with with comparable levels and gear have no problem keeping agro most of the time ... sure, the mobs occasionally hit the enchanter, but nothing too severe.<br />

<br />
The problem still isn't the pally / SK though,  the problem IMO is the cleric / chanter ect ( the group that is starting )......  they would rather have a pally or SK as MT......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's for a reason.<br />
<br />
Hybrids can generate aggro on demand, in PoP's case enough aggro on demand to cover the initial high-aggro debuffs that have become so important in PoP.<br />
<br />
Warriors cannot generate ANY aggro on demand. It's all based on luck, and as such, is unreliable.<br />
<br />
Most of em say screw warriors, I'll take the reliable aggro.</div></div><hr />

My good friend hates tanking he he.  He'd rather just sit back and use his utility spells, and have agood time.  Don't bother I have close to 2k more hps than him...or like a butt load more AC...<br />
<br />
Yeah, he'd rather me tank =)  Yeah =)</div></div><hr />
