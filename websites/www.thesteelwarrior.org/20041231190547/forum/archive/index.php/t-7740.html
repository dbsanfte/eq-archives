<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meanfred</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently Lvl 61, and am grouping in PoV constantly.  I am using the Bloodsworn/CHoS and am awesome at holding aggro. my gear is decent and Im topping out at about 6.5k HPs buffed, and about 1275 AC. Anyway, what I am getting at. My friends have told me that CoD is a great zone for 61 wars to EXP at up to 65, because they think that I wont get groups in BoT at 62, which Im sure is the case.  Is there somwhere else I should be rather than PoV, or should I just wall it to 65 here? I am not sure what to do atm.  And when do I know I am ready for a raiding guild?  Is there something I can be doing to better my equipment atm?  It is not horrible, but not the best, as you see my buffed stats above.  I just want to know what I should be working on atm.  Any tips would be appreciated from the more experienced high end warriors. Thanks.<br />

PS: I am Agnostic, so FH is out of the question.<br />

I'd personally stick it out in PoV. The experience is still amazing at 61. Try BoT when you want to, but Inner PoV especially should rock. I never tried experiencing in CoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try out Plane of Storms, not sure what's the grouping status is like on your server, but on Stromm it's mostly empty. If you have a regular group going, it's a change of scenery at least. <br />
<br />
Another place you might want to try out is Plane of Hate. It has mobs that get harder as you go further in, so you can decide just exactly how much you want to handle. Again, it's not as populated as BoT, so bring your own group along.</div></div><hr />

However, the dot procs of the puslings get VERY annoying after a while.  Make sure your healer has Radiant Cure or some other cure perma memmed. =p<br />

From 61 to 64, I did a mix of PoN goblins/nightmare mephits, trash in PoStorms (frog tunnel's fun /cackle), Castle in PoD, CoD, PoI factory, Bug tunnels in PoJ, PoV, BoT, HoH basement. Actually, I hit 65 in that basement, heh.</div></div><hr />
