--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Please visit my site, and let me know what you think so far. I do it in my spare time and there are NO ads, nor do I ever plan for there to be any. <br />
<br />
Am sorry to see the Steel site go. It was my inspiration as an up and coming warrior.<br />
<br />
www.eqwarrior.com (http://www.eqwarrior.com) <br />
<br />
Jaikar, Contact me at gulk@eqwarrior.com , would love to keep your pages alive on my site.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, and Be Safe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neato look.<br />
<br />
Only thing jes dun thinks ya gonna get folks ta go ta nudder forum.  Mebbe link forum thing ta here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow I love the look.<br />
<br />
But I agree, you mind as well link the forum to here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">kick ass!!!  but forum has to be kept here really.. 2 split forums would be a headache... but site rocks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the look of it alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kimo_Sabbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice look going on there :) but like everyone else mentioned link the forum to here ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm maybe I was missing it I did not even see a forum link on that site. But aye I like the look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Very nice site :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">good job. yes i don't wanna change forums again any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spinetwist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very nice look. I dig the greco-roman style. Only suggestion I can say is keep the forums linked to here. It is a pain in the ass for everyone to keep switching back and forth, and most of us are here and registered already. Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just for clarification, this board isn't affiliated with that site in any way. That may change in the future but in the very least the site's owner would need to talk with Raaj.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That was a rip from the Maximus home page. T.King's guild on Brell Serilis.<br />
<br />
/shrug <br />
<br />
No need for another board anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Five</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Errr, we have a board.  It's right here.  Just confusing folks by putting up another one and newbies aren't going to be getting the full benefit of the communities wisdom.<br />
<br />
As a &quot;cover&quot; page, I wouldn't chose that site.  Too &quot;pretty boy&quot; for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If Raaj will contact me, maybe we can work something out.  <br />
<br />
Boards take a lot of time, that I don't have.<br />
<br />
And NO, it is not a rip.  I asked T. King, if you read my site, and have his full permission to use all graphics.  <br />
<br />
I think they are quite fitting for a warrior site.  Maximus is no more, and the site serves as a living tribuite to that guild.<br />
<br />
Besides what i came up with initally, for the design, was lame, and there is no way i could even come close to making something so impressive as T. King's work.<br />
<br />
I merely offered my boards as a cheaper alternative, if there was interest in moving.  <br />
<br />
Thanks all for your comments.<br />

But, pls dont make a new forum, just found this one :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If teh cut3 is here, who would want to go anywhere else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">not to get your hopes down or anything, but your host beyond being slow, only allows 5gb of traffic a month.<br />
<br />
these boards alone use a half a gig of day with gzip compression and a bunch of custom modifications by me to reduce bandwidth.<br />
<br />
fyi =0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Nice work, Gulk!  The combination of your new site with these new message boards will make a great reference for old and new warriors alike.  I definitely think the graphics are fitting, and you give T. King credit at the bottom of your page, so that isn't even an issue.  <br />
<br />
Plus, well, you're in my guild and I have to give you props no matter what.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spinetwist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Call me a masochist but if I were to design a site tailored to the EQ warriors it would be caked with blood, torn bodies, and all kinds of wretched images of conquest!  The left hand menu would be a bloody spear with a mangled Bard impaled on it.  Among wicked graphics I would DEFINATELY add the &quot;Warrior Babes&quot; section, and add all the cut3'ies from the SteelWarrior.org forums.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt add another forum, Id just link to this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>gulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Chicks in Chainmail was going to be an eventual link <br />
:D <br />
<br />
And as far as blood and gore go, I don't have the artistic skills to pull it off, with out it coming out looking like a noob web page.<br />
<br />
I hope that the eqwarrior site at least looks befitting a warrior, at least that was my intention.<br />
<br />
Please contact me for discussion about linking to these boards.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
