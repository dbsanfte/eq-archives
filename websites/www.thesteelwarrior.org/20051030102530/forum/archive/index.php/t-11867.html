<br />
My guild got her down to 30% so I got a look at all three stages.<br />
<br />
Stage One:  I get my back up against the north wall, but she keeps slapping me around to the left and right.  Is there any position that allows me to stay stationary?   Sometimes she slaps me so far that her frontal fire will then effect people on the sides before I can run back to my spot. <br />
<br />
Stage Two:  There are two off-tanks on each side for the whelps and I dont want to form a crowd so I just stand around and take random shots at Onyxia when she is in range.  Not sure how I can be more useful without risking the Onyxia breath attack.<br />
<br />
Stage Three: This sucks huge.  Trying to get initial aggro while dodging lava.  Then when I finally get her to the north, she slaps me left and right which knocks me into lava.  Once again... is there any specific place to stand while tanking?<br />
<br />
Any suggections from successful Onyxia tanks would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

yes<br />
<br />
I'll also say that I tanked Onyxia on my second raid from, oh, 40% to kill. it's not too hard.</div></div><hr />
