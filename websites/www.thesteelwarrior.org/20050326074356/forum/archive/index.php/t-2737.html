<br />
Tonight we tried a first inguild miniraid of BoT towers, but we could only get people actually holding the key inside. I thought clicking on the portal would take your whole group in if keyed? We tried breaking up raid and doing it in single groups but still didn t work.<br />
Anyone else notice this, did they change it with the last patch?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this was their intention, for I have been told that gems are more common now.  Honestly, there is no excuse not to have a key, the gems and ring rot 90% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure there is an excuse to not have a key.  Not everyone that raids in BoT towers/Agnarr exp's in BoT.<br />
<br />
My alt mage has a tower key, because he exp hunts in BoT.<br />
<br />
My main warrior doesn't have any of the pieces, because he has never been in a BoT exp group - preferring to do Tactics instead.<br />
<br />
Is it a huge deal to go back and get a key?  No.  But I can't really see a reason to force even more people to go hunt in a zone that is already overcrowded, just so they can get a key they will use occasionally when they raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">U can thank SoE for removing the BoT flag and making it a level requirement.  Prior to that change BoT was not that crowded.  Good point...Your right about that, and I would agree that making everyone have their own tower key is not realistic since that zone is way overcamped....and the beautiful trains...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question.  Did you just leave the groups at zone in and let the key holders go up to the towers?  If so, that's your fault.<br />
<br />
Key holder AND group MUST be standing around the zone in portal to the tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Concensus seems to be that they changed it, and that the change is &quot;working as intended&quot;, as per GM's comments, according to other class boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure it's intentional.  Been this way on Test for a couple weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kind of a poor change, especially with no warning, and I really don't see the point in it. Was it that bad that one key could get a whole group into a tower?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only reason I can think of is SoE wanted to limit the amount of &quot;pick-up&quot; style raids on the towers for those that just dinged 62 and like to train everything to the ZI.  Other than that I can't really think of a logical reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And trains aren't created by the people who now need keys getting to that mini boss with the ring of torden rotting on it? BoT has plenty of trains but the pople raiding the tower bosses are not causing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we found it last night, one of our raid members apparently sent a tell to a GM, who said to /bug it, and he would do the same.  Unfortunatly, I suspect, especially after reading this, that it is not a bug, and it is working as they now intend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korudan</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a bug they are working on it plus they will add the key to key ring so no more carrying the ring about.<br />
<br />
news on BoT keys from sony (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=58245)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh,<br />
They need to get their acts together then.<br />
We had a GM letting non keyed people into tower's to raid today on the Nameless. <br />
I sometimes love CS from SoE, today was that day and I got a new shield out of the deal to boot.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the GM that followed along and let non keyed people in!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this the same way for Agnarr's Portal now also? Also the Ring Container to get into BoT Towers they only drop from the Wing Bosses? If that's true my guild will never get to Agnarr now :( there is usually around 80ish people in BoT ALL THE TIME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fixed on Test as of last night.</div></div><hr />
