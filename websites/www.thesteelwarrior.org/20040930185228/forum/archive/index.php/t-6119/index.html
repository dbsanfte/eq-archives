Fuck blatant kill stealers. Fuck anyone who feigns ignorance when confronted about kill stealing. Fuck anyone who cant say anything other than &quot;hi&quot; when i ask if they saw me pulling that mob.  Fuck elemental necros killing green shit in OS for no better reason than to fuck with people, and fuck Fennin Ro. <br />

good night<br />

/report is your friend, according to the &quot;play nice&quot; rules, a player killing greens while an exp group is contending the spawn, will be told to leave by a GM. I have done it, will continue to do it, you can't monopilize a non-exp giving spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only Kor's, Dar's and the occasional Jin are actually green in seb though.  I wouldnt call the place great XP, but I was making a yellow of AA an hour there solo while trying to camp a ToD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A Yellow an hour is pretty piss poor exp in AA for a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sargman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">$75 can make you forget Fennin Ro.... heh, yeah the server seems to be a cesspool at times, but hey...home is home. There is barely any mob in OS that doesn't give xp at level 65 especially after that level bump they gave those mobs back before LDoN came out because nobody was going to OS anymore. Whether it's to farm stuff to sell, or because you'll generally not be bothered, nothing wrong with being 65 and exping in OS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All servers suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know why someone would deliberatly go off and kill greens to piss off people they don't know.  I am sure they had at least &quot;some&quot; personal gain to be doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wrathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The worst is getting trained while doing a mob of your cycle *cough* cursed, AoW *cough*, by a TIME guild, to try to KS you. Sargman should know what guild im talking about since we are on fennin heh.<br />
<br />
We spawned the glyphed, we kill it, then we proceed onto exiled, they carm 5 adds, fully buff them up, then send them onto us. That failed on their part, so once we down exiled, they pulled cursed, and the GM (who was watching BTW) didnt do nothing about it. <br />
<br />
And while we were doing AoW (we didnt kill statue or idol, they did, but WTF would a time guild wanna take AoW from us for, we were in zone first), they trained vindi and all of the arena on us, but our monk got aggro and trained them back and the time guild wiped to vindi lol. And all this was also in front of a gm, and the gm finally banned/suspended around 26 of their members and banned all their officers lmao.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">YEAY, I will tell you why a Time guild was doing this. Cause the greedy TURDS in this game will do ANYTHING to stop others progress. We have the same problem on Tunare, greedy guilds who are bored so they come stop the entire server from progressing by sniping/training/any underhanded deed to stop other guilds from competing with them. The best thing is when the guild eventually falls because so many hate them, and they crash hard. GMs have even been MEMBERS of these guilds on Tunare! These guilds were eventually destroyed by continual pressure from the player base and their rotten reps (unable to draw members as theirs quit).<br />
The best was when I was asked to tank for one of these guilds on Vindy, the mighty had fallen. I found something better to do then help the turd guild, and now it no longer exists.</div></div><hr />
