<br />
Remember that people like to learn, too though. I don't have a problem with posting info like this, but I do think it's a good idea to keep it pre-time...for now.</div></div><hr />

Quick question for you on the Disc columns in the chart.  Are you saying if the tank has 8k hp (or more) and all mitigation/avoidance aa's you recommend using the disc in the second column?  (**disc)<br />
<br />
If I'm understanding the columns correctly, why do you recommend changing discs based on MA hp?  <br />
<br />
(btw, I'm not debating your comments...I'm just curious about the logic - especially since a mob we just started farming has defensive in one column and evasive in the other, and I want to make sure I'm using the best disc for the mob  ;) )<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bertoxxulous - 1882<br />
Grummus - 900<br />
RZTW - max hit on me was 1022<br />
Sontalak - 425 max<br />
velketor - 815 max<br />
terris thule - 900<br />
A construct of nightmares - 1100<br />
Rydda'dar - 1932 (i think, have to check logs again)<br />
Ta'Grusch the Abomination - 3500?<br />
Aerin'Dar - ~1350<br />
Lord Yelinak - 600? (was before mitigation increase)<br />
King Tormax - Pretty sure its 525<br />
The Idol of Rallos Zek(2) - Thought was identical to AoW except slowable?<br />
Saryrn - Was 900 when I got hit by AE ramp and backed off :P<br />
<br />
Can't say anything about luclin mobs as I was semi-retired during that era and only killed arch lich once in ssra and that was it. From what I've read its best to use evasive against almost everything in that expansion.<br />
<br />
Feel free to correct me anyone<br />
<br />
<br />
Should also make a column for rampage/flurry.</div></div><hr />

In the event that you are pretty much guaranteed to survive around 2 full melee rounds, then it may be wise to choose the route which results in lesser over all DPS, as opposed to smoother, higher level DPS. Spikes kill tanks, DPS kills cleric mana.</div></div><hr />

What I meant was if you are using defensive on a mob when you have 8k hp, why would you switch to evasive when you have 9k hp? It just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here let me trying to get ya so ya can under stand this i made the list as we went thow them and with my fellow war's in my guild after LR5 ID5 and over 8k hp <br />
<br />
going back def was not needed and evas stoped the proc and that was more prob then dps at that point<br />
<br />
i just used 8k+ hp and lr5 id5 as a guide line for my fellow guildie<br />
<br />
im not in a raiding guild im in a famly guild that raids<br />
<br />
so war core go from high to low and use 8k to 9k war not allways on</div></div><hr />

This is verry true. My guild has now downed this guy 3 times. Was just recently. Let me tell you. He hits just as hard as AoW only he can be slowed. <br />
Also I do not agree with you on using evasive on a few mobs. But the main  2 would be Grieg and the IV in AR. They both are majority melee  with a nasty couple AE's the AE's will never kill you for they are blind and a knockback stunn. Well on GE its that and on IV its a  fling. I have found it best to use /def  since they are mostly melee. Now on something like BoT tower  named then yes  evasive would be best since they have those 1K AE's and such.<br />
  Using evasive on HP i dont understand. BUT like you said LR5 and ID5 is when you start using evasive more often. So i shall find out when I have LR5 and ID5. Right now i only have LR2. Thinking of doing another Stalwert endurance(SP) Because ALOT of mobs stunn and i have  one AA in it and already notice a huge differance.</div></div><hr />
