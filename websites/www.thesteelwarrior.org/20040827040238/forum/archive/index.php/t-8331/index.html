<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no matter what zone you hunt in dont sell anything to the vendor that says it can be used for tradeskills.<br />
<br />
take ldon as just one example. though im level 65 i believe this story will apply to you...<br />
<br />
about 2 months ago i made a friend who is big into the bazaar selling thing like i am and weve done many ldons together. she likes to master loot so we have been allowing her to do so especially considering most people kind of hate being bothered by it. she used to sell the stuff to the vendor like everyone else but in the last few weeks she started looking up (with her bazaar alt on her other account) the selling prices of most everything she has been looting.<br />
<br />
so what she does now is she checks the vendor prices of everything she loots and calculates the split according to what she would have gotten for it all from the vendor but she doesnt actually sell it to the vendor but saves it for her bazaar alt.<br />
<br />
next time she sees us (me my girlfriend and a couple other friends) she splits among us everything she made from ldon items in the bazaar. we each get typically 500pp per ldon we have done with her.<br />
<br />
now THAT is a lot of money. basically what it is coming down to is that by bazaaring everything she loots she is making about 2000 plat per adventure just selling the junk loot in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
example 2) all those runes and pages you loot in the higher level zones ... did you know the typical value to tradeskillers is about 20pp each? this is one reason why when i fight in typical luclin zones with my alts i can make 1000-2000pp in loot per hour while others fighting the same mobs in the same zones are quite lucky to make a quarter of that. only difference is i sell relatively little of the loot to the vendor.<br />
<br />
so you ask where you should fight to make money. fight wherever you want. transfer all loot to your bazaar alt. attempt to sell it there first and only sell it to the vendor if it sits around for more than a few weeks unsold or if you run out of space to hold it.<br />
<br />
or .. you can bottom feed green zones. that might get you even more plat but it gets you zero exp and im a firm believer that exp&gt;plat so im not really enthusiastic about it as a strategy.<br />
<br />
so do this. when in a full group offer to masterloot for the group. estimate what the vendor would give you for all the loot and then add 50 percent to that number. then do the split. then sell the loot in the bazaar. your groupmates will appreciate your very decent splits you are giving them so repeat group-members will be inclined to let you continue to ml. and you will come out way ahead in the money you make.</div></div><hr />
