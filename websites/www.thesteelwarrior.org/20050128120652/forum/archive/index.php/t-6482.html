Whne you give your opinion, take into consideration that both of these weapons would be upgraded with Anger3 and that I'd have Weapon afinity and all the other good AAs done. <br />
<br />
Here are the details of the weapons in question:<br />
<br />
Blade of War: Dmg 48, Dly 32. Wt 5.50. +50 AC, +30 Str, +30 Sta, +30 Agi, +15 Wis, +15 Int, +18 vsFire, +18 vsCold, +18 vsDis, +175 HP, +175 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of Enraging Blow.   Classes: Ra P Sk Wr. All Races. <br />
<br />
Stone Etched War Sword: Dmg 45, Dly 30. Wt 8.00. +35 AC, +15 Str, +20 Sta, +25 Dex, +18 Wis, +18 Int, +18 vsPos, +18 vsDis, +185 HP, +185 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of Rune III.   Classes: Ra P Sk Wr. All Races<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the input.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW for sure.  While Sews is nice it doesnt generate near the aggro BoW does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW; but it all depends on if getting a BoW is an option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience, Rune spells like the Rune III proc are very aggro inducing. <br />
For example, I was grouped with a bard in a just a two person group where the bard did very little damage but spent most of the time singing a rune song on me so I could tank.  (mind you this was around the Velious era, just near the release of Luclin)  I had a hell of a time keeping aggro on me with a Willsapper and Blade of the Black Dragon Eye.<br />
<br />
I would have thought that Rune III is just about as aggro inducing as clerics casting CH on you.  So although I can see enraging blow as a very direct line of hate for the warrior procing it, I would think the Rune III proc provides for quite a bit of indirect hate for the warrior since a Rune III can be considered, a heal or just simply a spell that prevents the mob from hurting the tank.<br />
<br />
Would an enchanter be able to shed more light on this?</div></div><hr />

Using a bbb for a long time i ended up putting a dd aug on it and just using it for dps as my 1handers at the time were heads and shoulders above it.   Rune 3 causes about 200 hate at most if i were to judge it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When it was just BoW vs SEWS there was really no comparison.  SEWS is what you get if your guild decides not to farm BoWs for your warriors.  Augs, Anger3 in specific, closed that gap considerably.  If you can get a BoW get it, its definately better, better proc, better agi(which I have alot harder time getting than dex), and better AC.  However if BoW isn't an option SEWS does well once Anger3 aug'd, before that I had too many agro issues to use it for tanking.  <br />
<br />
My guild has killed RZtWL like 7 times, 3 of those being backflagging raids and the last one we got our second BoW which went to a warrior farther down on the tank chain that was still dual wielding.  Right now our tank chain's weapons look like this . . . BoW(Ykesha), SEWS(Anger3), SEWS(Anger3), BoW(Ykesha), raidwipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
12+ Sews though. <br />
<br />
Some day I will get sews(people still need before me), and I will be damn happy with it.<br />
