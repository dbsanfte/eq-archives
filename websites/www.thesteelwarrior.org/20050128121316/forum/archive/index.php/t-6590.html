If you feel there's a place I can read up on the answer, please let me know and thanks in advance for the help.<br />
<br />
I've recently returned to EQ after years of hiatus, Velious was new when I quit for college.  Anyway, I'm back and trying a vah shir warrior on Innoruuk.   He's only 22, but I want to play him the best way possible and be a no talent ass clown to the groups I play with.<br />
<br />
I have some gear from a friend.  Currently using a 2hs (argent protector).  Should I  change and get a pair of 1hs?  If so, what do you recommend?  <br />
<br />
Also, are there threads on this board to tell me more about being a good tank?  I know to always watch for attacks on the healer and the casters,  but other things I should be attentive to.  <br />
<br />
Last question, on Innoruuk, are there any mid lvl guilds that I might look to join for hunting?  I've never seen places like ToFS or higher lvl kunark stuff and I'd love to, but I'm going to need some help.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
Vuma</div></div><hr />

(1hs, 1hb, pierce, 2hb, 2hs)  Aggro procs shouldn't be a concern to you until later in life (40+).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do make sure you've got the appropriate tomes/discs.<br />
Scan around for discussions of mob positioning, taunt, /shield, hotkey set ups...<br />
The basics of tanking haven't really changed: know your mob, know pathing characteristics of mobs in the area, don't let mob hit casters, only let mob kill melees you don't like, etc.<br />
Two things that will have changed a lot are the weapons and armor available at your level, and the places people hunt.<br />
If you are in your 20s I might try the Butcher Block LDoN camp or M. Seru.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and to answer your question about weapons: yes, get the best 1HS and 1HB and 2HB and piercing weapons you can find. You'll proably level too fast to keep all of the skills maxxed, until you get in your 40s and start bumping into skill caps for a few levels. What you want to do is try to max the skills on your best weapon or two and keep the other skills at least respectable.<br />
By &quot;best&quot; weapon: for 1HS and 1HB, get something fast (and, obviously, something that hits as hard as you can afford). It's pretty hard to recommend a specific weapon: what I'd do is go to the bazaar and search by class/race/regligion/weapon type and get the best bang for your buck.<br />
I'd recommend that your fastest 1-hander go in your primary slot, and the best ratio 1-hander goes in your offhand. Also, try to mix them--if your primary slot is a slashing weapon, your offhand should be blunt or piercing, because that will help you max your skills.<br />
But don't stop using the 2-handers either. Generally, it is more difficult to hold aggro with two handers all other things being equal. But when you're not having difficulty holding aggro (or if you are soloing or when you are not the main tank), pop in the two-hand weapons and get some skill-ups.<br />
Something else you should know: the hate your weapons generate is based on the *potential* of the weapon (a combination of your level and the weapon's damage and delay).  The aggro you generate with a weapon does not depend on the actual damage you do with it. What that means for a new warrior is that even if your skill in that weapon type is low, you can still hold aggro with it. What your low skill will cost you is actual damage done to the mob, but your ability to hold aggro will essentially be the same as if your skill were maxxed.</div></div><hr />
