<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khiloor</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so yesterday afternoon i go and get my tomes and give them to my guildmaster and all that jazz.. set up my hotkeys and decide to go for a little test of this stuff on the EF noob area. <br />
<br />
testing out range on Incite and other things.. so i decide to see how good ol' taunt works after the changes.  i see a level 1 &quot;a decaying skeleton&quot; standing close by so i run up next to it and hit TAUNT (the original one).<br />
<br />
I press TAUNT.<br />
Failed to taunt..  (thinking to myself, oh ok. maybe i fug'd up)<br />
I press TAUNT again.<br />
Failed to taunt<br />
I press TAUNT again!<br />
Failed to taunt.<br />
I press TAUNT again!!!!!<br />
Failed to taunt.<br />
<br />
is say wtf???...  A level 65 Warrior with all skills maxed wearing elemental gear can't taunt a goddamn level 1 skelly???  Is there something wrong with this??? <br />
<br />
After 10 failed taunts on this level 1 skelly, i think maybe something is wrong with the mob.  so i use my good-ol'-reliable-no-aggro-piece-of-crap DISARM key on the skelly.  <br />
<br />
boom.. first time with DISARM i get aggro.  So i try this again on more noob mobs with the same results!!...  <br />
<br />
Later that night........... guild does Fennin Ro cuz he's up and we need something to kill.  It comes my turn to tank the nameds on the way to Fennin, and decide to log it for further taunt review.  I had 24 failed taunts IN A ROW on the same mob.  If it wasn't for my BoC proc'ing a few times at the beginning we would have had a LOT of dead clerics.  I just got lucky on the &quot;proc lottery&quot; that time.<br />
<br />
Anyone else trying this?  is anyone else thinking this is &quot;working as intended&quot;??  SoE musta screwed with the taunt key somethin' fierce if i can't even get a level 1 skelly to turn around when i taunt him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it would be a little more enjoyable and less spam if they would give a 'taunt succeeded msg' and not 1 million taunt failed msgs.<br />
<br />
With a paladin tanking last night in Tier 1 Time, I tried Incite 4x, and Spirit of Rage while attacking with my DBotW/SoPP and did not get aggro at all unless I proc'd DBotW a couple times or successfully taunted.<br />
<br />
Other times I was tanking Tier3 bosses and used Incite on them 2-3 times, plus DBotW/SoPP and Taunt.... and still had multiple clerics, wizards, and shaman summoned and killed.<br />
<br />
The only useful purpose I've seen for Incite so far is on INC when it actually is a fair amount of aggro.  After slow and debuffs/heals land, Incite is such a small amount of aggro that it is basically useless.<br />
<br />
I tried Spirit of Rage also and could not find a use for it.  The refresh is way too long. <br />
<br />
So for taunting the current 'best' methods are still the same as ever... AE Taunt &gt; Successful Taunt &gt; Procs &gt; Arrow/spell on INC &gt; Gimmicks.<br />
<br />
This is from a raid based perspective.  Maybe they are useful in exp groups....</div></div><hr />

There are times where i get 7 failed taunts in a row, or no failed taunts in a row.  The only difference now is that  i can see the message.  Also, taunt seems to fail more often on mobs that are yellow and red.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried all this stuff again today in a couple LDoN exp groups.  Normal.<br />
<br />
Incite seemed to be useful for pulling and tanking multiple mobs.  But it rarely would pull aggro off anyone and onto me.  Slow spells must be like 1000-1500 hate if this is reallly 400 hate.  The unhooking of the disc timers made this a lot more fun, but the aggro abilities of warriors don't really seem changed.  I still lost aggro to our rogue and necro from time to time, and had a few times where it took me a while to get aggro off of our shaman.<br />
<br />
With a paladin or SK the necro and rogue would have NEVER gotten aggro.<br />
<br />
Oh and mighty strike is fixed and is pretty fun now that it lasts longer.  Might be better than aggressive now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt seemed normal to me.  I kinda like the fail message, just for breaking mez...can wait till you know you have a good taunt, incite and attack, works wonderfull.  Takes a little of the guesswork and hoping out of mez breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to work fine here...Fails about as much as i expected. Incite is great though, makes keeping aggro on raids really easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed since the patch when taunt does work it doesn't hardly ever give me agro same with Incite.  Incite is only good for agro on incoming pulls it seems or at least to me.  Surely they didn't &quot;break&quot; taunt while putting in the new endurance system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Works as it always has for me, however I didn't know if it had failed in the past so.<br />
<br />
In past<br />
<br />
First taunt on mezzed mob....success hit mob sticks to me, no<br />
further taunting needed<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
First taunt on mezzed mob fail, didn't realize it had failed hit<br />
goes after enchanter /shaman keep taunting/ weapon process until mob gets under control.<br />
<br />
Now it's<br />
<br />
First taunt on mezzed mob....success hit mob sticks to me, no<br />
further taunting needed<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
First taunt of mezzed mob..fail message....try again fail message,<br />
try again fail message, try again fail message try again success.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we just keep trying until we get a success, because we see all the fails.<br />
<br />
We stop after the first successful taunt and don't see the streaky<br />
RNG doing all the successful taunts.  It then appears as though<br />
taunt is failing more than we thought, when in reality we just<br />
don't bother to see the RNG's streaky success rate as well.<br />
<br />
Solution get Sony to get  a real RNG and not the one that was<br />
found in the back of a basic programming manual from 1981.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grimmreaper1400</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i am in the same guild as Khiloor, and was there when he was upset about the extreme amount of failures.  Like i have posted on Safe House, NT, etc.  Its all eye candy.  Pally hate ranges in the 600hate area, with limitations only to their mana bar.  Whens the last time you seen a paladin oom unless he was just rezzed.  <br />
<br />
Back to the eye candy.<br />
<br />
Uww ahhh, you have made &lt;insert mob&gt; angery for 400 hate, with a hate tick.  Useable every 30sec.  Who cares about hate over time.  We were concerned about snap aggro.  And 400 is chump change compared to tash or slow hate, or a pally that chain stuns til its so locked, a gm couldnt peel it.<br />
<br />
Disc on different timers, guess this is a preference.  If your maintaining endurance so you have it when you need it, your not going aggressive too  often.<br />
<br />
Whether you want to admit it or not, endurance is mana.  Both are used in the same manner, but for diffenent skills.  You use both to do  a specific task, and you must regen or you will not be able to continue.  (guess its good you dont have to sit to med endurance)  OOE = out of endurance.<br />
<br />
I have always known that taunt failed.  Been playing a warrior since late 1999.  I was totally shocked and extremely upset with how much it fails.  No wonder warriors sucked for holding aggro.<br />
<br />
All in all, splitting the disc, is nice, not a fix , but nice.<br />
Aggro is still broken as far as i am concerned, they put a bandaid on  a gun shot wound.<br />
<br />
Mana,, i meant endurance is a weak attempt to control the class.<br />
<br />
The 1 good thing that came with the combat changes ( and only good thing imho) were: 1) you see when your taunt failed, (via message) which is WAY too much. <br />
<br />
But its eye candy, and most tanks bought it, so now we are stuck with it.  Paladins still hold the aggro, and yours still fails too much.<br />
<br />
Btw, still testing, but the 4 or so  ldon i have done since the change, has so far shown, that Incite is good for single pulling.  So far, unless i path through another mob, i single pull each time.<br />

The fact that you think it's not random means it is actually random, because by definition no one ought to know what a random sequence looks like.<br />

Taunt seems to work always the same amount as it did before.  Now you know when it fails too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Out of 1152 taunts, 482 were failures, so it looks like in the long run, it's really not that bad.  If someone had asked me what percent I was failing, I would've guessed 75%, not the 41% it really was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man thats not caps lock thats like super caps lock. Oh and as much as I hate to say it I wish they would have kept the fale message off. Now before you go flaming me its just sucks so much to see if fail all the time. Probably not as bad as it seems but it sure does feel like it fails alot more then it suceeds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uww ahhh, you have made &lt;insert mob&gt; angery for 400 hate, with a hate tick.

<br />
400 hate is a sizable portion of the hate produced by such as Slow, which is rumored to be in the 700-900 hate area.<br />
<br />
The Hate over time is obviously to counter DOT aggro.<br />
<br />
And a GM can ALWAYS peel a MOB off of a Paladin - He just kills the Paladin. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murad</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed my logs since the taunt fail message has gone in. I've done strictly LDON adventures with an average party level of 63-65.<br />
<br />
Taunt Attempts -- 500<br />
Taunt Failures -- 207<br />
<br />
That's appproximately a 60% success rate (at least on blue con MOBS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt is pretty frustrating. I think at a 50% failure rate the mashers have a reasonable case.<br />
<br />
Incite is handy in quiet little exp groups. It's somewhat less useful in ldon, and almost completely useless on raids. I suppose this is all by design. <br />
<br />
I'm feeling a little underwhelmed, personally.<br />
<br />
I can't tell a thing about this mitigation bonus, and I suppose at a 3-4% clip I wouldn't. I still got 1 rounded and killed. /shrug<br />
<br />
Healing will is pretty useless.<br />
<br />
After incite and all the failed taunt messages, what I most notice about this patch is that my raid dps is reduced because of the pretty substantial nerfs to aggressive and precision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I must be the luckies sob out there.  I don't pull and I usually don't have a problem grabbing agro from the puller with incite and holding agro 90% of the time - either in raids or xp groups.  <br />
<br />
I'm much more effective tanking now because I can use Furious/Fortitude (often along with ae taunt) when things start to get out of control to give everyone 12 seconds to get mobs mez'd, peeps healed, etc.  <br />
<br />
Also, at least now I know when taunt fails on the mez'd mob so I know not to break mez yet.<br />
<br />
When I die I use healing will to save the healers some mana...not spectacular, but it helps.<br />
<br />
True, I'm not in uber situations...mainly ldon or tier 2/3, but I also don't have uber equipment or aa's either (7200 hp max buffed, 27 aa's.)<br />
<br />
It's not knight level agro (which I still think sucks from a game play perspective), but given the fact I can actually use disciplines other than defensive/evasive now, I think these changes are a big step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khiloor</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point it was trying to make was that i couldn't taunt a level 1 skelly in Everfrost.  Not really too sure how they're figuring out what can be taunted and not.  EQ's con'ing system is totally screwed to begin with (level 1 green = level 40 green).. but at least before the melee changes, i could taunt a level 1 mob in a noob area without failing.  <br />
<br />
Maybe they (SoE) should consider altering the way taunt functions based on level or something.  Instead of giving us a coin flip (heads you win / tails you loose), maybe they should base it on a percentage or a number.  ie.  i hint taunt, instead of failing i partially fail???  or at least give the failure some, albiet little, aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... I was seeing about a 40% sucess rate on taunt over the weekend (mix of blues and some reds and yellows) so while I am on the low end of the scale, I guess I'm in the ball park.<br />
<br />
*inc sidetrack* What I don't understand is the whining about Incite. Personally I love it: <br />
- it is ranged<br />
- it is some guaranteed hate<br />
- sure its &quot;only avail every 30 secs&quot; but thats still often enough to get a jump on mobs<br />
- as for its usefulness on raids, I can see its situational, but MTs and Offtanks will still want to use this puppy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I work in IT, and I had an experience one time where there was a process a user could do that required several minutes of processing before the task was complete. The users would complain to me that is was taking forever, and was there anything I could do to speed it up. <br />
<br />
Well, the first thing I noticed, was that there was no visible indication that anything was happening, so my first 'enhancement' was to add a progress bar to the process.<br />
<br />
Before I went any further, all of the users began to thank me profusely for speeding up the process. Simply adding a progress bar made the appearance of improvement of performance.<br />
<br />
This is just the reverse of this. We now know exactly how screwed up taunt was, and gives the appearance that it is worse than before. It was always hosed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree that this is worse than before.  It still succeeds just as often as it used to.  The fact that now everyone can see how often it fails means no more debates where some moron claims that his taunt works 90% of the time and he never has any aggro issues because he's uber.  Just because you got aggro does NOT mean taunt succeeded...  I get aggro through pure DPS and procs as often as I do through taunt.  I get aggro even more often through Incite.  And despite what others have said I still consider it more useful to use Incite on every single mob to give me the best chance of holding aggro early in each fight than to &quot;save my endurance&quot; and use disciplines that use half or more of my total endurance pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True - People never really thought about how often Taunt failed until the messages came trough. But I also think people overfocus on it, since it has been shown that a good weapon is STILL the main source of aggro from a warrior.<br />
<br />
The higher potential damage, the less problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Offcourse, if you are not in a raiding guild, forget all about good weapons ... which is kinda sad, since it splits the warriors in Ubers and non-Ubers to a point where even generic exp groups have valid reason to worry ebout non-Ubers.<br />
<br />
Incite have helped that some though, about time too if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

I'm amazed at how often taunt fails. Okay, I'm a level 56 and my taunt skill is 218. I would think I should get a whole lot of successes but I'm seeing an awfully lot of red. I don't like it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Incite on almost every mob too.  If your group can kill so fast that you need to use Incite fast enough to deplete your endurance, then they can take care of themselves if you don't Incite a mob every now and then to recover endurance.  For example if you could've killed a mob every 30 seconds, you can instead fight 2 at once and that gives you around a minute per mob (the other one is presumably offtanked by someone that is not you).  This is a more efficient approach to LDoN adventures anyway since mezzing takes up considerable resources (either limits number of songs bards can twist, or the upkeep for keeping Enchanters alive).  As for PoP, if you can kill a mob in 30 seconds, you would eventually run out of stuff to kill anyway.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, this is completely against how they always said taunt works.. Maybe we can get someone to elaborate and explain taunt again.</div></div><hr />

i did think that it could be that as the mob is slowed by the time its &quot;go&quot; is, the rouge/ranger had had time to once again out damage and get more agro than me in that time. <br />
But i have seen the same effect on an unslowed mob when im putting out pretty steady damage</div></div><hr />

So yes, it does suck.  It always has.<br />
<br />
As for incite, etc, I almost always use provoke to pull or on incoming.  I see no point in blowing Endurance on incite when the puller just tossed a rock at the bad guy.<br />
<br />
As for incite and hate over time, I find this much more handy now when I lose aggro and getting it back.  When someone (unless they are being a retard) ganks aggro off me it is usually a 'snap shot' and has instant aggro.  It is usually not too hard for me to get it back by simply droppin' ass down to the deck or hitting and getting a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed though is lots of warriors only picked up a few of their disciplines.  With the exception of maybe three, I bought them all and I actually use them now.  Before I only used defence and occasionally aggressive/felstrike when I wasn't tanking.  Now I have four or five that I use all the time.</div></div><hr />

Is it possible for taunt to be successful if the mob is already aggro on you?  <br />
<br />
I would also like to know this. Does taunt increase the Hate a mob has for you even if you currently have aggro? I recently had a  discussion with a more seasoned Warrior (Im lvl 55) about taunting continuously during a fight to &quot;Lock&quot; aggro. I was under the impression that pressing the taunt key when the mob was already hitting you was useless. Furthermore, if you do press taunt when mob is hitting you then for whatever reason the mob immediately runs to the slower/caster, then you no longer have the taunt key available cause it hasn't refreshed so you have to wait until it becomes available and then (based on what I have seen) it will likely fail. So you have essentially given the slower / caster a better chance of dying. <br />
<br />
I never claimed i was the all knowing and yes I am wrong at times and am always learning to play the warrior class better.  So, is it good practice to continuously mash the taunt key during a fight? The warrior I was talking to said yes you should ALWAYS hit the taunt key during a fight to maintain aggro. He mentioned this only after the chanter was getting aggro shortly after the mob was in camp. I pull with Bellow and usually only taunt when the mob's attention is focused on another group member. I dont believe Warriors can have complete aggro lock during a fight. Maybe they can maintain aggro more effectively when all group members help the tank keep aggro. I believe thats key.  <br />
<br />
Guess I can try and continuously hit the taunt key during a fight but would like to hear the replies from all you Veteran warriors who have tanked a wide variety of mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you couldn't.  You would still fail as much as you fail now, and if you say otherwise, you need to have logs to back it up.  I've seen zero evidence that the success rate for taunt has been changed...what we've gotten is a utility that makes it a bit easier to do our jobs.<br />
<br />
Edit:  In reference to successful taunts not giving you aggro...search is your friend (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1811)<br />
<br />
Edit again:  It's long been accepted that mashing taunt is the wrong way to go about it, since our testing didn't show any absolute aggro increase per successful taunt, but a fluctuating increase based on your position on the hate list.  I'd say that's still the case, so don't mash.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kulmar</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A successful taunt places you 1 point above everyone else on the agro list, thats all it does so .....<br />
<br />
Use taunt/incite to regain agro when you lose it.  For example:<br />
<br />
1) Attack bad thing<br />
2) Lose agro to slower<br />
3) Taunt until success<br />
4) Immediately incite placing yourself 401 points higher than everyone else on the list.<br />
5) Rely on standard agro to maintain agro for 30 seconds, lather, rinse, repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
I believe this was SoE's intent for the discipline and the reason they added the fail message for the taunt skill.<br />
<br />
Keeping this pattern in mind, my ability to hold agro since has greatly improved.</div></div><hr />

I said to someone in TSW chat today, &quot;Being in the elemental planes doesn't make you a good warrior,&quot; and neither do levels, AAs, gear, titles, etc. The only thing that will make you a better warrior is understanding.<br />

<br />
I have seen the exact same thing...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is completely against how they always said taunt works.. Maybe we can get someone to elaborate and explain taunt again.  <br />
<br />
Well, I'm WIZ and not WAR, but it seems to me that above thing is exactly like they always said taunt works, at least according to post in your Library (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=32130#post32130) <br />
<br />
What they say there is that your Total hate has two parts:<br />
<br />
Total_Hate = Hate + Hate_Bonus<br />
<br />
Hate part is one that you get by meleeing or casting spells, or using Taunt. Hate bonus is part that you get by being first one to pull mob (First contact aggro, Bi), or sitting etc...<br />
<br />
What they showed in that post is that you will need always 4 successful taunts to get aggro from person if that person was one who first aggroed/pulled mob. But if person who has most aggro at time you are doing taunt is not one who first aggroed/pulled mob, then only one successful taunt is enough.<br />
<br />
Although that post in your Library was started and maybe even ended before latest taunt changes, in my recent tests for wizard aggro (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=275928#post275928)  I also tested taunt, and it appears to behave still as it did before. I also found numerical values for Bi and Ti. More specifically:<br />
<br />
a) you still need exactly 4 successful taunts to get aggro from initial puller<br />
b) value for initial aggro Bi is around 100<br />
c) therefore value added for successful taunt is between 25 and 33, lets say Ti=30<br />
<br />
<br />
Few examples:<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
1) SK pulls mob and start tanking it. After he stop, aggro is like:<br />
Total_SK_Aggro= SK_Tank_aggro + 100(pull)<br />
Total_WAR_Aggro= 0 + 0<br />
<br />
War 1st succ. Taunt:  Total_WAR_Aggro= ( SK_Tank_aggro + 30) +0  -&gt; mob still ok SK<br />
War 2nd succ. Taunt:  Total_WAR_Aggro= ( SK_Tank_aggro + 60) +0  -&gt; mob still ok SK<br />
War 3rd succ. Taunt:  Total_WAR_Aggro= ( SK_Tank_aggro + 90) +0  -&gt; mob still ok SK<br />
War 4th succ. Taunt:  Total_WAR_Aggro= ( SK_Tank_aggro + 120) +0  ==&gt; mob turned to WAR !<br />
<br />
<br />
2) WAR pulls mob and SK start tanking it. After he stop, aggro is like:<br />
Total_SK_Aggro= SK_Tank_aggro + 0<br />
Total_WAR_Aggro= 0 + 100(pull)<br />
<br />
War 1st succ. Taunt:  Total_WAR_Aggro= ( SK_Tank_aggro + 30) + 100  =&gt; mob immediatelly turn on WAR !<br />
<br />
<br />
3) MNK pulls mob and SK start tanking it. After he stop, aggro is like:<br />
Total_SK_Aggro= SK_Tank_aggro + 0<br />
Total_MNK_Aggro= 0 + 100(pull)<br />
Total_WAR_Aggro= 0 + 0<br />
<br />
War 1st succ. Taunt:  Total_WAR_Aggro= ( SK_Tank_aggro + 30) + 0  =&gt; mob immediatelly turn on WAR !<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, there are regular situations where you need 4 successful taunts to get aggro, although usually you will need only one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kulmar</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, no, you won't need 4 succesful taiunts to grab agro from the puller.  Taunt has nothing to do with agro, it affects your position on the hate list, placing you 1 point above who ever is highest on the list.  I have stepped into a fight from being afk, had the party burn the mob down to 30 percent health, taunt, incite, and I have the agro the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
I gain agro every time on a succesful taunt.  Lemme repeat the key phrase here .... Every Time.  The problem is that on a succesful taunt, you are ONLY 1 point above the next person, so if that person then nukes, or has dot'd, or out melees you, or debuffs etc. you will immediately lose agro.  Sometimes this happens so fast that the graphics engine doesn't render the mob facing you at all.<br />
<br />
I have done this over and over and over and over and can guarantee this is the case.<br />
<br />
So, taunt to regain agro, incite to stay above the rest of the folks and you will hold agro against any player who understands the basics of agro management.</div></div><hr />

Well, all tests indicate that taunt do not 'place you on top of hate list' but instead change you hate value ... but not your HateBonus value. <br />

Yes, that is usual situation, and that is similar to examples #2 and #3 that I posted few lines above...where SK tank and gain (Big) aggro, and then you can take that aggro with just one successful taunt.  It is example #1 that is special case, when person who has most aggro at moment of taunt happens to be one who pulled.<br />

<br />
Actually, this '1 point' is repeatedly mentioned, but even on that  post in Library on this board it is recognised that it is not exactly '1 point' but is some small value.<br />
<br />
What I managed to do with my tests hopefully (in addition to verifying that taunt still works as posted in your library thread) is to find values both for first contact puller aggro (100 points) and for that 'ONLY 1' value (Ti), which appears to be 30 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaruk</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On those taunt tests that were done, each time the warrior was not attacking the mob.  Now, it seems reasonable to me to conclude that the code would be written in such a way that a warrior cursing a mob, but not physically damaging it, would have a more ineffective taunt than a warrior both taunting AND attacking a mob.   I say this because I have successfully single-taunted pulls numerous times in my experience.<br />
<br />
Now, concerning taunt and incite, I've noticed that if I incite a mob before the slow hits it, my taunts tend to be more successful.  This leads me to suspect that taunt success is a funtion of how low you are on the hate list, i.e. if I'm at the bottom of the hate list, and a slower has 700 hate over me, my taunt will be less successful than it I'm somewhere in the middle of the hate list (say at 400 after an incite) trying to taunt a mob off a slower who stands at 700 hate.  I'd like to see someone do some tests on this myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nenad</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm.. I didnt see any mentioning about taunt being more effective if war is attacking , but its interesting idea.<br />
<br />
Although I believe it is more due to you simply making enough melee damage after taunt to turn mob to you .  I said that puller aggro is small, 100 points. I'm not exactly expert on how much aggro produce warrior melee, but someone mentioned its 1 aggro point for 1 damage, and I believe normal lvl 65 war melee round does more than 100?  <br />
<br />
So your first melee round after taunt will be enough to overcome those 100 points from puller. But in that case previous taunt teory still holds, only warrior attacking mob will almost certainly turn mob after one taunt and one melee round.</div></div><hr />
