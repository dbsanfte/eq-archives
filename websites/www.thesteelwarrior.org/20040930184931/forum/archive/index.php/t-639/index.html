<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive heard the new maestro is badass - quad 1100, lifetaps for 1500 and red to a 65. <br />
<br />
anyone know if they changed theway to get the hand?seems a bit unfair to go up against a mob like this now for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Guild fought Stro last night.  Immune to slow, cripple, snare, root.  Reportedly fire nukes were working, magic was completely resisted and no idea on cold.  For the most part only spells that are almost unresistable were landing.  Undead dots and procs were working.  Yes he had fairly good DPS but procs for 1500 lifetap were the killer... at one point he proced 6 times in 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
  I will repost what I find out from the next encounter when we own him and get our pay back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hand spawns in a room before the Maestro's room. He may still spawn a hand upon his death, but I don't know. The hand that spawns in the seperate room, wasn't too hard and not having to kill the new Maestro for our epic piece is nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On the 3 hate raids i was in recently, hand was up even if Maestro wasn't up, or before he was killed. It seems like the hand and the maestro have nothing to do with eachother now, he got tired of being killed for the hand so he just cut off a hand every time he was reborn and threw it out for people to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hand is red to me at lvl 55<br />
hits for upto 400 with 1100 ac<br />
enrages<br />
has 175 pt AE lifetap that it uses frequently.<br />
<br />
Can be up with or without the Maestro.. IS in a different room. was solo pulled by 56 monk with No adds.<br />
Not sure of respawn rate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just ganked hand tonight.  He didn't enrage for us, though he did rampage, his max hit was around 400ish, and he did do a 175pt lifetap a lot (I don't know if it was AE or not, but it was going off on me just about every time he landed a melee hit).<br />
<br />
Just backing up most of what Elroy said, though for us he Rampaged instead of Enraged, and I am not sure if his lifetap was AE or just melee proc.  My chanter friend didn't notice his lifetap at all, my groups HP weren't falling very fast, but the druid who was with us made comment about his lifetap being AE, so I can't say much meaningful about that =P.<br />
<br />
I can confirm (just another person saying it =p) that hand can be up without Maestro, as we saw hand up, then later maestro popped, we pulled hand a bit after that.<br />
<br />
EDIT: no smaller hand popped when we killed the large hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It could possibly be Rampaged...im always getting the two confused. :/  my bad...<br />
<br />
the Life tap was noticed by my healers (cleric and Druid).  Pretty much all in close range.  I cannot comment on how large the range is, as we were all fighinting in the room directly across from the maestro house.  I think everyone in our group commented on getting some AE.  <br />
I couldnot tell if it was proc or cast either...Beer + EQ = Fun with memory loss : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">sounding like a small range AE lifetap then.  Cause your casters noticed it and at least the druid that was with me noticed it as well =P.</div></div><hr />
