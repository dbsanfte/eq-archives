<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Piemapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya all,<br />
<br />
Ok I started an Ogre Warrior  on TP about a month back named Pietrunk who is lvl 29 now. When I did a friend of mine on that server (no I am not gonna tell you the name) gave me about 10kpp and a couple of UBER items for my warrior/shamman box combo. I had to buy all the gear on my warrior the two items that were given to me were for my shammy. N-E-Way back to the subject at hand.<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out what I should be looking for as upgrades in the near future. I only have about 1.8 k though atm. <br />
<br />
Right now his stats are:<br />
str   221<br />
sta  255<br />
agi  75<br />
dex 63<br />
wis 67<br />
int  67<br />
cha 1 -grins- actually -9 if the game would let ya go in the negs<br />
<br />
1488 HP<br />
623   AC<br />
726   atk<br />
This is what he has on atm:<br />
Full suit of Crusty <br />
Vellium fire Wedding rings both fingers<br />
Orc Fang earrings in each ear<br />
Chipped Vellium amulet - neck<br />
Tribal War Mask - face<br />
Crested Paulders - shoulders<br />
General Coterie Cape - back<br />
Dragon Hide Belt - waist<br />
<br />
He is also wielding:<br />
Centi SS - pri<br />
Lammy - sec<br />
and just a plain jane elm recurve bow<br />
<br />
This is my first warrior so not sure what I need to worry about on a warrior besides HP, and Str so I just tried to get as close to max in those two stats as I could. Ogre's are just too easy to max STA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haste item and levels.<br />
<br />
2 cheap haste items are Flowing Black Silk Sash (waist 21%) and Silver Chitin Handwraps (gloves 22%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't say what kinda helm you got, so i'm assuming you got a Crusty helm.<br />
<br />
Trash that Crusty helm and get a Skull-Shaped Barbute.  That should do you to your upper 40's or until you can wear a Helm of Raldakan or get a Thurg / Skyshrine drop or MQ.<br />
<br />
Definately get a haste item. FBSS, SCHW, or SoDB should do you for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piemapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aye full suit of crusty included helm. You know I didn't even think of haste. I thought it would be well outta my price range of 1.8k. hmm will have to check the bazaar prices on those three items. <br />
<br />
Will also have too look up that helm. I just got the crusty one because someone was sellin a full suit of crusty for like 1.2k ty guys for your advice. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah and the lvl's are commin haven't tried groupin my boxed shammy and warrior yet. I still am getting used to the combo a bit. Gonna wait until after shammy is 29 and warrior is prolly 31 before I go too OT and try groupin the two. <br />
<br />
Thank you guys for the suggestions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're going to want to switch those weapons around I think. Both are about the same ratio, so put the faster weapon in primary. And don't neglect skilling up with other weapon types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lammy goes in primary.<br />
<br />
get centi longsword for secondary.<br />
<br />
start upgrading to Crafted armor as you get money. But don't make it a priority. (i.e. framing plat without making xp)<br />
<br />
<br />
A L50 Warrior in full crusty flat out owns a L30 twink.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't worry too much about equip, your should be fine till L50 with the armor you got.<br />
<br />
Also, try to pick up an Argent Protector (2hs), Blood Point (piercing), Stormwood Battlestaff (2hb).<br />
<br />
Try to get into some groups with a Pally or SK. At L30-ish, there's not much of a difference in hitpoints, and generally the knights end up tanking. Use this to your advantage and build all your weapon skills. I used to equip whatever weapon i had the lowest skill in each time i started a session.<br />
<br />
Post L60 is when you'll really be appreciated, so don't let those knights get ya down, I'm running into more and more situations where they make me tank instead of the knights. <br />
<br />
Your on the right track, just put that damn lammy in your PRI! &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Also, a note on duel wielding. Delay has no effect in the offhand. A &quot;duel wield check&quot; is rolled each time your primary weapon is used. So you want that primary weapon swinging as fast as you can, so you'll get more chances at a successful duel wield.<br />
<br />
Work those 2handed stats! They are extremely important, because when you end up tanking PoP mobs, slow (but HIGH damage) 2 handed weapons means the mob won't riposte on you (for 500+ damage) as much. Duel wielding means you theoretically could catch 4 of those per round! Currently one of the best purchasable 2h weapons is the Greatstaff of Thunder. Who know's what LDoN will bring. So keep all them stats maxed. Don't be afraid to use the trainers. Most L60+ ppl have 100 training points just sitting there unused.</div></div><hr />
