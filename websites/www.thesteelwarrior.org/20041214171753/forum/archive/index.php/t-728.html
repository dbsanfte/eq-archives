<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaran</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, <br />
<br />
Started talking about this in serverwide last night so thought i'd post here about it.<br />
<br />
The question was, which is better Combat Stability 2 or LR 1, but in general its Stability over Agility.<br />
<br />
It would apper that which one is better to have is totally dependant on the mobs which your fighting DB and DI (which i dont really understand because never read many of those posts)<br />
<br />
Obviously u wanna get both but u have to get one first so which is the best to get. Not just looking at raid mobs but at typical grind mobs in BoT/Cod and the elemental planes (since those zones are where i normally grind).<br />
<br />
<br />
So i'll pass this over to the log phazer type ppls who understand all this stuff :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LR 5 &gt; CS 2, imo.<br />
<br />
But eh, someone who actually has those AAs will be along shortly to probably give a much better opinion on it than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually had LR 5 before CS 2.<br />
Worked very well for me although i have to admit i am usually only number 2 tank when we do major encounters but that is mostly due to a 100 AA lead of our MA(doesnt have a life :P) but not on a major agro or hp advantage(tanked Emperor for 80 percent of his hp bar - MA went down when he became alive - and died 18 seconds before defensive was up again).<br />
But it is hard to compare unless you have 2 identical warriors with same gear, tanking same mobs and one going mitigation first and the other avoidance first.<br />
Avoidance first worked for me, but it might be mitigation for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just don't get that with mitigation (stability).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaran</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mobs dont proc a 5k lifetap in grind groups...<br />
<br />
Cant think of any raid mob that procs a 5k lifetap either<br />
<br />
And in a emperor fight the ability of a tank survive depends on the clerics not the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaran</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but what was mentioned last night was pre pop mitation wasnt so big due to mobs not hitting that hard having only small variations in damage, with pop and the bigger variations in damage the mitation may be more beneficial.</div></div><hr />

Since when does a swing have to connect for a proc to go off? ;)<br />
<br />
But on the original topic, both are good.  Most of the experienced posts I've read(granted, mostly on the SK boards) put CA and CS as reducing damage taken by roughly the same amount, and that &quot;seems&quot; to be the case.  I don't parse enough to have noticed the specifics like that, though.  I can say that CS2 is a larger percentage increase than LR1, so I think you will end up getting more benefit for the points spent that way.  I could easily be wrong, though.<br />
<br />
I personally went avoidance first because of spells.  It's a lot harder to be interrupted when the mob doesn't hit you as often, which can be a lifesaver if you're a spell-based feign puller :)<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and Galdaran... in case you were curious, some of the mobs in the Carprin&gt;High Priest cycle in CoD proc 5kish lifetaps, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mathas, mobs have NEVER procced on a miss.  Players can, but NPCs cannot.  That is how it has always been... at least as long as I can remember.<br />
<br />
Oh, an it's great to see another Bbane person on steelwarrior :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathas</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would explain it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i went with wat i felt i needed. i was getting pounded because of low ac. so i went avoidence route. the true path does not exist you must chose a fork to travel and know that both will take you to the same place through different routes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went with LR5 before getting ID1, had both CS/CA 3 before PoP came out. I think avoidance is much better in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macbrother</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, LR5 is &gt; CS2 in that you can reduce procs, but LR5 also costs 15 points as opposed to CS2 costing 6 points.<br />
<br />
Get the most bang for your buck as quick as you can, imo.  That would put you getting CA3 &gt; CS3 &gt; LR5 &gt; ID5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slagfest</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can avoid a mob's innate proc but not its weapon proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jear</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personaly I belive a good tank should take a steady amount of damage over time aka in my eyes CS is better due to the fact a tank who takes a constant amount of damage over time (CS / ID) is easier to heal then a tank who takes swinging damage over time (CA / LR) <br />
It is much like Evasive contra defensive for me. Defensive is mostly used due to the constant amount of damage suffert where as Evasive is swinging more wildly if you like at it. <br />
As for procs a mobs inate proc needs to hit you to proc. where weapon procs just need to swing aka makes Evasive good against proccing mobs.<br />
<br />
well just my 2cp here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in Carprin event in CoD proc a 5k lifetap, it sucks to tank. Raex is one of them, cant remember the other guys name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to LR vs ID, Sscaley did a huge parse that strongly suggested that they reduced melee damage received by about the same amount.<br />
<br />
In regards to CS3 vs ID5, CS3 will generally reduce melee damage received by a greater amount then LR5 and the *cost* of CS3 (12) is less then LR5 (15).<br />
<br />
Once I had both CS3 and CA3, similar to Mathias, I also went the LR route over the ID route, but that really boiiled down to spell casting, as they are believed to reduce melee damage received by approx the same amount, but I now have the (not huge, but advantageous) benefit of avoiding hits and still getting spells off.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, you truly want to get both.  I believe you would be splitting hairs to try and argue that one is inheritly better then another.<br />
<br />
By that same school of thought, however, it never ceases to /boggle me how many tank classes go *all out* to get LR5 and then ignore ID and sometimes even CS!!  That is just plain silly.  These skills are damn near equivalents in terms of reducing melee damage received, with the CS/CA group being superior to the ID/LR group.  <br />
<br />
Dont ignore them--you want BOTH<br />
