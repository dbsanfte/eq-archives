<br />
Now that SOE has made the statement that in the July 8th patch we will be able to remove augs. (Wheeeeeeee) Does anyone know what will be involved? I have heard rumors that you will need a melding stone that only drops in GoD zones. I have heard 100pp solvents and 1000pp sovlents. I am willing pay 100pp to drop a aug but I really don't like the idea of having to get stones from a GoD zone, even if they are tradeable they will sell for way too high in the bazaar. So if anyone has any knowledge of how this will happen please let us know...or even if you have heard other rumors. Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistiv</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They haven't announced it yet but at the guild summit someone suggest 20kp for a price and they said they had enough plat sinks at the moment so wouldnt need to be that high.  That's a fact anyways on to rumors.<br />
<br />
Rumor 1) only dropped augs can be reused.<br />
Rumor 2) wee i only have one!<br />
<br />
<br />
If you need a meld stone to remove an aug that isnt that big of a deal since they are droppable and can get 5-10 in 2 hours of exping so they will be in bazaar soon enough. Their current use is for qvic armor btw.</div></div><hr />

Asking a level 30 character to obtain a GoD item so they can save a STA aug or something similar is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Going along with the spirit of LDoN adventures, why not do a level-appropriate quest for the Wayfarers in which the reward is the material necessary to remove the aug?</div></div><hr />

Restricting things like that and making them too hard to get will be the functional equivalent of making it impossible for some players.  If that trend continues, the largest chunk of their players will move on as soon as a viable alternative presents itself.  A lot of them already are.</div></div><hr />

I also think making me adventure for 1492 points to get a single +40 hit point any slot aug is ridiculous. if someone else wants to do the leg work and sell it to me at a hugely inflated price that I will pay so be it.<br />
I just spent all the points I had saved since I started doing LDoN's ( 1.5 years work ) and all I got was a Bracer and a couple of anger augs.<br />

You can tell the people who farmed GoD/grinded out LDoN's vs the person who just sits in PoE all day.  Even if it isn't hard to do a bunch of normals over and over to me at least it shows putting more effort into your equipment which I think it would be lame to take away by having the biggest pp buyers getting twinked out with augs.</div></div><hr />

Hmm. Type 8 (raid) augs can be obtain in LDoN raids, which, strangely enough, are geared towards VT geared players, at a minimum.<br />
<br />
While it's nice that the high end peeps get their voices heard for change, but when/if the change is exclusive to them... hell with that.<br />

At that point don't bother. Screw us equally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they do this it will tick off enough people to cause an outrage as far as I am concerned. That requirement can only be targeted at the high end raiders and I thought they were going to be helping the casual gamer. Well that will not be of any help to me or any other casual gamer. This will put the final nail in LDON's coffin.<br />
<br />
I hope they understand that if they let it be somewhat easy(100pp) they can breath new life into LDON with that one move. It is getting harder and harder to find LDON groups these days. Well lets hope they listen and read these forums.</div></div><hr />

Let's hope they don't do something stupid like make aug removal extremely difficult or expensive, or worse yet, make it require GoD.<br />
<br />
For now I'll stick to the positive, that I should be able to reuse augs in the future, that is a positive change.  If they screw it up...  Well WoW is right around the corner.  I'm really looking forward to trying out WoW, but I would be surprised if it took me away from EQ.</div></div><hr />

Being able to remove augs SHOULD cost people something. I can't believe the amount of crap about the &quot;price being too high&quot;. I really liked the idea that was aired some time back about having the choice, based on the solvent type, of losing the aug or losing the item.<br />
<br />
And as far as the time involved in getting the 1150 pts for a 40hp aug, its scale. Why should Joe Casual be able to obtain something in less time than Joe Raider? For the first time since Velious, the casual people have been granted an avenue to improve without raiding and people want to bitch about the time it takes. Jesus, what stupidity. If you want the massive upgrades in one big shot, then join a raiding guild and get in line (you won't get the first drop and you won't get a drop a night). If not, then set your goal and work at it: its what everyone else does, because even (or especiallY) in EQ instant gratification does not exist.</div></div><hr />

Heck, make it a quest that requires zero fighting so level 21s can do it if they choose to.  Let's instance it if possible so we don't have camp wars.<br />
<br />
Now, quest done, you combine SAPM with the item and an appropriate solvent (say 50-500pp, depending on slot and sold by the Maguses) and whammo.  Make type 1-4s 50pp, type 7s (LDoN dropped) 100pp and 8s (or bought 7s and GoD augs) 500pp.  Reasonable but not silly.  You might keep that stam aug then and would probably reuse any bought augment at the least.  A bit of a cash sink but nothing insane.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that removing augment should cost a little bit of adv. pts sacling with the cost of the augment we want to get back.<br />
so making the meldstone vendor byable with adv. pts and a solvent from tradeskills.<br />
then scaling the different level of quality to adjust the cost.<br />
ex: if we want to remove (wouthout loosing ,) ) an augment that cost  &lt;50&lt;100&lt;200&lt;400&lt;700&lt;1000&lt;1400&lt;2000 adv. pts<br />
we have to by a appropriate quality meldstone for 5&lt;11&lt;24&lt;52&lt;98&lt;150&lt;224&lt;340 adv. pts<br />
and a solvent that we can get in different quality for 5pp&lt;15&lt;30&lt;70&lt;140&lt;230&lt;360&lt;580pp<br />
thus would still need to return hinting for adv. pts (but not that mush comparing to get a new one) and a cheap amont of pp.<br />
<br />
fell free to adjuste the cost / step numbers and gaps / ... / anything</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Who the hell gets a drop a night from LDoN AP? 1150 (kind of minimum for most decent augs/items) / 51AP (or Hard for that matter) x 45 min (capped minimum and not realistic even on Easy to maintain for whole time but what the hell) = about 18 hrs or 3-6 raids. Ok its &quot;guaranteed&quot; drop but the quantity of stuff out that there that is worth a shit can be listed on one hand. In fact equipment wise there is only one choice per class per slot that is worth anything (i.e. that someone should aspire to) to all but the most gimped bazaar character.<br />
<br />
Typical Joe Raider talk... and Joe Raider needs to realize that Joe Casual cant and often wont compete with him anyways and sure as hell not in Tier 4+ so what the hell are you bitching/worrying about. Just cause u cant get decent (for the level) drops in reasonable time then no one can? Keep it up and there you wont have to worry about Joe Casual cause he will be playing another game and you will have 15 Time+ guilds on one server cause SOE will consolidate the servers to save money....<br />
<br />
And yeah thats a DBotW and my warrior was bought. I personify the wont from above because I CAN'T raid (family, work, life in general) and I bet I play as much as most raiders (30+ hrs a week minimum and its all timing). This Joe Casual (under the above definition not mine) wants decent chances to upgrade my twinks and flush out my other guys.<br />
<br />
We all have a right to have fun and I am all for ways to make raiding a less of a grind, but I half think that raiders like it that way cause it automatically excludes guys like me. Remember that being Joe Raider is a choice, and that for some of us being Joe Casual is not (assuming i dont want to get divorced, lose my good paying job, see my kids grow up to ruin this country, etc).<br />
<br />
Ultimately we all need to be rewarded (with appropriate type stuff) for our efforts or we will likely leave the game (at least excluding the social aspect which helps them keep people as well). Funny you never see raiders suggest ways to make raiding &quot;better' (other than to fix the bugs), all you do is see them bitch about Joe Casual.<br />

Removing of augments and keeping them may go in the next update.  I will not be revealing how it works until it is on Test.  However, thanks for your ideas and feedback on the topic.<br />
 <br />
Selling back of any adventure items for adventure points (including augments) is not currently planned to go live.  It is in a discussion stage.<br />

Lastly,  we will not be posting every planned change, sorry.  I will have a list of what we expect to be in the July 8th update posted in the next couple of days and it will include some very fun and exciting stuff, but we will not be detailing every change we have planned for this update and subsequent updates.  <br />

<br />
I think that if they make it so you need a drop from GoD, any drop, even the smallest NODROP thing from the greenest of mobs, is screwed up, simply because, its another expansion and the buying / selling of augments for points is something that came out with LDoN, so I shouldn't have to buy GoD just to do something that is merely focused on LDoN and has nothing to do with GoD. Ok, augments drop in GoD too, but as far as I know, they are type 7/8 (so, you dont need LDoN to use em), make the whatever solvent for type 7/8 obtainable by both GoD and LDoN owners if you want, but dont come and tell me I have to buy GoD (which I didnt btw, not gonna spend the money to go to 3-4 zones) to use my banked (on banked gear) augments or reuse the ones I have due to upgrades.</div></div><hr />

No one disputes that. What many of the old timers are maintaining is that doesn't mean your time is more valuable than ours. Some of us have spent up to 5 years collecting one armour set and then moving up to the next. Its called progression. You probably haven't expericed it yourself. You explore the zones at your level, collect the drops and move on.<br />
<br />
I have real issues with the tools that want some sort of refund for their time invested for LDON: why shouldn't a BoT farmer in his ornate have the same options once he upgrades past his gear? Why shouldn't someone who has farmed Hate or the Velious sets able to get a &quot;refund&quot; on his or her time?

I also think making me adventure for 1492 points to get a single +40 hit point any slot aug is ridiculous. if someone else wants to do the leg work and sell it to me at a hugely inflated price that I will pay so be it.<br />
I just spent all the points I had saved since I started doing LDoN's ( 1.5 years work ) and all I got was a Bracer and a couple of anger augs.<br />
Ridiculous<br />

<br />
It took me long to get my SS BP back then, and I was so proud of it (I still use it hehe), but dont tell me someone in BoT spends the same time to get an armor drop than someone in LDoN, because that's simply not true. Of course, the nameds have a chance of dropping or not dropping it, but it's one single kill, if you have a group of friends you just go there and keep killing nameds (it doesnt even have to be the bosses on 6hr timers, ornate gaunts and bracers drop off easy minis), that pop every ~7 mins more or less, on the contrary, you have to spend 30 Normal lvl65 adventures x 45-60min (depending on the group) to get a 1492 piece of armor, and in that hour (that means 1 adventure out of 30), you could have killed almost 10 named spawns. The LDoN armor has better stats than ornate (most of it), but it's still much more work than camping BoT, that's for sure. Besides, you can buy Ornate, you can MQ Velious armor, so that's prolly why it's hard to refund that, because you might have just spent RL cash to buy it, no camp, no time sink, nothing, on the other hand, LDoN is a sure time sink.</div></div><hr />

This was posted in another Forum here.  Guess this is the dev's answer for the time being.<br />
<br />
Q: Any updates on augment removal?<br />
A: &quot;The base system will be on Test today. Which features a new window when you click on the Augmentation Sealer world container. The functionality to remove augments using new solvents is in, however you may not be able to get the new solvents just yet. Design is still finalizing that process. In addition to this, the process to delete augments has changed slightly. You don't need a specific solvent and you delete the augment you want by selecting the slot.<br />
<br />
Btw, the augment refund guy will be removed. This won't be a way to get refunds for all your unwanted augments. <br />
<br />
The price for the solvents is going to scale based on the value of the augment. &quot;<br />
<br />
IMO it's stupid to not be able to sell back your augs for at LEAST a partial refund.</div></div><hr />

we really need to have the ability to flip an aug from type 7 to type 8 or even get a refund of some kind. honestly, why make em removable if they are not truly reusable?<br />

- Augment Buy Back System:<br />
<br />
Players can now sell LDoN items back to adventure merchants and receive half of the points they spent (rounded up). <br />

The Adventure Merchant Window now contains a &quot;Sell&quot; button, which is used similarly to the Sell button with regular merchants -- <br />

Really hoping for that 7-8 converter as well, but selling the type 7s back for half points is better than nothing.  Since they put in the ability to remove them though, it's kinda silly to make people buy the exact same augment they already have sitting in the bank, just because they got a piece of time+ gear.<br />
<br />
I think I understand the reason behind type 8 augs, they don't want people putting uber augments in crap gear I guess?  but why not make type 8 slots type 7/8 and get rid of the need for duplicating things like anger procs and hp/ac augments.</div></div><hr />

class all<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorereaper</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, I don't see the need to even have solvents for aug removal. When it comes right down to it, augs are no drop items, you have to earn or win them to have them... Why make them no drop and make it a requirement to either use a solvent and destroy them just to make a piece of equipment tradeable again, or even make it a requirement to have a solvent to remove them and still keep the aug... They are no drop items.. can't be traded, can't be sold... It seems to me that a player should have the ability to just remove the aug and then use it with another item simply because in that case the aug would still be useable only on items in the possesion of the original owner of the augment. Well, that's my opinion anyway, people may not agree with me, and I think it's good that augs are no drop, but it takes much of the fun out of the experience for me anyway when you have to deal with yet another tedious process requiring yet more platinum to be spent on an augment that you can't even buy or sell in the first place... And really... what exactly is fun, challenging, or enjoyable about that anyway, it's just a pain, and I know people have to be complaining about it or SOE wouldn't be considering implementing some kind of change in the first place. The biggest problem I have with the solvents is that they are required to be used with an item that is already no drop. I see that as basically heaping on the restrictions for an item that you can't just go to some vendor and buy or pick up from a trader in the bazaar and it seems to be a bit excessive to me. I would just be interested in some opinions on my particular outlook here, does anyone else feel this way?</div></div><hr />

This is just something that has been asked for. There is no mention of this or any converter on the test server.  I think it has just been asked for here and we can hope they will hear us. But again this is not on test or anywhere else, sorry guys.</div></div><hr />
