<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nyyhte</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am currently using a seawind necklace which give me +15 dex which puts my dex at 103, my str is 163 sta is 109 ac 907. My questions is should I trade my necklace for something more useful or is getting my dex over 100 worth it. Cash flow is a problem so I would have to trade the necklace for something else? (suggestions on what to trade for would be appreciated)</div></div><hr />

glimmering mithril torque shouldn't be more than 100-300pp or so..15AC will do more for ya methinks than 15 dex.<br />
sentry collar...got some decent AC + agility ( i think, been a while since i saw one ) ... prob in the 100pp price range as well.<br />
<br />
Dex is about one of them most ambiguous stats there are; i have yet to see any hard numbers showing a significant ratio of increased anything except tradeskilling by having high dex for a warrior that is<br />
<br />
Rangers..i think they're better with a bow ( ranged attack )...and that i'm not 100% sure of.</div></div><hr />

these parses show that high dex significantly affect:<br />

-critical hits</div></div><hr />

I have heard that there is a big difference as related to getting over 100, which is what my +15 necklace is doing for me. I suspect however that I may benefit more tho from an increase in ac/str/sta as I am a relative newb as can be seen from my stats, which is why I asked this question in the first place. More input and thoughts would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Screw DEX, it will NEVER keep you alive. More HP/STA with AC a distant third is what you need right now. By the time you get to the level where you are really interested in proc rates, your gear should be plenty ot get you DEX to a reasonable level. You might try to trade for a tracking wolf collar or a clattering bone necklace.</div></div><hr />

Dex is not something we worry about...period. As wandor stated, by the time we are it isnt' an issue anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are a few thoughts that might help you compare different pieces of gear.<br />
<br />
Extra procs/crits from high dex is a good thing.  But compared to HP/AC it is nothing.<br />
<br />
If your choice is between two items:<br />
<br />
a) 10ac, 15 HP<br />
<br />
b) 10ac, 15 HP, 15 dex<br />
<br />
Then sure... grab item B and be happy that you got a dex bump that might net you an extra crit from time to time.<br />
<br />
But if another item gets tossed into the mix...<br />
<br />
c) 12ac, 15 HP<br />
<br />
Then item C is the winner.  HP and AC are always more important than dex.<br />
<br />
The only time that it should be hard to judge the gear is when one has a high ac, and the other has high HPs.  In that case, a generally accepted rule of thumb is 6hp = 1 ac for comparing.<br />
<br />
Stamina and agility are really the only stats that come into play, until they are capped.  All other stats are &quot;nice to have&quot; but don't really matter.<br />
<br />
Stamina = HPs.<br />
<br />
Agility:  If your agility is less than 75 you take a huge ac hit.  So if your agility is under 75, it is very important to raise it.<br />
<br />
But once it is over 75, you can pretty much count on 5 agility = 1 ac.<br />
<br />
Resists are a separate subject.  Usually people carry a separate set of gear for special encounters when resists are important.  At your stage in the game I wouldn't worry about resists yet.  As you progress they will eventually become important, but by then you'll have a better idea of what you can and can't trade off to get them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakanzzar</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say I've noticed a big difference in my proc/crit rate recently as I've dropped my dex from just over 200 (with food) to 166. I did this because it seemed prudent to swap out my Rage ear (+15 dex, no sta) with a BM ear and my putrid belt (+10 dex+others) with a heavy rubicite belt.<br />
<br />
However, I am more tha happy with the extra sta and hps (specially being a fragile little DE :) )<br />
