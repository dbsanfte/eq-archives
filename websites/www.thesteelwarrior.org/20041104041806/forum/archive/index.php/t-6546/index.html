<br />
I just found this site and figured I could get some great ideas from the community for how to upgrade my gear! Well I am just about broke only 2k in the bank (blew a chunk on the reinforced sand blade and the Re'tek was only 50pp I am sure it was a misprice). So all ideas are welcome but it is going to take me a while to get the items I am sure. Especially since I am not guilded at this time. <br />

I just made a magelo so I could find out what you all think. Please any advice is welcome. Since I am always the lowest HP and AC in groups compared to other tanks. Hey thanks again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here are a few options that shouldn't be too expensive..<br />
<br />
Head: Skull-shaped Barbute<br />
Finger: Sell the haste ring, get a FBSS. Replace with Velium Fire Wedding Ring<br />
Wrist: Might look into Crustacean Shell<br />
Arms: Crustacean Shell<br />
Waist: See above, get FBSS<br />
Feet: Crustacean Shell<br />
<br />
The sand weapon is nice. Try for a Frostbringer to use in the other hand, or for a cheaper option, the Black Blade of Tormenting. While the Re'Stek has a solid ratio, the aggro isn't there without a proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">get a new earring 2 ac 35hp<br />
get new boots with hp<br />
get two rings w/ 65 hp<br />
get a belt w/ haste (FBSS)<br />
arms with hp or cobalt with the self buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before you go out and grab the first FBSS you see, do a check for general haste items in the bazaar. On the nameless, i see the Worker's Earring of Efficiency for like 3k-5k all the time. It's got like 5ac 55hp and 21%, and its an earring, so you'll get better ac/hp on it for the cash than any other earring, without even considering the haste. Other haste items you might want to look at would be silver chitin hand wraps and sash of the dragonborn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd be inclined to suggest that you think of working on your upgrades along two lines: one would be the best-bang-for-your-buck stuff that is really cheap, and the other is saving up for more expensive items that will really last a while. Your chestplate and that sword will do you for a bit, for example. Some of the haste options other posters have suggested are along these lines--if you have 2K now, start saving for haste.<br />
Or: Naggy drops very good haste. Vox drops good haste. Both must die. Why not at your hand? Bring 15 of your level 48-52 friends and a couple of higher-levels for buffage, have a good time, offer the random number generator your first born if you get the haste item. Naggy also drops a warrior epic thingy. Did I mention that Naggy must die? And: it's *not* an exploit to kill him or Vox more than once, either.<br />
Part of your long-term efforts might involve saving up some LDoN points for some pretty good armor.<br />
As for minor upgrades, first, I'd budget a certain amount for right-now upgrades: say, 1K pp. The reason for limiting your right-now-upgrade budget is that ultimately it's more expensive to marginally upgrade gear over and over than it is to get pieces that last a long time. But, in your case, I'd budget some pp for cheap upgrades because you ought to be able to make yourself a good deal harder to kill in the short run for a relatively small amount of plat.<br />
Suggestions: if you're not using such stuff already, get 10-pound Halas meat pies and some Grobb Liquidised Meat. That stat food is generally available, and a good value. I'd look at your rings, your earrings, your arms, your bracers, your helm and your back first when you search in the bazaar. Since you want the most bang for the buck, search each slot for, say, everything under 200 pp. (and your race, class, and agnostic). Whatever pops up, look at the highest AC items and the highest hp items (including hps that are generated by STA). Then go to PoK and see what the vendors next to the smithing forge have in the way of LDoN armor.<br />
Don't buy the first thing you see, necessarily. The first day, I'd get one most-upgrade-for-buck item, and take notes on all the rest of the gear slots and prices out there. Start getting a feeling for what's a good deal on your server. Lots of high level players occassionally put gear up for sale in the bazaar at low prices just to move the items off their mules: the amount of money the item is below market is not really significant to them, but it might be to you.<br />
Relative to your AC, right now you have really high STR and pretty high STA. I'd trade out pretty much any amount of STR for AC or hps if I were you. I'd also be inclined to give up a fair amount in resists for more AC/hps. Not because resists are unimportant, but because you might find it cheaper to buy non-resist heavy AC armor *and* a couple of pieces of resist gear, which you could swap in when you're up against a casting mob (Lol with your STR there's no reason not to be carrying extra pieces of armor around). Crown of the froglock Kings, Halas cloak...bleh, some cheap stuff out there.<br />
On my server I saw an ancient seahorse hide cloak for 95 pp the other day. I wasn't really paying attention but it has something like 20AC and some hps on it.<br />
if you have a few friends, you also might carefully look over the drops from the Skel commanders and fabled mobs while they last. You won't be able to take the commanders solo, but you and some buddies could.I think a lot of the fabled mobs you and a small group could take drop caster items, but look around and see what you and your friends need.<br />
And start checking prices on a Great Staff of Thunder. You can't use it yet, but you will be able to soon and it's a very decent and unbelievably cheap agro weapon. You can use it in a few levels while you save up for better haste/better armor and you won't be hurting your group at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kylong shinguards for your leg slot.  Velious quest armor for your head, arms, hands,  wrists, and feet.  Crinose cloak of the werewolf or cloak of greater pernicity.  I would sell the re'stek and get either a stun proc weapon(ykesha or droga weapon), frostbringer, venomous axe of the velium brood, or black blade of tormenting.  (anything with a decent aggro proc)</div></div><hr />
