<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jubea of Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">omg we did him last night for the hell of it (leave a bored time guild to their own devices and see what happs) and god was it retarded after revamp hes &quot;kinda&quot; hard i would say any p1 guild would have a bitch of a time doing him but he is eisy, his drops are well, p1 loot lol on par with terris!  <br />
<br />
i want my 3 hours spent doing all trials back plz!</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, bored Elemental/Time guilds are what's killing the progression of up-and-coming guilds.  Bring on the GoD!  :D<br />
<br />
It's generally not *too* bad on my server, except for mobs that have droppable loot... Zlandicar, Acidic Mass, AoW, and such.  We've have to race against Elemental/Time guilds for each of these mobs recently as we try to push towards Vex Thal, and it's a lot easier for them to mobilize 1-3 groups than it is for us to move 4-6 groups.  On the plus side, it's amusing when they wipe because they didn't bring enough toons, heh.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jubea of Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no he seriously is bunk, his aes are retarded for p1 god, and if someone is stupid (theres allways one) and decides to run up and attack him, 7H will ae for like 30 mins (one is dot/mana drain other is 800 dd) which slows shit down like nothing else.<br />
<br />
i dont think its even worth the effort to get the mark of justice on every toon that wants to kill. bad planning on soe :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">trials are fun anyways and he is optional content so there is no reason to bitch about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I remember wiping on trials more than once right after PoP came out, with players who were mostly 55-60.  Trials are a blast.  I wish I had enough free time on my hands to finish everything EQ has to offer and be bored with it.  :)</div></div><hr />
