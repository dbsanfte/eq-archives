<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty solid PvE wise, still there are some issues.  We have some difficulty soloing as well as everyone else for quests (High lvl mobs, or multi's.)  There is also difficulty frontloading damage to get the fast clean kills everyone likes in PvP.  Still, the class truely shines in instances whatever the spec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakan</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in pve we own in group pvp we can really fuck some shit up but one on one pvp we are just so so due to our low dps  and i can solo fine  at  60 on singles or even a bad multi pull with a  protection spec.<br />
<br />
if you are really burned change is allways good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people ask me how I can play the same class I played in EQ for years.  Its because a WoW warrior feels like a whole different class.  We have more utility and abilities than we ever did in EQ.  PvE, I think Wars do great.  Group wise we are probably one of the most needed classes, we tank several mobs at once great, and are just all around beasts.  Solo its no problem either if you play it right.  I had no problems all the way up to 60 soloing even con or 1 to 2 level higher mobs, and mobs that are lower or a couple of levels lower I just ripped through.  PvP.  Group PvP we're great too.  With some healing with my AC, HPs, and damage output (not great but pretty good too), I'm a terror.  One on one PvP we are not so great, this is where we are weakest.  Doesn't really bother me that much though, since all the PvP I do or will be doing is going to be groups mostly.  Maybe we need some tweaks, but I think WoW Warriors are great to play.</div></div><hr />

The high end content is garbage and the raid bug kicks our ass every week causing attendance to drop. It's awesome.<br />
<br />
I think WoW is great if you're going to casual game, chill and PvP, but the raid content is a joke currently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No more a joke, then when EQ was released...I was there.  Ill take WoW over EQ anyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the fun factor far outweighs any of the bullshit people like moan about.  WoW warriors are awesome.  WoW itself is an awesome game.  As long as you're not expecting to be coddled or treated like royalty by Blizzard cause you, gasp, pay a subscription fee to play the game, you'll love it if you enjoyed EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, I guess I was just hoping that they would've learned from EQ is all. <br />
<br />
The problem isn't the actual raid content, it's the fact that my guild has two raid choices currently, and we can't do one of them because a bug that they can't/refuse to fix even though they've known about it for quite a while now. The worst part about it is that the bug chops numbers off our already mediocre attendance and there's a five day lockout before you can try again and pray that it works properly.<br />
<br />
Again, it's not necessarily lack of high end content until we beat Onyx/MC, but it's lack of working high end content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knowing about a bug, and knowing just what is causing it, are two different things, Daeos.  They can know something is wrong, but unless they can figure out what is causing it, they can't fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW beats EQ any day of the week, for me (and after watching friends play EQ2...WoW beats that for me too).  I play really casual now (~2 hours a week due to time constraints) yet I can still do many things and feel like my time is worth something since I can actually be productive during that short amount of time...which is all I really wanted from EQ.<br />
<br />
Sure, at high end with all the instances I won't be able to do as much, but considering the time it will take for me to get to that point, I'd probably be able to play longer by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pushing more buttons to do the same thing is not more options.  You're just pushing more buttons.  Now you can do stuff like snare that you can't in EQ but that's just because of WoW's model of taking a powerful CC tool (mez, snare) and then make it 1/3rd as powerful and give it to 3X the classes so while you don't have anyone who can drop an EQ snare which totally trivializes any non summoning mob, you end up having 3 guys who have 1/3rd of an EQ snare who can combine to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Actually when people say they have more options, they really mean you've the option to solo instead of waiting for a group (and indeed this is usually the preferred method).  You're not really doing more as a Warrior per se.  You're just pushing more buttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea the warrior class doesnt have any options 'sides beating on the mob, beaing beat on, snaring, debuffing mob attack power and AC, slowing, buffing our own group, DoTing the mob, AE fearing.  Ok, how is it we're just pushing more buttons again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget adjusting your damage output for the situation, while managing aggro usually on multi's, typically while directing combat.  ^^  I find this class very entertaining.</div></div><hr />
