<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Freknik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone point me to either a good site or old post that has spawn strategy of Servelious in the Emerald Jungle?  If there is none, can someone just reply with info on his spawn times, spawn location, how long he is up, and any other pertenant info?  Any and all info is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you use this map(http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/emeraldjunglemap.html)  he spawns due north of the staircase(#2, around p4000 p3000(or viseversa if i got the #'s wrong like i normally do))<br />
<br />
i've seen him spawn as soon as 3-4hours after a server reset, and i belive its 3days(possibly 7) on respawn. he's up till he dies<br />
<br />
his crucial stats:<br />
Level 60 dragon with approx 32k hp<br />
AE Disease spell (approx 500 damage)<br />
AE stun (casts often)<br />
Melees for over 500<br />
Shaman mob, and comes with wolf pet.<br />
Doesn't cheal, dispell, fear, and i've never seen her gate(but she still might be able to)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You sure on the fear part?<br />
<br />
We dropped him two weeks ago and I was feared on incoming for near 5 seconds. I was not feared at any point the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experience fear with Sev?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All i know is:<br />
Shaman<br />
Dragon <br />
1 Week spawn time <br />
Has a weak pet<br />
Level 60<br />
32k HP<br />
has 2 AE's<br />
<br />
Sure there is more though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'm not *positive* cuz i resisted just aout evrything he's thrown at me...<br />
<br />
its either fear or stun(mayhaps both), but either way, a good MR will stop that(150+)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sev has a nasty fear that when partially resisted tends toget you stunned.  If you are 60+ you should be able to resist most of what Sev AEs.  If your raid force/group is mostly 60+ shold not be to much of a problem.  If you have a lot of people under level 60 then the stun AE and Sev's Fear will be an issue.  Just kill her quickly and be stubborn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah fear watch out for that. but don't waste hp/ac on that. his ae's are weak he has 32k hp and drops some good shm spells and green scale. strategy for camping:<br />
<br />
level 8 mage (from df belts) get a port go up against wall where nothing is. just press sense summoned every 5 minutes. I doubt EJ will be popular and if someone is there with anon and stays there for a while you might have another camper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>OgreOverlord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We Killed Sev lastnight on Saryrn for a friend of mine .. if i remeber correctly he has a 71 or 73 hour and 30 minute spawn time, as for Fear, yes he FEARS. AOE dot and DD. He Spawns neer the North West Corner of the Platue in EJ and Wanders some so best to pull him to keep your Force together, and do your prep(buffing, medding ) neer the Succor point at the FoB ZL he has a huge agro range.<br />
<br />
Other then that hes not a really supper tuff mob only 32k hp's so if your guild has killed the likes of RumbleCrush or Doomshade he will be easy for you just make sure your prepaired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With the coming of PoP and it's levels / AA's, this dragon is doable by half to a full group of high levels ( i.e 4-6 65th level PC's). Be sure to have poison resist/DMF and magic resist up....<br />
<br />
Next time I catch him up I'm gonna try him with me, a mage and a shaman.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was about to post a similar question myself when I saw this thread. Thanks for the info guys.<br />
<br />
Beo<br />
<br />
PS: When the hell are they going to make this a triggered spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Freknik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well, i am confused..  they said earlier that he is a 7 day spawn.  I just read the &quot;tentative times&quot; thread and it said this: Severilous, level 60, &lt;24 hr spawn, 3 day respawn, Emerald Jungle .....   they also mentioned above that he was a 3-5 hour pop after reset, but it says 24 hours..  Can anyone shed some light on this for me please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it says &quot;&lt;24&quot;  meaning less then 24hours.  after server reset he will spawn  anytime within 24 hours.(i've seen him spawn 3 hours after server-ups)<br />
<br />
i'm not sure on respawn time. i've heard both and havent actually confirmed either time myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Groticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I camped him after a server reset.. took about 8 hours for him to spawn.  I have talked to others who say he takes up to 24 hours to spawn after reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">took me 18 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sterix_VA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hmm, I don\t remember getting any noticeable aoe damage from Sev.<br />
It seemed to me it was:<br />
MR based aoe fear<br />
PR based aoe stun with very minor damage (if any?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hits for 520, Unslowable<br />
Casts a lot, including Malo, Pox<br />
32khp + Self shaman kunark buffs<br />
Wussie pet<br />
AEfear (MR)<br />
AEstun (PR)<br />
Never witnessed Sev gate<br />
He runs away at 30% HP assuming you have a 61+ in your raid and no low hp aggro<br />
Also pretty sure he drops scale 100% now<br />
<br />
Best way i've found him up is to sit on top of a ruin there, and wait for him to spawn and start beating on me, because his aggro range is roughly 90% of the clip plane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zerar_Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know he is not exactly like Talendor (spelling?) in skyfire, but I know they are similar, and we took that gimppy red dragon down with 3, yes three people. Me (65 warrior about 7100hp for the fight) a 65 bard for resists, and a 65 cleric for heals. kinda a longish fight, but nice loot for such an easy fight. Runed Bolster belt went to bard, red scale went to a fellow warrior in the guild, bracer and gloves to BST_Alt_01 of cleric, and spells went to me and my shammy roomie for funds, but he did score Malo out of it... just a hell of a fun encounter.<br />
<br />
And sadly, the first time I had ever killed or even seen the bad boy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">43 minutes into server up this afternoon Severlious spawns.. 17 minutes later dead to ten.. He hit for 250 max (defensive) and ran at 14% <br />
Droped the scale just as a TW guild ported in for him <br />
^_^ HEEEHEEE<br />
No Farming for joo!<br />
Just a few more pieces!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Reason for the difference in respawn times - He used to be a 7 day respawn, but was changed to a 3 day.  Still has a randomizer to it though.  Overall not a bad mob, though fear can be mean to the lower level people with ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Donvanlot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Great idea for the mage and sense summoned!  I have a 36 mage I haven't touched in ages.  Can get some good use out of him now :)<br />
