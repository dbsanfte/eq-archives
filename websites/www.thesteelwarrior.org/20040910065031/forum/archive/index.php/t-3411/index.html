<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear Warriors talk down about /defensive often, while muttering that it's too late in the game to remove it.  I'm trying to think outside the box a little bit here though.<br />
<br />
How about raising Warriors mitigation by half of what /defensive does all the time, and eliminating /defensive.  Add to this a weak ranged aggro <br />
tool, and a tweak to make taunt work a bit better.<br />
<br />
Would this destroy Warrior's ability to MT level/gear appropriate content?  If not, would the difference between a similarly geared Paladin and Warrior be significant enough that Warriors are wanted to MT level/gear appropriate content?<br />
<br />
How far would it go toward balancing Paladin/Warrior balance in experience groups?  Warriors would be significantly better at mitigating damage, and would receive a moderate increase in aggro ability.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to toss this out for discussion. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was thinking about this very subject a bit over the past day or two.  I haven't tanked &quot;high end&quot; boss mobs yet (Vindi, Doz, BoT/Tactics minis are about as far as my guild had gotten) - so take this all with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
IMHO, defensive and evasive are detracting more from being a warrior than say a 10% bump in baseline mitigation and avoidance would give us.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Here's my thoughts:<br />
<br />
A &quot;good&quot; tank basically will always keep defensive/evasive (D/E henceforth) open just in case it is needed.  This means that we nearly never use our other disciplines.  This means that we never realize our potential DPS upside that many people factor into our class.<br />
<br />
If we got rid of D/E we would start using agressive, enrage, etc. like they were meant to be used - to increase our DPS and to provide a strategic offensive ability.<br />
<br />
The down side?  All those boss mobs that were desiged to be tough with a D/E warrior just got ~20% harder to tank.  When I hear stories about Pallys and SK's being able to MT in PoTime, I find it hard to believe that this is a valid arguement to prevent getting rid of D/E.<br />
<br />
So, I would say that SoE should dump D/E, and give us a 10-15% innate bump in mitigation and avoidance.  Of course, this does next to nothing for the aggro issue - that's another pandora's box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If Knights got a D/E 50% as powerful as ours and we got range aggro 50% as good as Knights, I'd be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only thing Defensive does is...<br />
<br />
1) Give us a concrete life preserver... &quot;All raid mobs are balanced on a Defensive Warrior&quot; so we cant change that... Well when they nerfed Mod Rods they went back and 'Balanced' all of the high end content.. dont tell me they cant do that again.<br />
<br />
2.) Give knights a new Whine-Cry -- &quot;You can get our aggro when we get Defensive&quot; This is what every single knight justification for the way they are over powered boils down to.. &quot;But but but you have D-E-F-E-N-S-I-V-E&quot;<br />
<br />
3.) Prevents us from any meaningful upgrade...<br />
<br />
Knights CAN and DO tank every boss mob in the game, except for a very small few... We havent gotten to time yet, but I can count the number of mobs I NEED to go defensive on ONE hand AND have room to snap my fingers...<br />
<br />
Give warriors an INNATE Defensive of 25% REAL TOTAL DAMAGE TAKEN.. meaning -25% to whatever the Mob would normally deal, and I am sure every warrior would be happy to completely remove the defensive disc from the game. Warriors Should show a MEANINGFULL increase in mitigation over EVERY other class ALL the time.. not just when riding the one-trick-pony-defensive...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I might be going out on a limb here, and may very well be wrong. But about 3-4 years ago, I recall a dev or rep saying that innate skills and abilities are pretty much tied between players and mobs. So if a monk can midigate X amount of damage, a monk MOB could midigate the same, then add their NPC modifier..  I don't know if that's still in place or ever was in place, but if they make warriors have an innate type of defensive, then warrior NPCs will also have that + their NPC modifier. In other words, be careful what you wish for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are two problems with this really. <br />
<br />
1) Mitigation isn't really a concern anymore in XP groups. Warrior damage absorbing abilities aren't the real concern these days. They are only a concern in relation to knights and how well they mitigate these days in comparison to warriors. Fixing mitigation without seriously addressing agro wouldn't be the correct path to balance<br />
<br />
2) Too many raid encounters designed around the damage absorbtion of defensive. Basically, mitigation would have to be raised to a point where a mob cannot reasonably 1-round a warrior with suitable HP for the encounter unless the encounter is already designed for this. Defensive is 50% off DI. Giving warriors innate 50% DI mitigation would be just sick and wrong, not to mention horribly unbalanced. However, NOT doing would lead to very big problems on certain encounters designed around it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The best idea I heard for getting rid of defensive would be this:<br />
<br />
A slider bar.<br />
<br />
So you slide your bar all the way over to become a &quot;defense&quot; oriented tank for that encounter, and you lose out on your offense.<br />
<br />
You go the other way and you lose out on your defense.<br />
<br />
Mix and match.<br />
<br />
So as to not gimp a certain OTHER melee class for when warriors go full offensive, give them an offensive boost since that OTHER class' defense has already been &quot;nerfed.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Being able to go full offensive/defensive without restriction at any time is also broken though - soon as you place resrictions on it it goes back to the save defensive way of doing things...maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Being able to go full offensive/defensive without restriction at any time is also broken though &quot;<br />
<br />
Not really. Not if the LEVEL of defense wasn't as high as the level of /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
It's require some fine tuning for many raiding parties, probably.<br />
<br />
But, in general it'd probably be more helpful to the overall well being of the warrior class as they'd get to use it on more than just boss mobs, and more than once every 10 or so minutes ... and thus would gain an edge as a superior tank option in ALL aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
The sacrifice being that it wouldn't be as effective in places where warriors absolutely need defensive (then again, maybe it'd allow for some upgrade to the Vie spell line and then you'd have your defensive style tank again).<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT, there is some content that would need some tuning, I'd imagine. Which is probably why this won't happen. It'd create WORK for Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you are forgeting one important thing - defensive is first and foremost is a discipline. <br />
<br />
Why and what grounds would you want to alter a disc that has been the most usefull disc of our class.  You want something out of nothing.<br />
<br />
You arguement is this from what I understand : Defensive is so good that you want to have it avilable all the time, but but but let me please use other discs too... Well who is stoping you from using them? Its your character you in controll. <br />
<br />
Defensive is not broken. Its very usefull. Its balanced. Leave it be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Defensive is extremely broken...<br />
<br />
Defensive is the SINGLE BIGGEST reason we have been sucking witch's tit at the upgrade table. <br />
<br />
Remove defensive, make mitigation for warriors mean something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you are a developer and you would know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MachedorCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No. But when a class is defined by a 3 minute discipline, there is a problem.  We are a class built to take damage better than anyone.  It should not depend upon whether we have our disc ready or not.  Plus, who are you to say it isn't broken? Are you a developer and you would know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wouldn't call defensive &quot;balanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
That they had to design content AROUND defensive actually points to it being unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">anything CAN be tanked without defensive. Defensive just makes it more acessable. Its a disc. Its a good disc. Leave it be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;That they had to design content AROUND defensive actually points to it being unbalanced&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the same argument used to nerf Donal's BP so long ago... they were designing content around that single item, instead of just fixing the item.<br />
<br />
I'd agree with what others have said... the fact that it's sort of the 'class defining' ability, and the fact that many encounters are designed with it in mind shows that something is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The way discs work now sucks.<br />
It needs to be changed.<br />
<br />
Defensive and evasive are both good discs... but with a bad system.<br />
Disciplines could have been an important part of the melees, bringing balance.<br />
<br />
Alas, incompetence dropped disciplines into a forgotten hole.<br />
Let's just hope they can dig deep enough to retrieve them...<br />
- New disciplines for 60-65, a couple new low level ones... 15, 30 etc..<br />
-Tweak the timers<br />
-Change the discipline system, by removing the linked timers. And adding in a new constaint. Allowing to chain a couple disciplines, at a cost.<br />
<br />
And there you have it.<br />
Monks can become the best pullers again thanks to a new discipline.<br />
Rogues can become damage dealers of choice.<br />
Warriors can become tanks of choice (chaining defensive/evasive, can allow warriors to tank unslowed mobs at the cost of dps).<br />
<br />
Defensive certainly does not suck,<br />
its everything around it that does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would like to kick defensive and evasive and give warrior 7.5 % more on the evading side and 7.5 % more on the damage reducing side and the discipline stone stance of the monks for the start probs in a big fight.<br />
<br />
And for the aggro part. When they want to make it simple and easy. Make an Item dropping random in some 55 + zones with unlimited charges of a Low Level Stun. Cast Time 2.5 Seconds Useable out of Inventory. Useable only by warriors. No Drop. Or make it a Quest like the Ykesha spell quests for level 50+.<br />
<br />
So you would have ranged aggro, start aggro but nearly no chance of firing it while fighting. Would it break the game? No. Would it break raids? No, then there is alreay an Item with a 2.5 second stun proc out of Inventory but not no drop and with only 5 charges. That one drops from level &lt; 35 Mobs. <br />
<br />
Ppl. say balance per itemisation is bad but most is itemisation. Spells are also Itemisation. That what it will bring is the same chance for an inital aggro than a Paladin has with one cast of cease or another low level stun. But that should be enough for Exp groups.<br />
<br />
And the implementation would be real easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">anything CAN be tanked without defensive. Defensive just makes it more acessable. Its a disc. Its a good disc. Leave it be.<br />
<br />
Sorry but this is WRONG.<br />
<br />
There are a number of mobs in EQ that require defensive to be tanked.  This seems to apply to some of the 'top' end mobs in each and every expansion.  It used to be AoW, because he would one round any tank w/o defensive.  You cannot 'tank' anything if you cannot live through ONE round of melee combat... you MUST have time to heal... or you die in 1 round.  Dying in 1 round is NOT tanking.<br />
<br />
Currently in PoP this applies to a couple mobs, most notably probably Vallon Zek (in Time) who hits for 2500 and quads... to tank him without defensive you would require at LEAST 10,000 hps.  Plenty of warriors have over 10,000 hps now, but only the very top warriors were at that point when they first encountered VZ.  And that doesn't take into account the fact that if you get riposted + quaded you'd need 12,500+ hps to live.  I currently have 9600 hps, but only 9450 or so when tanking VZ cause I can't use 1h because every time I do I suicide myself on Ripostes (took over 10,000 damage in ripostes in 15 seconds last time I tried).  I've tried at like 9,200, and 9,600 now on VZ and have basically been 1 rounded every time... but our 10k warriors can handle tanking him just fine in most cases.<br />
<br />
The other example is Quarm who hits for 3800.  A triple attack is 11,400 damage.  Along with DoT damage... you'd need at least 13,000 or more hps to tank Quarm w/o defensive... again you'd likely die pretty fast w/o incredible healing even then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive breaks the game.  It should be removed from the game.  <br />
<br />
And there is no reason that Knights should be able to get 100% perfect aggro lock on anything, especially Time Gods.  Another reason the game is broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There are also plenty of monsters that &quot;/disc defensive&quot; doesn't make much of difference.  An unresistable 2K proc can not be disciplined away with current skills.  Not to mention, the way all of EQ is geared the moment you place a player in melee range you punish them.<br />
<br />
Current EQ is anti-melee.  Is it any wonder why Warriors are in a bad spot now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Correct Aeka.<br />
<br />
EQ is currently anti-melee.<br />
<br />
There are no mobs in the game that are threats to casters as much as any random mob is a threat to melee. Between Insane melee damage, DD procs, AOE's Ripostes etc.. Being in melee range is a BAD thing. <br />
<br />
Paladins are able to tank WITHOUT attacking the mob, thus removing a signifigant part of the mob melee damage equation. They can also mitigate DD/AOE effects with their FAST Groups heals, which ALSO help to maintain good aggro with these heals.<br />
<br />
Except for the few mobs that absolutely REQUIRE defensive because they WILL one round a non-defensive melee class - Reparm, Quarm etc.. there is no good reason NOT to use a Paladin for a MT on any mob not REQUIRING Defensive...<br />
<br />
THIS is why Defensive is Bad for Warriors...<br />
<br />
As far as 'chaining discs' and how unbalancing that is.. how is it more unbalancing than 3 warriors chaining defensive? Since a 100% MT switch is completely trivial, It is very easy to have 12 FULL minutes of defensive with just 3 warriors... And able to do that every 15 minutes. Using hastened instigation, you can ALMOST do an infinite Defensive Chain with 4 Warriors...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The original idea, removing defensive and giving warriors a permanent mitigation boost equal to half that, sucks. That's a 25% mitigation boost for warriors over knights, up from the current 2%. Can you imagine the outcry? Heck, can you imagine a knight getting a group, for that matter? <br />
<br />
Healers would need to spend 25% more mana healing the knight. <br />
<br />
Paladin hp are very close to warrior hp with their self-only buffs and brells (350 for aura of the crusader, 150 or 200 for brells? Yes brells is a group buff but group with pally mt is assumed to have no warrior, and vice versa. Anyway, 500-550 total from self buffs negates any class advantage warrior would have) but the mitigation advantage we'd have would basically put them back in kunark era as far as tankability, back when warriors had 20-25% advantage in hp due to class specific gear.<br />
<br />
No, boosting warrior agro is what's needed, that and removing defensive so SOE has no phantom warrior advantage to justify keeping us down with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh yes, fixing Warriors means Knights are back in the Kunark era.<br />
<br />
The Warrior HP advantage over Paladins usually does not exist.<br />
When a Warrior MTs his DPS advantage usually does not exist.<br />
Warriors aggro even if improved will almost certainly still be inferior to Knight aggro. As it is now, it's *cough* uncompetative.<br />
<br />
You don't think Stunning a mob pervents damage???? Heck, prevention is a lot better than mitigation any day of the week.<br />
<br />
People pooh pooh soloing. Well, if there's a better test of Damage output, mitigation, HP's, and abilities I don't know what it is. (In fairness, fear kiting can't be included in such measurement methods.) Buff up one of each and have them tank warrior-type mobs solo - the proof is in the pudding.<br />
<br />
The truth is Knights outclass Warriors tremendously and a 25% mitigation improvement for Warriors should not be dismissed out of hand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You don't think Stunning a mob pervents damage????<br />
<br />
Actually, on a slowed mob, stunning doesn't really prevent damage. I think the way it works is a stunned mob saves up its attacks so right when stun wears off they fire them off anyway, usually followed immediately by the next round of attacks that was coming, instead of &quot;skipping&quot; the attack round it was supposed to have when it got stunned. On an unslowed mob, yeah, stuns will prevent dmg.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's one of the few things they have left that aren't 100% perfect with their class so they been bitching to high heavens about it. Just bringing it up to correct the previous poster's misconception.<br />
<br />
Edit: now that I think about it, this likely isn't a bug but something intentional. With a slowed mob attacking every 3-4 seconds and stuns making it skip a round of attacks, a pally could time his stuns to completely block a mob's melee dmg, making it have NO dmg output. Just think how easy it would be for warriors to get groups then - pally: no healing + agro lock, warrior: crying in a corner trying to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Arnan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would like to see them remove the snap agro from the knight class and /defensive from the warriors.  They can re-tune the big encounters to compensate for taking /def out.  If they do these two things, it wouldnt be that hard to find the right adjustment for warrior mitigation and DPS.  It most likely would not be a high enough boost to make most people happy, but the real reason the game is out of balance is agro control.  What is broken is the Knights agro, not ours.  <br />
The fix should &quot;not&quot; be to make our agro as &quot;broken&quot; as theirs so it is all equal, because then they would just tune the mobs with mem blur ability so nobody could keep agro.<br />
Just my thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Personally I think removing defensive and aggro lock would be better for the game. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I see SoE's track record. Removing Defensive would just drive the final nail into the warrior coffin. Why use a warrior when a paladin will do?<br />
<br />
If Defensive/Evasive are removed, they need to SERIOUSLY upgrade warrior mitigation, not PLATE, but just warrior.<br />
<br />
I dont see them doing that.<br />
<br />
The best we can hope for IMO is unlinking disciplines. <br />
<br />
Oh, and get rid of the rediculously LONG ASS reset times. Aggressive/Precise  already have a downside, we get hit for more/more often  it should be the same timer as evasive/defensive.<br />
<br />
the hour long resets on fortitude/fellstrike/mighty are ok, just really need to reasses the entire discipline list in regards to the added powers all other classes have recieved.<br />
<br />
I really like the 'Book of Tactics and Strategy' idea and using spell gems to add new disciplines and styles. Would be a great use for etheral/spectral/runes for warriors.<br />
<br />
Some do not like the 'quasi-caster' idea, but if we want balance we need something easy for SoE to fix/adjust/add, and they have said spells are a lot easier than any other effect in the game. Just make all Disciplines UNSTACKABLE, and give them Buff Slot 22 so that they cannot be dispelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, Stunning a mob does prevent damage. Stunning interrupts casting (which almost always is beneficial to the mob or detrimental to you) and allows your group to attack and cast on the mob for the entire length of time it's stunned without the mob being able to retaliate. Force of Akilae stuns for 4 seconds. Every time it sticks that's 4 seconds your group is damaging the mob and it's not damaging your group. Do this a few times during the fight and the mob dies with less opprotunity to do your group damage.<br />
<br />
I find it very hard to believe a mob stores up all of it's spell casting opprotunities and weapon swings during it's 4 seconds of inactivity and does them after stun wears off. Doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Why? That's what hybrids essentially did during spell casts. Mobs just never got a retuning. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I do believe that if a stun wears off of a mob that it will hit you immediately.  Let me dig through my logs..<br />
<br />
..Viv's damned pet with its stun procs seems to be in every fight just after I land one, gotta keep looking..  Ah, here's one.<br />
<br />
0:56  A Steward Tormentor hits YOU for 47 points of damage.<br />
0:58  A Steward Tormentor hits YOU for 200 points of damage.<br />
0:59  You begin casting Force of Akera (four second stun).<br />
1:00  A Steward Tormentor is struck by a sudden force.<br />
1:03  You bash a Steward Tormentor for 22 points of damage (I'm admitting ignorance here: does bash stun 55+ mobs?  This one was immune to Holy Shock and regular Stun, I was using Fiery Defender)<br />
1:05  A Steward Tormentor tries to hit YOU, but misses!<br />
1:07  A Steward Tormentor hits YOU for 241 points of damage.<br />
<br />
I think that the mob delays one round of attack until after the stun ends - but not that it &quot;saves up&quot; any other combat rounds it may get while stunned.  But that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It's pretty simple how stun effects mob melee swings - and I think it is the same way for PC's too:<br />
<br />
1.  Everytime we swing a timer is started (proportional to weapon delay, modified by haste).<br />
2.  When the timer is up, we swing again.<br />
3.  If we are stunned when the timer is up, we do nothing until the stun wears off.<br />
3a.  When stun wears off, we swing again.<br />
<br />
Therefore, stuns *can* reduce mob melee damage (in addition to all the spell interrupt and maybe dodge/parry/riposte supression?), as long as the stun overlapps the end of the mob's melee timer.  <br />
<br />
On a slowed mob, this is what separates a good Pally from a keyboard masher.  A good pally will time the stuns to land just before the mob swings again - gaining the most mob idle time for the stun.  Don't think it can happen?  It is little different from Warriors that watch for tash, malo, slows and cripples to land on the mob and hit Taunt immediately afterward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As useful as defensive is on raids, I agree with the most others about the idea that defensive is holding us back.  As long as we have defensive and evasive we'll never get upgraded.  I think they should bump up our innate avoidance and mitigation by about 10% each and remove both of those disciplines completely.  That would give us a 20% boost all the time which would bring us closer to parity with a knight using his spells to keep himself alive.  They might have to tweak a few raid mobs downwards a bit *cough* Reparm *cough*.</div></div><hr />

Would the increase in mitigation all the time be enough to make a significant difference in tankability to make Warriors a competitive choice for tanking in experience groups?<br />
<br />
Would it if you added a weak ranged aggro ability and improved taunt some to help Warriors in the aggro department?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">No, because simply upgrading taunt upgrades ALL taunting classes in their ability to tank. You have to make adjustments so that all 3 classes can generate aggro without locking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hmm that's odd.  It looks like his attack plan would of been this (if you hadn't stunned)<br />
0:56 attack<br />
0:58 attack<br />
1:00 attack<br />
1:02 attack<br />
1:04 attack<br />
1:06 attack<br />
<br />
It kindof looks like it was working like this from what I can tell, each second it counts down a timer (which starts at 2) when the timer hits 0 he attacks.  So it looks like maybe this is happening:<br />
0:56 attack, set timer = 2<br />
0:57 decrement timer, timer = 1<br />
0:58 decrement timer, timer hits 0 attack, reset timer to 2<br />
0:59 decrement timer, timer = 1<br />
1:00 Stun happens, add 4 to timer, don't do anything, timer = 5<br />
1:01 decrement timer, timer = 4<br />
1:02 decrement timer, timer = 3<br />
1:03 decrement timer, timer = 2<br />
1:04 decrement timer, timer = 1<br />
1:05 decrement timer, timer hits 0 attack, reset timer to 2<br />
1:06 decrement timer, timer = 1<br />
1:07 decrement timer, timer hits 0 attack, reset timer to 2<br />
<br />
Although Possibly I guess it could simply just be a roundoff error type thing going on with the granularity of the log file, ie the mobs attack speed wasn't exactly 20 and by the time he hit the 1:05 mark it had added up enough to move him off by a second.<br />
<br />
Hard to tell with a short snip of log file I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">On topic though, I vote get rid of defensive/evasive altogether and give warriors a 40% innate hp multiplier on top of the other aa multipliers.  That would make it where All/All equipment doesn't really throw things so far off balance and still allow for Warriors to tank things that they could before.  It would also make it where alot more warriors would get less of a ch from ch, which is probably a good thing, since under defensive a 7500 hp heal is closer to a 15000 hp heal in effectiveness.</div></div><hr />
