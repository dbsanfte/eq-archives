<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was looking at  a PoP progress map tonight at <br />
<br />
http://www.fedupnow.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=38<br />
<br />
i was always under the impression you needed all flags up to and including bertoxx, mith marr, and tallon and vallon. the link above seems to indicate you dont need bertoxx to get into sol ro. this obviously makes me a little curious since bertoxx is the only flag im missing of the above and i was curious if i was sitting on a sol ro flag and i didnt even know it. <br />
<br />
i know you need a bertoxx flagged person to kick off KoS event in torment but im just confused as to if everyone needs bertoxx flag for sol ro? someone help plz!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The chart is correct, but misleading.  When people say &quot;you need Saryrn&quot; it is always implied that you also need the TT and Bertox chains of flags.  Fahlia will not talk to you without those, and you cannot sort out the Cipher of the Divine Language without her dialogue.<br />
<br />
To zone into Sol Ro you need:<br />
<br />
POJ trial + 3 HOH trials + MM + Behemoth + TZ + VZ + Hedge + TT + Grummus + Carprin + Bertox + KoS + Saryrn, and a lot of hails along the way.<br />
<br />
To zone into Sol Ro you do not need: <br />
<br />
AD, BOT entry quest, Agnarr, or RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't you need AD to 'officially' get into HoH ? Can't imagine they kept all other entry-flags required, yet gave a freebie in HoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't you need AD to 'officially' get into HoH ? <br />
<br />
nope if you are lvl 62 you dont need it ever...long as you can get 15%ed into hohb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't need AD to get to elementals, however, you do need him to get into HoHb which can be a pain to push into. <br />
<br />
Also, you do need to do the BoT key quest for elementals. We had a memeber who couldn't zone into elementals without the BoT key.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure you need AD to get into the elementals.  When you kill Mith Marr without having AD it says &quot;you receive a new checklist flag&quot; and it doesn't turn into a real flag until you kill AD and unlock memories.  Same deal with Justice Trials etc.  A guildmate finished the BoT quest but didn't have a Justice trial and couldn't zone into BoT (&lt;62) until he went back and did a justice trial.  No skipping steps.<br />
<br />
Could be wrong though, it's happened before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You do need AD. <br />
How people can claim such things is absolutly beyond me.<br />
Not having HoHB keeps you from activating MM flag, as it says you lack the Honor. <br />
<br />
It says you lack Valor or something at seer when you miss AD for LMM kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we have a few people in guild who do not have AD flag, yet can zone into the elementals. Unless there was a brief period where it was bugged and you can skip it, you can still do this to my knowledge.</div></div><hr />
