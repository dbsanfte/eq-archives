What is considered acceptable hp for tanking in the trials? I max out at 7488 buffed right now with 1330ac (still working on those AA and armor upgrades).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can probably do the sewers but vxed and tipi will get rough. if hard LDoN is giving you trouble you might want to reconsider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt do a GoD trial unless you run around 8-9K hps buffed and have all the defensive aas maxed.  The mobs hit for 1K+ and I would consider them a notch above the mobs in LDoN hard.  They do seem to have low attack though, but this just makes their damage output very spikey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 8.5K roughly (or was at time of first trial) and around 1600-1700 AC depending on buffs.  Trial #1 the mobs were hitting for 1280's max, and with max avoidance/mitigation AA's it was still a very worth while challenge.<br />
<br />
Had a blast doing them so far, but they are definately at the very edge if not a little past what you can likely do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd highly recommend being 8k+ and maxing defensive AA's.  In the sewers the unslowable golems hit pretty fast/hard and at the end of trial 1 the named is fairly tough.<br />
<br />
Vxed/Tipt get harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input :)<br />
<br />
My group accidently got a hard guk adventure last night (we only noticed it was hard when I pulled 3 mobs and was mowed down instantly). Chanter mezzed them, I got rezzed and rebuffed, and tried tanking them. Was very slow going, even when I had defensive up so we gave up and got a normal adventure and breezed through it.<br />
<br />
Sounds like I need to keep grinding away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way Guk and Nro hard adventures are much harder than hard adventures in the other camps.  I'd try a Ruj, MM, or EF hard adventure and see how you do.  (although I'm guessing you need to get most defensive AA's and a bit more hp - or a really good cleric)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Payn<br />
<br />
Keep trying the hard ldon.  The previous posters are correct, if you have a hard time there then GoD is going to be just a bit harder.  The consequences of wiping in LDoN are ALOT less than GoD...its probably the best place to practice.  All that being said keep pushing yourself...don't let others tell you what is/is not possible...thats the only way you'll ever suprise yourself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you can start the sewers try to do the 2nd or 3rd first because the 1st has a reaily hard named that will likely eat you with your current gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">try to do the 2nd or 3rd first  <br />
<br />
I didn't know you could choose a trial out of order.  I thought you always got the purying plant first.<br />
<br />
How do you go about gettign the 2nd or 3rd as the 1st trial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will give you whatever trial the Leader is up to.  So if you have Trials 1 and 2, and your partner has none, you'd get Trial 3 if you were leader, and your partner would get Trial 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Payn, you're real close to me in hps/ac and I can tank hard ldon, at least in mir and MM. Probably ruj too.  I'm not gonna say it's a walk in the park, but with a good supporting cast I can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beornegar do you have a magelo I can compare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another note on GoD trials (or rather, specifically the Vxed and Tipt trials). Trash mobs in these 2 zones hit around 1.2k+ max. At 9036hp / 1697ac buffed, the Cleric usually starts CH when I'm at 80% hp (that's 7228hp buffer), and even then, sometimes it gets close, and a sub-healer needs to chip in a fast heal.<br />
<br />
In Vxed, named mobs have a very high 'to-hit' rating, so almost none of the swings miss. Even after Furious + Stonewall, 2 healers had a tuff time healing me on a Kyv Hunter (may it grow boils on it's behind!).<br />
<br />
In Tipt, the final named, Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru, hits in excess of 2.3k dmg per swing, and can quad.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried the Sewer trials, but I heard they're a bit easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my 2cp on this - your HP/AC and AAs are comparable to what I had 18 months ago just prior to PoP opening.  I was wearing mainly HoT armor, my guild was just starting to raid NToV.   There is a lot of content between your current level of equipment and the GoD trials to enter Kod`Taz, like NToV, all of Luclin and most of PoP.  <br />
<br />
I don't mean to discourage you from exploring GoD, I'm just trying to give some perspective on how much ground there is you could be covering in between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, I know my gear is outdated :) I took an 18 month break which is why. I just started back up in late December. I'm working on my VT key atm, slow going since I've soloed all the pieces I have so far. Leveling up a cleric on the side (currently lvl 26) to help with the shard farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with saying that there is tons of content in Luclin and PoP to explore is that that's really only true if you are a raider.  I'm fine with my gear being subpar to a raiders as it's less work.  But, I'm always up for pushing the envelope. <br />
<br />
For what it's worth, our tank, 7400 max hps, 1450 AC tanked in Ferubi.  It was tough, but, it can be done.<br />
<br />
Oh, I have heard conflicting reports about the trials.  Some folks say the first trial doesn't hit that hard, and some say, 1200+.  If I am going into the very first trial in sewers, what do the normal trash mobs max hit for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamov</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.1-1.3k for trial 1 mobs<br />
<br />
The unslowable abondoned workers only doubles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theren Sa'Riik</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sewer mobs are fun, easier than Tipt/Vexd by far, but still a fun time.  From my logs the regular sewer mobs were hitting up to 1000ish on the sludgeworkers.  The other mobs look to be more in the 800 range.  Tipt/Vexd are considerably harder, the unnamed there all hit inn the 1000 to 1100's it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabal</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading this I can say that GoD is a tough place. In the sewer trial trash pulls do indeed hit for 1100 or more. On avg though they are about 800ish. The golems are unslowable. I sit at 8965 buffed and about 1500 AC i have all my defensive aa's except I'm only on ID 2 atm. The trials for my group were fun and challenging. I would definitly recomend getting a good cleric and a spot healer to go with you. Especially if under 8k. Other than that push the envelope have some fun and let us know how you did good or bad=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think giving sewers a try is a good idea when you feel you got a chance, because the nameds in there drop loot which might very well be an upgrade if you can just barely do it.<br />
<br />
Since last patch you got to wait 5 minute between adventures so you can no longer get adventure, go in and track, and quit if no named close, but still 5 mins aint too long a wait.<br />
<br />
Same goes for vext/tipt, some nice equipment drop there aswell. Ferubi might be worth it if you can track a named, otherwise just crawling there looking for a named is prolly not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladd</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im sure you already know this but you may want to make getting Fierce Heraldic in a few of your slots a top priority. Legs are the most glaring thing i saw the boots arms and neck piece I would also consider swapping out for. No idea how you are strapped for cash but can probably pick up all 4 pieces for under 20k and that alone should give you a healthy couple hundred HP boost.<br />
May not be enough to put you into trial tanking range but it would be a step in the right direction.<br />

If they're still a few points shy of max they'll appreciate the opportunity for skillups, if they're maxed bring enough for 2 or 3 combines and let them keep part of what they make.</div></div><hr />
