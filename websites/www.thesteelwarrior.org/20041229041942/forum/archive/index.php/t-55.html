<br />
Basically, a guildie (monk) asked my why the Vindi bp would be better than a statue bp.  I tried to explain it to him, but some days I'm not very good at that.  So I was wondering if one of you who is better with words this morning (since I haven't slept yet) would help me explain =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erad has more AC and melee stats, Vindi has better resists and a +atk/regen effect.<br />
<br />
Just take whichever comes up first, I went for Vindi and I'm happy with it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people just like the extra atk/regen from the Vindi BP; and overall I'd guess the extra regen/atk would prove more beneficial over time than the extra &quot;meat&quot; on the Statue BP.<br />
<br />
Personally, i'm shooting for a Vindi BP. Seems in the long run to have more roundabout usage than the Statue. BP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vindi was better when the AC cap was really low due to the saves/effect. Now I'd rate them basically even. If you don't have access to Kizraks/Void+ I'd say take whatever comes your way first. Unless yer very desperate for stamina then go Erad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavanD</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Statue has cha though for di! Everytime di goes off its all worth it . =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already have a Vindi, everyone in my guild who can wear the bp has one.  Which was the reason for the discussion, what we would do with the bp, should we ever find statue up.  We supposably have access to kizraks (if it would drop), and don't do anything in ssra so I'm not sure if we have access to void.  Basically, statue bp would go to someone who has a vindi already, so I was looking into it a bit more, but I think some people actually care about the difference between the two, so I'll stick with my vindi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I still love the AoB on my vindi bp.  The AC cap has surely been lifted, and, well I pretty much agree, get whichever you can first and don't worry about it.  These aren't endgame bps anymore, so pickup your upgrade and then share the love until you get to another tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 If everyone has Vindi already I think I'd see what lesser races/classes(elves, shorties, non-barbs basically) want Erad 1st for the stam.<br />

 5 stam isn't much but it adds up. And wars are generally better off on stam. Personally I'd hold out for Kizrak's+ if it's a realistic option. But if you tank a lot and aren't overly concerned about 7 to all resists Erad would be an upgrade, just a pretty small one is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chances of us finding statue up are slim anyway, but just wanted to explore the option.  Will pass on Erad, should it come up.  Keep hoping for kizrak's, but loot tables that are empty 90% of the time suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really 100% related, but if you do statue you can attempt AoW at least. So another benefit of skipping Erad is you can go for a Helm/BoC =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With statue, you gain something like 10 ac, a couple useless stats, 5 more stamina, and lose 8 to all saves.<br />
<br />
with vindi bp you have 8 higher to all saves, same hps, 5 less stamina, but 2 per tick regen (useless), but the real kicker is the atk on vindi bp... 11 atk is better than Vengeance II, and even though 11 atk isn't going to do a lot, atk is the toughest of anything to raise naturally (without buffs).  Overall it's really up to you, but I like the free Vengeance II personally.<br />
<br />
Oh, plus Vindi is usable by more folks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korak Sarathai</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoB is 10atk.  That 10 gets multiplied by 1.33 somewhere in the process along the way to being displayed in your ATK rating though, as do all raw atk buffs... for warriors anyway.  There may be a different multiplier for other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahhh that'd be why it appears as more :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Call in a 2nd/3rd guild to bring their 3 groups after Statue dies=) AoW is really easy, really. If you have 40+ people equipped like you he should fall no problem. And would be totally worth it assuming you can figure out a way to do loot with the other guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In hindsight, I'd kill for his ring too. If you possibly can, kill statue and attempt the AoW... Best risk/reward in velious in my opinion. Right below him would be King Tormax.</div></div><hr />
