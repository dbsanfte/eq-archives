<br />
I'm coming back to EQ from a stint in FFXI (fun game, &quot;harder&quot; than EQ IMHO, community sucks from lack of English speaking only servers and too hard to make groups at higher levels) and getting back into my warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about where to go with my gear.  I'm currently not in a guild, but looking for a good fun one on Ayonae :).  At 61, I pretty much just put together a group and LDON or grind.<br />
<br />
Take a look at my Magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=885152<br />
<br />
I know my gloves are behind the rest of my gear.  I'm plotting spending the apx 6k I have on a better non agro DPS weapon over my Black Acrylia Hale (WMBS prolly) and was thinking about getting the 760 point LDON EverFrost gaunts http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23658<br />
<br />
However, in looking at my LDON options, I'm leaning toward saving my points for weapon upgrades (and going for Fierce Hearld Glaunts, or Champions/Beserkers or Kylong Gaunts).  I don't amass LDON points at a huge pace and am thinking that taking my Everfrost points to 1150 and getting the Club of the Mad Researcher http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23778 <br />
<br />
Then, working on Takish-hiz points to get the #2 Dmg Aug and more Everfrost Points for Anger III Aug and I'll have a really nice upgrade for 1 handed agro.<br />
<br />
Then, probably (if I can ever get groups to go there) start working on Guk points for the LDON 14/19 sword and do the same upgrades for it for a really sweet weapon set.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think that working toward better weapons is a more productive use of my non-massive LDON points over my original plan of amassing a set of Malevolent EverFrost armor to replace my Fierce Heraldic stuffs.<br />
<br />
What'cha think?<br />

The EF armor isn't a huge upgrade over FH, but the helm is substantially better than your Radulkan.<br />
For weapons, I would just get angerII or III augs and put them on the weapons you have, rather than getting the LDON weapons. I have the Droga combo with angerII on both and double proccing weapons are teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spend 50 plat and get a GSoT more than enough DPS/agro. I have both WMBS and GSoT, like them both, but DPS is a luxery for later I think, and GSoT has almost (if not more) agro then WMBS. Then you can spend your plat on armor that lest you live while everyone else kills what you tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
weapons? heh, GSoT is the best weapon you got for a 2Her plus you already have one of the best combo's for a non-guilded warrior going....i'd work the living hell out of it until you can get a BoT tower drop weapon like the GBoS and a GSot4W....screw tha weaponry out of LDoN..save points for aug's.</div></div><hr />
