Given that the GSoT has a similar 0.0 stun was wondering whether this generated similar amounts of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duel wielded Hone Bladed Ykesha blades before I got my GSoT.  <br />
<br />
IMO, The proc from the GSoT produces higher hate and the GSoT is way more DPS than the 2 Blades.  However, before the GSoT the 2 Ykesha Blades were the best aggro combo I could find.  <br />
<br />
Also, the procs from the Ykesha and GSoT are not the same one, even though you get the same message (lazy programmers).  <br />
<br />
Ykesha is 75DD + 0sec Stun.  <br />
Planer Stun is 1sec Stun with a Knockback component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what about the proc rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what about the proc rate?<br />
<br />
Actually I would say on average the GSoT proc rate is less than the Ykesha Blades.  However it only takes 1 or 2 procs from the GSoT to lock aggro.  The Ykesha's seemed to require alot of procs in a row to achieve the same &quot;lock&quot;, i think its because the amount of hate from the Ykesha is very small compared to the GSoT.  <br />
<br />
But in general proc rates are just random and ive had good streaks and bad streaks with both GSOT and Ykesha blades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you observed a noticeable decrease in the proc rate of the GSoT within the last month or so?<br />
<br />
Another thread mentioned a possible nerf to the GSoT proc rate within the last couple of patches, and I was curious as to your observation on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also read that thread but honestly I can't really see much difference.  Its still just as streaky/random as ever but I almost always get 2 or 3 procs within the first few moments of fight which enough to &quot;lock&quot; down some aggro.  I still get streaks of 8 procs in a row or streaks of only 2 procs per fight.   <br />
<br />
Im not sure how procs rates actually work but whatever it is it is still 95% random number roll before any other factors are considered.<br />
<br />
All I know is that since I upgraded to GSoT my aggro getting/holding ability has improved tremendously.</div></div><hr />

Cant say I've noticed a decrease.</div></div><hr />
