If you don't care about greenies can always go to Sebillis and kill the Iksar in the jail they drop pretty decent of gems and stuff.</div></div><hr />

Ever since OOW they mostly drop Beast Essense or some such crap for the beastlord epic.  Everything on the nightstalker drop table got way nerfed and they drop this stuff 75% or more of the time.</div></div><hr />

Even if you get class armor drops there you could hand it in for diamond(s) in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not a bad idea, thanks for the suggestions. i'm going to try to do some farming tonight with my usual 66 war/dru and a 65 war friend of mine, anyone have any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groovdog</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you looking to build DL faction as well do greens in DS. Drop 3-8pp in cash and often drop cash drops for 10-200pp. And with Druid DS u can mow them down. My ranger can take 6-8 at a time just self healing with gimp ranja heals. And the named drop cheapo bazaar crap that sells good for low level twinks. POJ Basement yields lots of gems as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't waste your time farming.  Get a good OoW group, get a single rune drop and sell it for 20-50k depending on the type and server economy.  Not only will you get some nice cash from it but you will get exp, faction, and possibly a dropped item for the OoW armor quests.  I think it's a much better way to spend your time...... plus you still get gem drops and such.  Farming sucks~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to Droga and snipe the nameds. Nothing there sees invis, so just run from spot to spot pulling the PHs. Things seem to pop pretty regulary. With a 66 beastlord I can keep 5 or 6 named PHs down easily. In a few hours I can usually get at least 5 drops, sometimes as much as 10. It'll be easier for you having two characters to loot them with. I use them for tribute most of the time, but almost all of them I could sell for anywhere from 2k up to maybe 15k (haste belt). Also, every critter in there usually drops between 8 and 15pp, along with the possibility of some vendor gems. There is also a small amount of experience tied to it.</div></div><hr />

Shhh......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the tip Groovdog, i plan on doing this when i get off work tonight. :) there should be a sticky threat for cash/gear farming and 2 boxing wars. I farm mostly because i cant get groups at 2am+ when i get home :(  im stuck at 5% 66 and ldon's are a joke. I cant hang in MPG and WoS is packed as hell. RCoD stays pretty deserted. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, another question: How do you pull the nameds ph in droga? do you park your healer in the corner and just uninvis/agro all three or so of the mobs in the area? i tried this once duo with the druids owner and it didnt go to well. of course i wasnt as well equipped but still heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do it solo in Droga *shrug* Two or three aren't really that hard. It's not like they hit for any real damage. Granted, I can slow, but I only have around 5300HPs self buffed and no healer to back me up. Most of the time you'll only get two anyway. The aggro radius in Droga is dinky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe it woulda been easier if i didnt have the druid lol. she got keeled after a heal.  do you use clicky haste gaunts? i keep my ornate bagged for the clicky heh. i can slow 35% with the willsapper and its stuck to them before so i'd imagine it will be fine. could i go in and rule them pretty much? last time i think i had right at 5300 unbuffed, now with proper buffs i hit 9.2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I'd never try it with my warrior. I do it with my main who's a level 66 beastlord. Poor Athrias would get owned in there vs. 3 lvl 60ish mobs =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">still though, think i could do it with 2 wars (65 friend of mine and myself) and a 66 druid for heals/etc? is there a safe spot i can park her say, in king room?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am positive that you'd have no problems at all. I can do is fairly easily with just myself tanking three monsters at once that are hitting for 200's or so max. Granted all three of them are gonna be slowed and one's gonna be chained stunned, but I have nothing but a 428 point heal and Paragon to keep me up, and I do it just fine. I am sure that you would basically steamroll through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks Arth, your replies have been most informative and helpful. thanks everyone else who posted, i got a nice big list of things to try now :)</div></div><hr />
