<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">because I´m stuck in Lev 61 and i cant move on. Why? Because i play now all the time LDON and one time i was in an average Lev 63 group and what should i say... I couldnt tank the mobs.... I lost my health too fast. And when we tried to kill a normal named mob i was like dead in 10 secs... the cleric couldnt heal me fast enough. I know i dont have enough AC but what should i do? My guild sucks but i also wouldnt like to to join a raid guild where i have to go on raids everyday. But buying all the good gear in the bazaar will take me take forever....<br />
I can tank the lev 60 group mobs ok but 63 is just impossible.<br />
Its just frustrating right now....<br />
Oh and btw... i hate these stupid slow pulling pallys...! :)</div></div><hr />

Didn't see a magelo but even with a group of 65's the mobs hit like Tier 1 mobs.  I know money can be hard to come by but just sounds to me like you need a lot of upgrades if you die that fast with stuff that doesn't hit for over 350ish unless you play on hard everytime :D</div></div><hr />

 (and no, my Magelo is not correct. Gotta fix it when I get out.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean the named Lev 63 mobs... they hit harder than the normal mobs... and as i said i do fine against lev 60 mobs....but for me it seems the increase between 60 and 63 is a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you may get hit a little bit less with extra levels but the difference between level 61 and 63 is a grand total of 100 or so hp's in 'real' terms. you won't tank a lot better at 63 than 61, therefore gear must be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well with Defensive it still shouldn't be to much of a trouble. Example with full group of 65's normal mobs hit near 350ish named near 550ish and I think usually on Assassination missions the boss hits near 800 or so.  So with Defensive no way you will be getting hit harder than like a PoV mob really probably not even that hard since you don't have all 65's in your group.  Sounds to me like you just need to get some upgrades post a magelo will be happy to give some mentions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">switch to 100 percent AA now, dinging will only make the problem worse.  Look for bazaar upgrades, and maybe think about undinging to 60, to get better AA exp and to try to insure you are not doing the average 63 LDoN dungeons.<br />
<br />
Save points for North ro or Everfrost and get the plate armor there.  (probably everfrost, it doesnt appear you can wait)<br />
<br />
Leveling to 65 isnt going to do you any good if the mobs just clean your clock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">De-dinging won't make the AA exp go faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">de dinging would also prevent getting easy pop aa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As i said. Right now i spend all my XP in AAs because it doesnt make sense to level to 62. But that was my point... now i CANT level up to 65 because i need to get better gear... well i dont think i suck sooooo much.<br />
Buffed i have around 5k Hps and 1080 AC... i know AC is too low... im working on it... just takes time.. and that pisses me off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cuedyen2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This problem gets worse with every expansion - people outleveling their gear.  Not sure if this is a sony or player problem.  Maybe there should be a minimum gear requirement to progress in levels /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not to sound cold, but your HPs sound really, really low. My wife runs a 63 cleric with no HP AAs and has over 4800 HPs buffed and the last time I ran with a warrior he was level 57 and had 6K buffed. I agree on the AC thing too. When I had my warrior he was over 1100 AC without buffs and could easily break 6K HPs with buffs at level 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It doesnt actually even sound possible :(<br />
<br />
Post your magelo if you are at 2600 hps (probably less given I guarantee you havent maxed out your stamina)<br />
<br />
I will get you 500-1000 hps for less than 20k. I can almost guarantee it.<br />
<br />
Jakle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">IMHO, AA and gear will help you more than any more leveling.  You probably need to fix a few trouble spots in your armor (people always seem to forget the non-visible armor slots, especially the mask/waist/neck, I've noticed).<br />
<br />
Maybe if we had a Magelo we could point out various trouble spots where you can get cheap upgrades. (note: Magelo is down at the time of this writing).  Getting at least 25-30 hp in every single slot, or any hp actually, will make a big difference, if you don't already have that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here is the link for my old warrior's magelo. It should give you some idea of upgrades that are easy to get as drops or bazaar purchases on a tight budget. The most expensive item he has is the BP and I think I paid 7K for it. He was poorly equiped, but it sounds like what he has would be an improvement.<br />
<br />
Carwenst the Deleted's Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=556110) <br />
<br />
The only item he had that was received via a raid was the Lurid Dagger, everything else was MQ, bazaar, or drop during an exp session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">buffed around 5k Hps and 1080 <br />
Jesus man, I'm lvl 59 with 3AA and I usually push pretty close to 6khp  and upwards of 1250AC buffed (virtue and lvl 59 or better shaman buffs), and my gear sort of sucks.  (Not terrible, but not great either;  Champs and worse).   Sounds like you need to spend some time farming cash and hit the bazaar, or con some of your friends into hitting kael for corroded plate drops.  Again, I'm not in a heavy raiding guild (read as:  Kael and UP for most raids), so if you can't fairly easily push past me in HPs/AC, your gear needs serious work.  You can get some stuff that has decent ac and hps on most slots relatively inexpensively.  Hell I paid 250pp for an ac12 hp35 mask the other day (fright forged mask I think it's called), auged it with a 5sta aug that dropped in Tak, and now I have roughly 65 extra hps.  You don't have to go all out and get huge gains from one item, just try to work it so that all of your armor has decent ac and at least a few hps on it.  I figure that you're probably on a similar budget to me(never have more than about 500-1000pp), so if you post a magelo link or list out the gear you have, I'll try to give you some advice on what upgrades you can make for cheap. (some folks around here think a 20k upgrade is cheap:)  )<br />
<br />
- Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hate to be the one who has to play the &quot;prick&quot; role but seriously...<br />
<br />
You are in a scenario where you have outlevelled your gear.    You're &quot;afraid&quot; to level, and you don't want to raid, or at least join a raiding guild.  You dont' appear to be able to press /disc evasive or /disc defensive for mobs that are apparently hitting you so hard that you can be taken out in less time than it takes for CH to land.   <br />
<br />
This game requires some things, one of which is to step off of the exp treadmill and collect gear.   If that means via tradeskills, farming hill giants, or small time nameds for small chunks of plat at a time, then do it.   Or get involved with a raid or something, just get some better gear, you are a damned warrior after all, you live and die by your gear, like it or hate it, it's a fact of life.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest getting off of the treadmill and doing something worthwhile.   <br />
<br />
Go to Sol B and camp the Efreeti, you'll either get boots that can still be sold for some nice plat (focus effect and nice stats for casters with your playstyle), or a ring that will be a nice upgrade.    <br />
<br />
Save up some Adventure points if you're doing LDoN and buy some armor, it's not that expensive for some nice upgrades.<br />
<br />
Go to Kael and get some armor, there's still people killing giants you know.<br />
<br />
Go to Western Wastes with 5 friends and kill some dragons, some of them have some nice sellable gear and/or neck pieces.<br />
<br />
Go to Siren's Grotto with a group, there's some nice gear dropping from there.<br />
<br />
Hell, go to Hate and exp, you can at least get some indo armor that can be worn and then turned in for experience later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok here is now my magelo link. <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=763509<br />
<br />
Right now I´m thinking of getting the Dented Kunzar War Helm or the Helm of Radulkan.<br />
But I cant decide. The dented has 23 AC and 8 STA and the Helm of Radulkan has 26 AC but only 4 STA... both have 35 HP.<br />
Hm which one is better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">:eek: <br />
<br />
Please do not take this as a put down.  I heartily agree with putting your aa to 100%.  At a bare minimum, bang out ND1-ND3, PE and PD1.  You need those hp aa quite a bit!  <br />
<br />
If possible, look into moving your haste OFF of you hands.  Even thrug (champ's) gaunts would a nice pair for the hand slot.  <br />
<br />
Probably the easiest and cheapest route would be to head to Kael and live in the arena or do the plate cycle (manor).  With exception to the bracers, each piece would be an upgrade.  For bracers, doing the benevolence quest in Western Wastes would be better bang for the plat.  While you are there, do the draconic pauldrons quest, too.  You'd be getting the necessary faction for the quests while hunting in Kael. <br />
<br />
If you do not feel like faction grinding, take a group and get to know veksar well, there armor that drops there is on par with champ's.  You'd be getting aa and plat at the same time, to boot.  <br />
<br />
Starting with one of those plans will help you quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Hm is the quest possible to do with a 57 cleric friend? Or do i need a group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow kaluas you sound alot like me. I decided awhile back that when I hit 60 it was AA over all till I got some more gear. Looking at youre maeglo then mine I see youre sta is alot lower so look for some sta as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">On your helm choice, they're both good...whichever is easier for you to get.  If you can get the dented, go for it.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
Veil of the executioner for face, or one of the many face items with 20-35hp.  I got a darkmetal visor for 1k, but I think he was wanting to get rid of it.  Comes from Veksar, another good camp place for good equipment btw.<br />
<br />
Thurg armor would be best for you, or if you can hammer out the LDoN points, that death embracer armor is looking pretty good compared to what you have (think it's only about 150 points?)<br />
<br />
I'd also go to WW and do the draconic pauldrons quest.  It has no hp, but 15ac 12str 12sta 5 svf/c.  It'd be a nice upgrade for those crested ones.  The quest is pretty easy, I'd say you could easily do it with a 57 cleric...a slower/haster would also be useful, you need good faction on CoV tho.  Don't think the Bracer of Benevolence is duoable at your level with a 57 cleric...would need a decent group.<br />
<br />
Change out those bracers and arms for thurg or death embracer armor or better, as well as those boots.<br />
For the neck, you can do the Qeynos badge quests, might take a bit of factioning tho...ends in a neck item with 6ac 6str 6agi 6int 6wis 40hp/mana and see invis as worn effect.  Really easy for you at 61, just takes some time and effort, bring a healer for the later parts, and probably need a group for last kill unless you know a druid that can kill him for you (rootrot awesome for Barduck).  Other options might be better, for all I know tho.<br />
<br />
Your BP, legs, waist and back are pretty good atm compared to the rest, as is your mainhand and right ear.  Your offhand is okay also, I'd be going for a Copper Hammer of Striking myself but your situation might be different.<br />
<br />
Bows, I'd be keeping an eye on in bazaar for a better one.  Unless you do some hardcore saving and farming, you're not gonna get one of the 100hp ones soon, but the other ones are nice.  Twisted longbow, or even the Nightmarewood ones are good.<br />
<br />
Other people probably have better ideas, and I don't know your server economy.  Frodlin is right, you've outleveled your gear and you're now feeling it bad.  Stop and go straight AA, while you get your gear more up to par and balanced, it'll take a little while, but in the meantime you'll get some AAs and can start getting some defensive AA that will also help you out (full ND is what I'd go for, CA as a secondary).  Then after you're content with your armor and AAs, work on getting to 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lueyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I should have explained a bit in my first post... got busy at work lol.<br />
<br />
What it sounds like is/has happened is that your dying before the initial ch.  So what I'm seeing is this.  You engage the unslowed mob.  Although CH could be started at any point... you said 10 seconds, so I'll assume the cleric starts casting at engage.  You never mentioned if the mob was slowed or not.  I'm guessing not.. due to resists or slower doesn't slow right away or no slows.  Before CH can land you are corpsed.<br />
<br />
First I guess the question asked is did you have a slower... when and if the mob was slowed.<br />
<br />
Did the cleric only use CH?  We have other heal spells, and although not as mana efficient they have thier place (like the initial few rounds of combat before a mob is slowed).  I would submit that the cleric probably should have hit you with a Heal over time just before engage, and possibly ducked ch for a faster casting spell as soon as they realized ch wasn't going to hit in time... which they should know in time to adjust.<br />
An alternative, which requires some timing and pre planning might be for the cleric to start CH even 5 seconds before engage... thus if you got knocked down to 20 percent in 5 seconds the ch would land around that area.  I'm assuming through all of this that the mob will be slowed at some point, and the cleric can relax and quit burning a lot of mana.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying you shouldn't look for gear upgrades, but I noticed Vamcoy replied to this saying you two had similiar gear... and he can tank PoV mobs which I think are even more dangerous then the ldon mobs you are talking about.  Yea gear is gonna help, but I'm sorry it shouldn't be affecting your survivability from the hp listed.  I dunno mabye I'm missing something here, but if you died and your cleric was not dead or OOM... well lets just say I think the cleric probably needed to do things a bit differently.</div></div><hr />

I should have explained a bit in my first post... got busy at work lol.<br />
<br />
First I guess the question asked is did you have a slower... when and if the mob was slowed.<br />
<br />
Did the cleric only use CH?     <br />
<br />
I think the problem was that the MT died... he had like 1400 AC and over 6k HP..... so prolly the cleric didnt know about my crappy gear and casted like before on the MT..... but actually i´m not sure if the mob was slowed or not.....<br />
And as i said if i have an average lev 60 group i can tank fine but the lev 63 average group mobs are much harder in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Here is another cheesy ass suggestion. I made myself a Chanter and worked myself to 29. Now this may seem a lame ass way to go but I sit in PoK casting clarity for a few hours a week and made enough plat to re-equip my warrior. I had retired and given all of my gear away to guildies and friends. This is a short cut but it is a decent way to make enough plat to upgrade your Warrior. In three weeks I was able to buy some FH pieces and now I have started upgrading those pieces. Honestly you need a lot of upgrades and either find a way to make plat without farming or take the time out of the game to farm yourself some upgrades. Once you have your warrior to where you want him then commence levelling at this point AA and make plat.</div></div><hr />
