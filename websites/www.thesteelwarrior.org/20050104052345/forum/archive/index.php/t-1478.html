<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
Recently, i purchased a TON of PP off of PA (call me an ebayer, does not matter to me), and i am looking to upgrade my warrior.<br />
<br />
Currently, he is wearing crusty/crafted, and weilding a veno axe and a frostbringer, with a bunch of crap for jewelery.<br />
<br />
For my weapons, i am going to go for BoC+SoD combo, but everything else i am in the dark on. I am looking for something to replace every item that i have. What should i go for in terms of armor and jewelery, and a 2hander as well. Keep in mind that PP is not a problem for me.<br />
<br />
**EDIT** BTW, my warrior is level 51.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure on your deity, but buy cultural armor...whatever matches. Buy Helm of Rallos Zek if money is no object, and boots of storm. Gloves grab velium encrusted.<br />
<br />
For earrings, grab some bloodmetal, rings go valorium.<br />
<br />
Have a look at some of the better magelos and check out the non-nodrop stuff...should help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot, im agnostic BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a much better ring than valorium out there now, band of flayed flesh, I think.  I don't remember if it's lore or not, but one of those should replace one valorium ring, at least.  <br />
<br />
Agnostics get screwed, deity armor is much better.  You might be better off buying MQ of Skyshrine armor, if that stuff is sold on your server.  <br />
<br />
No one mentioned haste, I think CoF is still the best droppable haste item.<br />
<br />
You'll be dual wielding when you are MT, but when you aren't MT you can't be swinging the BoC/SoD, you'll pull aggro away from the MT and people tend to get annoyed when that get happens, particularly in cases where there is a cheal rotation on the MT.  So you'll need something for when you aren't MT.  If plat is really no object, I'd recommend either a windblade or a war marshall's bladed staff for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Offer insane amounts of PP to your server's top guild to key you for the higher planes and VT and ST.  Then pay them even more piles o plat to loot the drops from there.<br />
<br />
After you have 8k HPs and 1700 AC enjoy mowing through the mobs in Tier 2,3 planes :rolleyes: You will be the coolest lvl 51 twink ever.<br />
<br />
This is what I would do if I had unlimited amounts of plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, my supply is not unlimited, it is however enough to buy a boc+sod, windblade or the other staff, +full smithed armor and or SS MQ + jewelery and other slots.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions guys, this should be sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thing, what should i get for belt, shoulders, face and neck? Should i just stick with the fine heraldic? or should i get something else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got all my shopping done, what do you guys think? Anything in there I should change?<br />
<br />
Ive got about 120k left over so let me know if anything needs to be changed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Featherwood Compound Bow. Has 10ac, 10sta, 100hp on it. Cost about 80-100k on Tarew. Decent range slot upgrade.<br />
<br />
And by the way I hate you. Having $$$ must be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Extremely nice :D<br />
<br />
Gotta love the rich parents who don't mind putting out RL $$$ for a game lol.<br />
<br />
**EDIT** Can't use a Featherwood till 61, any other suggestions i could use for that? Or should i just stick with the Nightmarewood till then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm with that cash, maybe you should hire some folks to PL you.  Think all you need now is just lvl's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never thought about PLing, thanks Lorre, maybe only till about level 60 or something, I'd rather gain the rest myself. <br />
<br />
Stupid me made this warrior as my main and I couldn't make more than like 1kpp a week, so I broke down and ebayed some lol.<br />
<br />
Looking at a bunch of other people's magelos, my gear should be fit with me up to lvl 65 until I get raid upgrades correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mosquito Leg earrings are the same or better than bloodmetals and a lot cheaper.  The earth crafted rings are better than yours and sell for 40-60k each.  Earthen resiliance i think?  Sell the sod its junk, buy a better weapon like Loathsome bludgeon of depravity, Split blade of destruction, fleshgrinder, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sold one of the bloodmetals and bought a mosquito leg.<br />
<br />
Sold both my rings and bought 2 of the earthen resiliance onces.<br />
<br />
Sold the SoD and bought the SBoD.<br />
<br />
Didn't need the SoD at all, I'm doing amazingly well without, once the BoC procs, thats enough to keep the mob on me.<br />
<br />
Im good with the gear now guys, thanks everyone who posted here, this should last me till I get to the elemental planes (and thats a LOOONG way away mind you :P lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look into Elbow Spiked Armplates, they are 40hp arms.  no stam, but that doesnt seem to be a prob for you atm, as you cap with buffs easily.<br />
<br />
Stonewood bow, 100hp.<br />
<br />
and please, if you can, get rid of the IGS for something with HP on it, IGS are nice, but well, they went out of style like 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghazad</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now go solo nagafan or something....:-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumelor</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i saw a bunch of people had Strength of the Elements as a shoulder item, so I thought, hey, the quest might be fun to do.<br />
<br />
Turns out a wizzy in my guild needed phinny for her epic, we went into kedge dropped him, didnt drop the wizzy staff, but it dropped one of the ore pieces. Told the guild i needed it for a quest so I got it. <br />
<br />
Next day, guild was gonna raid the hole for a few people's epics, turns out that Yael was up, so we said why the hell not, and dropped him, dropped the ore and I got it for my quest. Later that evening, I took a group to WW and dropped the air elemental for that piece of ore, got it.<br />
<br />
Then earlier today, went to SF and got the ground spawn and now I am wearing my new shoulders :D <br />
<br />
Me so happy :D<br />
<br />
Gonna keep the IGS as resist gear for certain situations though.<br />
<br />
<br />
**EDIT** Sold the Nightmarewood bow, got a guildie to make me a Stonewood bow for half price (180k full price on Fennin Ro, so i got it for 90k :D). Can't use it till 61 so I'm just using a Goranga Idol till then. I've got about 52k left now.<br />
<br />
Is there a better neck slot than Fine Heraldic Collar that I can get for 52k? Im sure there is.</div></div><hr />
