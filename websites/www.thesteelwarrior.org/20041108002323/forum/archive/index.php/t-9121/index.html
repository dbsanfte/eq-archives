<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone messed with this at all? Just noticed it tonight as I was topping up my pts reserve for the normal ac / hp buff. Bought 2 ranks in this to use whenever DI is usually applied, but I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere else. Expensive to leave running 24/7, rank3 is 100pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have not looked into it but they added one where there is a chance to rez when you die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have this and I don't ever turn on tribute anymore unless doing a boss thats actually dangerous! In 2 or 3 times i've died with dual ranks, never got rezzed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>R27</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Killed myself 16 times with level two in beta, never worked. It's so damn expensive for such a small chance, I doubt its worth using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesn't it only work if you actually have DI on? It gives a greater chance or something but doesn't give innate DI I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have used it at level 2 in a group (without DI up and 111 CHA). The group was not the strongest and we were pulling a rare in WoS so I clicked it on. I got down to 3-5% and it fired. Just like cleric/pally DA, I couldn't melee or be hit. Aggro bounced everywhere as a result. Bottomline: It was ugly.<br />
<br />
I can see in raids where this might be helpful. At least there you could spam for someone else to snag aggro. It would, at the very least, prevent rez and rebuff time. I am not sure I want to use it in a group again though... still pondering that one.<br />
