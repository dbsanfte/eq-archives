<br />
As you can see in my magelo I wield a BoC and an Anger3 augmented GBoS. With what should I augment the BoC? My favourite is another Anger3 augment. Or do I miss another interesting option here?<br />
<br />
Most of my time in EQ is spent tanking in a group (HoH, FoZ, normal LDoN, T1 sewers). I am raiding only about 20% of my time atm and thats pre-elemental stuff. Often I am MT there also. If not I go 2handed with my War Marshall´s Bladed Staff.<br />
<br />
I know this is not the right forum for an AA question but I dont like to split my post. I finished Ambidexterity yesterday. YAY!!  :D In an average week I manage to aquire about 5 AAs.  I havent decided yet what to do next. Maybe you can help me.<br />
Option 1: WA 1-3 for 12 AAs (especially nice once I have an augment in the BoC)<br />
Option 2: Ferocity, Combat Fury 1 for 11 AAs and then Flurry<br />
<br />
Since I use a 2hander only in the rarest cases, I think I leave Punishing Blades for later. <br />
<br />
Sturdiness 1 and 2 would be nice, but I figure my HP as sufficient for what I am doing. At least no healer has yet complained.  :p So I would rather spent the 12 AAs somewhere else.<br />
<br />
I prefer to do Option 1 followed by Option 2. Any suggestions on this setup are highly welcome!  :) <br />
<br />
Due to RL I dont have much EQ time in summer. I want to use this summer to build up a solid raid tank, hoping to see the elementals in early autumn. Maybe you can consider that goal in your recommendations.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Nope. Go anger 3.<br />
<br />
Option 1: WA 1-3 for 12 AAs<br />
<br />
I'd get sturdiness 1 and maybe 2 after that... it's probably worth the points for the return at that low of cost. DPS AAs are important, but frankly the added aggro is better, and the low levels of sturdiness are too, in my opinion. If you want to raid in the EPs, get sturdiness done and WA done for the ass kicking factor, then worry about your DPS. Tanking doesn't require DPS, and EP guilds won't care if you have any of those AAs. They'll care about your hp/ac primary, aggro secondary for your application.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Switch your weapons. Mainhand the GBoS until you anger 3 your BoC at very least, maybe keep it mainhand afterwards. You're only getting 4 procs per minute when you should be getting 5.</div></div><hr />
