<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Burst DPS:<br />
1. Wizard<br />
2. Ranger<br />
3. Mage<br />
<br />
Sustained DPS:<br />
1. Rogue <br />
2. Ranger<br />
3. Mage<br />
4. Necro<br />
5. Beastlord<br />
ect.</div></div><hr />

Monks aren't too bad either but they tend to not get in with bards for additional attack and overhaste, and the beastlords tend to give fero to the rogues.  I'd put in necros up there for good burst damage also (depending what you consider burst.. ie a 3 minute fight)<br />
<br />
Drop the rangers down a bit and put in monks and wizards for sustained.  Ranger dps becomes less and less obvious as you progress into Time and pure melee dps starts to get better.<br />
<br />
There will be some variation depending on mob resists, any ae silence or mana drain, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Although they are often involved in a number of other aspects of the fight, if the raid has enough target-slots open for a couple of necros to really stack up the DoTs I would imagine they can become fairly frightening.  In a situation that allows pet use, WTD or (of course) charmed pets as well they should very likely be near the top for sustained damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
usually pet classes own in sustained dps so mages/bl plus depens on skill of the player and how awake are they. So whatever you see here is more a matter of personal opinion then anything. So the real answer is: it depens.<br />
<br />
rog/wiz/mag/bst/rng/nec all good at dps period in most of the situations<br />
SK are good for burst dps<br />
ench/dru/nec/mag own when they can charm<br />
then there are all the rest of the classes</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't really think of any elemental / time raid situation where any classes will charm, except possibly in plane of fire if you pull the mephits from the lava tunnel but that's more effort than it's worth.</div></div><hr />

Ok, but don't forget the fact that a wizard who chain casts white fire is a dead wizard, especially if they do it from the get go.  Factor in the fact that they have to cast concussion in there and there is recast delay associated with concussion as well (although that is limited w/elemental legs).  Also factor in that a wizard who chain casts white fire is an oom wizard.   ;)</div></div><hr />

80% Of wizards with White Fire will have Elemental pants :)<br />
<br />
As for the Agro factor ... <br />
A well geared tank (BP + DBoW/EoE + Full AA + Full Augment) is insane agro.<br />

True, but you still have to cast concussion from elemental pants, and there is still some time involved in between each cast of white fire due to that.  I honestly am not at the end game, but I know that even with Strike of Solusek and casting concussion in between every nuke with SCS3 I still took aggro off a BoC/GBoS equipped warrior.  However, of course that's a different equation than a warrior equipped with DBotW and EoE or even BoW with Anger procs.  I still believe you need to use concussion in order to avoid stealing aggro no matter how good the warriors weapons and procs are.  And also still a wizard chain casting White Fire is an oom wizard.   :)</div></div><hr />

If you had 1100 DPS for 660 minutes, you would have done 726k damage solo. Grats 7 person AoW kill :)<br />

<br />
Sorry man, that is just wrong.  Sure, if you have a high downtime group or you are hitting a quick raid target a wizard might be able to chain cast White Fire due to their starting mana pool, but overtime in a high uptime group a wizard cannot chain cast White Fire.  Let's use simple logic.<br />
<br />
White fire is 700 mana.  Let's figure they have some mana preservation and with specializations that on average it only costs 500 mana.  Cast time is 8 seconds, well a wizard with white fire is probably in the 6 sec cast time range, with a recast delay of 2.5.  So that's around an 8 sec cast time using 500 mana.  You are telling me you have wizards that regen 500 mana in 8 seconds?  That's about 400 mana per tick regen while standing, since you have to stand to cast.  Think about it, it's not possible. <br />
<br />
Also, think about the fact that white fire does 3k damage, probably more like 4k avg at least with focus and crits.  That's 4k dmg every 8 seconds, which equates to 500dps.  Sorry but wizards do not have sustainable 500dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, yea.  Enchnater pets in tipt (the crags) do around 1200 dps plus they proc like mad (which is what? 263 dd?) and the proc isn't counted in my parser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvak</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Necromancers are the class i can speak on the most. Many overlook them for burst dps although with recent expansion additions they have gained alot of this.<br />
<br />
When debating dps, the biggest factor is how situational you are going to consider.  What is burst dps? i usually consider this a two to three minute encounter - nice and sweet where discs do a large portion of the dps.<br />
<br />
With the addition of things like wake the dead and Swarm of Decay, Lifeburn etc necromancers have gained a large portion of dps.  Necromancers can stack near 2k a tick if they are using every dot/recourse possible to them with focus, and thats not taking into account critical affliction which adds a nice chunk overall to that figure.  2k a tick x 10 ticks a minute = 20k dmg a minute dots, pre crits.  Now ofcourse you have to figure in that is situational, for the first minute you are only usually doing around 6k(dot/recourse) + your max hp(LB) +pet +SoD. This is due to the fact that for the first minute you are starting your stack, first 6 seconds you only get up to one tick of your highest dmg dot, 2nd tick you get first stack'd dot plus the second, and so on.  With a nicely equipped necromancer it is very feasible to break 13k + critical affliction + pets in the first minute.<br />
<br />
Necromancers shine in sustained damage on top of that dps... every minute after that keeping just recourse on without factoring in pets or critical affliction you can keep around 18k in dots on per minute. <br />
<br />
Understand that SoD pets hit change over 300 an arrow, and 3 of them are summoned instant cast - although with a thirty minute refresh on the ability it really only factors into the first minute in most cases.  Summoned pets on the otherhand do have nice sustained aggro bumping the necromancers burst and sustained dps up that much more - although in alot of sitautions pets are not used.<br />
<br />
So basically in a 3 minute fight an elemental necromancer that knows what hes doing, NOT factoring in resists of the mob but also not factoring in critcal affliction can lay down around 50k dmg + pet + SoD + WTD. In a 3 mintue fight thats 278 dps w/o even factoring in the three pets hitting for 300ish max, the pet quading for 80ish max, or the WTD pet quading for 80ish max when hes not casting spells, or critical affliction.  All this added on is a very nice chunk of damage, but this is even more situation to try to throw in a solid number due to mob ac, normal pets being used, and random hits of mobs.<br />
<br />
But like i said, necromancers shine in the ability to also keep this dps up... being over 100 mana per tick raid buffed with a large mana pool it is quite easy to keep all dots stacked on a mob casting them as they drop as long as there is enough buff slots on the mob to make this possible.<br />
<br />
I think alot leave necromancers out on burst dps just because you dont see many necromancers landing shiny crits over 6k, but they parse very highly in my experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite right.  It's more like...   16 classes.  One tank, one healer, one slower, everyone else fighting the same bland pissing contenst called DPS.<br />
<br />
This simplifies things a bit since crowd control, pacification, and pulling are also important skills.  So classes such as enchanters who not only can slow, but can handle pacification and crowd control, as well as DPS with charm, are heavily desired.  Also note that clerics who fit into the healer role can pacify.  So those classes are very heavily in demand.  Monks get the pulling benefit to add to their DPS, and SK's get the pulling benefit to add to their tanking.  Wizards have high DPS but evac capabilities as well as stun, crowd control.  Druids have heals and evac to add to their DPS.  Rogues have lockpick to add to their DPS and SoS for corpse dragging.  All of the DPS classes have other abilities to augment their desirability to groups, but when it comes down to it, when those three primary slots are filled, tank, healer, slower, any other class can fill the remaining slots.</div></div><hr />
