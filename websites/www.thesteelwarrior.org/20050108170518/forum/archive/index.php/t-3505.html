Just starting to see about TZ, and VZ and well any info on them would be helpful,  We tried lining up on the wall for TZ and using archery but that went badly.<br />
Would really appreciate any feedback possible on these two <br />

Your's in War<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do as before on TZ, but make each group self-sufficient in terms of healing, i.e. give each group a priest of some kind and tell the group members to know where their healer is.  No single person is likely to be hit twice in a row and you can spread the force around 2 or even 3 walls.  Archery is surprisingly effective against this guy, I did about 60 DPS with a stonewood bow and mage arrows.  We also had a handful of knights assigned to super-aggro Tallon and fight him in melee range, and a couple of healers to keep them alive, but I'm not convinced that it made any difference to the outcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As pointed out the key to this encounter is spreading out your raid force.  You do not want Tallon to turn one direction and immediately AE 50%+ of your raid force.  Personally what we do is divide the groups up as evenly as possible to the 4 corners of the room.  Then we use a couple paladins chain casting stuns that attempt to keep him looking at a wall between two corners.  TZ has a pretty hefty knockback on his melee so at times he likes to turn suddenly as well as his shadowstep.  But if the tanks know what they are doing (and people are smart enough to move if something goes wrong) there is no reason for this fight to get messy.  And what I meant by people being smart enough to move, if you notice TZ facing you that means it's time to get out of the way pretty simple.<br />
<br />
As for VZ it is a pretty interesting fight the first time you go through it and if you haven't already read up on the encounter I would hate to ruin the surprise.  Most people will tell you that the VZ encounter is very easy and that is true if you know what to expect, just don't go in expecting to just attack and have VZ fall over dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On TZ my guild had a paladin DA, run to the far right side corner and then start throwing every aggro spell that he had.  The clerics did their CH rotation from long range and we totally slaughtered him.  Just a huge storm of arrows.  Keep everyone spread out in case you get an aggro burp and he fires an arrow at someone who isn't your knight MT.  Cake fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togr</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On TZ don't have all your tank types just blindly rush him, if they do one proc and they all get throw away and TZ will start arrowing your casters till they run back.  Instead have several plate classes hover around arrowing until he procs the ones currently engaged and sends them flying.  Soon as they get proc'd on send another one or two in and have them do everythign to get agro until they get sent flying.  Should be easy to continue like this and have minimal procs going off on your casters who can't take it much.<br />
<br />
VZ have a wizard cast an eye that is sent between the waiting VZs, have your tanks /assist him on call to get your targets, the wizard can easily then target /assist each tank to make sure they are all on different ones.  And always always push them away from the center of the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't even touch him with melee.<br />
<br />
Just spam pets and archery. As long as each group can heal themselves the ae's wont be an issue. Spread out through the room and have everyone use archery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we use the same idea on TZ with the hybrids agroing spread out somewhat in center of room, rest on walls around the room.<br />
On VZ like was said have someone with eye send out target and each melee grab assist on one each of the 5, pull the &quot;real&quot; VZ hits for 900ish max the &quot;fake&quot; ones 400ish so whoever has &quot;real&quot; call it and kill rest first, then kill &quot;real&quot;, at 60% he pops 5 new ones. Rinse repeat 4 times till down to last &quot;real&quot; one. The one main difference we have from other posted here is we all peg em with an arrow into back right(entering room)corner instead of fighting in middle. This way you can wait a minute to retarget each wave. VZ=wuss, TZ =somewhat more involved battle.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretarget the 5 split vzs if you like and have your main vt tank stand there with no target, as soon as the real vz aes he will pop on your target, he also hits for 800 max, fakes hit for 500.  Tz is a zergfest really because he shadowsteps. Ae fire and dr are pretty important here, fire is 3k dd and dr is 40% slow + dot.  What we do on the rz ring version is a bit different but you will have to suffer when the time comes and learn it=p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Tz is a zergfest really because he shadowsteps&quot;<br />
<br />
Nah, with the right strategy he could be killed with just a few groups, easily.  All range, an figure out a way to deal with his AE arrows (lots of ways have been suggested).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">arrows are neg 100 fr check..on top of his neg 300 sv all debuff.  Either you need to have awsome gear for killing him the FIRST time, or it is a zergfest period end of story.  Fact is anyone killing tz the first time isnt going to be able to resist the fr unless they dispell his debuff, and since they are just kiling him now i am sure they wont be able to/are experienced enough to dispell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wasn't talking about resisting his AE's.  The best way to 'resist' an AE is simply to not get hit with it to begin with.  I said 'deal with' the AE, not resist it.<br />
<br />
Having a pally stand in the middle of the room getting long-range heals, just sitting there stunning to keep aggro, is one common way.  Everyone else in a big circle using range.  <br />
<br />
We had exactly one &quot;zergfest&quot; with TZ (all of 50 people OMG zerg), the very first time we did him, since we tried the standard MT/heal the MT strategy on most fights in EQ.  Didn't work (well, it 'worked' but damned it was a messy fight), so we adjusted our strategy and now it's a pushover.<br />
<br />
Main key is to just not have anyone close to anyone else; so that if anyone happens to get aggro, they are the only ones hit.  I think our last few kills of this, tho (which were a couple months ago, don't kill him much anymore) we didn't have anyone take a single point of damage.</div></div><hr />
