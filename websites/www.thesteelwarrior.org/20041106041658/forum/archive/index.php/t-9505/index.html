<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok have been a lurker for a long time and truly do like all that I read here.  Now it is time to ask for some all around gear advice.<br />
<br />
I am working on LDoNs to get augs I really like the HPs and AC I can get there to add.  <br />
<br />
If you see any gear that is way out and I need to upgrade right away let me know.  Im not time flagged but am constantly in EP since I got my flaggs.   <br />
<br />
Heard there is a haste item in Fire I might want to look at,   However I have no idea where that guy is or what it would take to get to him.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
Basher</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A bit of a side note first - Seems yout charm isn't reflecting the flags you have, not to mention the adventurers stone must have improved some as well. Forgot to update the magelo I guess ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">:( Ok I dont know how to update my magelo to show stats on that thing.  LOL but Im have flagged for all of the EP No Time and dont go to GoD much.  Im just Water and Air from Time.  I have done all the LDoN's to obtain at least 1k points in each event.<br />
<br />
Dont see how that has to do with what my original post was though.  Oh well if you guys could please help me out with the original post most appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warhead42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have access to all planes, your charm should be at 90%.  If you go under manage this character (or something like that, I'm at work and can't look it up), there's a section that asks for the bonus on your charm, as a percentage (0-200).  Since you have 9/10 upgrades (you'll get your 10th as soon as you are flagged to enter time), the charm should be 90%.<br />
<br />
As far as your adventurer's stone, divide the number of wins in each camp by 10 (drop any remainders), add the results up and multiply by 2 for the percentage on your adventurer stone.  It's not based on the number of points you've earned, but the number of wins you have.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes, I can't check magelo from work, but I doubt I'd be able to help, as I'm nowhere near being EP flagged yet :(  Best of luck, I hope that helps with getting your charm updated in your magelo.</div></div><hr />

You might want to look into one of them new fancy 40% haste augments.<br />
I believe they are playermade ... might wanna go find what items / slots they are for.</div></div><hr />

I dont hunt in PoF that much anymore though due to never being able to get a group there.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the great info on how to do that.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the ideas.  I truly want to get a new sword hehe its called a BoC lol but might take me a while.   BoW is another want .<br />

Wondering if I should throw that hate Aug on my CHoS and use that instead.  Only thing is I drop alot of stats by doing that.  Not sure which would be better way to go.</div></div><hr />

check the stats on your charm in game, then start putting random numbers into the charm completion thing in the update page on magelo until the magelo stats match the in game ones.  only people who pay for premium magelo and do live update get the automatic syncing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Wondering if I should throw that hate Aug on my CHoS and use that instead. Only thing is I drop alot of stats by doing that. Not sure which would be better way to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
As a general rule, I always figure that for MT'ing, hate generation of the weapons you're using &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;everything else. So, hate aug your best aggro generating weapon and tank with it.<br />
It can make me wince to give up the &quot;free&quot; stats on a weapon to use something with more hate. But if your group/raid can ramp its damage up to take advantage of your additional aggro, the fight should be shorter and the damage you take ultimately less than the damage the stats would save you in a longer fight.<br />
That's the theory, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bolomir Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">look at my magelo and compare..seems we're at about the same spot..you just have one more flag than me hehe<br />
<br />
most of it is easy to get, so shouldnt be too too hard to upgrade</div></div><hr />
