<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All that tells me is that the knight epics need more AC.  =P<br />
<br />
If you want to compare the Matchless Silver Claymore to a comparable weapon, you should use Bonecleaver, the non-warrior version.  They have comparable ratios, both have high aggro procs, and the MSC has more AC.  All 2handers in OoW so far with superior AC have inferior ratios and procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">10-16-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">msc only had mana removed, nothing else.  considering lack of mods, proc mod, and AC, it's really not much more than a toy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are overestimating the AC of the average 2hander.  One of the biggest disadvantages to using a 2hander over a dual-wield setup is that the user will usually have a lower AC and lower hp than they would, otherwise.  A 2hander with 60+ AC is the exception, not the rule.  OoW has shown us only two of these that I have seen.   The Fang of Feratha has exceptional AC, but is inferior in every other way.  Crystallia has decent AC, but is eclipsed by the weapons from the MPG raid trials, by far.<br />
<br />
A warrior who is dual-wielding 1handers which are not warrior-specific are not likely to have more than 35 AC on either weapon.  Even Thunderclap stays true to this.  55 AC with hard-ass innate proc aggro versus 70 AC (20-33 per weapon more common than 35 on both) with mostly DPS and augment aggro... I dont see how it would be a difficult choice.<br />
<br />
Edit:  For warriors that already have a DBoW or BBoB, this would be a toy.  For warriors using a bag full of A3 augmented weapons that are neither of these, it is a beast.</div></div><hr />

Though I'd think wielding 2 1.5 1H weapons would beat it... but besides Thunderclap I haven't seen a 1H with good ratio and a good proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I replaced my Darkblade and Epic 1.5 / Jagged Onyx Staff with the Matchless claymore 2 nights ago and i've found its aggro capabilities to be suprising. Combined with awesome DPS and my symbol of the planesmasters proc and ykesha augged, its quite the aggro machine.  The great thing about it is it can take aggro just by sheer DPS.  I dont know if any of your guilds have high end berserkers but they tend to get aggro a heck of a lot in my guild because of berserkers pure ratio weapons and output, this fits that type of standard but has an innate proc that only 2 other weapons in the game currently have (Brutish blade and Darkblade)-<br />
<br />
I think that you guys are underestimating it, its a crazy weapon, and darkblade/JoS/epic1.5 is nice too but Ive been starting to get bored of using a primary from 3 expansions ago and this one feels very promising.  I have yet to have problems in EXP groups and raid situations tanking with this.  Running up to a mob and hitting with a flurry of 500's and landing a successful taunt can be more aggroing than an early proc by someone else easily, landing an anger or stun proc is sure enough to hold you over, so while having 3 procs is less than having 5 procs, the dps makes up for alot of it and i've found it to be at least equal in all situations or in some situations more aggro-effective and helpful to the raid in general.  The downside is I lost about 80hp or so from having a dual setup, but i'm not a magelo braggert :p so I dont really mind what others think that I have a 2h weapon listed as my primary sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DPS is not a toy.<br />
<br />
In almost every situation, a warrior's dps is a toy.  I'd be interested in seeing a parse of this weapon's dps versus a BBoB primary DW setup, as I do not expect that it truly is putting out vastly superior damage.  The first night a warrior in our guild got this, he started complaining about &quot;how two-handers procced so rarely.&quot;  Perception is groovy, but cold, hard numbers still interest me more than estimates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DPS is not a toy.<br />
<br />
Though I'd think wielding 2 1.5 1H weapons would beat it... but besides Thunderclap I haven't seen a 1H with good ratio and a good proc.<br />
<br />
I also weighed this into my equation, a warrior who wields a thunderclap in my guild with a darkblade, that was originally going to be what I was going to have as my setup, he had me on DKP though so I took the time to observe how he did. Its a nice setup, but I find I can be as equally aggroing in any situation if I desire to be with the claymore but put out alot more dps at the same time while spending less DKP for wielding 1 weapon over 2 (in my guild this can be an issue at times since items are becoming more and more expensive with omens).  I'd assume that if my claymore went on a dry spell for a while that it could be noticably ineffective versus a dual combo that has the chance to NOT go on a dry spell as often as a 2hander would, but it happens to ALL weapons, its just a factor of luck at times.  I also find that when my Claymore goes on a luck-spree it has the potential to beat out anything even my dual setup (Darkblade/JoS or Epic 1.5 dual ykesha augged) because of its superior output especially coupled with flurry's and a damage disc or the like.  Its really subjective, and its underestimative to say this is just a dps toy when in fact its a very viable option and of course the new model makes ya feel newer than a people running around with 3 expansion ago weapon models .(Think I had my Blade of War almost a year and a half ago and i've had to have that model of a weapon ever since with Darkblade till now to be effective as a tank with no other real option that was significantly different in any way shape or form)  <br />
<br />
Anyway, just had to post my defense case here because I think that most of you with maybe the exception of one or two people here have actually had the chance to try this out with a good aggro augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I dont know of a mob nor do I own a parsing program to test this on.  I do know that a monk in my guild with a 71/32 staff from Txevu which is very similar in ratio to this weapon being 73/33- parsed on the Queen  and King in Riftseekers (approx 5-6 minute fight) at upwards of 370 DPS.  Now I know we dont have the same output of monks and skills but based on other parses done we are about 20dps give or take a few less depending.  On the same mob using my dual setup with Darkblade / Epic 1.5 I was parsing at a few points over 200dps-  These are small windows of reference and i'm just basing these on others parses, havent yet had someone parse this sword in action for long enough to call it a reliable test... so welcome to suggestions if you all really want to know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're not always the MT.  Even when you're the MT, your DPS is still significant, especially in the days of 54 man raids.  <br />
<br />
I don't know why so many people think DPS doesn't matter, not to mention DPS is also one of the most reliable ways to aggro.  I can sometimes hold aggro with a Great Maul of the Mighty if I really wanted to which has basically no aggro on its proc.<br />
<br />
I sometimes wonder if those complain Warriors being chained to procs are only like that because they consciously make decisions to be tied forever to procs.  You should really look at how a monk tanks sometimes.  They can't taunt.  They have no +hate skills besides exploiting Instill Fear, and yet they can hold aggro quite well compare to most people, because their insanely high ratio weapons can hold aggro by just swinging.</div></div><hr />

if you went for pure tanking.<br />

I went 100% Pure tanking (and even regred Kelek range over Lodestar).<br />
0% Accuracy<br />
4% Striketrough<br />
160 Worn ATK<br />
<br />
I am still amazed at the DPS i manage to do full AA with 65/35, and wont try to imagine<br />
what it could be with Some Ferocity / Cleave / Max ATK etc etc.<br />
However i think that would be detrimental to our core role (pure tanking).<br />
<br />
People dont think we can do serious dmg when hearing 400-600 dps rogue/wizards.<br />
But for someone with pathetic offensive gear, i am amazed at my dps.<br />
With a couple of buffs those 930 flurry's go on all night long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing I like about my BoW is that I can use it when I am a couple tanks down the list and not steal aggro from a dual wielding tank, but be right behind him if he goes down.  I dual wield when I'm main tanking, use a 2-hander with no aggro proc on it for when I know I don't want aggro, and use the BoW when I want to be somewhere in between.  Once I get a better dual wield setup I will most likely take the A3 augment out of my BoW for this reason, because although it doesn't happen a lot, I will sometimes steal aggro with the BoW early in the fight.  <br />
<br />
Were I at the top end content, I would be interested in getting an MSC for this reason, but you still need the *real* aggro weapons like a darkblade or BBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All i'm saying is, this is a &quot;real&quot; aggro weapon, just as Blade of War was a &quot;real aggro weapon&quot; when it was discovered before darkblade came out to beat it.  So far this is on line with darkblade and has the potential to be more aggroing depending on the situation and get the job done with more DPS output :) and a new look, so thats why I like it, and will probably continue to use it, meritting that no other supreme 1hs comes out like darkblade did to put the 2hander to shame... will see how it goes, but I think it will be a reliable weapon throughout this expansion as its a class specific and only two other weapons in the game currently hold the proc it has, I dont think it was intended as a toy.</div></div><hr />
