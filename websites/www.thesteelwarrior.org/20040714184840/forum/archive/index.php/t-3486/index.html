<br />
 When you first get flurry it doesnt go off a lot , but as you add more AA it starts to trigger a lot . The way it works is IF you get a triple attack , you have a chancee to flurry on top of that , so anything helping you get triple attacks will help , such as ferocity or punishing blade.<br />
<br />
 Useing a blade of war , i typically flurry 2-3 times over a 40ish second fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maxing flurry is one of the most rewarding series of AA's to me. . .it takes a big commitment, but it's like so super sweet!  When flurry was first added, everyone was like &quot;what, no one else can see when you flurry? What a gip!&quot;  But now, after maxing flurry and seeing how much it goes off. . .the ammount of flurry spam on a raid with 10 warriors would be rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't know... I think we should be allowed to spam people with  it! Hey, I can't turn off slay undead crits so would seem fair to allow others to see it if they wanted to. Just make it filterable and while you're at it make it so I can turn off slay crits and pets casting spells and stuff. :rolleyes: Not likely!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One thing i have wondered about , ,is does flurry work on a different hit/miss or skill lvl as opposed to regular attacks? Flurry attacks sure seem to miss or get ripostes/dodges/parried etc A LOT. <br />
<br />
Keeping in mind that a flurry is additional attacks ON TOP of a triple attack round , so it is at least 4 attacks as i understand it.<br />
In the example parse above only ONE flurry has landed more than 1 hit, several dont hit at all. So wtf is up with that. I have a feeling it has been stealth nerfed , maybe from day 1.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kacnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shrug! Haste means more ripostes too, but we take haste, right? Flurry is a nice agro aid, especially on initial agro if it goes off.<br />
<br />
When I have agro ensured, I turn off attack in bits anyway, to avoid ripostes.<br />
<br />
Love the dps when i'm not tanking as well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I love flurry, nothing better than a 2k damage round in elementals.<br />
Actually had it happen in earth:<br />
3 hits for 321 points and 2 crits for 528 with BoW <br />
<br />
but probably a once in a lifetime thing.<br />
<br />
All in all not a first choice for a raiding MA but certainly a nice one for younger warriors on raids that are mostly doing dps from side/behind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nothing beats that feeling you get when you see that first message in bright yellow text &quot;you unleash a flurry of attacks&quot; <br />
even better than when i first saw the &quot;you avoid a stunning blow&quot; message</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;You shake off the stun effect&quot; is surely up there for first time seeing it feeling, knowing that even though its almost worthless my symbol indeed still works~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont buy it choppin, since I cant see anything like it (Where the mob actually hits me also) in my own logfiles. Not pre pop not pre ldon and not during ldon either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Moze Emdoyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You know... Ive seen this argument before that flurry CANNOT be riposted and would LOVE to see some parses on it...  Frankly I think this is a myth which has been perpetuated by the ignorant.  Ive never seen ANYTHING posted in skills information or otherwise that has said that flurries have some sort of special code assigned to them exempting them from ripostes.<br />
<br />
I cant even see a reason why SoE would include such a code into flurry... They want to make stuff HARDER for us not easier..<br />
<br />
Until I see some solid parses I think its safe to assume that flurry attacks get treat exactly the same as any other attack... Its subject to riposte dodge parry etc...  Unless someone can point to their logs and say, &quot;Hey look! I parsed flurry for 12 hrs and NEVER EVER got riposted.&quot;  Otherwise I wish people would just stop perpetuating myths :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jateki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I believe that it's all based on swings. When you swing, that swing can miss or it can land for a single, double or triple hit. Your offensive AA also has a chance of working per swing, Flurry, Punishing Blade, Ferocity, whatever. <br />
<br />
The mob also has a chance to evade your swing, dodge, parry, riposte, whatever. If it is indeed per swing, then you would be in no additional danger of taking riposte damage on a flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Jateki makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">actually here is the way I believe it to work...<br />
<br />
Round begins....<br />
<br />
Start Attack<br />
<br />
do Swing Primary<br />
if (Double attack check = True) Then do Swing Primary<br />
if (Double attack check = True) And (Triple attack check= True) Then do Swing primary<br />
if (Double attack check = True) And (Triple attack check= True) AND (Flurry check = True) Then do Swing primary And do Swing Primary<br />
if (Dual Wield check = True) then do Swing Secondary<br />
if (Dual Wield check = True) AND (Double attack check = True) Then do Swing Secondary<br />
<br />
End Attack<br />
<br />
Ambidexterity helps dual wield<br />
Ferocity helps Double attack<br />
Punishing Blade helps Double attack With 2hs..<br />
<br />
With this it seems that a dual wielding warrior can attack up to 7 times and a 2hs warrior up to 5 times.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that EVERY swing can be dodged/block/riposte etc.<br />
And every SWING can hit or miss, I believe on each swing there is also a seperate CRITICAL check, otherwise It seems we would run long strings of crits every time we flurried and critted.<br />
<br />
Of course I may be completely wrong and off my rocker..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sscaley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I first got flurry, during Luclin I did, on several occasions, actually hit a mob through it's enrage. Mind you, this was before Tactical Mastery was in the game.<br />
<br />
Add to this that mob flurries and rampages are un-ripostable, it might not have anything to do with each other, but it serves merely as a pointer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm pretty sure punishing blade is a seperate attack not an increase to double attack.  So that you can quad at times with punishing blade and no flurry.  So max atacks possible is 6 with flurry with 2h'rs and not 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You know, <br />
<br />
I really wish the Devs would just sit down and explain all of these with the actual mechanics. <br />
<br />
The suppositions and beliefs are things that as level 65 warriors and thousands of battles we really shouldnt have any question as to how they work.<br />
<br />
Again casters really get it easy, everything about spells is on Lucy or other information pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, but then what fun would that be?</div></div><hr />
