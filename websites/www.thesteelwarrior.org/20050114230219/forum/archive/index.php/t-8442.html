<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greatdark</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I know a while back EQ made Naggy/Vox a level 52 limit.  My 56 warrior is pretty well off in gear and my epic cleric friend is good in the gear and know how department and is level 54.  If we deleveled to 52 with the correct buffs on do you all think that naggy and/or vox are duoable?  I'm thinking that pre PoP he was soloable with a 60 and now that better, much better at that, gear is here why cant the dragons be beat with a warrior and cleric buffed?  What weapons and tactics would you all think is the best way to tackle this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 52 a warrior would not have enough dps to take out Naggy with a level 52 cleric's mana pool to heal. Getting feared could be an issue along with the cleric having to heal himself.<br />
<br />
If the cleric were 65 they could bind in naggys lair and heal the warrior, get banished, gate back in, heal, banish, gate, heal, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
to answer your question with a long answer, watch this video of 2 monks killing naggy/vox.       Click here to watch naggy movie (http://www.hawka.com/naggy_0001.wmv) - Click here to watch vox movie (http://www.hawka.com/Vox_0001.wmv) - click here to watch my guild do the 5 solro mini's. (http://www.hawka.com/sol%20ro2_0001.wmv)<br />
<br />
Click here if you want to see more movies of this type on our kills/website heh.  (http://www.caguild.org) <br />
<br />
note: all have music.<br />
<br />
the wins are dependant on pre-buffs+tribute+potions, i'm sure any 52 could kill these 2 drags with the right stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kxorth</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a friend who kills nagafen and vox on two servers after each patch with a 52 monk and 65 druid.  Feign death completely owns it (also, he deleved the monk from 65 and it has a lot of AAs and loot from NToV).  Whether or not a warrior could do it at 52 with a 52 cleric.. I would say yes.  However, it would require some twinkage, tribute, and probably a bunch of AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Watched the naggy video and saw the MT monk fd out of combat and probably get healed then unfd real fast to keep aggro.<br />
I think :p</div></div><hr />

For the very, very very large majority of people, the answer to this is no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both have been solo'd by a twinked monk. I would imagine it could be done by a warrior with some good weapons (2x SoD would be pretty good). It does require liberal use of stinging wort potions, so it can get pretty expensive until you get some good drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been told the best way to do this is a mage/shm combo. Get aa's and gear for mage  along with epic. then D-lvl take a shm to heal pet and (cant remember if nagafen is slowable or not) Ya I wached the movie also. I saw how nagafen ran down the hall after who ever was healing him. Wich would = 2 monks did not duo this fight. If they did it would be them and nobody healing them thus making it imposible for nagafen to run out and down the hall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naggy runs at low health, he wasn't chasing anyone. Vox does the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svan</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you look behind the archway on the lava side about 25 seconds into the nagafen movie you can see a little dwarf cleric who is handling the healing.<br />
<br />
Froggerx never said they duoed them, he just said 2 monks were killing him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, dathor hammer + furious = dead naggy/vox<br />
<br />
