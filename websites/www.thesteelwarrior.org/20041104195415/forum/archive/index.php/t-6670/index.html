Its been a while since my last gear check and Ive upgraded a lot so wanted to do another...and I have a couple Questions :D <br />
My current goal is to get 4k HP unbuffed  then push to 58 and above. I am going to get the Helanic Tundra Legs(40ac, 10sta, 80hp) for a boost in HP and Im now thinking of getting the Helanic Tundra Cloak(16ac, 5sta, 5wis, 80hp). Would it worth it to give up the Str and Dex of my current cloak with a small gain in HP and AC?   I am next in line for the SkyShrine Plate BP from HoT/ToV on the Weekly Raid Ive beeen on. It is better AC then my Current but I will lose 50+ hp..is it worth it to Switch? I was also thinking of getting a Mosquito Leg Earring some time soon.  <br />
My Far reaching Armour goals are either the Malevolant Armour from Everfrost or the Royal Attendant Armour from Nro LDoNs. At lvl 57 Im only getting 21 points a win so both are a LOOONNGG Way off. I really doubt Ill be able to afford any of the Plate Molds for PoP Armour and will Probably never get there with my Warrior to actually get the Drops or if I do thats further down the road then getting a full suit of the Nro Armour. I am in a small guild that is part of an alliance of more small guilds. The biggest thing we have done as a whole was HoT and it took a LOT of work to get us there the first time. We have been 3 times total now. All 3 had lots of Deaths but we had some very good Drops. Practice Makes Perfect.  <br />
For Weapons...I like what I have but one day want to add in the CHoS when the price comes down a bit more.  <br />
For money...Most of my cash is from my Main Character(65Druid) and the items he gets lucky enough to win in LDoNs or occasional PoP item and can Sell. I dont do trade skills and have never Farmed for skins and silks and such ..:lol  The last cash I had went to purchase the Haste Belt my Warrior now has. <br />
For AA Advice...I have Run 3 and just got Sta 2. Should I finish out Stamina in General before moving on or get 1 more Point and move to Archetype?<br />
Thats about it I think... thanks in advance for advice and such! Good Hunting All! :D  :cool:</div></div><hr />
