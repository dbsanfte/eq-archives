<br />
ok its too damn big to cut n paste it all into here (four friggin posts worth on the WoW boards), but some of this is funny<br />
As such, in response to the myriad of posts that offer the shocking revelation that DW has a higher miss chance than 2h or 1h+s, I’d like to say that it really isn't necessary to inform us of this. We know this, that's how we made it, thanks again for the reminder. ;] Also, it seems these revelations often imply that since DW has a higher miss chance, that the DPS isn’t as good as 2h, which (as explained above) simply isn’t factual.<br />
ahhh, bnet discovers dice!<br />
First, a few minor notes. Yes, slow weapons will be streakier then fast weapons, causing you to notice it more when you fail to hit the opponent. This isn't something that is likely to change, it's just a basic property of the psychology involved with having fewer random events in a given time versus more. It’s probably worth reminding everyone that you're also going to get a more substantial effect on a single fight from streaks of hits, which, after decimating the enemy in a few swift blows, you aren't likely to come to these forums to express discontent about. ;] <br />
oh noz there are roaches in WoW!<br />
Now, regarding improving the warrior’s overall rage generation. We've found that there are indeed a few issues with rage generation as a result of bugs. Warriors (and druids in bear form) are intended to gain some rage on block,dodge,parry events, but apparently this isn't working correctly. This needs to be fixed asap in order for warriors to meet their total expected rage generation. <br />
<br />
In addition, while our tests have indicated that players are getting the intended 5% miss rate while using a single max-skill weapon against even level enemies (yes, we've tested this exhaustively, and cannot reproduce the 9% miss rate you're reporting for normal swings), we have found the bug causing abilities (ie: heroic strike, sunder armor, etc) to miss around 9-10% of the time under the above conditions instead of the intended 5%. This does mean that warriors are getting the &quot;miss&quot; even about twice as often as they should. Obviously, this needs to be rectified asap, since it directly impacts the warriors DPS and rage use (since missing wastes 20% of the rage cost of the ability). <br />
oooooooooooooooo gooodie.... RE: Execute<br />
First, it's worth noting that the full consumption of rage upon missing is a bug that will be fixed. <br />
BURN NOW!<br />
Third, the reduced rage cost means that against key &quot;boss&quot; monsters, you will be able to use the ability as many as 3 times instead of 2 times. This can make a very significant difference in terms of how difficult it is to finish of a very difficult boss encounter.<br />
hitpoints? we dont need no steeking hitpoint!<br />
First, the way Health gain on level-up works is balanced between classes to get all classes to our target expected base Health values. The mere fact that it is &quot;working as intended&quot; for all classes means it's meaningless to imply that the system is unfair to warriors, yet somehow not to other classes. Of course we could change the methodology for how Health gain is calculated on level-up, but in the end warriors (and all the other classes) would still have the same amount of Health. <br />
<br />
So, while it’s fair to state your opinion that warriors should have more health, I don’t see any valid connection between that opinion and your jab at the methodology for arriving at the health numbers. Using that approach again smacks much more of an attempt to get “/signed” responses for a change you would personally like to see than it does of presenting constructive feedback. <br />
<br />
Second, as far as I’m aware, naked warriors do have more health then naked characters of other classes (they’re certainly intended to). To imply that WoW has some kind of wacky design where Warriors have less health than other classes strikes me yet again as another attempt to mislead other players into thinking that there is a design flaw when there isn’t necessarily one. <br />
<br />
That being said, you’re claiming an imbalance exists is because a warrior that focuses on getting gear with stats other than stamina gear can end up having a lower total health then another character that focuses on stamina equipment, I still don’t see the argument as entirely valid. That scenario seems more like a conscious choice on the part of the players involved, and evidence that WoW has interesting and meaningful equipment choices.<br />
/target Paladin<br />
/cast Nerf Bat<br />
it’s also worth mentioning that not only are there some balance issues being resolved with Paladins (ie: the fix to seal of the crusader which gives paladins both superior survivability and superior damage output), but there are some things I should clarify about the design intent of warriors and paladins. <br />
<br />
While paladins are indeed intended to be the most survivable of any class in the game (players sometimes assume warriors are, which is not the case), paladins aren’t intended to make the best “tanks” in the game, or to have superior offensive abilities then warriors. What this means is that survivability alone does not a tank make. <br />
<br />
The other key concept to tanking is the ability to hold agro on mobs (especially simultaneously on multiple mobs). This is the key difference between warriors and paladins in PvE. Simply put, warriors are intended to be the best at holding agro against multiple mobs (which will also be a more clear distinction once the Seal of the Crusader bug is fixed). So, assuming a group scenario that includes healers, a warrior’s survivability rivals that of a paladin’s, with the warrior having very significant advantages in terms of holding agro.<br />
*best Chef voice* &quot;Yes children, warriors are tanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Q u o t e:<br />
<br />
Uniqueness: Warriors do not have any specific traits or abilities which set them apart from other classes. The idea of Auto-Attack-And-AFK presides for the class, as there is generally little interaction required for combat. There are no perks to playing a Warrior. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No specific traits or abilities? You mean like stances? Rage? Disciplines like retaliation and recklessness? <br />
<br />
Auto-attack-and AFK? Um… yeah, I do really well when I don’t push buttons as a warrior. :/ I really can’t find it in myself to remotely agree with this statement… it strikes me as pure drama. If playing a warrior involves little interaction for combat, why is it that group success is often made or broken by the skill of the player playing the warrior. I would wager to say that even today, the success of a group is determined as much, and possibly more, by the skill of a tanking warrior then that of any other class. <br />
<br />
No perks? You mean aside from being an indispensable part of most instance runs? The ability to use ranged weapons (unlike a paladin)? The ability to both close distance on a target and slow the target once you get to them? Carrying out an opponent’s death sentence once they reach 20% health? <br />
<br />
Really now, you’re going to have a very hard time convincing me that warriors suffer from a “uniqueness” problem. <br />
i think this pic sums the whole thing up nicely:</div></div><hr />

And the Exicute change is a MAGOR bug. It will certainly have a major effect on the class,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-30-2005, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think that overall the dev did a fine job of explaining Blizzard's vision of Warriors, the problems they see the class having, and some of the fixes they anticipate implimenting.  I think that occassionally his tone was perhaps a bit too sarcastic for a professional addressing a customer.  But otherwise I was very impressed.  We'll see how it all comes out in the wash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assure you that there are accomplished players that value this talent. You're entitled to dislike it, but dismissing the talent as pointless leads me to believe you might not be as much of an expert on your class’ talents as you make it sound. ;]  <br />
<br />
That whole post was absolutely perfect.  All these fuckin tards who think they know how a game should be balanced after playing 1 class for 2 months arguing with someone who's been working on this game for years.  Quality.</div></div><hr />

Dear Kalgran: A Warrior Reply  (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&amp;t=1116470&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post1116470) <br />

Dear Kalgran, <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your long and thoughtful letter to the warrior community. Yet many warriors feel your letter was more alarming than reassuring. <br />
<br />
Your letter is alarming first of all because it appears to me that you are still unware the extent to which the warrior class is under-powered and how servere the problems that plague us (esp. in PvP). Instead, you seem to believe our problems are minor, and that a few cosmetic fixes will bring the us up to par. (Or as you say, a lot of our complaints are &quot;pure drama.&quot;)...<br />
<br />
and plenty more.<br />

At least he's being clear and not falling into the snot running crybaby speak..</div></div><hr />
