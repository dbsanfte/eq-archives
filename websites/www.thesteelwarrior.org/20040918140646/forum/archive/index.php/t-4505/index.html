<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mandilloran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am Posting this as a stand alone Post as well as having it as a reply in a existing post subject<br />
<br />
 doubt few will agree with what I am about to say here but I felt it needed to be said&gt;<br />
<br />
I see a warrior as being a person who is drawn to combat because there is that unheard natural call to it.You have a gift for facing death face to face and if anything there seems to be a need to do so for that is what makes a warrior tick.You reconize fellow warriors at a glance for the bond that is build by those who have faced death and walked away is as hard and fast as the Steel contained within the blade at your side. Do Warriors in game terms need/deserve improvements to their Class? Your Damn right they Do!!! I think the warrior should be the parimount Melee class without question for that is WHAT they are all about its what makes them tick as I said above.<br />
<br />
Now Paladins what should happen to them what are they? Well in my humble oppinion they are this&gt; A Paladin is a warrior but in a much different direction. He/she also understands the call of the warrior but its not what calls to them for they hear but one thing within the hearts and that is the call of their Diety! Its a call that is as much a part of them as say the the Sword is to a warrior and his need to face Death again and again.This call from our Diety is where we draw our strength from.( I say we because I am a Paladin and have never played a warrior past level 11 because the class did not fit me, I think we all have a class we best identify with and in my case Paladin was it.) I Roleplay in small amounts and have always loved being a Paladin even when I was not wanted and let me say that was a great deal in the long past. I love it when a Warrior Roleplays as well and have several Warrior friends I would follow into the 9 Hells for they have my Respect as I have earned theirs. I say lets get warriors back to being what they are all about and offer Paladins new melee changes in line with what Rangers and Shadowknights Bards etc will get that are Paladin focused.Nerf no thats not an answer , fix the Problems with warriors and give them some new skills that bring the fun back to their class. In the end I doubt few will agree with me but thats ok , I Love being a Paladin and in the end will play as one no matter what SOE does for I Love logging in and Being Mandilloran the Paladin!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Sony wants us all to be equal tanks (which it seems they do) all we all want (exp wise) is when a group says hey we need a tank there is an equal chance of any class being chosen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't you just post this in a different thread?<br />
<br />
Oh well I ask the same question:<br />
<br />
You left out some classes from your analysis.<br />
<br />
Where do Shadowknights, Monks, Rogues, and most importantly, BESERKERS fit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If Sony wants us all to be equal tanks ...<br />
<br />
then theyre fucking retarded and have no concept of how to balance their own game.<br />
<br />
But we knew this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Equal tanks&quot; is the wrong way to go.  &quot;Tank differently&quot; is a better way to think about it.  All of us can stand infront of the monster take a beating.  What can each class do differently beyond that is the important part.<br />
<br />
I hope out of all of this is a way to play off each other.  Warriors should be assisting other classes for great effects and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what can each do differently<br />
<br />
Warr - Evasive/defensive<br />
<br />
SK - leech HT or 8k HT<br />
<br />
Pal - LoH<br />
<br />
