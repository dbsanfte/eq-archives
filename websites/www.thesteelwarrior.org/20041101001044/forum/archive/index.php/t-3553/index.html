<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hawke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow warriors,<br />
 I just recently retired my mage and sold his belongings. With the money I made I decided to twink a warrior. I've played magic users all my eq career until now. I did some research into weapons and equipment that I could afford and started slaying.<br />
What I wondering is, up to what level with this equipment get me before I should start thinking about upgrades (mainly my weapons) If anybody could take a few minutes to check out my magelo and offer some advice I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm also looking for more possible twink toys, not overly expensive tho... Thanks <br />

Just need a neck and face item preferably with HP on them.  Also legionare braclet needs to be changed.  I cant give any suggestion since you are on Stromm and I do not know what is available.</div></div><hr />
