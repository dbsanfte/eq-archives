<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once again i will try to post here and see how this goes. We have tried this guy about 6 times so far. We have had 4 to 5 level 65 clerics and 3 to 4 druids. We are having trouble with this MOFO.  He are doing him with mellee &quot;have not tried to range fight him yet&quot;. The trouble we are having is postioning him he is knocking our main tank out of range when that happens he is going after our clerics. We have tried to have spot healers on clerics &quot;has not worked yet&quot;. Spamming cure blind has helped from the shaman but when the MT goes blind we also get screwed there..<br />
 Is there a place we can maybe AOW him at &quot;example is the place far down from him&quot; have a bard &quot;DA&quot; and pull Hydro there?<br />
OR is this a ZERG fight with lots of DPS. I am just wandering what starts are used on this guy. If im not making any sense please feel free to post your questions.<br />
<br />
OR &quot;weight the MT down with plat so he sinks&quot; &lt;&lt;joke...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Lord works in mysterious ways, however, and you have done what was once thought impossible and shattered all previously held records on being an incompetent nincomshit.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you are just some dickhead monk that comes on this board to troll with impossibly stupid questions or if your guild actually sucks THAT MUCH. Considering you can still kill Hydrotha with &lt; 20 people, I'm at a loss over this entire thread.<br />
<br />
I'm sitting here thinking to myself, &quot;Did he just ask if Hydrotha was a zerg encounter?&quot; &quot;Did he just say his guild had failed Hydrotha on 6 previous encounters?&quot; Which then leads me to ask, &quot;HOW IN THE FUCK DID HIM AND HIS GUILD EVER DEFEAT THE MANAETIC BEHEMOTH LET ALONE RYDDA DAR LET ALONE RALLOS ZEK?&quot;<br />
<br />
I realize this isn't my board, but if I were a mod, I'd ban you outright. After giving this some thought, there is no fucking way you are being serious, and I am almost 100% certain you are just trolling with these idiotic questions to get a rise out of the posters here...<br />

Hydro was and is still the easiest if not one of the easiest minis in the elemental planes.  I dont believe your question can be serious as the answer is blatantly obvious to everyone else.<br />
<br />
If he is eatting your clerics, your MT obviously is forgetting to turn on attack.  Ask the MT to turn on attack (and turn off duck) next time and you will surely win.</div></div><hr />

You do realise that if u can not kill hydrotha with a normal raiding force :<br />
- THERE IS ZERO chance you can kill behemoth<br />
- THERE IS BELOW ZERO chance you can kill RZTW<br />
<br />
If u cant kill Hydrotha you couldnt even DENT RZTW.<br />
<br />
As for slammer....<br />
<br />
Exept for beeing retarded, i think we can all agree his guild is shit.<br />
They either zerg flagged or by some mysterious gimp exploit him<br />
and the 30 chimps with the same tag got into the elemental.<br />
<br />
Want a strat ?<br />
1) Buff a Tank <br />
(your gimp guild does know they can buff people right ? <br />
Like ... i'll throw you a bone.....   avatar ? ferocity ? Thule ? )<br />
<br />
2) Pull hydrotha (you know EQ has classes used for pulling ?)<br />
<br />
3) Attack hydrotha (Thats gotta be the LEEET Furor Sekret)<br />
<br />
4) Keep the tank alive (This is the most well kept secret in all EQ)<br />
<br />
This fucking piece of shit mob is just underwater AoW<br />
(with a lame blind, but thats not the problem).<br />
<br />
Now if he is a troll (i mean someone this stupid is a insult to warriors EQwide).<br />
I think we can all say we got a good laught at him and he cheered<br />
up our day with his gimpness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Hulanta we are in the elemental planes, I sure we will be him to we will have a game faces on when we go back. I found other sites to post at and get info on him and this encounter. It really is sad when you have to go to other sites and get info you need.<br />
Thanks for your interest..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">to defeat the mighty beast you must undergo special training!<br />
<br />
Take all of your raiding force (98 ppl ) port to Greater Faydark bind there and attack Nexus Scion one by one. Once everyone nakid run to Crushbone buff up using only lvl 9 and below spells tell everyone not to use any spell above lvl 9 for this raid. Once you organized zone into crushbone and dive into watter canal. Then send in &quot;13 munk&quot; to pull nasties Dvin and Emperor Crush to you while you wait in the watter. If all goes well you should see that nasty dark elf running for you soon and maybe able to kill it without MT loosing agro or the raid suffociating! If you past this test you are ready to face Hydrotha! If not an unpleasnat CR awaits with all those nasty orcs around to who most are kos and outsiders may even train!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">It helps if your MT has two computers so he can see where he is while blinded.  Even with maxed MR you can still get blinded.<br />
<br />
Other than that it's a pretty straightforward MT fight with considerable anti-aggro going on.  If you have problem controlling aggro apply whatever tricks you know that'd help MT keep aggro better.</div></div><hr />

Seriously mang, it's not impressive. I gaurantee everyone who posted on this thread has killed him, and probably their very first time, except for you, obviously.<br />
<br />
..And F Kildace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Slammer.  Don't listen to all these mean people.  I am sure you are the coolest warrior in the game and that your guild will be the first one to successfully kill Lady Vox.  You have shown incredible planning and skill by coming to this board to get a good strat for this near impossible mob.   I am also very happy for you on your kill of Hydrotha and that all the strats we gave you were able to work for you.<br />
<br />
If you need any good strats for the Rathe Council, just ask!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">You assholes crack me up, you have let the Lo0t go to you heads and think that you better than everybody else../boggle welcome to EQ...I looked at you  magelo what is your point there ??<br />
Your not an Ogah so there is no way you can be a real tank ..bottom line...=0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">Oh...My...God. You're another fucking Einstein.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Actually, my skill playing a warrior makes me better than most. The gear is merely a reward. Fuck, while lots are complaining about not even being able to hold aggro on a mob in exp groups, I can regularly hold two at once (even in some mid-range pop zones. It helps that I don't hunt with retards though).<br />
<br />
As for only ogres being 'real tanks', you really need to take your head out of your ass, shortbus.  That frontal stun shit never has been and never will be a make or break advantage. Never once have I lost aggro due to a melee stun. Never. Plus there's stalwart endurance which works from any angle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now go delete your ogah, shortbus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">LOL, delete my ogah, GO past the front page and look what we have done..Nuff said..we are pushing on and on and on ...As for keeping agro if most Warrs had the gear you do im sure they would say the same thing...
