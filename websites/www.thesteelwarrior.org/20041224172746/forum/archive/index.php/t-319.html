<br />
Specifially- Silken whip of ensnaring vs Anklesmasher.  Poth proc snare, both have a 1:2 ratio (14 28 on whip and 10 20 on anklemasher)  Only other difrence in stats is the -5ac on whip and +4 ac on anklesmasher and one is 1hb the other is 1hs.  Now because they both have the same snare proc is it safe to assume they proc at the same hit %?  This is to say, 1 proc in every 30 hits on average...(just throwing out numbers).  Because in that case the reduced delay on the Anklesmasher would cause it to give more agro becuase it will proc more often.<br />
<br />
What do you guys thing about them and snare procs in general?<br />
<br />
Also how does this compare to the frostbringer as far as agro goes.  At 12 22 the frosty has a bit better ratio so your dps will be higher, but when I MT i only realy care about agro, DPS is nice, but agro is what i got in the group for.  The bonus of the Frostbringer is not the DD proc but the Debuff side of the proc.  -9 ac if i remember corectly?  Put it procs fairly often.<br />
<br />
Right now i am useing a 13/18 with a desiease DD and Dot proc and the frostbringer.  I was thinking about picking up a snare proc becuase snare seems like such huge agro whenever somone else casts it.  Just wondering how those weapons compare in agro to the Frosty especialy for situations where mobs are resisting my frosty proc (still builds the agro, just no ac debuff)<br />
<br />
Oh, and because i have allready gone on so long:  Do shammy/chanter/other ac debuffs stack with the frosty proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HamkChai</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no one can be sure what is a proc rate on a certain weapon... unless u are a developer or u can get some top_secret_info about EQ, hehe<br />
<br />
most of us agreed that different weapons, even with the same proc effect, can proc quite a different frequency. most obvious example is BoC and BF. both have EB, both are 20 delay, and i assume those who have a hand on them should reach 305 dex (which helps in proc'ing a weapon... again no official words saying that hehe) either buffed or unbuffed. but their proc'ing frequency is quite different. someone may argue that BF has 15% riposte skill mod so 15% more riposte so 15% more swings so 15% more chance to proc...<br />
<br />
back to the topic, snare whip vs anklesmasher. if i were u, and if i could get a hand on anklesmasher, sure i will take it over snare whip. also frostbringer proc is 60dd + -15ac, and AFAIK, the only debuff that has stacking issue with it is obsidian shatter (sp?), which is also a dd + -ac debuff. even with that, frostbringer's debuff will overwrite obsidian shatter. also even if frostbringer's debuff does not take hold, u get the same aggro as it lands...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frostbringer has better DPS to go along with a relatively nice aggro proc. So it will, overall be the better weapon.<br />
<br />
Anklesmasher has the same ratio as snare whipe. So in the offhand, they're even. But the stats edge goes to the 1hb. So it's probably the better option.<br />
<br />
MAINHAND, Smasher will be better than the whip because of the damage bonus being applied more.<br />
<br />
But overall, Frostbringer is the slightly superior weapon both mainhand and offhand.<br />
<br />
But try not to stress about it. They're all on roughly the SAME level, in regards to weapon quality and aggro generation. You won't see too huge a difference between them. <br />
<br />
Sure someone will post here saying &quot;Oh YEAH? Well my Frosty kicked the crap outta the Anklesmasher I used to wield.&quot; And someone else will say &quot;Oh YEAH? Well my anklesmasher procs 16.2 billion times per combat round once I got my dex up to 101&quot; ... etc., etc., etc.<br />
<br />
But seriously, Frostbringer ... Anklesmasher ... they do the same job at about the same level of effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Then comes your red epic.<br />
<br />
Then comes the Cord Hilted Spike Driver.<br />
<br />
The comes Enraging Blow weapons.<br />
<br />
And somewhere in the middle of ALL that crap is high DPS 2handers.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the puzzle, it's part of what makes being a warrior fun ... the TOYS!</div></div><hr />
