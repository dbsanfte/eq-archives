A 53 Warrior with some thurg gear (don't consider uber-twinked, think casual) or a 59 Paladin in full thurg and some LDoN like the Architect BP?  Consider no defensive AA.<br />
<br />
Yes I know, sounds like a stupid question, with a very obvious answer, but still...humor me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's being casual have to do with CHoS and SotB?  Those are THE casual weapons.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to contribute ... the pally would easily out-tank the warrior.  The difference between 53 and 59 is huge, and the pally has better gear and a spell-book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the warrior, in this case,  has decent enough weapons, he could use the lower level aggro work for him over the pally. It's one of those things you gotta feel out.<br />
<br />
Although I'd only recommend it for offtanking.</div></div><hr />

In order for the Warrior to make up the level gap, they'd have to be twinked in full cultural/SS with all the good jewelry and the Paladin would have to be geared so that he only had a few pieces of thurg and they were his best, assuming skill levels are equal.</div></div><hr />
