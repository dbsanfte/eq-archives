<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Secmet</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, first off this is my first warrior. The only other char i've played to a high level was a 65 beastlord and while at low level didnt bother with much equipment until I could farm myself. I've started completely fresh on Morden Rasp with absolutely NO twinkage. <br />
<br />
Atm I've been concentrating on AC, as I figure that AC should be the focus at low level, until I start grouping with CHing clerics (circa level 40). Now my guild is leveling pretty damn fast, as we have aspirations to move quickly through the lower raid content and progress from there, high end raiding is the end goal and everyone is trying to level asap. The level of my equipment atm (in magelo), is the same quality as pretty much most of the guild atm.<br />
<br />
Cash will be short and I don't have much time to farm silks or whatnot to get that little bit of starter cash as the guild is grping intensively to level up. <br />
<br />
Given that, a couple of question i'd like opinions on....<br />
<br />
1) HPs seems to be the way to go as I near level 40 (CH). I would like opinions if it would be wise going for items which have high HP, but virtually no other stats or AC i.e. sapphire necklace, vel rings and other items, or should I try and keep my equipment balance with mediocre AC, HP and some stats?<br />
<br />
2) Should I forget about armor and just save up for a good weapon, like GSoT, which goes for 10k on morden currently and have it rdy for my mid fifties? <br />
<br />
I suppose my problem basically comes down to, should I spend my earned cash on small upgrades, or save for the big upgrades i.e. GSoT, which will see me well into my career?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't equip a GSoT until level 55, so it would be a total waste of money at this point given how many other slots you have which are seriously lacking.  Most of your armor is absolutely terrible for your level.  You should at least be in full crafted minimum.  I don't have any idea what your server economy is like, but when I was level 30 I had mostly crafted except for a couple of slots(crafted helm sucks, so I had skull shaped barbute for example), and I was totally untwinked too. There is a long list of stuff that should be available to you. Get some friends together and kill Martar Icebear in EF to get a cloak of the icebear. He's level 30ish, bring friends, he's tougher than he looks.  Crafted or Crusty boots, Crafted or Crusty greaves, Crafted, Crusty, Hero, hell even Silver Plated bracer would be an upgrade.  Anything from blackened alloy to think leather apron would be an improvement for waist slot.  Orc fang or cougar claw earrings, or something with more hps.  Make these changes and your ac should increase by about a couple hundred points roughly.  As a rule of thumb your important stats are AC/sta/hps. Which order you put those in depends on what level you are and what level of the game you're playing at.  Right now, your ac is way too low, but all of the stuff I've listed should be attainable by a group your level even if your server economy doesnt allow you to buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Secmet</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, my gear is SERIOUSLY lacking, i know that for sure, but what do I do? The economy hasn't really started yet on the server therefore demand for low end tradeskill items are virtually non-existant. The bazaar only has very low end gear, or extremely high end stuff that the level 65's brought over. Granted there is crusty for sale which I will pick up a few pieces, but even that will take time. Will LDON gear me up sufficiently during the next 20 levels so I have adequate gear do you think?? Ldon seems like the only real option I have for decent gear, drops and saving up for splits. I absolutely HATE being underpar, but i'm reassuring myself atm when I look at other peoples gear on the server and hearing what other tanks AC/HPs are around my level and i'm definitely average atm i'm sure. <br />
<br />
Anyway, i'll keep leveling up, maybe ldons will sort ot my gear probs, but there's no wa I can stop leveling atm to get decent gear as when I do go back to leveling most of my guild will be in late 40s, low 50s at the rate they are leveling now and i'll have no guild groups to group with!! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the newbie quests your guildmaster gives out and get rid of that freaking cloth armor lol. The quest rewards are 5x better than 1 ac cloth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ask around and find people that make fine plate. Offer to supply them with pelts for the leather padding for a suit. Then go around killing spiderlings and wolves and whatnot. It's not the end all of armor, but most likely there is someone making it by now. <br />
<br />
  Also, if you really can't find anything better, make yourself bloody patchwork armor. Trivial in the 20s, IIRC. Or buy banded armor from someone. Something! Just don't wear cloth anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Secmet</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But cloth, it feels sooo goooooooodddd against my skin......... :D <br />
<br />
Only 3 pieces of cloth, but  I get what you're saying. Some people starting off jewel craft in the guild so I managed to grab 2 +45hp rings off him for cost. Will look into the FS plate for some of the slots it would be an upgrade. Done all the newb quest stuff btw, only caters for legs, arms, head, wrists, bp as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a grp and farm points from LDoN for the lowest point cost armor you can find.  That stuff isnt too bad and it will last you for awhile.  It costs like 45 points so at lvl 30 that should be xp and money plus earning gear and weapons too.  LDoN will be your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evariste</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Listen to Lidan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">newb quest armor, crafted quests, poh/rok/thurg/ss/giant/culture, ornate/ldon, raex, timestuff.<br />
<br />
the best part is your can progress as a guild through the armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been a loooong time but, a group of low 30s should be able to get you all the crafted pieces except maybe helm (which sucks anyway) and breastplate, a hero bracer and a bracer of scavenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crour</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol well i'm 46 and you have better gear then me (. although im not wearing any cloth YAY, im stuck wearing blasted tree weave for my BP.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">was about to post that you could check out my magelo for some ideas what you can get fairly cheap, but now seeing the stuff you have guess i skip that, you probably have gear on that guy worth more then what i have on all of my 8 guys total on ab.</div></div><hr />
