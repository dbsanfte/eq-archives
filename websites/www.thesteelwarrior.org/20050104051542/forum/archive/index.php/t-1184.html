<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksign</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have played EQ for a long time, and I feel like I am in the twilight of my time in Norrath.<br />
<br />
I have always wanted to start a DE Warrior, and I feel like this time I would do something a little different.<br />
<br />
If you examine the gear here <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=711917<br />
<br />
(I have him at 51 just to see the gear in &quot;full bloom&quot;) you will notice that its almost all rec level, I thought this would be fun to kinda add some challenge and reward as he &quot;grew into it&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only thing about this gear setup, is, ironically its so, so low on str. In the past on alts I have ignored str, str seems to just come outta nowhere on gear these days, but 74! this is crazy! I actually can't believe I am even having to address this.<br />
<br />
I was just looking for any opinions on how to mitigate this - I dont want to loose the hp/ac on the set I have now, but 74 str is insane.<br />
<br />
Also, fyi, it took a lot of money to put this set together, and I am plumb out, I can't just drop mad cash on one fat item anymore, unless I get clever.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any insight on my fun project.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ac is ok, the hp is ok, but it's undeniably hybrid gear, and especially for a warrior it's lacking in the strength we dark elves kind of need.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to look into silver chitin bracers, which will net you 7 str and 40 hp each, but cost you 10ac, and either the pog or thurg bps and legs, which have much better stats for a war.<br />
<br />
That should get you closer to the stats you were expecting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cobalt boots effect would help. 25str.<br />
<br />
Valor rings when will help as well.  <br />
<br />
Clattering bone necklace<br />
<br />
SBoZ had some str on it as well.<br />
<br />
There's just some ideas off the top of my head</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skullreaper Zek</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could ditch CoF for Cloak of Greater Pern and use RBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksign</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forgot about the Valorium Rings, wont be able to use that or Cobalt Boots till he's a little higher.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ideas, I think I can work some STR in there for him.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't sure if you had already created your war or not from your post so this may not be an option.  You could trade / sell the dark prince to get most of the fierce heraldic if you bought it on another char and / or reroll the warrior if he is very low level.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo, nothing too impressive but I get 7800+hp buffed and just a few buyable items away from 8k hp.  I always have a shammy on another account with ferine avatar so my battle stats are always maxxed anyways.<br />
