my elemental rockridge legs are at 62 / 100, so a 38%, 38 point loss.<br />
My jade belt is at 30 / 40, not only just a 10 point loss, but ALSO only a 25%.<br />
<br />
Do Leg items decay faster than belts or is durablity really just something random? Appears to me that at least durability decays at a fixed %, not by points.<br />
<br />
so whats the point in having more durabilty totals on your items when these points are worth less?</div></div><hr />

since death is a flat 10% i dont see the reason behind that</div></div><hr />

Most likely, when you are hit, it is calculated for each item independendly if it will lose durability. Depending on the damage you recieve, each item possibly has a different chance of losing durability. when you are hit, the chance is calculated and then the items roll to see if they lose durability. Could be something like:<br />
<br />
if (random x) &lt; (damage recieved / char level) then lose durability.<br />
<br />
x might be different per item. It might be something completely different from this, it is just an example of how it could be. However, i do not think they are putting durability on items and do not make it matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may eat a flat 10% from death, and your item durability may decay at roughly the same rates % wise across your character model.. however,  this does not suggest that a 100 durability chest will last as long as a 125 or 150 durability one.</div></div><hr />

so just bad luck that the greaves lost durability almost 4 times as fast as the belt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is pure speculation, but greaves would be a larger target than a belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, obviously it's not going to go down at the same rate by points.  Can you just imagine a belt and greaves (40 and 140 durability repectively) going down at the same rate?  You'd go through 3 belts before the greaves ever got down.<br />
<br />
/pure speculation on<br />
<br />
Perhaps the higher durability items are more likely to be lowered in durability, therefor &quot;saving&quot; the lower durability items from being knocked out as fast? I wonder if some items cost more for repair per point of durability...or even for each percentage of durability. <br />
<br />
/pure speculation off</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's absolute crap that you could accumulate about 80s worth of damage to your gear just by doign nothing but PvP for a few hours in Hillsbrad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's not that bad considering that durability is unaffected by pvp deaths<br />
<br />
or has that changed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It hasn't changed.<br />
<br />
But still, if I'm doing nothing but PvP for a few hours (Which can and does happen on PvP servers), I can rack up 50-80s in durability costs no problem. <br />
<br />
Of course, I guess with the honor system, things might change, as there would be an incentive worth the cost, but right now it just sucks.</div></div><hr />

I used to have two to three sets of gear on me at all times before they implemented repair robots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's not striking but simple being in combat that makes your gear lose durability.</div></div><hr />
