<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a thread long ago on the old Steelwarriors about this stick that procs a gate spell.  I think it takes you to Thrug or something.  Its either a quest or a drop and it had something to do with Over there.  <br />
<br />
Anyone remember this thread, have this item, or know what Im talking about?  I just need a name . . .  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe you are confusing two items... there's the hammer which gates you to Overthere, which requires very high faction with evil races (at least the ones there).<br />
<br />
Then there is vial of velium vapors, which is a brewed drink which is clickable thurg gate.<br />
<br />
Can't remember the name of the hammer... should be able to find it on a quest list somewhere though.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Dug up the link, was easy enough to find on quest list at allakhazams:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doh, ok thanks.<br />
<br />
I thought there was a procing stick for Therg but I guess not.  Hate potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your isp ever goes down while your in ToV or Plane of Hate, you'll form a new love for gate potions ;)  Also they're great for some places that would need a rogue or evaccer to get you out of otherwise.  <br />
<br />
I never leave home with em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only need amiable faction to get the OT hammer.  I actually did it while max kos.  Get some puppet strings, had some guildies come along to debuff him good, then I charmed him with the puppet strings (which gives amiable faction), then did the turn in.  All thats required to turn in is a jade I believe.  When you pop in, you're right next to a low level skelly who will aggro, easy kill, then I personally go out to the water and swim around to the PoK book.<br />
<br />
As for Thurg gate, need something like 122 pottery, which only takes 30 mins and 100p or so.  Very helpful item to have, keep one of these on me at all times also.  Saved my ass more than a few times =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The thurgadin gate potion is what I use.  I usually gate one to 3 times per weekday playing session.  It takes me approximately five minutes, once I've gated, to run to the NPC in thurgadin and say 'what velium vapors' (she doesn't repond to a hail) for the contraption you make the potion with, run to the bank and combine grab my ingredients, turn around and use the pottery wheel and the other pottery thingie that looks like an oven, then run to PoK.  5 minutes of downtime for the ability to gate isn't the extent of it, however.  You also need to either farm or buy the components necessary.<br />
<br />
Before I describe all of this in detail, I'd like to point out that it took me 4 hours of intense clicking and about 100 pp to get 122 pottery.  Even so, 4 hours and 100 pp is nothing.  As soon as I heard about this potion i was all over it.  The ability to gate for a warrior!  Ofcourse, this is the poor man's version of warrior gate.  The expensive version would be a shaman made potion to return you to you're bind point ;)<br />
<br />
You need farm or buy in the bazaar:<br />
small pieces of velium (bazaar price on BB ~ 30pp)<br />
small velium bricks (bazaar price on BB ~ 30PP)<br />
crystalline spider silks (bazaar price on BB ~5pp)<br />
<br />
You need to buy from a pottery vendor:<br />
Glass Shards<br />
High quality firing sheets<br />
<br />
In a pottery wheel combine:<br />
1 small velium brick<br />
3 crystalline spider silks<br />
2 glass shards<br />
<br />
This yields an unfired vial.  Then turn to the other pottery thingie, the one that looks like an oven and combine:<br />
1 unfired vial<br />
1 high quality firing sheet<br />
<br />
This yields a velium vial.  Now take the velium vial and put it in the contraption you received from the NPC along with 2 small pieces of velium (the stackable ones).<br />
<br />
This yields a vial of velium vapors, which is you're gate potion!  Woot!<br />
<br />
I forget the name of the NPC you speak to in THurgadin, but I can give directions.  Head to the bank from GD.  Pass the bank.  The path goes down a slope.  After the bottom of the slope, the second shop on the left has a vendor.  That's you're girl.  She doesn't respond to hails, just to the phrase &quot;what velium vapors&quot;<br />
<br />
I farm in CC and Velks.<br />
<br />
This is actually part of the shawl quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used to have a thurg gate potion for those times when you really need it but now that I have got my Gaunts of Dragon Slaying my dorf faction has gone to complete crap. <br />
<br />
I was thinking of doing the clockwork tali quest in PoI but you need a few drops from the Elem planes to complete the final no charge version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casual Guy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hussar - Are you saying that if someone charms the quest mob, it cons amiable to other PCs?  I can easily get an enchanter guildee to do the charm if this is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are you saying that if someone charms the quest mob, it cons amiable to other PCs?  <br />
<br />
No, if someone else charms a mob that mob is INDIFFERENT to everyone esle and only AMIABLE to the charmer.<br />
<br />
You will need to do the charm in order to get the Amiable faction, otherwise it wiil stil be indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casual Guy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, pardon my ignorance, but is there some item or potion or something that let's a warrior charm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, there is an item that a warrior can use to charm, but I cannot remember the name of it for the life of me. :\  It has something like five charges of charm is all that I can remember about it at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Puppet Strings (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=11643)<br />
<br />
Drop in PoFear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What do these potions cost?  My guild is doing ToV soon and I have LD problems alot and need an easy way out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On veeshan gate potions sell in the bazaar for around 300-350pp per charge.. can get single, 5 charge or 10charge potions.  Casting time is 10 seconds.  Personally I carry 2 of the 5 charge gate potions in case I get stuck somewhere with a friend.<br />
<br />
You can also buy potions that gate you to specific spots like Everfrost for about 250pp per charge, but those have a 30 second casting time.  <br />
<br />
Given our lack of channelling skill I prefer the 10 second casting ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry, worded that badly, edited to reflect what I meant.  Puppet strings come from Fear, nice to get one as a guild then pass them around to 10 melees and get them all gate hammers at once, with the debuffed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It used to take only an hour to get 122 Pottery, until VI put up the patch that fixed some tradeskills being 'too easy'.<br />
<br />
On my warrior lately it took a few sessions cause I couldn't bother doing it all in one sitting but effectively it takes a few hours of making unfired small clay bowls and medium bowls to get the required Pottery skill level.<br />
<br />
As a warrior I'd imagine farming the components in Crystal Caverns could be less than practical .. ideally if you buy components to make one potion.. then go to CC, from there on you can always gate back directly to Thrug with your components, at least it saves you the walk throught the geonids etc..<br />
<br />
As for the hammer.. don't forget to unequip it when you are done.. that happened to one of our Bards during a raid ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ever since level 50 I dont have many problems farming CC by myself.  You've just got to do it when no one's camping the orcs.<br />
<br />
With lvl 51 first aid AA it's a snap.  If it's prime time i'll offer to buy velium peices for 10 pp each (60 percent mark down for my server).  A lot of times people XP hunting in CC will sell them too me to avoid the bazaar hassle, I guess.  I dont find it a hassle personally to sell those large velium bricks I find at the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I find that the pit doesn't yield as much velium as the upper tunnels, but maybe that's just me.<br />
<br />
I'm usually to chinsey to gate out of CC to thurgadin.  It really don't take much long to run past GEO's, zone to EW &amp; run to GD to the book than it does to gate, make another potion, and zone out and run to book.  Sometimes I gate out of CC though, when I'm being lazy.<br />
<br />
When I go XP hunting in Velks I get lots of velium too.<br />
<br />
One thing worth mentioning... A warrior in my guild just got stuck, today.  He relies on his OT gate hammer for gating.  Well, he fell in a whole he couldn't get out of in a remote location adn there were no mobs to beat on for gate!  I bet he's going to change his mind about using thurg gate potions now, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rahwain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The third type of gate not mentioned here is the vendor sold version.  Cost me about 1049 plat, and useful in case of emerg as it's an instant casting time.<br />
<br />
Otherwise Thurg gate potions are fine for getting out of non aggro situations.<br />
<br />
If you dont like either, buy the regent for the PoK gate in quantity and find your favorite mage to summon you a talisman of return before you go out to play :p<br />
<br />
Rahwain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You can also get gates to like FoB or innothule swamp for considerably cheaper and just run to a PoK book nearby.  Also do the clockwork talisman quests is nice too, 100ish pp reagant cost and gates to pok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Buryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">usually just buy 10 dose Potions in the bazaar to Field of bone since its closest to a PoK book.  Usually costs about 1-2k, but Its nice to be covered for more then one nessicary gate without making a potion in thurg.</div></div><hr />
