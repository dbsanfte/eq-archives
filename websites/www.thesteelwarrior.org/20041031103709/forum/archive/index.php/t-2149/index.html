<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a *really* stupid question...  :D<br />
<br />
Is there some way to determine which damage / delay ratio is better than another?<br />
<br />
I'm bad at arithmatic.  I cant imagine dividing the damage value by the delay value would yield anything useable.  Is there a formula I can use to compare damage delay ratios?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dividing damage by delay does provide useful insight and information.  This is especially true for your offhand which doesn't get a damage bonus.  All other things being equal, this is a good judge for an offhand weapon (comparing two non proc'ing weapons for instance).<br />
<br />
For your main hand there are more factors that you must look at like proc's, your damage bonus, etc.  As you level you get a damage bonus applied to each hit you score with the main hand only.  Therefore the more this gets applied (all things being equal) the more damage you do.  For instance, a 10/20 weapon (ratio .5) will outdamage a 20/40 weapon (ratio .5) because you hit more often and have the damage bonus applied more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">(assuming no proc offhand only)<br />
<br />
That's what I thought.  I've been dividing the damage by the delay for my basis of comparison for a while.  I always thought I was supersticious and getting no real information, guess I was right in dividing the numbers all along.  THanks for the explanation.<br />
<br />
so the higher the ratio, the better the damage delay.  Sweet.  Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends on level, good rule of thumb to 50ish is (damage + bonus)/delay, 60+ I think (need to parse and double check, but eyeballing some graphs, (2*damage+ bonus)/delay is a good quick and dirty. (For main hand.)<br />

If you look in the library you will see a thread called the Most Important thread you have never read. Read it.</div></div><hr />
