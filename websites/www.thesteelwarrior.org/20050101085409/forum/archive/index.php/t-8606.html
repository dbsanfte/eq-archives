<br />
Appologies if this question has been answered before.  I looked in the library and did a search, but could not come up with the answer...<br />
<br />
I recently dinged lvl 65.  What is the difference between stonewall (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4688&amp;source=Live) and defensive (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4499&amp;source=Live)?<br />
<br />
They both seem to mitigate the same amount (45%), have the same duration, and have the same recast timer.  I see that Stonewall reduces your movement rate, and Defensive decreases damage modifier (50%).  I'm assuming that is referring to My output damage.<br />
<br />
As warrior DPS is a small component of the group/raid's overall DPS, is movement rate more valuable, to chase down an aggroed mob or an add?  Does each skill use the same amount of Endurance?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mukaz</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that I use them both. Defensive for when I need to be mobile and actively repositioning. Stonewall for those times when I've got the bad guy pinned down or when I'm keeping him focused on me and my back in a corner.<br />
<br />
While dps is almost never a primary consideration more is better than less whenever you have the choice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd reccomend you never use stonewall except when your dps is actually important (which is almost never).  Stonewall kills any motility and utility you might have in crazy situations via the snare.  Defensive is no more or less aggro ... so i'd just stick with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine the following:  You are corner-tanking mob-01 and pop stonewall.  2 necros arent paying attention (hell any 2 casters) or the RNG just plain hates you and you lose aggro.  The first caster is summoned and immediately killed.  Your boss mob then charges off to the casters to catch the other over-aggroing sonufagun.  Now lets pretend this mob has ae rampage and fires off a rampage or 2 while in the middle of the casters ... meanwhile you are snared trying to hop-skip-jump your way back to him to taunt/aetaunt ... trying all the while to get a few lucky procs in.<br />
<br />
This happened to us on a RZ attempt a while back on the fake RZ.  A premature burn was called without solid aggro established and RZ charged the casters and ae ramped once or twice.  Needless to say we failed.  Our warrior was stonewall and could not regain aggro or even chase after RZ.  You may think ... well our casters are smart and our tanks have great aggro ... but any caster can peel aggro without too much effort on an all out burn ... and even the best geared tanks are subject to the RNG screwing them over.  This is especially true once your necros start getting focus items for their dots and have their crit-dot aa's.  I'd much rather let the casters crank it up knowing that i can handle a poor situation than making everyone play it safe so i can double my already weak dps.<br />
<br />
We don't allow our tanks to stonewall anymore in raid situations.  Leave stonewall for xp groups when your dps actually moderatly matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
defensive = raiding<br />
stonewall = grouping<br />
<br />
When duoing, I basically use stonewall anytime I end up with 2+ mobs.  There's no reason not to use it, really.  Seldom is it a matter of survival, usually it's just a matter of convenience and mana preservation (and better aggro control of adds through reduced healing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my approach too.  I never, ever use stonewall on raids, but in a group where I'm not likely to lose aggro and my DPS matters, I use it quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lots of times on raids if im cornering i engage and fortitude, when fortitude runs out i call assist and hit defensive. because noone else has attacked yet the mob isnt in the corner and neither am i, if i were to stonewall, he would likely be pushed right over me and mess up cornering because i cant move in reverse while snared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lordaeron</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewall is not all that bad and quite usefull if ur skilled at using it, but definitly not for the lesser skilled. While on raids your dps will not matter and so mobility is mroe important (as there are more people wacking there mob, there will be more push). Stonewall really shines in exp groups, especially those in tight quaters such as ldons.  <br />
<br />
In ldons the group is going to be close together so u dont have to go far if you lose agro, to get the mob back. In high difficulty 65 Ldons (especially when the healer is less experienced of has less manapool, etc.. and especially when were running out of time) i chain cast stonewall, beacause the healers have to heal less and i still do the same damage, which actually counts in a single group situation, also u will usually kill a good number of mobs before your group moves up each time, allowing you to burn a stonwall, then move and by the time ur setup again and ready to kill more ur only a min or two from being able to use stonewall again.       <br />
<br />
Some mob repositioning is possible with stonewall, instead of walking straight back, you can walk at an angel backwards and this is the same speed as walking forward while snared, with a little practice u can walk side to side and angled backwards so that while u dont walk straight back u can still backup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, raid mobs snare me all the time and i have to strafe to position and just to move around.You don't want to do this to yourself intentionally tho.Exposing your sides and back and messing around straffing for position is something you will have to do,but, it's not worth  snaring yourself so you can dps a lil better on a raid.<br />
<br />
It's not really a skill hehe.Any tank should know how to move when snared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time I'd ever use Stonewall as MT on a raid is on perma-rooted mobs. Very useful in xp groups or *gasp* soloing though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, I use stonewall alot on raids. both perma rooted (Late night drunken alt farming raids) and Corner tanking raids.<br />
<br />
I'm confident enough in my aggro when MTing that I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna get necro ganked, so I usually tag, hit Furious while backing them into the corner and call assist with 5-6 seconds left on furious. Most of the tanks in my guild do the same, so we know to assist and bash / slam to position before assist called to help push. <br />
<br />
I like Stonewall for the added DPS for both aggro and mob dedded. Call me old fashioned, but any extra DPS = good DPS<br />
<br />
now if you're tanking something in PoWater... Stonewall = teh debil</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's making the assumption that defensive lessens your agro as it lessens your dps.<br />
<br />
However that seems arguable now, as many think agro is based on potential damage per swing not actual damage. *shrug* who knows, i've never noticed a big deal with agro between the two.<br />
<br />
I like stonewall for groups as the dps helps.<br />
<br />
I don't raid alot anymore but,<br />
<br />
I have used stonewall on raids if dps is a big issue and there aren't many on the raid. However I do wonder if i have to reposition wether the hassle to reposition while snared doesnt compromise my dps more than the loss I'd get woth defensive.<br />
On large raids, one warriors dps should not matter than much, while positioning for the MA is always important, so I think defensive is better if you are in doubt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30 or 40 extra dps is meaningless on a raid.  Not being able to get to a mob or position it because you're snared so you can get 30 extra dps is not smart tanking.  You will get away with it more often than not, but it isn't smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only time I use stonewall on raids is when the mob I'm fighting uses snare/root itself like Monstrous Mudwalker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turn sideways and strafe...you wont suffer an AC penalty and still get to where you need to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Stonewall for the first time (Hey, I been gone 8 months, gimme a break) today tanking Kelorek Dar.  Well, it was me and the druid, so I figured my DPS was just slightly important. Positioning doeen't seem that bad with it..since I had to spin that little bastard around to keep from pushing him out to see, and managed to do that just fine.<br />
<br />
Actually....I used it twice.  And Fellstrike popped back up as soon as I ported back to the nexus hehe.  It was not a swift fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrk</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never had a problem using stonewall here.  Using strafe to tack backwards has always worked just fine for me, and if the mob ever ran for a caster a quick sit brought it right back (followed by a taunt as I'm being smacked back into standing).  Most of the time my friends are smart enough to not setup on the other side of the room in the first place.  Mobs won't ping pong if they get a little overzelious with a few nukes, and /sheild'n works a hell of a lot better when they're already close to me.</div></div><hr />
