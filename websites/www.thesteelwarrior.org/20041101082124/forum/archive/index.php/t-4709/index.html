<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I'm glad that SoE finally increased the availability of a few weapons with aggro procs, like the Greatstaff of Thunder, or with solid dps, like the Greatstaff of the Four Winds, I just think they look way more stupid than they need to. <br />
<br />
What warriors, especially REAL warriors (like ogres), need are big axes, brutal looking hammers, spiked clubs, cool looking swords, etc. What we don't need are completely bizarre things that have no visible relationship to a weapon, and that really look like some kind of caster staff. The GSoT might be a sort of balancing tool making badly needed aggro and dps available to warriors not able to summon up 60 person raids to gather them gear, but it shouldn't come with the penalty of making them look like gimps. I mean, I might be a welfare warrior, but do I have to run around with a sign saying &quot;GIMP&quot; on my back by carrying around some freaky caster staff/weapon?<br />
<br />
The Exe Axe or Earthen Blade -- now THOSE were cool weapons. Mithril 2Handed sword? Win! Felhammer? Win! Club of the Ykesha? Win! GSoT? Not Win!<br />
<br />
Bring back the Exe Axe!<br />
<br />
(Maybe if I just put an Anger III proc on the Exe Axe...?)<br />
<br />
P.S. I will agree that the sword of the bloodsworn looks just fine, and even the droga hammer is okay. Props there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lances own. Walking around with a 7ft long ribbed shaft just makes people stop and go &quot;Holy shyt!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree.<br />
GSoT's biggest &quot;win&quot; is that the group can regocnize it easy and know you have an at least decent aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, who the hell designed that weapon ?<br />
I mean, for Shamans and Bards the graphic is kinda fitting, but for a warrior ?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
If used in real world settings, the weapon would have a lousy balance and that ring thingy would be anethemae to doing any significant damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I rather like the Blade of War graphic. Bloodied Berserker's Blade should have looked like the Sword of Truth though. :p<br />
<br />
And here is where I agree with Furor wholeheartedly... gimmie Rallos' flaming axe of own.<br />
<br />
They could probably stand to make a couple more true polearm models. The Black Acrylia Halberd model was a nice start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">your droppin a 2 inch thick stone ring on something, that has to hurt.<br />
<br />
the GSo4w? i agree, looks like a big tazer, and when ya fight with it...... its like a giant push broom :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Exe axe all the way!!! That is one of the coolest weapon models ever. Put some flames on it and BAM! That would be the axe of pwn. I weild a Poleaxe of Sorrow for DPS, if I hear one more &quot;oh you have a windblade&quot; comment I am gonna go bezerk on some poor caster. Big lances, big hammers, big axes!</div></div><hr />

Usually, they stop and go &quot;Why do you need such compensation?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not mad for many of the new weapon models (the LSoEE is still one of my favourites) ... but the first thing I wanna see is an end to the poking with my 2HB.  It's not a game of 9-ball!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there is no lance model in game currently that doesnt look even gayer than centi Longswords and Black Acrylia Halberds.  Please, no more gigantic dildoes of doom.<br />
<br />
Lances wouldnt be usable anywhere except a horse anyway - they should replace all warrior 2hp weapons' graphics with the priceless velium spear graphic.  THERES a spear.<br />
<br />
But yes, Exe Axe was a great graphic.  As are many of the graphics in LoY and LDoN.  Too bad neither expansion includes a single warrior usable weapon worth equipping past lvl 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">your droppin a 2 inch thick stone ring on something, that has to hurt. <br />
heh ... not as much as hitting them with a Frostreaver or something like that, yet it performs just as well.<br />
<br />
On another not, I really like the look of the Stone Etched War Sword (aka. SEWS). Snapshot of  Gerald wielding it (http://members.cox.net/mondo/sews2.jpg). I'd really like one of those. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I definately agree... GSo4W rocks but I feel like a pansy wielding it... exe axe, earthen blade, palladus axe of slaughter... that is for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree.  The fact that my BBB looks like the standard luclin trash 2hs, along with a lot of other weapons makes me sad.  I wish it had the Sword of Truth look, or at least some special model, not something so common.  I loved my GSo4W, but I really got tired of that look.  Especially since 2hb has a piercing animation, it looks like a fork.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm one of those that trully despise the 2hb piercing animation, i mean Come on, Just make it Share the 2hs Animation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tug<br />
<br />
You hit this right on the head.<br />
<br />
Two of the weapons I use often GSOT and Club of Mad Researcher look fairly ridiculous.  The animation on 2HB really is particularly sad....with illusion frog I look like I am waving a baton in a parade.<br />
<br />
I loved the ol' Exec axe.  Loved the EBW, loved the SSoY.  <br />
<br />
In SoE defense though: some the weaps I do use also look fairly cool...I like my CHSD and the droga weapons looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree.  I myself, like the look of the Windblade for an axe (albeit some plagerism from LoTR).  I'd love to see some 2h axes with big stone blades, chips in them, make them look like a warriors weapon for crying out loud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">id like to see some fuggin gore :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Too bad we can't apply the dam/dly of the best weapon we own to our epic some how.  The JBoW is the best looking warrior weap, bar none.   I also wish there was a 2-hander with the Katana of Pain look (maybe there is, but I don't know of any).  I can't complain about my WMBS too much, I like Japanese style weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">WMBS looks cool when held, but don't ever watch yourself swinging it! Holding a staff weapon at the middle and then swinging it overhead with your legs spread is not a pretty sight!<br />
My favorite graphics are the Cazic Thule 2.0 look. I used to have both the 10/19 1hb and the 33/36 2hs. Stone hammerhead or stone axe blade on a shaft that actually looked like wood.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Old Primal 1H swords are also pretty nice .. simple, yet elegant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now make the same graphic about 25% bigger and it would draw the &quot;ooooh's and aaaaaah's&quot;<br />
<br />
It is by far the best looking sword in game , the detail is amazing.<br />
<br />
But i want RZ's axe for sure, gimme some spell effects on my weapons , they are magic after all!!</div></div><hr />

and the sword from NToV he's talking about looks like that flamberge with root as proc that Tunare drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I like the skull club with the spikes on it, a la Hategiver or Blackout or, I think, Sky-something off Va'Dynn</div></div><hr />

Agree that Gaudralek is still probably the best lookin 2 hander a warrior can get tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've always liked the realisitic look of the SEWS myself. It actually looks like a REAL sword.<br />
<br />
Executioner's Axe also looks very cool/realistic, but I'm more partial to swords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Used an Earthen Blade during my midlvls long time ago. Loved the look. All it needs its flame effects and [SERIOUS] stat upgrades and Id pull it out of the bank lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Btw , besides that sword that Seru holds on the SS on Illias(never seen him holding it in game) the best looking swords in game are BoW and Sword of Ssraeszha.(Havent seen a DBoTW yet in game)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Dakryn, DBoTW = BoW in 1 handed form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Khalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yttrium War Axe is my favorite at the moment. Wish I could use it more often :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Really wish I knew why they decided there should be no realy good(end game) axes in the game after Velious. I really wish there was a nice big 2H Axe I could use and be effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Borix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Really the worst thing about the GSoT graphic is that especially before the droprate was upgraded i got asked for a SoW every time i was in PoK. /agree Abividad<br />
<br />
It has definitely a Shaman's look over it. But then again, i have never seen a graphics change unless something was really wrong (the &quot;boobs&quot; armor from Velious comes to mind).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">/steps on soapbox<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that all plate armor looks the same, the only real way to look different or interesting is by having cool weapons. =&gt; <br />
<br />
If I see a bazaar warrior with a split blade of destruction, my immediate reaction=idiot with too much plat. <br />
<br />
See a GSoT and I think=&gt; smart guy, but I do feel sorry for him having to wield a weapon with that graphic.<br />
<br />
I m actually very fashion victim (and somewhat idiotic) myself.....I was in such a hurry to ditch my Copper hammer of striking I bid on Vallon's Scimitar and the Jagged shard of Frozen Flame off Jiva......both of which are ok offhand (especially auged), but dodgy when defensive. Then again, they were cheap dkp-wise and both look very cool :p<br />
<br />
My BoC is still my mainhand workhorse, but I hate the twinky graphic with a vengeance (damn cheapass Cursed and RZ.....1 BF and 3 BoW s in 25 kills each, 2 of which went to warriors who quit=&gt; we are cursed). At least it is recognizable on a veteran warrior as an enraging blow weapon. <br />
<br />
Dammit, yeah, there should be more F****ing warrior only 2 handers (especially huuuuuuge axes and swords like the Frostmourne in WC3) like back in the heydays of NToV.<br />
<br />
/em steps off soapbox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tsebach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think the operative word here is &quot;elegant&quot;.  Far too many of the new weapon designs that come out are over the top.  That splitblade thing just offends my senses.  The bloodsworn is about at fancy as it should get.  Just make it look like an finely honed, balanced weapon that an noble warrior wouldn't get laughed at for brandishing on the battlefield.  Heck... I'll take more katanas any day of the year!  I'll even forego particle effects... I don't need 'em.<br />
<br />
PS.  My guildmates used to call my GSoT the &quot;anti-bard picket sign&quot;.  I'm so glad I sold it for 40k when they didn't drop off EC orcs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>digmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The axe of reckoning looks awesome....I hear it is the same look as the blade of angels.</div></div><hr />

http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=641<br />
Same look actually than Tunare 2hander that is knight only.<br />
Personally i like bloodfrenzy/BoW look and some of the knight 2handers from elementals.<br />
Still wish i could at least equip the sword of truth i have banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I always liked Gaudralek. That weapon imho was the best appearing weapon I have ever seen ( even better looking than sword of truth )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I like the look of katana of pain (samurai sword). It's just simple and awesome.</div></div><hr />

And the 2Hb animation looks friggin' retarded. Hasn't any of the friggin' designers seen &quot;Conan&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">No, but The Hustler is usually playing in SoE's breakroom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Personally, I think most weapons in EQ are too .. humm .. large in the snse of being manga-fied. They are huge and clumsy in some cases, often being so big that they would break the wrist of any regular man if were even just trying to pick it up, no less wield it.<br />
<br />
We want more elegant swords in the game dammit !<br />
Like the Narsil (http://www.cbswords.com/product_info.php/cPath/21/products_id/41) from lord of the rings movie, that's elegant.<br />
<br />
Oh well - I guess the overly large stuffs is popular with the kiddies.</div></div><hr />
