<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OKay, I need some help. In fact I need quite a bit of advice. <br />
<br />
Brief backstory, so that no one needs bother to ask: <br />
<br />
My guild is currently just breaking into EP, we've done a couple fire named, a couple earth rings. Before I joined, my guild used to clear VT quite a bit, but I have never gotten my VT key, and it looks like VT may be a thing of the past for my guild. I am raiding every single day and soon I'm going to need to start thinking about what and how I should upgrade. Obviously none of my gear is great, and I can replace all of it easily. <br />
<br />
My concern, however, is that from everything I've read and all the very uber warriors I've talked to, AC is the greatest concern. At least insofar as you can get say 3 pieces of gear that all have 125-150 hps, but the best piece is the one with the highest AC. I've looked at a lot of EP loot and noticed a disturbing trend: very low AC values on a lot of the loot, enough to make me *really* wish I had my VT key. It may be that I'll never get mine, and I get extremely disheartened when I see stuff like the 50ac mask and 20ac earrings, etc from VT. <br />
<br />
Raex's is an obvious choice for any of the visible armor slot, but really I'm looking for what I can do, with no VT loot, to get the highest AC possible. I've noticed a few pieces seem okay, such as puresteel mantle from Air, but in general I'm disapointed. Is there EP gear out there for warriors that has a comprable AC to VT gear? Am I worrying too much about AC? <br />
<br />
Anyone with advice, all comments are most welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Concentrate on Raex and fill the rest up in Time. EP accessory slots are mostly crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Puresteel Mantle<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Fang of Flame<br />
<br />
are the only two items I can think of off the top of my head non-visible slot wise that I would wear out of the EP's.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are a few other items and hopefully someone can post 'em ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/sigh <br />
<br />
That's what I was afraid of....Time's a long way away, but I guess my VT key just became an even bigger priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I took a peek at your magelo, you are *not* sitting that badly off what a VT geared warrior would be. Don't get me wrong, I highly encourage you to get your key...there are some *very* nice items there. If you raid every day, you will fill out your Raex within a few months, and you'll be sitting very close to what my magelo is now, and I've tanked all of the hardest hitters from start to finish before (other than Reparm, tanked him to 4% till he triple procced me =x) i.e. Fennin, Rathe Council, Xegony, Blazzex, and otther normal loot farm mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, looks like you have a decent amount of AA's, so I would assume you do some LDoN, and if not, I'd encourage you to do it (even though I myself can't stand it). Some 10 ac augs on your current gear would bring it up to around VT quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Loyalist Shield of Honor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7398)<br />
<br />
Not from EP's or VT, but easy to get, and worth it imo.  Hps aren't great, though not horrid either.  It's a huge ac boost.  Pretty much all but the final guy can be done solo / duo.  Final guy isn't difficult either, only need a couple people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An earlier thread with some info when I was asking the exact same question. Just a little more information for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomercy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and have tons of plat you were never gonna use  i would consider the Aid Grimil quest.. not only can you get 2 nice earrings ( 1) 25 ac-145hp  2) 17 ac 115 hp) but his will save you dkp for other purchases. I decided to start the quest only haveing my smithing( for seru bane ) and brewing( cause RL bartender). My starting skills were smithing 190 brewing 45  i think fletching was 50 and the rest zero.  I bought enough INT gear in bazaar that with kei i can get to 240  and in 2 months of downtime  tradeskilling im 2 combines away from Signet of might( 25 ac 145hp +25 stats + 15 saves( i think  maybe 10) aura of daring and 8% dodge mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was in allmost exactly the same situation you were in when I started out in my current guild; I still don't have VT key, but haven t really missed it. I never replaced stuff like my belt and earrings in the EP s, but I can tank most mobs fine.<br />
<br />
If your guild uses dkp, you ll want to save points for Raex anyway; this is some of the only stuff specifically designed for warriors at the high end and thus it is much better value, not least because even Time armor is not much better. <br />
<br />
The Puresteel mantle is the only other good EP item we get, which really is a bit depressing. <br />
<br />
The Moss encrusted band is nice, but rare (read, hard to win a bid on it) as is the PoEb earring.<br />
<br />
However odds are on by the time you have Raex in all visible slots, your guild will be close to time and even phase 1/2 items are great there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brackon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While it is not the &quot;best&quot; in the game, there are some really good upgrades you can get in the EP prior to Time. <br />
<br />
 If/when your guild kills Coirnav, he has a great earring. It is the highest AC/HP combo you will find EP wise. Yeah, you will piss off casters right and left, but who cares.<br />
<br />
 Avatar of Earth from PoEB, has a decent BP, little better than VT. It could easily fill in until you get to Time, because once in Time it will take you some time to get to the BP's.<br />
<br />
 Arbitor of Earth from PoE had a decent shield. AC70ish with Furious bash IV (adds to hate). <br />
<br />
 There is a ring or 2 that drop in the Plane of Water on misc. named mobs. <br />
<br />
 Bracer of Earthen energy from PoE. Another quality item..it will allow you to put haste on your wrist slot and free your back for much better AC items. <br />
<br />
 Honestly, there is a ton of things that will upgrade you in the EP's. You just need to do some research to see what fits you best. Aslo, do LDoN. 2600 adventure points adds 50AC(raw) to slots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tossing some relatively cheap 10ac augments on a few elemental items isn't a bad idea. 50ac Puresteel Mantle seems to be a popular choice.<br />
<br />
Also in a guild that farms elementals, mobs like AoW (30ac ring... augment it to 40ac if ya so desire) are much, much easier than they used to be. You might be surprised.<br />
<br />
And of course Signet of Might, if you have the platinum to burn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">... mobs like AoW (30ac ring... augment it to 40ac if ya so desire) are much... <br />
<br />
  10ac augments do not fit on rings. Only non-visible armor slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">10ac augments do not fit on rings. Only non-visible armor slots. <br />
<br />
Hehe re-read this statement. Ever see rings on your character? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Rings and earrings aren't armor slots... they're jewelry slots! Gorget, pauldrons, visor, cloak and belt are non-visible armor. I just wish they kept up their trend and allowed 40hp augments for gloves and bracers... Anyways, maybe the distinction was only clear in my head.</div></div><hr />

is a EP piece i have which is nice, drops off of FRo tho soo</div></div><hr />

It's sad, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jubea of Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">not really, VT was end of game luclin so obviously some of the loot there will be a fair contender for even some time loot. and in all actuallity when you look at it, some of them do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wouldn't call it sad, unless you like having to upgrade every gear slot on 6 month cycles.<br />
<br />
When we did our VT romp I said to myself, forgoe any visible slots, stick to stuff that will last till time. It was hard to do, but came away with mask, ear, belt, bp. Only thing I'm missing is the neck but it's still pricey and romps for just aten are rare for us now unless nothing in fire is up heh. Only took helm cause EP is beyond rare and there's enough competition between the 30+ plates on a raid compared to the cheese that is leather / silk drops.<br />
<br />
And yeah, ep non vis save puresteel is pretty laclustre for a tank IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">An augmented Girdle of Earthen Stability looks nicer to me than the Belt of Mastery. At the very least, I don't think I'd just do VT for belts.<br />
<br />
The BP, mask and neck are keepers, no question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Belt of mastery owns all EP belts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">IMO, Aten gloves, neck, mask, and earring are worth getting as well as Belt of Mastery and either BP of Speed or Aten BP.  I have all of those and consider the gloves to be the best despite the fact that they're the only one I've replaced so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This may all change soon though.  I fully expect that GoD will not have full armor sets and will likely include more non-visible slots.<br />
<br />
AC for tanks is a little more important these days though and that often seems to be reflected in the items that are dropping.  We shall see what comes soon enough though but my money in on a more Luclinesque weapons and non-visible slot expansion.</div></div><hr />
