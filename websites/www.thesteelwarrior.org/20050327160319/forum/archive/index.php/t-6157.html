<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThunderHeart</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All..<br />
<br />
              I am one step away from completeing my epic and I would like some advice on how to handle the queen different from what i have been doing.. Maybe I jus have had bad luck, please read on and you tell me...<br />
<br />
              First off, I am 3 boxing her with a rogue buddy that let me in down there... Warrior, Cleric, Shaman... All 65, all Good gear.. We are all on ALLY faction in chardok...<br />
<br />
              So heres what we do. We kill the 6 roamers in the hall. Pacify all in room, except door guards.. now pull 2 door guards.. Now we pacify all again, and pull the queen.. All is going great, we get her solo everytime.. Her AE isnt a big deal... Here is the big deal.. She keeps running at 13% and I am quite tired of it hehe... Has anyone ran into this with her that 3 boxes/6 boxes or whatever ya do.. And how did ya handle it... We tried to root, no go, tried snare, no go...<br />
<br />
              I have a few ideas i cant try till this WED when my rogue buddy gets back, here they are... 1) Either pull her and another mob/ at 35% go get another mob.. thinkin she wont run if her guard is there... 2) Try root/snare again, (snarewhip killin my DPS hehe) and let her run, while my rogue friend opens the door and have a friend pull all the mobs out the libary and upstairs so i can jus beat her down.. this sounds dumb, but dieing all night is gettin old.. 3) Somehow get her to zone in, cuz having 15 of them mobs beatin on me might be alil easier then 15 gaurds hehe...<br />
<br />
             I could allways bring more people, but tryin to do this as grudge/revenge thing.. Funny thing, when i did my clerics epic, the king took the death like a champ hehe, no bish in him.. So i appreciate all your knowledge you offer, rather bad or good...<br />
<br />
Thanks All.. =) I think one of my Ideas will work, but i hope you know something i dont, such as she IS rootable, she IS snareable.. and i jus been havin bad luck.. she was debuffed nicely and they didnt take.. So i dunno...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good luck, sounds like fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She does gate, so unless you're supremely confident your cleric can keep her locked down with stun I wouldn't recommend rooting her.  We had this same problem first time we tried her, she started running and someone rooted her to stop her from getting back past the fake wall.  She gated and this was.....bad.  Would recommend snaring if possible :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Break out your kunzar ku'jah or silken whip of ensnaring and hope that it lands.  You might also buy some of those ensnaring throwing items that shamen can make.  I have never seen one land on a mob, but I usually only toss them at boss mobs on inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dispell her 3 or 4 times to start.  Park her halfway up the ramp past king room and she wont gate.  chain root her when low so she doesnt get far.  If you have snare that will work as long as shes dispelled first.  <br />
<br />
I've 2 boxed king and queen.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Specc</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did as follows (was WAY overkill) ... had a 65 rogue with SOS unlock and escort a 65 mage (ally to chardok) to the walkway just before king / queen ..  i beleive just pass library (i dunno i was COH'd) .. any who .. i with my bard ... had mage enter king room .. target .. /tell rs lull %t .. i /assist mage lull .. we did all mobs in king room .. then i stunned king and dropped it on my warrior... was flawless... melee in at get go .. nukers unload at 30 pct ... 2 wizzy chain telekin (stun) at 10 pct ... king down .. then did identical with the Queen... had 1 add on the Queen.. but was mezd and we took care after the Queen was killed... i have however heard of this .. Chanter or Bard or Rogue or Monk walk all the way to the king / queen (non kos faction of course) ... lull and agro king .. lulling everythign back on the way .. pulled king / queen all the way to the zone line (this is rumor of course.. but is also posted on eqclerics board) .. then at zone line .. had a group unleash on him / her .. hardest thing IMO about king / queen is the HOT Landing Zone when  you COH in ... how we did .. Bard was first on COH with invis song on .. then disbanded coh chain .. then cleric .. disband join bard.. etc till we had 2 clerics 1 chanter 2 tank 1 bard in the main group to hold it for the others</div></div><hr />
