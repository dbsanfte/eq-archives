<br />
There were recent improvements to Bash when they made clerics 'melee-clerics' They upped the damage from Bash depending upon the AC of the shield.<br />
<br />
What kind of damage does a good shield do with Bash?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think at 55 kick stuns level 1-55 mobs so I don't know if it's worth wasting time with a shield. And don't even think about it with a 2hander.<br />
<br />
Imho, it's kinda a shame that warriors can't choose their style. like in Diablo 2, say where you have the 'weapon shield' style and the 'dual wield' style.. but this is how it is :o</div></div><hr />

Kick does very little damage,and I am a Barbarian so i can Slam. What I want to know is with Bash and the new increases to clerics a while back, what kind of damage does a good shield do bashing?</div></div><hr />

6) Shields and blocking<br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wait now ^_^</div></div><hr />

She started working on bash recently in good groups, she got a 70 dmg bash with her bashing skill at 130 I think it was.  That was the highest bash to date I have seen her get, she gets em in the 50's all the time using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far with my skill at 222 i have bashed as high as 97. Its just fun to switch out every now and then and have fun with a shield :)</div></div><hr />

Beo</div></div><hr />

I have never seen a stun message but I have seen that %t casting is interrupted. I have been using this method not for very long, but it seems to help at the point I am at in game. I didin't use bash for along time after duel wield either now I have my skill up in the 110's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i only has a Sarnak shield; but if i had a FB(x) shield who knew what good it would have done.</div></div><hr />
