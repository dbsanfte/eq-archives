<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">08-11-2005, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i decided to reroll a new warrior, on the horde side this time (new server too).  Its a normal server so Im going all defensive (MS to lvl to 60 then respec) and need some advice on gear.  I started on this server with a rogue so I'm going to use the rogue to farm money, mine arcanite, and prob mine dark iron as well.  With a farming toon, I dont need my tank to go offensive at all, and without the ganking pvp I'll be set.<br />
<br />
Here is the gear list I will aim for.  Most (if not all) is either Bought items, 5 man groupable, or easy quests which dont require a raid.  I want to try to avoid raiding with more than 1 group if possible, at least until later on.  It will take me a long time to get these items, but I will eventually get em.<br />
<br />
Tank Gear										Defense<br />
<br />
Head – 		Enchanted Thorium Helm 			[Crafted]		+13<br />
                                .      or Golem Skull Helm 				[Drop – BRD]		+11<br />
Neck - 		Medallion of Grand Marshal Morris		[AH Bought]		+15<br />
Shoulders – 	Stockade Pauldrons	 			[AH Bought]		+15<br />
Cloak - 		Redoubt Cloak					[Drop - DM]		+10<br />
Chest – 	Enchanted Thorium Breastplate   		[Crafted]		+13<br />
                .      or Ornate Adamantium Breastplate			[Quest]			+15<br />
                .      or Kromcrush's Chestplate				[Drop – DM]		+15 <br />
Wrist – 		Bracers of Valor					[AH Bought]		<br />
Hands - 	Stonegrip Gauntlets  				[AH Bought]		+15<br />
		.      or Stronghold Gauntlets				[Crafted]<br />
Waist – 	Stalwart Clutch 					[Quest - BRD]		+12<br />
Legs – 		Enchanted Thorium Leggings			[Crafted]		+12<br />
Feet – 		Boots of Avoidance				[AH Bought]<br />
Ring1 - 		Not sure<br />
Ring2 - 		Not sure<br />
Trinket1 -  	Not sure<br />
Trinket2 - 	Force of Will?					[Drop - BRD]		+10<br />
Ranged - 	Anything?<br />
<br />
1H - 		Any with 40+ DPS.				<br />
		.    or Timeworn Mace?					[Drop – DM]<br />
Shield - 	Draconian Deflector				[Drop BRS]		+15<br />
<br />
Now whats a good defensive skill to have later on?  (Heard 435+ was good).  Is the Anticipation talent required?  Also Im not sure what to use for the trinkets, fingers, main hand, ranged, and shield (assuming I cant get the Drac Deflector).  Could someone please recommend those slots?<br />
<br />
Also do mobs higher up disarm you at all?  Stronghold Gaunts are nice for the disarm immunity but is it required for tanking?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Indeathinite</div><div class="date">08-11-2005, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll just use this opportunity to make a shameless reference to my gear guide post &quot;Indeathinite's High-End Gear&quot; or whatever I decided to name it. Check it out. You have good gear in mind, and I explain why I chose the items I did and what bonuses you can receive from them--most of the items you have listed are on my list as well. <br />
<br />
As for +Def...I am having trouble with these items, myself. Not acquiring them, for I have already done that for the most part. My biggest problem lies in the question of whether or not you can have &quot;too much defense.&quot; Sure, it makes you take less damage, but does it make you a better tank? I am currently investigating this. The drawback with so much armor/+Def items is that with so much dodge/block/parry/damage mitigation, are you generating enough rage to have a sufficient supply to use your threat-generating abilities. So far I haven't had enough time to test the balance between these things, but after 425 defense it seems as if +Sta gear becomes much more important. You've successfully reduced the critical hit rate on yourself to almost slim-to-none, and the additional defense doesn't seem to make as much of an impact as previously thought.<br />
<br />
I have my own questions about this, and I intend to do investigations on such whenever I have enough time. As for now, I do not know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">08-11-2005, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read your post and we do share similar pieces.  I would like to reduce the amount of PUG raiding or groups as possible.  Having 3 DM drops compared to 7 would be easier for me, because I'll probably have an easier time farming for the gold to buy AH items than to run DM X more amount of times.  Raids like UBRS, LBRS, Strath, Scholo, etc are what I'm trying to avoid as much as possible.<br />
<br />
For the Defensive skill, I guess we can both agree with with 425 number.  AT lvl 60 a warrior should have 300 skill, and 310 if they have 5 points in Anticipation.  That would leave 115 defense points left that needs to be attained via gear.  I would say that after you have 425ish defensive skill, then you can start working more on % dodge etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smotts' Compass (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3812) is excellent for the work, and makes it easier to justify skipping the Mark of Tyranny and getting Blackhand's Breadth should you get some UBRS time in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the feedback folks, it was a great help.  I think I might lose the disarm-immune gloves for more +def.  I just wasnt sure if mobs disarmed in the higher higher instances since I never really tanked.</div></div><hr />
