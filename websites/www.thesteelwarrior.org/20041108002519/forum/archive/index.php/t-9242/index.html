<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw a whole bunch of warrior discs on allakhazams (like those stun ones, the 5401 strike or whatever) but i have NO clue where to get them.  Does anyone else???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of them are scrapped discs that were going to be given to us in the openings system. The decided not to do that, but the stuff is still in the database, since it was on the test server. Throw stone is real though. You can get that at Abysmal Sea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol why the heck would i want to use throw stone?????  it doesnt even stun or anything lol<br />
<br />
thanks for the info though.  they should have given us the stun discs, the fools</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it breaks roots, so usefull when you target yourself...<br />
moreover, it can give you a tagging tool if you have forgot to equipe your bow and arrows, but you can't incite just after :(<br />
Moreover if you have the correct AA (finishing blow), and the correct situation (fighting a low lvl mob that flies away at low health) you can use it for a 32000 crit domage (always very nice on a screenshoot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">reeeeally?  i should go buy it!  is it in pok?<br />
<br />
well i cant buy it this week, im gonna be camped in ssra all week so i can get me emp key for an emp raid on sat :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can hit stuff that normally requires bane to hit with Throw Stone and contribute 0.1 DPS.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it breaks root on mobs but I always use it if a mob is rooted because rooted mobs are a pain when there's more than one melee on it.</div></div><hr />
