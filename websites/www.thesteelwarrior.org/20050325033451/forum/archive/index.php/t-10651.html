--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
- World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.2.2 (2005-02-15)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
  <br />
  Paladin<br />
  Seal of the Crusader: Fixed a bug where damage per swing was <br />
  increasing instead of decreasing when Seal of the Crusader was active.<br />
  This resulted in a dramatic increase in damage per second (DPS) that <br />
  was unintended.  The tooltip for the spell displays the intent of <br />
  the spell:<br />
<br />
  &quot;Fills the Paladin with the spirit of a crusader, granting additional <br />
  attack power.  The Paladin also attacks faster, but deals less damage <br />
  with each attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
  The overall increase in DPS from Seal of the Crusader should only <br />
  result from the increase in attack power and not from the increase in <br />
  attack speed.  We understand this is a significant decrease in the <br />
  power of this spell, but was a necessary bug fix to ensure both <br />
  overall game balance and the viability of different Paladin Seals.<br />
<br />
- The tooltip for the Warrior's Intercept ability has been updated to <br />
  reflect the proper rage cost. Using Intercept now requires 10 rage, <br />
  not 15 rage. The tooltip now accurately reflects that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, where are the fixes to rage generation with parry/block?  Where is the decreased miss rate on special attacks?  Where is the fix for missing an execute and blowing all your rage?  Ah well, guess we'll have to wait another month.<br />
<br />
So close to 40.  Just let me on please.  I wanna mame some more gorillas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
those can all be fixed without a patch Im reall not sure why they arent yet</div></div><hr />

While doing that, they'll fix a few bugs while they can.<br />
<br />
I dont think we'll get our fixes to rage gen on block/dodge/parry until they do the next content patch.</div></div><hr />

They just happened to fix a thing or two that was either really bad or really easy to fix as well.</div></div><hr />

The spider belt now has a 30 minute cooldown, as it was almost certainly intended too. Of course the interesting question is what other un-announced changes were put in place.</div></div><hr />
