<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">probably means cornering a mob..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cornering, tanking, chain CHing, DPSing before clerics OOM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he's talking about when MT put the mob in a corner to tank.  believe AoW encounter was close to one of the most popular mobs to fight like that , so AoW style kinda caught on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">problems with AoW style...<br />
<br />
Cornering can end up to walling mob, ie no trueshot/archery<br />
<br />
Also after some zone geometry fixes, some zones large races even when shrunk cannot see targets when they get cornered, this happens in Kael now.<br />
<br />
Cornering is good for mobs that do PBAOE based on their target,  keeps the silly melee dps'rs from getting AoE'd. Also good for those melee who think that balance means to all get on same side and push... as the mob does a little tour of the surounding landscape..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the main advantage of this strategy was to minimize riposting on the rest of the raid?<br />
<br />
If everyone but the MT sees the mobs back, no one gets riposted - right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Minimize ripost, maximize dps...<br />
<br />
all in all a good, boring tactic :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another advantage of cornering is that it negates caster/melee push. Once the mob is in the corner with it's back to the raid, they can pretty much stop worrying about pushing it all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, mobs don't move all over and rogues don't waste backstabs on moving mobs (huge DPS increaser there).  Plus, mobs and MT don't get out of healers/nukers range when they are not melee'ing.  This tactic is important for AE'ing mobs too if casters can hide from the AE and not worry about the range to targets changing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgor</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">someone said it before but cornering a mob will not result by a DPS increase as your rangers wont be able to shoot arrows at most corner'd mobs . and ranger DPS with bow and AM3 &gt;&gt;&gt; backstab dmg . The only advantage of cornering a mob is that it wont get pushed all over norrath by those &quot;!$%&amp;Ä'/ mini pets and by your melees that doesnt understand jack about mob positioning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoW style is useful in tight places to keep the mob in one place, and I've never had a problem with sight, or agro when using this tactic on raids.<br />
<br />
While it does kill ranger DPS, it makes them expendable as snare/WS agro pumpers =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since no one actually answered you...<br />
<br />
 AoW style pinning is when the MT backs into a corner(maximum shrunk preferably) and has the raid push the mob onto them. The walls will stop it from being pushed overt he warrior and keep it firmly into a single position, and right on the warrior so range is easy to maintain. Mob doesn't move at all. A 90 degree corner is best if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple solution for the large races that get that &quot;Cannot see your target message&quot; when corner tanking....look up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you saying as a large race double shrunk you can look up and be able to hit them again? or are you just being sarcastic? Just curious.. as we have used gnome illusions lately on all our large race tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">looking up works.  I double shrink myself, back up and look up, works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last two AoW pimpings we have done.<br />
<br />
one, I was double shrunk barbarian, could not target from the corner.<br />
second, Another MT, Troll was double shrunk, could not target.<br />
<br />
never had any problems before the geometry change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnarian</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was double shrunk in the corner on Vindi after that geometry patch and could hit fine, I was looking up thought never looked down.  Couldn't corner Doomshade though in Umbral Plains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't tanked in Kael in awhile, but some mobs in PoP you get a lot of &quot;Can't see&quot; BS. What always works for us is to constantly walk backwards.<br />
<br />
 Also, just because the game says can't see, or too far away, doesn't mean yer not hitting. Sometimes your client thinks yer too far/can't see but to the server yer still wailing away. Make sure you look at your melee window and see if yer still swinging or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't being sarcastic at all.  We recently did a Vindi kill to get a bp for an old friend who came back to the game.  I was corner tankin and started to get that &quot;Can't see&quot; bs and I just looked up...worked perfectly fine from there.  Tried it in BoT NW tower as well with those fuggin Skygges and worked fine there too.<br />
<br />
Only thing that sucks is having to stare at crotch for the duration of the kill :p</div></div><hr />
