<br />
My guild is rather smallish, but we are capable of Epic's I am sure. We will need to hit Venril Sathir soon, so I had a question.<br />
<br />
Is his lifetap a proc or a spell? If it is a proc, will evasive help avoid this?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a Proc.  Depending on how fast your guild can kill VS I would suggest using Furious as the disc.  Just pull and when VS is inc blow Furi and have everyone engage right away.  VS can't proc if riposted so durring those 8 seconds you will be invinvible.  If you have a good number of nukers you can burn VS down in 20 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like.<br />
<br />
Is this the consensus? Any suggestions if we don't have a strong Nuker Attendance?</div></div><hr />

If he can't hit you, he can't proc on you (my understanding). But a normal miss will allow him to proc. This is only what I've heard, never actually tanked this guy. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

Another option is to chain cast Rune shields on the tank, VS can't proc while attacking a Rune shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
he doesn't proc every hit. Just keep the Main Assist up with good heals and Runes and keep the DPS at his back and you will be ok.<br />

I mean, we are talking having to do this guy at least 5+ times in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get used to the cost.  The rune strategy won't stop him from healing anymore, but it wil still soak some of the damage from your MT, and give heals a chance to land.  Peridots and pearls and emeralds or whatever reagents you need, you'll just have to accept the fact that you're going to spend some money to kill some mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I can accept that.<br />
<br />
Not like the guild is THAT broke, it just seems like there must be another way.<br />
<br />
Is he immune to stuns?<br />
<br />
To tell you the truth, our guild has a good set of Enchanter's/Clerics/Pally's. Is Chain Stunning a viable solution? <br />
<br />
My Enchanter and my friends Wizard can chain stun pretty well at lower levels, I park on top of the mob (it's what made me want to play a Warrior really) and alternate my area effect ones, while he fills in my refresh time with Tishan's.<br />
<br />
Keeps em locked down tight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No stuns. You could borrow a high level shaman and disease slow him. It would definitely make him proc a lot less :)</div></div><hr />

If you want to tank VS easy :<br />
- Put on all your RM gear<br />
- Get RM buff<br />
- Get bard RM song<br />
<br />
At 500 i resisted 14 procs.<br />
At 400 it was 400-500 proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">honestly donnell; the best way to kill VS is to kill him as fast as possible with as much DPS as you can muster.<br />
<br />
we tried lots of different ways around his lifetaps but the best way was an all out gankfest; everyone all out offensive. the longer the fight=the more chances of it going bad.<br />
<br />
raiine=with the proper aa's/levels evasive becomes a more valid option to use for everyday usage than defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always used the chain rune method, used to work just fine. If that has been changed then perhaps have a ranger weaponshield him or a shammie dis slow, cripple and have tank go evasive.... He is always a full out offensive fight from get go, once MA has aggro locked...<br />
<br />
Also, NPCs can proc on a miss, just VS cannot, NPCs that have innate procs (not from weapons) have to hit to proc, NPCs using a weapon for the proc follows the same rules PCs do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rune cuts down on procs because any melee hit that does not actually damage you will not cause a proc. So unless the hit in question gets through your rune just on it's melee he will not proc.<br />
<br />
 So long as yer considering disc tanking him, have a ranger do it. Weaponshield is 20 seconds of parry, much better. Though it's a level 60 disc.<br />
<br />
 Also, spellshield will knock 700dmg off his lifetap as long as you keep it up, though wizards are much better off nuking=P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do we fight VS?<br />
<br />
Easy, Rangers tank him.  Rangers get a 20 second melee immunity /disc as opposed to the Warriors 8 second one.  We have killed him in less than 20 seconds, but it isn't necessary.  All you have to do is have 2 rangers.  On pull, the first ranger chain snares for aggro and engages Weaponshield.  Eveyone goes max damage on VS.  Usually this is enough to kill him.  If it isn't, have another Ranger chain snare in the last 5 seconds and the first Ranger start jolting.  This is usually sufficient to swith aggro and the second ranger can tank for another 20 seconds.  It's pretty easy to kill him in less than 40 seconds if you are experienced.  Just don't mess up because it takes a while for Weaponshield to reset.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we lose a ranger, but it's rare now.  VS may get off 1 or 2 taps in the fight.  We didn't do this last time we fought him, but even with me tanking him he dropped really fast and his DPS is pretty negligable to me at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that's always true.  There's that mob in Grieg's End that drops the cleric hammer with the Divine Aura proc.  For clerics, the proc lasts the usual length of time.  For that stupid mob, the proc lasts a few minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does that refute it in any way? He has the weapon, and he has to hit you to proc it. It's really retarded that it lasts like 2 minutes though.</div></div><hr />
