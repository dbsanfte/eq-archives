<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HI all<br />
<br />
For those of you that parse... or who just know :)<br />
<br />
Query: Looking for better 1 hander DPS combo than the Windblade.<br />
<br />
Specifics: 65 - 120 AA - No Guild - 150kish max to spend<br />
<br />
Comments: Heard all the POP 2-hander more damage with PB etc, so for the last few months have been using Windblade exclusively..am NOT looking for uber taunt weapons, I JUST want to find better DPS in a 1hander combo if possible. Also time split 50/50 between POP and old zones.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Chilly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buyable?<br />
<br />
- Split Blade of Destruction <br />
- Shortblade of Lightning <br />
- Disemboweler <br />
- Blade of Carnage <br />
- Sceptre of Destruction <br />
<br />
Maybe with Flurry, Ferocity, Raging Flurry and Ambidex.... maybe ...<br />
<br />
So 150kish max to spend:<br />
<br />
- Shortblad main, Split Blade or Disembolwer off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm...Don't think you can buy a better 1H combo that will beat windblade for sustained DPS, especially if you have PB. As far as 2H though, I've heard from a few that War Marshalls Bladed Staff will out-dps a windblade due to its speed.<br />
<br />
Some of the others with ele 1h's can comment here, but if you take the best 1H items and pit them against the best 2H, I think 2H will always win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the Windblade is about near the end of the line for the best buyable sustained DPS weapon.  I think it's second to the War Marshall's Bladed Staff.  The Windblades are awesome weapons, but boy do they look cookie-cutter.  I HATE the graphic on them, but I use it anyways. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just thought that I would add my 2cp.<br />
<br />
I have used and parsed both the Windblade and War Marshall's, and the War Marshall's staff out-DPS'd the Windblade every time.<br />
<br />
As far as your weapons go... 150k isn't much to find a 1h combo to outdamage a big 2h like the Windblade...<br />
<br />
But Faederya is right with what he said, the Shortblade and Disembowler would be a pretty good combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Faederya is right with what he said <br />
<br />
/scratches at Waeolwen's semantics<br />
<br />
&quot;She&quot;<br />
<br />
Normally in languages, words ending in feminine letters are classified as feminine... though, in english language, most words are non gender specific except a man's personal possessions; his car, his boat, his tools...<br />
<br />
/struts off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hit a nerve, didn't it Faederya?<br />
<br />
Yes, English is a neutral language in terms of sex.  The use of pronouns, such as he, she, or its is the form of indicating whether or not a word has sex to it.  Until then, you pretty much assume all words are neutral unless indicated.  Or, unless it's a proper noun where you can tell the difference - Nicole, Nate, Matt, Herman, etc.<br />
<br />
English sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at least both of ya aren't in l33tsp34k :D<br />
back on topic..i think she just about came up with the best buyable combo though...but all in all i'd still go with a faster 2Her like the war marshall's bladed staff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gotta agree on this one!  The Windblade in all of its ferocity looks like something you'd churn butter with :(<br />
<br />
Compare it to the graphic of the not-so-famous-now-adays Exe Axe.  Remember the first time you laid eyes on those Barb and Ogre warriors toting those MASSIVE axes around?  Now that was a graphic worthy of attention.  <br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A lot of people in EQ live by the rule, unless specifically told otherwise, assume all female characters in everquest are played my males.  This may lead to an uncomfortable moment such as the one above, but it's much worse to guess the other way and be wrong hehe.<br />
<br />
You tell Honeybritches 'I want to make sweet love to you'<br />
Honeybritches tells you 'Dude I'm a guy'<br />
You tell Honeybritches '...'<br />
<br />
No this is not from personal experience, just an example. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nah...they are posting as an alter personna, so refer to them by the sex of their alter personna. Besides, in my old guild (sadly now defunct), fully 30% of the active players were RL females (how do I know? We used to have RL meets), and while some males played female mains, the large majority of the female mains were played by females.</div></div><hr />

LOL!  Still chuckling at this one!!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">usually the name itself is a dead giveaway to what the actual sex the person is behind the toon :D....<br />
my first guild i think was 50/50 ratio guys to women...the person who got me into EQ in the first place was a RL girl :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">usually the name itself is a dead giveaway to what the actual sex the person is behind the toon ....<br />
<br />
Oh really?<br />
<br />
So what about:<br />
Kailyn<br />
Kailihn<br />
Kailynn<br />
Kaelen<br />
Kailen<br />
<br />
(all have been active on Povar, though I have not met the last 2 K's (in game), nor have I seen Kailynn since I have come back from my break).<br />
<br />
I can't say, but for some of the sexually explicet names, that I have seen a female toon and guessed the players sex by name.</div></div><hr />
