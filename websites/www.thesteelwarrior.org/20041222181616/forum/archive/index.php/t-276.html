<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tashin</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need help trying  to decide if I should use my gauntlets of the Myrmidon or not. I currently have SCHW. It is the only haste item I have. The myrmidons are a great increase in ac for me. My wife has a 57 shamy and we almost always play together. That being said would it be worth losing my haste item for ac?  If not should I get a different haste item? Also if you see any items I should upgrade please let me know. Thanks for the info guys/gals.<br />

<br />
haste is probably the most important stat for any melee. Nothing else you do will increase your DPS by a single item more than a haste item, and if you duo with your wife a lot, your DPS is important. Making things dead 22% faster is gonna be of more benefit to you than the slight reduction you'd get from increased AC.<br />
<br />
But don't take my word for it. Run some tests yourself. Go to Velks, or Seb or Chardok and kill some beasties, swapping the SCHW for the Mym's gaunts after a while and see how it feels to you. Maybe get a parser and log your fights. Do a hunt for an hour with the Myrm gaunts and see how much damage you take per fight with the increased AC.. Then do the same with the SCHW and see if the decreased kill time has lowered the damage you take, even with lower AC.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend Velks, cos the spiders don't run so you won't need snare, and they're all pure-warrior mobs (some are rogues, don't turn your back)</div></div><hr />

SS gaunts are damn good gloves, probably won't replace them for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah absolutely, SS gaunts are REALLY difficult to replace.  Get a belt haste and get those 90 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">obviously keep the myrmy gloves, but in the meantime swap out the haste, its all that really matter when duoing.<br />
<br />
i still use my quest gloves and prob wont replace to elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SS gloves are sweet. Id definitely sell the SCHWs and look to pick up a RBG. If that will take you some time, pick up a silvery belt of contention or a FBSS at a pinch until you have enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I would sell the SCHW and buy a FBSS.  You will go from 22% to 21% item haste.  You also will lose 3 raw AC (5 equipped).  You will gain however 90hps and 5 dex.<br />
<br />
Personally I am not sure it is an upgrade now but it is for the future.  I don't think it is a downgrade either though now.  This has to be about the closest swap I have seen.  More than likely though you will come out with 1k pp ahead though since the SCHW's are more valued than a FBSS.<br />
<br />
As to duoing with your wife's shaman, you will probably see things die about 0.6% slower (assuming 50% spell haste, 171/172 = 0.994) so it will have a small negative impact on your duoing as the hps won't help you with a shaman healer.  You already have enough hps for the shaman mini cheal.  For a druid or cleric though your extra hps helps with their versions of Cheal.<br />
<br />
You may be able to take the extra pp from the SCHW's and upgrade another piece of equipment with it to make up for the AC loss.  I really doubt you will ever &quot;notice&quot; the 1% of haste change.<br />
<br />
Not sure any of my rambling helps, bottom line reasons I would change are this:<br />
<br />
1)  SCHW's probably are only going to continue to come down in price<br />
<br />
2)  traditional haste upgrades are more easily obtained for belt/back slots<br />
<br />
3)  you will be hard pressed to upgrade over myrmidom gauntlets<br />
<br />
4)  you are farming HOT I assume where the 90hps helps with aoe's.<br />
<br />
5)  you should come out pp ahead for other upgrades<br />
<br />
6)  you gain 90 hps for 5 ac<br />

Figure out a way to wear them.  The vast majority of people who have been to ToV, but don't have GoDS yet are still wearing theirs.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gauntlets with good AC and stats are easier to come by than waist/back items with comparable AC and stats (I'm not saying that there aren't some damned good items available for the waist and back slots, just that really good gaunts are easier to get).  That having been said I'd go with a haste item on either back or waist slot (again waist is easier to get, FBSS will work in a pinch), and use the SS gaunts.  Or if you want an example of a warrior on a budget, currently I'm in Crystal Chitin gaunts and an FBSS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow....myrmydon gaunts are irreplaceable for someone at your level of equipment. I know Axgoreth's is a fine chunk of AC, but I'd really replace the belt with a Silvery Belt of Contention Silvery Belt of Contention (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=31203) (seen them for 5Kpp in the bazaar on the Nameless), or a Sash of the Dragonborn (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1623) (4Kpp'ish). That way, you get your haste, and you get to keep that nice AC and +90 HP's (let me restate that...+90 HP's!) of the myrmidon gaunts.<br />
<br />
In the end, I doubt you'll notice a difference in speed either way, but you will notice a difference with 90 more HP's.</div></div><hr />
