Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net)  shows a lot of different warrior &quot;spells&quot; but I realize that most of these are for a combat system that has not (will not?) been implemented. <br />
<br />
Was just hoping you could confirm that the tomes availible up to level 50 are only:<br />
<br />
Level 10 - Tome of Focused will discipline.<br />
<br />
Level 20 - Tome of Provoke discipline.<br />
<br />
Level 30 - Tome of Resistant discipline.<br />
<br />
Level 40 - Tome of Fearless dicipline.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Um... actually, this is implemented and has been for a few months.  And there are more tomes post-50 that are quite useful (aka, Incite).</div></div><hr />

That wasn't his question, he was asking what discs were available pre-50.</div></div><hr />

He thought that the system was not implemented.  I was just letting him know that it is, in fact, implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was talking about the opening system that was scrapped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh gotcha.  Since he didn't link to the actual &quot;spells&quot; in question, I figured he was just talking about more tomes.  I totally forgot about the whole opening debacle.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the topic of tomes. I just dinged 63 last night =).. I ran to POK library to get my 2 disc at 63 (Healing Will and Berate). OMG the price...340 pp each. Yes I will pay for them. Had to log so didn't run to bank and back to library. Man the price on these it way jacked up compared to pre 60 disc tomes.</div></div><hr />

Post-60 were new 'spells' and were priced reasonably imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should get Incite at 63, not Berate...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, try being a caster and having to pay 50k or sometimes more for a spell from a rune...  I was looking at 75k to buy Strike of Solusek for my wizard.  Fortunately a friend in a PoTime guild did a turn in for me and got it....  But on the other hand it is much much easier to farm pp with my wizard than with my warrior.</div></div><hr />
