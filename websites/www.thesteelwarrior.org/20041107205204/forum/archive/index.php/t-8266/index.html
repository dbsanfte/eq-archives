<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moncro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings to the Steel Warrior from Fellowship of Paragon, a Supergroup on the Champion server in City of Heroes. Our SG has over 60 members, not including alts, and is made up of mature, casual gamers who play mostly in the evenings and on weekends. Our members include a number of current and former EQ players, myself included. If you are interested in joining, please visit our website here (http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=16601&amp;TabID=150038#), or send a tell or e-mail in game to me. Even if you have no interest in joining our SG, I believe you will enjoy the resources we have collected in our tips and strategy section of our website.<br />
