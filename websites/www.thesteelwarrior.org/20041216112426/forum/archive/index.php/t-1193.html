<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadmar</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so we get access to the upper planes with the new patch.  My question is...would we have to get our flags to do the armor quest?  Or would we only need to get to 62 and get access to BoT, HoH for the npc to talk to me.<br />
<br />
I tried talking to the dorf with my 61 ranger(he has no flags whatsoever atm) and got no reply.  From what I heard...before yesterday's patch you were able to do the quest once you were flagged for BoT, HoH or CoD.<br />

There is one everytime thanks to the piss poor beta testing. Report it as a bug, don't take a chance and lose the armor. Of course that shouldn't happen, that was patched......</div></div><hr />

I had thought you would still need to get them in order to get into the EP, similar to the quested access.</div></div><hr />
