Tuesday July 20th Update <br />
<br />
- Augments can now fit into multiple slot types. On an augment the text could read &quot;This augment can fit in these slot types: 3, 4&quot;. <br />
<br />
- Zoning pets will now properly save their taunt toggle settings. <br />
<br />
- Spell damage messages done to yourself will no longer be displayed for others. Cannibalize and Mana Convert spells were examples of this. <br />
<br />
- Summoning a Sand Giant in Oasis with Monster Summoning will no longer cause your pet the next time you zone to be HUGE! Monster Summoned pets will no longer save their size <br />
<br />
- Pets will no longer poof when you get Call of Hero'd. <br />
<br />
- Weapon augmentations will again proc properly <br />
<br />
- The EverQuest process is now more friendly. There is also a slider bar to set your Max. FPS. in the Options window under display settings. This will free up more resources while running EQ. Also, when EQ loses focus it will use less resources. <br />
<br />
- New commands for consent: <br />
<br />
/consent group -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by all of your current group members <br />
<br />
/consent raid -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your raid (including people who join the raid later) <br />
<br />
/consent guild -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your guild <br />
<br />
/deny group -- removes the flag <br />
<br />
/deny raid -- removes the flag <br />
<br />
/deny guild -- removes the flag<br />
<br />
<br />
So basically sounds like now they decide to incorporate a EQ Play Nice type deal when EQPN is now a payed service.  Also if you look at http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemhistory.html?id=42205  I'm thinking maybe they're eliminating the need to do different themes for type 2/7/8 of 40hp augs which would take away the hassle of going from type 7 to 8.  The type 7 40hp aug is currently listed as type: 64 while the type 8 40hp aug is listed as type: 128 so not sure atm though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you list as the new displayed types for augs will probably be replaced at a later time by a more easily human-parsed display. I'mma go ahead and bet that they're displaying type 6 augs as type:32, 5 as type:16, 4 as type:8, 3 as type:4, 2 as type:2, and 1 as type:1.<br />
<br />
What you're seeing is the decimal representation of a binary string of 8. Rather than have a type denoted as a single number, it's instead handled by an array of on/off numbers, convenently expressable as a binary number. So, type 4 is now type 00010000, type 7 is now type 00000010, etc. A type 2/7/8 is now type 01000011. A type all is now type 11111111. For every combination of slots, there's a unique binary array, which we can then convert to a traditional decimal number: Type 2 is type 2, type 7 is 64, type 8 is 128, type 2/7/8 is 194, type all is type 255, etc.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to see a lot of 2/7/8s, but I do expect a lot of 2/8, 3/8, 7/8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some augs are still listed as type 7 on test though while some type 7 are listed as 64 hence why I reasoned they were the ones being changed to multiple type.  Not exactly sure how lucy updates though, think someone has to loot or link the item since it's been modified for changes to appear on lucy so maybe it's just some haven't been looted/bought yet and haven't been changed from type7 to 64 or 8 to 128 I suppose.<br />
<br />
Anyway I wouldn't be surpised if they just eliminated the need to buy seperate augs for certain things like 40hp(2,7,8)  I mean I guess they want people using all the themes but most will anyway just for the sake of maxing their LDoN aug.  Probably enough attention for a 7 to 8 converter that it got noticed.  If they're going to promote reusing augs may as well eliminate the need to earn 30% back so you can go from type 7 to 8.</div></div><hr />
