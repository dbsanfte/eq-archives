<br />
  I'm trying to get a better feel for how much worn attack I need before I no longer need to bother with offhanding / swaping primal for avatar. <br />
<br />
  As best I understand it the worn attack &quot;Softcap&quot; is 150, however also to be factored in are the poor stats and ratio of a primal offhand and the resulting DPS penalty.<br />
<br />
  As Avatar nearly always drops at the least oppertune time, and nearly always takes the maximum time to re-proc when you really need it, I'd like to avoid the whole &quot;Weapon Swapping&quot; situation altogether and just fall back on Vengence/AoB/Bravery items. (as soon as I can acumulate enough of them :p )<br />
<br />
Eventually I'd like to replace My current offhand (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29439) <br />
<br />
With this (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=22975) or something very similar<br />
<br />
Does anyone have some thoughts as to where the proper balance point lies?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically get to about 200 which is 40 Vengence and then give your Primal to the banker in Thurg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grumbam</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ... I'm still confused on this issue.<br />
<br />
As I understand it the worn attack cap is 150 so you won't ever have 200 worn attack ( that will count anyway ).<br />
<br />
I've been told that Avatar procs from primal count tword this value.<br />
<br />
I.E. 50 worn attack + Avatar Proc = Maxed worn attack<br />
<br />
.... so if you want to dump primal at only 50 attack then you need 100 worn attack from items???<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed more light on this?</div></div><hr />

And it's not a softcap, it's a hardcap.  You simply get no more increases at all for having above it.  A softcap means you'll still get increases, but it's fast diminishing returns (you can have 2000ac, but if the softcap is 1500, that 500ac has very little value as you get little improvement for it and 500hp would be inifinitely better)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes much more sense then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not sure on windblade or tsbs, just have to parse it and see.<br />
<br />
for dw, i would think its always worth it unless you are close to the cap.</div></div><hr />
