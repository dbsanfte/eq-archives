<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carnican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just read your &quot;Aggro not working&quot; thread after searching the forums for HoTT.<br />
<br />
I come here to ask a question about how to &quot;educate&quot; a guild warrrior who is often one of our MA's.<br />
<br />
The scenario is this:  <br />
-- Our guild has 5 - 7 hastened Divine Stun pallies in it.<br />
<br />
-- We have worked out a Div Stun rotation that keeps the mobs permantly locked down.<br />
<br />
-- HoTT window will not change from the first pally that lands a Div Stun, till the mob dies.<br />
<br />
-- All but one of our guild warriors have commented positively on this new strat.<br />
<br />
-- One lobbed an attack on the entire class of pallys in our guild.  Stating, &quot;***tells sawar:6, 'either i am tanking or pallies are.  pick and i am GTG&quot;<br />
<br />
-- His entire warchannel was telling him that we had 'em locked down,&quot; 'pallies stun on inc to avoid bards eatin shit, they are not pulling agro on purpose nor tanking, there stun lasts a long while giving the appearance of agro lock..when its not..chill they are just doing there job effectively'&quot; And &quot;its not a prob, its them doing there job...one stun is easy to pull agro off of and with these mobs having so few hp's debuffs have to be done rather quickly..without the pallys doing there job our debuffers would be getting slammed every 4th mob<br />
<br />
--  When the stun rotation is smooth: &quot;You tell sawar:6, 'HoTT will not change target untill the mob wakes up, ***.  We thuroughly tested this last night, stun locked mobs will stay on &quot;whatever&quot; target.'&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So, there's the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have one warrior who insists on seeing his name in the HoTT window, and can't get past the fact he HAS aggro but can't see it.<br />
<br />
Tell me, you stand in front of a mezzed mob, chain /taunting it with HoTT up, when do you become the target?  When you wake it up.  Never before.  Same thing with a mob swarmed by pallies stun-locking it.  The mob doesn't have time to to &quot;wake up&quot; to switch targets (aggro).<br />
<br />
If you were this ego driven as this fool is, how do you tell him?  How would you need to be told to accept it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just curious, if you stunlock the mob like this permanently, what exactly is the warrior tank doing? The mob can't land a single hit on him, can it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He needs to get over himself, a mob hitting no-one is better than a mob hitting him. If he refuses to believe the mob can't and won't change target while stunned/mezzed then you need a more openminded MT. The worst MTs are those that can't adapt to new circumstances/tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like if the mobs are truely locked down then all the war is, is dps anyhow.  Unless I misunderstood whats happening maybe you should just eleminate the war from tanking since it sounds like he really isn't anyhow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends on your definition of tanking. <br />
<br />
If tanking = taking all the damage, then the warrior wasn't tanking, and niether were the paladins.<br />
<br />
If tanking = preventnig anyone else from taking any damage, then the paladins were tanking.<br />
<br />
Either way, the warrior wasn't tanking. He could've gone and sat in a corner and the fight wouldn't have gone any differently. I've got no problems with that, but there's no point calling him the tank. Just let the paladins call the targets if that's what works for you.<br />
<br />
Your warrior probably believed the BS the pallies were spouting about how stuns were worthless for tankability, especially on raids, and shouldn't be considered in any balance discussions. No doubt they want defensive too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its been my experience the HOTT box only updates when the mob in question makes it next melee attack.  It does not update when the mob is mez'd, stunned or otherwise prevented from attacking, and doesn't update when the mob changes targets to cast.  Too many times I have seen a wizard or cleric mob show its maintarget was the warrior in the group, but it turns towards me, nukes, then turns back around and beats on the tank.  The HoTT window never showed anyone other than the tank, even though the nuke I was hit was definitely a single target spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If a stun fizzled and the mob got &quot;unlocked down&quot; the warr would then have a job to do.  /shrug at the end of the day its about winning...that warr should be happy if the team is winning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That warrior is the top of aggro list the instant there is a gap in a stun.<br />
<br />
The mob will turn on him the moment it &quot;can&quot;.  He is doing his job, and well, mind you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The main issue is HoTT (Health of Target's Target) leadership AA.  Combined with the fact that the mob &quot;can't &quot; change targets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have someone hack his comp, and remove HoTT from his UI. Or put him in a group without it. He's obviously too dumb to use the tool for what it is.</div></div><hr />

Mobs are different from players.  Mobs routinely cast debuffs on players who are lower on the hate list.  The HOTT accurately shows the person who is at the top of the hate list in this case, rather than the target of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, he's not nuking you he's debuffin and being generally bad natured.The tank can still have aggro and be tanking while he malos the enchanter 30 ft away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">chain stun = chain agro on the stunners and litteraly no chance in hell of getting or keeping agro in that situation.<br />

you would have to be a wizzy chain casting doj with every spell haste you could find. to even think about getting agro from something like that.</div></div><hr />

Thats pretty much what I said... mob targetting is different than players and handle casting and melee differently... grats to you /golf clap<br />

<br />
I disagree with your claim that the HOTT only changes once per melee round.  My observations refute that.  I've seen HOTT change multiple times between melee rounds before.  People can show up briefly on the HOTT without ever receiving a swing.<br />
<br />
That is unrelated to the earlier point that HOTT doesn't change while a mob is stunned/mezzed, anyway.<br />
<br />
As for DD spells: from what I've seen, if you get hit by a pure DD spell, then you had top aggro, however briefly.  The HOTT may not show your name when the spell lands, but it showed your name when the spell began to cast.  People who are lower on the hate list are only hit by spells that leave icons (or that annul icons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ladas, I have nver seen a single target dd land on someone without aggro.I could easily be wrong because I'm always ma and not in that situation of receiving said nukes...though I doubt it.Play nice heh.<br />
<br />
Your post seemed to omit the fact that mobs commonly turn to debuff other players while the tank still has aggro and drew a response.One that was polite without sarcasm btw.<br />
<br />
I agree with Sass.Her contribution here seems much more accurate than yours.</div></div><hr />

Somehow that sounds reasonable to me /shrug<br />
Personally I could care less if paladins want to do stun rotations or tank mobs, but if the pallies are chain stunning than that warrior certainly isn't tanking and I could see getting frustrated if I was assigned MT just to watch the mobs in front of me bounce around. <br />
&quot;Okay JIM, your MT today.  Druid team will be snare kiting trash mobs though, so don't be alarmed when they chain snare/nuke the mobs and run them around. You just follow behind them and make sure that if anything goes wrong you're able to take over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh and anything with a knockback effect during raids is a ton of fun.  Getting spammed with &quot;you cannot see your target&quot; messages , while the mob appears to be standing directly in front of you, only to warp and re-appear 5 feet to your left within a few seconds...oh baby...that is some good stuff....&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3</div></div><hr />

MT Role:<br />
- to tank a mob that needs to be tanked until either the mob is dead or the MT is, for which case there should be a 2nd, 3rd and so forth MT assigned<br />
- to have a MT assigned means the Healer know who to target by default because he should be getting all the beating<br />
<br />
MA Role:<br />
to give Target as to which mob to kill next<br />
for reason of people getting easily confused when the person they assist on is dead, their secondary role is to stay alive<br />
this secondary role is not in line with the MT Role which is the reason these two roles should not be bound onto the same person, unless there realy is no danger for the MT to die, but why than assign a MT at all?<br />
<br />
<br />
the 2 terms are not interchangable and are easily confused due to frequent incorrect usage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">very often our MA dies, and we assign a SA ( second assist) ,, wich sometimes dies as well<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yeah ,we do that too.I'm mt and most often ma for my guild.However,It doesn't change the fact that ma and mt are divisable roles.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. The MT is just the person who's getting hit and needs heals.  The MA is the person who dictates targets for everyone else.  In some guilds the MA is a bard, for example, but it could be anyone who has a good view of the battle and is quick &amp; reliable at choosing targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">in your guild maby ,,, in ours the MA is responible for BOTH target and tanking all of it<br />
<br />
only a warrior or a knight can do this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Again, your guild may do this, and mine usually does too, but that doesn't mean they should be the same.  I know a lot of people have trouble with this in my guild, and those people have trouble bending their brains around events like Agnarr because of it.<br />
<br />
To me, it seems like a bad assumption to assume that the beefiest warrior/knight is the best person at selecting targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">personaly i agree with you,,<br />
<br />
 but it was discussed at depth and the majority wanted it this way, so thats how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Kewl.Their was an implication that separating the roles was not done or was incorrect tho.This is the point being addressed,not what one guild has decided to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">If the MT and MA are always the same how do you do mobs like Agnarr,TT or Jiva?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">A good number of guilds (and some pretty competant ones) use very seperate MA/MT people.  Personally I like the Rogue MA (sometimes that person's only role in an encounter or even a clearing) but that's a bit of bias showing.  Then again, I like a Rogue GL/RL that does nothing at all other than coordinate.<br />
<br />
MT is a role that is best served by different classes at differnent times. Very often that's a Knight for clearings and a Warrior for targets.  Frankly, if that pisses off the Warrior, then he or she needs to think more about the raid and less about his personal glory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Garim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The guy is an idiot.  Any warrior that has been tanking with people with HoTT should have come to the conclusion that the mob isnt doing anything.   Now if the paladins miss a stun the mob definatly will go after the paladin no matter what the warrior does in that situation. But the warrior should be able to grab it back with a successful taunt.  If I was this warrior i would sit and wait till I saw the mob swing at a pally, then taunt it off.   It would at least relieve the boredom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I was under the impression the MT and MA were one in the same. For those that believe they are two completely different roles then are you saying that  (For example) Monk/Bard is MA and and War/Pal/SK is MT.  Monk/Bard pulls the target and all assist the Monk/bard? That dont sound right. The way I see it is there is a &quot;Puller&quot; and a &quot;MA/MT&quot;.  MA/MT assists off the puller to aquire the incoming mob. Then MT peels mob off puller (Incite/Taunt/Whatever) and commences tanking.  All others assist the Tank<br />
<br />
Main Assist&quot;  meaning,  that is the one the group will &quot;assist&quot; off of during the fight. Main Tank meaning that is the one that will &quot;tank&quot; the mob during the fight. Unless your split tanking, I see no reason for one to tank some of the time and another to tank some of the time unless they just want to swap off from time to time. Either you have a MT or you dont. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Always have a different MA than your MT. Get used to it or youll hurt bad in some events. We usually used a rogue to MA, because all rogues do is DPS so you'd want the rest of the DPS assisting him cuz they'll generally have the same target. For the most part, it's important to pick someone competent at changing argets. I've MA'd before, when I wasn't tanking anything. That way the MA can switch targets before it dies, if you were tanking youre kinda stuck on it until it dies, which slows down the rest of the dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">ok i guess there are three roles here <br />
<br />
, the way we do it in our guild is  MA is   the person whom selects the content target and tanks said  content target, every one else in guild trys to keep the aggro of content mob on this person<br />
<br />
our definition of MT is the person who will/is tank BOSS mobs/nameds<br />
<br />
now it apears some guilds use rouges or some outher lesser class to select targets.<br />
 so that would be<br />
<br />
MA --- target selector<br />
<br />
MT--- Boss tanker<br />
<br />
CT -- content tank<br />

now in this format if CT is defined as one individual or is ffa was not said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">MA = Main Assist - the person everybody else in the group/raid assists for a target.<br />
MT = Main Tank - the person who is first in line to be expected to keep the attention of the group's/raid's primary target.<br />
<br />
In most non-raid situations, the MA/MT is one in the same.  Silly to have it any other way really.  With the advent of the Luclin expansion, many encounters were added that sometimes require the MT to keep the primary target busy while the rest of the raid focuses on dispensing with adds/secondary targets that are initially part of OR spawn during the encounter.  During these types of encounters, you will typically have other tank types keeping these secondary targets occupied while someone else in the raid, the MA, is dictating which target the raid should currently be focussed on.<br />
<br />
This type of approach is also very useful when doing multi-tank clearing with mobs that can potentially gate (Vex Thal is a prime example of this).  E.g. Puller brings in a pile of mobs; warriors, sks and paladins each grab one keeping them busy while the MA (usually someone who can get a good view of things going on around him/her - int casters work good) monitors health of any gaters and calls the targets accordingly.<br />
<br />
The basic point I'm trying to make is that while the MT/MA are a lot of the time the same person, they are essentially VERY different duties.  Depending on what content you experience in the game, it may become necessary to split these duties among multiple people in order to preserve order and ensure the success of many raid encounters in the higher end game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Consistency of who everyone is assisting is also far, far, far more important than the consistency of who's doing the actual tanking. Remember, it's not entirely uncommon for the Main Tank to be rendered unable to tank, by death or other effect, at which point someone still needs to be able to direct the raid. <br />
<br />
As another example, in ToV, there is a mob type that lands a very difficult to cure AE slow, and another mob type which procs a very hefty manadrain. Warriors at this stage of progression will most likely be unable to hold aggro while slowed, while a knight cannot hold aggro for long with 0 mana. Thus, it was very common for our tank to change every 3-4 mobs, but everyone just kept assisting the assigned MA - There was no confusion sown amoung the raid by these switches.</div></div><hr />

If that wasn't considered as an exploit, why not ?<br />
Then by extension, an amazing number of mobs are rootable. Why risk anything if you can root and use archery to kill incoming mobs? It actually works quite nicely on a lot of GoD trash. Insted of having Paladins show off their l33t skills have 6 Warriors and 4 Rangers do in the mobs before they ever reach camp - much safer.<br />
<br />
Yes, SoE hasn't labeled stun locking mobs an exploit. That's the only thing that distinguishes it from Fearing a mob into a wall.<br />

Show of hands - who's in favor of letting SK's Fear up to level 70 mobs into walls so raids can dispatch them without risk?<br />

while you have valid points ,  im just stating the way our guild handles this issue.<br />
<br />
when the MA dies we have a role known as SA<br />
<br />
or second assist<br />
<br />
basicly the SA hops in when MA falls ,, we rez in MA rebuff and when MA is ready to resume dutie they anounce and we go from there.<br />
<br />
this is the way WE do it <br />
<br />
not telling you this is how YOU should do it<br />
 <br />
<br />
no system is perfect, <br />
find what works for you<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ps ,, i agree stun lock is sploit ,, unless warriors could lock aggro like that :P then it would be balanced</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Atilette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Then by extension, an amazing number of mobs are rootable. Why risk anything if you can root and use archery to kill incoming mobs? It actually works quite nicely on a lot of GoD trash. Insted of having Paladins show off their l33t skills have 6 Warriors and 4 Rangers do in the mobs before they ever reach camp - much safer.<br />
<br />
<br />
sure, if you like to loose time (don't forget rangers don't do double damage with archery on rooted mobs). It's much safer but it's much slower too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Rheven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Hi. <br />
<br />
I had sort of a related problem recently. I was on my first large raid, only 36 people but large to me. We used a MT of course, 65 paladin girl. She wasn't in my group and my problem was finding her in the fighting crowd and spells going off and all. I generally stayed right by her as best I could. I would target her then hit my assist key. Early when we were fighting our way to the prime target of the night it was hard to keep up sometimes. <br />
<br />
Is there a better way in raids to stay targeted corrected so I can assist the MA or MT as quickly as possible. Maybe some of you have dealt with this problem before.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

If you find yourself assisting the same person on most raids, it's super handy to throw that into a custom hot button so you don't have to type it out everytime you want to get the target.  I persoanlly find that the MA changes a lot of the time and its more of a pain to change the hotbutton all the time than it is to actually type that out.  I almost always use an assist hot key when doing LDoNs  to get the pullers first target.<br />
<br />
As an aside, also take a look at the cycle target and target nearest functions in the Options dialog if you havn't already.  Really handy to have those bound to a convenient location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I was under the impression that divine stun was very little aggro, which means that even if a paladin fizzles a stun the warrior might still have more aggro than any of the pallys doing the stunning.<br />
Anyhow, as far as i know this is how many guilds do certain stuff in god and it seems like a good strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I see nothing wrong with pallys chain stunning the mobs.<br />
<br />
As a guild warrior, if RL wanted me to MT while Pallies did there stunning, I would have no problem.  <br />
<br />
If I couldn't keep agro when stun droped .. which doesn't seem to be the problem .. then I might be concerned that one of the pallys should be the MT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">MA-(Main Assist) is synonymous with MT-(Main Tank) in the country I live in. <br />
The 2 terms are interchangeable.<br />
The only time I recognize a distinction is in a script where the boss requires the MT to stay on it while the MA leads the attack on adds.<br />
Of course there are those people that are extremely anal...<br />
Actually our guild usually has 5 or 6 tanks going on mobs when we can swing it.   Its actually become our preferred method of trash clearing.  We've done one full rotation of VT (on Xev thats how it works) and are in for wing bosses once a week.  I would guess we've mezzed under 10 mobs that entire time.  Mezzing is just too slow.  <br />
<br />
In cases like this, the MA is usually a necro or some caster calling the mobs.  Bunch everything tight and let the red rain flow... For this HoTT combined with the cycle mob key is a HUGE convenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Equirs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">If the MT and MA are always the same how do you do mobs like Agnarr,TT or Jiva?  Half the raid is going to be running around with no idea who to atk.  In my exp peeps MUST have someone to assist and if the mt(ma) is on the main mob how do they target the adds?<br />
<br />
Rodney<br />
 Actually our guild pretty much use MT/MA as  one role. Only the guy doing the tank rota on that day usually calls it out like this.<br />
<br />
&lt;RANDOM TANK 1&gt; IS MA on MAIN TARGET<br />
<br />
&lt;RANDOM TANK 2&gt; IS MA on ADDS.  <br />
<br />
Its simple enough, really. Though some people never really bothered to change. If it gets excessive enough, our raidleader goes. ANYONE WHO IS ASSISTING THE WRONG MA GETS DEDUCTED OF 1 MILLION DKP.</div></div><hr />
