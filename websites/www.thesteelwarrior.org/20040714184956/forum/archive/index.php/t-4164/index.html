<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Togr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The new target indicator is a godsend against the birds in PoAir and PoFire, check this SS (http://members.cox.net/blueflamme/hitbox.jpg) out and look at the displacement between the twin's graphic and the target indicator, this'll really help those out those who have folks who just can't seem to find the hitbox on these birds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always hated those bird models and watching the feet were just never worked for me.  I guess I'd better patch the target window into Sars 4 and give this a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That screenshot is hilarious!<br />
<br />
But I had noticed that the target circle does make it easier to find the hitbox on flying mobs.  Also it kinda seems like the target circle defines the mobs melee range...anybody checked that?  Now we can all just slay the giant lifesaver and not worry about where the actual mob is :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is also really handy on the dust ring in plane of Earth when the Trims go underground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also helps following someone thats invisible if you dont have see invisible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Target Indicator seems to be a massive DPS increase in Plane of Water  as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the &quot;blazzax kind&quot; of fiend models is about the same like the birds. The model does a great jump ahead but the mob ( and his hitbox) don't move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I checked last night, the circle doesnt indicate the mobs melee range or its hit box. I was well outside the circle and was able to hit and be hit by the mob I was on. As far as I can tell, the circle only is only defined by the size of the mob, take a look at it on a gnome, its small, take a look on a barb, its larger. I do think that the circle is one of the best things to happen in a while to melee, can always tell where a mob is at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it doesnt exactly follow melee range, but it DOES scale with melee range.<br />
<br />
in other words, compare the circle on a Air Avatar to a Fire Bird.  If you stand just outside the cirlce youll ALWAYS be just at egde of melee range.<br />
<br />
Its only buggy on PC models, but fuck PvP anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I cringe every time I have to tank a large mob with a phoenix model like in that picture. I absolutely hate those birds :(. EVERY fight I miss swings because of where I think the dumb bird is as opposed to where the game thinks it is. This will be very handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey I don't see the circle on my account, any one have pointers or do I just need to turn a setting on or patch that I havent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tinmari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You probably use a custom ui.  You need to copy the files with &quot;target&quot; in the name of them that were modified 11/3 or 11/4 into your custom ui folder.  I apologize for not having the names available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">and if I just use the default UI? = p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Off topic ... But how did you get Jopal's on the other side of the castle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">PoWater is significantly more enjoyable now with target circles, and as Crys had said, melee DPS has increased in water dramatically.   <br />
<br />
on top of that, the stupid little tiny mobs in water like the little frogs and the tiny krakens and stuff are MUCH easer to deal with as a result of them.<br />
<br />
Chalk one up for SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Off topic ... But how did you get Jopal's on the other side of the castle? <br />
<br />
There is a lavatunnel leading from Jopal village area into castle 1, there are some Jopals guarding that tunnel at the castle side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, very helpful for flying mobs. . .however there is a problem.  If you are fighting a mob on uneven ground (such as in the tunnels in plane of air), the targeting disk stays level as the ground does not, and as a result you can get a big face full of glowing lifesaver that sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Staring at the ring can make you lazy though, and get you killed. The posistion of the ring does not change when the mob turns around. In the case of the Pheonix' and demons in fire, you could be eatting ripostes and enrages before you know the mob is facing you.<br />

I learned this the hard way, nearly dieing to Hydrotha and Jax Chickenass in fire.</div></div><hr />

Trippin Effect=1, shik being a clueless n00b=0</div></div><hr />

Yeah this was great for keeping track of the Triumvirate of Soil, those guys can be a real pain if they invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I hate meleeing in PoWater, but the reticle definetively made it a lot better. Same goes for the fricking birds in PoFire and PoAir. Extremely helpful. <br />
<br />
Right now i'm looking around for customized targeting circles :)</div></div><hr />
