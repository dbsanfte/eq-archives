If you really have nothing better to do, and if you cant find a pick up group when your friends are not on... I guess any kind of xp is better than nothing hehe.<br />
<br />
I would advice you to group up with your friends or some pick ups, it would be much better xp :) Even in GD if you are in need of Coldain / CoV faction. There are dozens of other zones with better xp tho, specially dungeons (not necessarely LDoN, just dungeons) cause they have an xp bonus :) And now you have the Hot Spots, some are LoY zones, pretty good for your lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaipax</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can get a pickup group but i just dont see the point. during the week i only play 1-2 hours a day so soloing is kinda the only way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1-2 hours is enough for a LDoN :)<br />
The downtime for a warrior soloing at that lvl might be too big to be worth the hassle really, just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also try going to the &quot;hot spots&quot; for your level (per the recent patch.)  I haven't been to these lately, but I suspect this is where a lot of lower levels are going for xp nowadays.</div></div><hr />

You're also wearing RZ cultural armor but your profile says you're agnostic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaipax</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for telling me it said agnostic i didnt notice lol. but i decided not to get the bloodguard ring and am saving up my plat for a better haste belt. i have about 7kp and if i sold my old silver chitin hand wrap i could have a total of about 10kpp. i was looking at the sash of the dragonborn but its 24% and the handwraps are 22% does it make that big of a difference or are the stats on the handwraps worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, it is probably cheaper to buy your haste through tribute instead, until you get a &quot;keeper&quot; item that is 31% haste or higher.  That way you do not have to compromise on stats in any of your slots in the meantime.<br />
<br />
I have a pair of &quot;twinks&quot; on a different server from my mains.  They are totally untwinked and only have the money they have looted themselves through soloing and duoing from 1-40.  Even so, I am easily able to afford tribute for both of them.  21% haste and FT1 are dirt cheap tribute effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaipax</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont you have to have GoD for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.<br />
<br />
If you are missing expansions, it would be best if you mentioned that before you ask for gear advice. :)  Are you missing GOD?  LDON?  POP?  LOY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xaipax</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">everything exept GoD.<br />
lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another viable haste choice is the Worker's Earring of Efficiency. 5ac 55hp 21%(or so) haste ear slot, with no rec/req level... perfect for twinking, and can commonly be found for under 5k. All of the low-20's% haste items have such miniscule differences in haste that getting the one with the best stats is better than paying for something with like 3% more haste but a lot worse stats.</div></div><hr />
