<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got finished enough Mir points to buy Anger 3 and I was able to buy two of them. <br />
<br />
Wow!! I have never used EB weapons before so I cannot compare but the aggro with Anger 3 is amazing. I have augmented my CHSD in main and a Keen Edged Cleaver in offhand. I get aggro lock with these weapons, something I never thought was possible.<br />
<br />
I recommend any warrior who has any aggro issues at all to spend 23 missions in Miraguls as soon as possible. You will not regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Has anyone put Anger 3 on their 2handed epic?  Is it not even worth it?  Just asking cause I don't even know if I should bother aside from the fact that the epic to me still seems like a rite of passage hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Epic may be a right of passage and look nice, but its pretty much just a trophy nowdays. You can buy a Greatstaff of Thunder in bazaar for under 500 plat and it is better DPS and Aggro then the 2 hand epic. It may look dumb but it sure gets the job done and ya cant beat the price.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You can't polish a turd.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok planar stun does not have more agro the 500 hate from epic 2H friend and the stats on epic 2H will make a greatstaff of thunder look silly<br />

PS try augmenting epic 2H with anger III first and then decide</div></div><hr />
