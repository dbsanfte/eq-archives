<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a complete bazaar equipped warrior and have finaly saved enough plat up for another upgrade. Both of these boots tend to run between 80-120k. My question is, I know hitpoints are the number one goal but should other factors every play into that? The two main things I like about the bloodied is they are much lighter in weight and they have endurance. I would also think that since the bloodied are from HLDON's that theoritically I could pick them up cheaper since more and more of them are hitting the bazaar. I could try for the Kizrak's Boots of Battle mold but when I checked price just now the only one listed was at 160k. Allakhazam's says the average price is 75k. I dont like the Kizrak's armor (other than the gauntlets), for the most part I would rather get the best sellable gear and live with that untill I am level 65 with enough aa's to get into a raiding guild. That way when I upgrade its a REAL upgrade and I can resale the bazaar equipped items. My other option would be to live with what I have untill I am level 65, then work my way to bot and try to tank with 4200 - 4500hps unbuffed, is that even possible? Which would mean I could possibly start picking up molds from /random. Can I do bot /lfg (get a group) when I hit level 65 with no aa's?<br />

If ur weak on stamina, then id go for storm. If ur okay on stamina id take the bloodied boots as dex cha are amongst the slowest stats to max for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bloodied rites ... i've been saving myself too .. and theyre what i'll buy next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Gulug.  If you are really low on stamina, take the boots of the storm.  If you are okay on stamina, take the bloodied boots of dark rites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keep in mind, Bloodied Rites are going to lose a lot of value as they become more common.  Boots of the Storm will always have a high resale value since they have no rec lvl.<br />
<br />
So if you ever intend to upgrade and resell, if you want to capitalize on your investment, you should grab the Boots of the Storm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's an even better idea - don't buy either boots!<br />
<br />
There is another upgrade you can get that would be a MASSIVE upgrade that would serve you much better than the upgrade you would get from new boots.<br />

You will pick up an asston of AC and a bit more HP compared to what you will gain from boots. Not only that, but HoRZ will last you well in to the elems if not Time AND you will get a good price for it when you sell it then.<br />
<br />
Forget the boots, get a new hat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I totally agree with Wandor, but the HoRZ will probably be 2x the price of the boots, depending on the server economy.  On Stromm I've seen boots of the storm for 100-125, HoRZ usually shows up for 250-350k.  Big difference.  So it depends on the economy, if the price isn't a lot more, keep saving for the helm.<br />
<br />
I got lucky, someone was selling boots of the storm for 22k.  No idea why, but I was happy.   :)  Then as I was saving for the HoRZ, ornate BP prices started dropping and I picked up one for 100k, haven't seen them for less than 140k since then and usually are 150k+.<br />
<br />
I always just look for deals...  search the bazaar for slots you need upgrades in....  wait until you see a good deal and grab it.  I don't usually focus on a specific piece of gear I want, but rather look for deals that are significant upgrades for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">noticed kizrak's was listed though them boot give ft3 to most plate clases so seeing 200+ on them is almost normal. would defintly place it in horz price range.<br />
<br />
or grab these<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31299<br />
<br />
of course then you could move up to farwater bp and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Both of these boots tend to run between 80-120k. <br />
<br />
Dont bother with boots<br />
<br />
1) Get HoRZ <br />
2) Get An Elemental bow<br />
<br />
Then ....<br />
<br />
Grab a Heavy Rubicite Guirdle<br />
Grab a Sibsilian Berzerker Cloack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What price range is the Heavy Rubi Girdle? I haven't seen one for sale in a while on CT. I know that was off the topic. I know I am saving for HoRZ, then I plan on upgrading my boots. BotS are not a real big upgrade for me at the moment so I figure I better just save away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bloodied boots.  It has better AC/HP combo and plus to CHA.  STR/STA will soon (if not already) be super over maxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Reyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My bad, I forgot to update my Magelo with my new Featherwood Compound Bow! I already have the bow. As for the HoRZ it sells for 300 - 350k. My stamina is 201 and I am now level 63. The Heavy Rubi Girdle sells between 80 - 100k. <br />
<br />
I have one question now.. From all that I have read here, I formed the opinion that when it comes to haste as long as you arent grouping with a shaman or enchanter on a normal basis, that worn haste + clicky haste &gt; stats? I have a 31% haste item right now and was really hoping to get a 36% haste item. However it was suggested above that I sell my 31% haste for a 26% haste item and better stats. Would anyone else recommend this tactic? I duo with a cleric 99.9% of the time and never see any better spell haste than my gauntlets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well after looking at your Magelo, I would say go with the Bloodied Boots, your stamina looks good enough and you should be topping it out with Shaman buffs normally.<br />
<br />
Or really close to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">However it was suggested above that I sell my 31% haste for a 26% haste item and better stats.

<br />
<br />
Never ever ever downgrade your haste for better &quot;stats&quot;. And especially in your case since you are doing most of the dps if you duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I duo with a cleric 99.9% of the time and never see any better spell haste than my gauntlets. <br />
<br />
If you will rarely have ench/shaman haste, keep the best haste you can.<br />
Since you are the main source of DPS, loosing some haste hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On this note, I am also looking for Bloodied Boots. What level (hard, normal??) LDoN do they drop in and what Mob did any of you get them off of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They drop in the level 65 hard Mistmoore adventures. They can drop off any of the named.  Just be ready to watch some bard lutes rot before getting a pair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with Wandor...love the HoRZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Slight side track.... when i first went into BoT (and tanked of course), everyone kept telling me 6k hps minimum (buffed) was suggested.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't take very long to see why, lol.<br />
<br />
So if ya hit that (and not get a sad group) you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Which would mean I could possibly start picking up molds from /random. Can I do bot /lfg (get a group) when I hit level 65 with no aa's?<br />
You could probably get a pickup group in BoT at 62 w/ no AA's if you are prepared to sit there with LFG up for long enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hehe I would advice some basic AAs before hitting BoT... nothing like the unslowable (ok, bard slowable) wind boss to test em out :p<br />
<br />
If you dont wanna save up for a HoRZ, its not THAT great, but after all, it can get to the same HP or better, http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44301 put a 25hp aug and its 100hp, less AC, but you can custom it a bit with other augs, and you didnt spend 100+k or whatever it goes for? Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">LOL  Much h8 to Laef Windfall. The frist time I fought him I was 62 and didn't realize he wasn't slowable. Thank gawd for druid backup heals :P<br />
