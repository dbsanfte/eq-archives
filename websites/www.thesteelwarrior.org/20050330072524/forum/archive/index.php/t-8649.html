<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gloves and Belt from p2 are usually pretty good upgrades for people new to time... unless they have Raex Gaunt's.  Anyways, this is a very good list... would be cool to get it cleaned up a little and some links (I can work on this when I get home from movie tonight :)). Also, would it be worth it to do PoTime by slot as well so people can see their options for specific slots? I will do this as well if people think it'd be useful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd really like to see an EP shopping list too, if somebody feels so inclined :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
EP's is very simple: <br />
<br />
- all molds<br />
- puresteel mantle from air<br />
- bracers of earthen energy from mudwalker ring<br />
- possibly clawed earthcrafters hoop and/or moss encrusted band<br />
<br />
Anything else is junk really as even p 2 items are better.</div></div><hr />
