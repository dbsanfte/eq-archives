<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And, while the subject is heading off into its own tangent, I thought I'd go off and explore the depths of my puny halfling brain myself!<br />
<br />
The subject is raid level Warrior weapons.<br />
<br />
I had been giving myself some time to think about this, as I often do while either taking a shower, or running my nightly 4-mile course.  With the advent of OoW and the introduction of the new Epic 1.5's, the entire weaponry progression of PoTime/Ikkinz raider gets completely thrown off, but yet some classes still remain unchanged.  This is inevitable with expansions that old weaponry becomes outclassed.  We saw this in the BoT towers in conjunction with Ssra Temple, and we saw this some Ikkinz weapons, though not all, when compared up against their PoTime counterparts.  However, a new trend has arisen, and I think it's offset the balance, not necessarily in some classes being overpowered, but simple game mechanics not being taken into consideration.<br />
<br />
Fact is, all PoTime+ content is essentially balanced based on the Warrior having a Darkblade.  That is fine, as when the droprate of the Darkblade is put side-by-side to the percentage droprate of, say, some other class weapons out of PoTime, it's balanced.<br />
<br />
Introduce the epic 1.5 quests.<br />
<br />
For most classes, the epic 1.5 represents an item that's basically equivalent to about a Tier5/6 PoTime item, and yet you can achieve the new epics for less than a 100th of the work that it takes to get a guild to PoTime.  No biggy, expansion mudflation is inevitable, and things like this are to be expected.  But here comes that mechanics flaw I was talking about.  If the majority of the guild isn't even bothering with most of the Time weapons, and are simply skipping straight to the Epic 1.5's (such as my own), what does that leave the position of the Warrior class?<br />
<br />
It's not that I believe this is an extremely critical issue, but it does tie into the fact that the Darkblade is an amazingly powerful weapon (We have 1 so far), and all content beyond the Plane of Time is essentially balanced based on the Warrior wielding one.  The problem I am seeing is this:  The Warrior 1.5 is an incredibly solid weapon for the sheer amount of work involved, but it is designed in mind to be a complementary weapon at best.  It is absolutely NO replacement for a Darkblade or even a Fleshbiter as many of the other classes epics replace the function of their PoTime weapon with ease (Exceptions to this rule:  Shamans and Enchanters for the clicky slow and Clerics simply because the Cleric 1.5 is a shield).<br />
<br />
The observations I am seeing in my guild are as follows:<br />
-Blade of War users, like myself, can still keep agro against this &quot;New Breed&quot; of dps classes, but it's obvious that the agro line is way too close for comfort.  I never had problems holding agro against a Rogue wielding an Ifir/GRMK combo with my Blade of War.  Put a Fatesealer and JoS in their hands and it's like returning to the old Warrior days of frustration.  Why not look for an agro upgrade?  Quite simply, outside of the Darkblade, it doesn't seem like there is one.<br />
-We once regarded the SEWS as a viable alternative to a Blade of War given its stingyness for dropping, but so far in my observations, a SEWS wielding Warrior stands no chance against holding agro from a primarily epic wielding raid.  The Warriors in my guild who have a SEWS are starting to refuse MA duties.  There just isn't much else to give them.  =/<br />
<br />
Basically, it boils down to this.  The Epic 1.5's are upper Time quality, and while a Rogue can happily acquire a Fatesealer and not have to worry about a JTB, a Knight can get their 1.5 and not necessarily worry about getting a Greatblade of Chaos, etc etc, the Warrior gets his epic, puts it in this bag, and says,<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, this'll be nice to use with a Darkblade.&quot;<br />
<br />

Well said.<br />
<br />
I have also noticed borderline aggro with my A3 SEWS.   Waiting on a DB feels like waiting on a BoC (and then a BoW) back in the earlier days.  Since the emphasis appears to be more on dual wield, there should be a few more options available.</div></div><hr />

Yes the epic 1,5 isnt a DBoW, but its still a really fine weapon(not looking at the effects here).<br />
Before i got my hands on the DBoW i used the augd JoS / Epic 1,5 combo. I didnt draw aggro from the DBoW users but had no problems at all with aggro when it was my turn to tank.<br />
<br />
While the DBoW is the &quot;best&quot;, there are still other options that will make you a reliable tank at raids.</div></div><hr />

I'm really curious if you don't have a dbow, why on earth you'd bag 1.5.  A BoW isn't even the same ballpark as epic1.5 + boc, much less with an eoe, jos, or any real weapon.<br />
<br />
Last i checked there's plenty of warriors up through tacvi that are tanking without dbows.  Of course having one makes it easier, but its hardly necessary, nor is the content necessarily tuned around having one.  It's not like you need a dbow before you can change from 2h to 1h.<br />
<br />
I don't get your argument at all.  At the pre-dbow level, 1.5+any aggro procing offhand &gt; any 2h you can get.  At the post-dbow level, 1.5 is a very solid offhand that is often preferred to other weaps due to its shielding.  Where's your complaint?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.  The day I finish my epic, the A3 aug is gonna come out of my BoW and it's going in the bank.  BoW is not even close to epic 1.5 as an aggro weapon or a DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While we are it:  I use a BoC primary and 1.5 Secondary.  I have anger 3 in the BoC and 2 Anger 3 augments in the 1.5.  Would I better served to get a JoS to replace the BoC?<br />
<br />
EoE is also an option, I am holding out for a Dbotw but we havent seen but one so far.  I have seen several EoE and a few JoS.<br />
<br />
I do have a VDD that I picked up for DPS,  I havent augmented it yet but it truely seems to have better agro over my Boc/1.5 combo.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts are appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

Proc aggro should be roughly equal and the DPS difference will be huge.  Normally you want to put your faster weapon mainhand, but in this case, when you have one weapon that is not even in the same ballpark as your other one, you want the good one mainhand.  I could be wrong, but I would bet that epic 1.5 and BoC are very close to equal to your vanazir for dps if you mainhand the epic.  If you can get an EoE/JoS to replace your BoC that would be worth mainhanding, but if it was me I would holdout for the darkblade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask your shamans and enchanters what they think.  The difference is massively noticable.  With the new oow aa's, there's absolutely 0 reason to use a 2h unless you're fooling around with MSC.<br />
<br />
Considering I can easily play ping-pong with the Warriors in my guild who do have the Epic + whatever combo, I don't constitute that as even a remotely significant reason to bag the BoW in favor of something else. <br />
<br />
Is this really a big surprise when the person in your guild with 1.5 (magelo 356538) has only one anger3 in the 1.5, and uses an AHB offhand (16/20, 0aggro proc) with no aug?  Not to mention he only has WA3, and only 211aa and missing the flurry aa's.  Of course an augged bow with all dps/aggro aa's is going to pingpong that.  I can pingpong that.  I'm a bard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The BOW is better than it's current popularity suggests imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well.  It's a good weapon when you get it in the elem planes, its ratio is very nice when you compared it to other weapons at that level (GMRK, Ifir), but the fact is when you're getting to the point where ratio &gt; delay (epic 1.5, eoe, jos, demerix), the BoW becomes subpar very fast.  It's not like there's this massive procratemod on the BoW, it was the dps that was doing most of the aggro, and when it becomes subpar dps, it becomes subpar aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The person I'm referring to, unfortunately, was taken off the roster due to inactivity from his real life move.  Not that it would have mattered anyways.  He stopped updating his magelo months ago.  <br />
<br />
Now Vick, the guy you're referring to, is someone I actually got on their case about telling him to update his freakin' magelo.  He responds, &quot;I wish!&quot;.  He has Epic+JoS and even has a Ring of the Brutish Beast in there as well that isn't listed on his magelo.  <br />
<br />
(Come to think of it, this doesn't help to support my point...)<br />
<br />
Now, I didn't ask the shamans/enchanters, but I did ask the wizards about agro differences in the tanks, and a competant wizard (which we have a lot of) is going to have a very good grasp on tank agro.  While maybe not as passionate about it as I am, lol, their view on the Epic/JoS combo is that it's about that of the BoW.  <br />
<br />
I cannot steal agro from the DB/EoE user we have (before I just got my new ring with +10CA).  That, to me, is a fucking agro upgrade! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well.I agree with what you are saying about ratios to a degree...<br />
My BOW still seems to give me better snap aggro on slows/debuffs. <br />
I am MT and guildleader for my guild and we are just starting into Uqua so we don't have a ton of the higher ratio weapons ,although,we do have dps folks from higher content wielding that stuff.I've reduced my tanking time the last while to better lead raids,but, my aggro with the BOW was still good.I set the tank order and watch the aggro move around when folks are using all sorts of setups.The BOW warriors are doing very well/shrug.Imo I still get better intitial aggro with my BOW than my a3 DBOTW for debuffs in groups.My wife is a shammy btw and we have duo'd mpg and she debuffs and main heals in rs when our clerics are unavailable for whatever reason.So this is an observation over extended practice albeit a subjective ,personal one.<br />
<br />
The DBOTW is a lot better aggro for a fight that lasts any amount of time tho.However,I see stuff like epic 1.5 , JOS and EOE being touted as far better aggro than the BOW.Imo those weapons are not markedly better aggro,although they are competitive.<br />
<br />
Comparing aggro on weapons can be a kinda silly buisness.Imo BOW's are still better tanking weapons than many suggest these days.New weapons with better stats are just more popular atm.See it every raid day.I would have kept my BOW until the DBOTW or a FB dropped.</div></div><hr />

This is the only part of your post that I agree with.  <br />
<br />
With proc augs and WA5, Bloodfrenzy + Anything offhand is better aggro than a BoW, and anything with better dps than that just widens the gap in my experience.  I use my BoW a lot for it's ac and dps, but if I'm having aggro problems I drag out the bloodfrenzy, and when I get my epic, I won't use the BoW at all anymore. <br />
<br />
Personally I think that the &quot;better initial aggro&quot; is nonsense.  Doing 150 dps instead of 120 for 10 seconds is not a significant amount of aggro, and you have a much better chance for an early proc dual wielding.  With a darkblade you're doing much better dps AND have better procs and a better procrate.  There's no way that you can get more &quot;initial&quot; or any other kind of aggro from a BoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well its an old argument.I don't want to split hairs over aggro thats close.Imo my BOW was better than my BF/BOC setup for MT'n frpm tactics through Time.I had WA - 5 as soon as it  came out and swapped back and forth between he 2 setups for like a minth.At that time I MT'd every mob we encountered.I talked to all the dps casters and watched results myself.Eventually I stuck with the BOW and it as worked well.We have folks who have finished most of high end GOD and are well geared and I have tanked for all sorts of these types.The BOW was getting weaker relatively ,but, weapons like epic,JOS,EOE and certainly a BF are not really aggro upgrades Imo.They are moving sideways.<br />
<br />
If you think there is no differance in snap aggro on a BOW against a BF you are wrong.My wife is a shammy and I practiced this over and over....with the BOW (after offenesive aa) I seldom ever lost aggro on very fast slows and debuffs.With the BF/BOC I often did and it depended on a lucky proc.Since I got my DBOTW I've noticed the folks who usually slow right off the top with me are actually getting more aggro than when I used my BOW/shrug.Of course the DBOTW is a better aggro weapon overall and i get aggro back right away.Usually in my next round of attacks.The exra hate on a DBOTW allows dps casters to go harder.That wasn't always the case with a BF.The differance was never consistent nor plain.<br />
<br />
In a long fight the BF had more hate potential for the dps casters ,but, in my experience the BOW worked better overall.I tanked every mob you could with it raiding up to uqua and it worked fine.Really, thats my point for new warriors looking at these weapons.As to weather you choose one of the above combos for lack of a DBOTW/FB etc it doesn't really matter.I've seen them all used to tank relatively well.I've seen BOW warriors pulse over and over or have had our healers switch targets when folks have aggro weapons equipped(for whatever reason - like our crazy bard training us with Velk and HiveQueen at a Hulcor kill...eggs everywhere gah :eek: ) and aggro is sliding onto a BOW war repeatedly.<br />
<br />
There is a noticable overall differance stepping up to a DBOTW.The other combos mentioned short of a FB/BBB are all pretty close in aggro production Imo.BOWs and other better ratio 2 handers are very good  at snap aggro too,at least with offensive aa.Just my opinion hehe.</div></div><hr />

Magelo is really out of date.  i gotta log on to see what all augs i have atm but have WA 5 ect ect ect. However JoS is currently unauged because i keep getting reject groups in LDoN. but Epic has a3 + a2 (cuz of a3 in sro not being unlocked yet). But there was another warrior in guild with JoS a3 and epic a3x2. With BoW + a3 i can pull agro off him but generally are roughly same because he'll pull it right back off me. Not really a viable upgrade except for more stats in exchange for using more aa to do duel wield stuff. ATM until i finish out my LDoN farm I will use BoW for raid and duel wield for group. Once i get it all augged up the way i want, i will experiment with what is better. Epic is probably the best offhand you can get pre tacvi or what not. But as far as primary goes, probably should hold out for Darkblade or FB or BBB If you want to replace a BoW. <br />
<br />
However if your guild raids Ikk2 alot, JoS's are probably on nearly every single dps person or what not and would be a good suppliment  for dps when not tanking. We finally got a DB to drop last week and soon hopefuly we get a few more and maybe a Fleshbiter. And we won't have to worry about this. But for the rarity of agro weapons with high enough caliber to never worry about a certain gnome wizzy dieing every raid mob at around 5%, our choices are limited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BoW is still greater DPS but that DPS does not offset the extra aggro proc. Then when you consider an extra 185HP, saves, stats, 3% shielding and the sometimes useful right click effect on 1.5 there's no competition. <br />
<br />
I probably would be better off with a BoC or BF but I have no issues on raids right now and I have my eyes set on a Velitorkin's Femur which has a stun/dd proc and my Hammer's Ykesha will go in it. It'll be a long time until I see a DBotW but I don't see that combination letting me down, ever.</div></div><hr />
