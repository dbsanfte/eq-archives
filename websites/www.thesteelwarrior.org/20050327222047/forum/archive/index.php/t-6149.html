<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...since i got my BoW we haven't had a 2nd one drop in quite some time, so we decided to take him out last night and hopefully get another. Everything seems normal, we do TZ, get set up for VZ. Real VZ decides to spawn as we were getting ready, so the VZ from RZ script despawns. <br />
Great, we gotta start over. <br />
Once again, kill triggers, kill TZ. Pullers seemed to have some trouble getting VZ, not exactly sure why. As they're trying to get VZ, the fake TZ *reapawns*!!! So i run my arse over to him and start tanking, of course i'm OOR since the clerics are all the way by VZ tanking corner, so some of them run over and superlite me as the rest are trying to figure out where the hell am i. At that point, fake VZ warps on me with 5 adds. Needless to say that was a wipe, we didn't try again that night due to the event being extremely bugged or something.</div></div><hr />

Wierd...</div></div><hr />
