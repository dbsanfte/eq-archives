<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dindarr</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was brought up the other day in the channel and was looking to see if it has been posted here. Didn't really find anything so I thought I would make my own thread.<br />
<br />
If you are always looking to increase your hp like me sturdiness looks like a reasonable offer (well its the only new offer). Each level of sturdiness gives 100hp at a cost of 4 8 12 16 20. Planar Power lets you get your STA up 5 more points each level at a cost of 2 each time. Its already been stated that 1 STA = 6hp.<br />
<br />
For some context when GoD came out I did not have PP or any AA saved up for sturdiness. So I'm trying to decide which to get first to increase my HP. Obviously sturdiness 1 and 2 are the best rewards for the cost. But then when you get to sturdiness 2 you have to think about it. 12AA for 100hp compared to... Well given the formula above 25STA would be 150hp. All that for only 10AA. It seems a better deal than sturdiness 3 right?<br />
<br />
Well I now have PP5. Its not 150hp. Before someone mentions it yes my STA is 305 without buffs. PP1 gives me about 21hp. PP2 gave me like 19hp. Then 23 and so on. It rounded out to just a little over 100hp. After 280 do you start getting less hp per sta? This I wasn't aware of.<br />
<br />
But the verdict is if you are exping slowly and want the best bang for your buck while you are doing it go for sturdiness 2 then PP5 then back to sturdiness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's true. And it sucks. It's actually after 255 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You definitely get dimishing returns the higher you go.  I'm kind of looking at it this way.  PP5 is about 100hps for 10AA, where as Sturdness 3 is 100hps for 12 AA.  So probably better bang for you AA spent with PP5 if you don't have it, but the difference is really only 2 AA which is pretty negligible.  I'd get PP then Sturdy 3 personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you also have to consider that by training up PP you also increase your dex and str up to 305 also.  This will give you a bit more procs and higher attack.  Personally I didnt have any PP or sturdiness when GoD came out.  I first trained sturdiness 1, now I am working on PP5 then I'll go back to sturdiness 2 or perhaps finish out the last levels of WA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience you get 3hp for 1sta post 280 (maybe post 255) with ND3 &amp; PE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real thing to bitch about I feel is that Sturdiness and Leadership AA's ignore ND/PE.  It's 100 hp not 112...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC it is 6 hp per stam from 0 - 255 then 3.6 per stam from 256 305.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sturdiness 2, PP5, Sturdiness 3<br />
<br />
As others mentioned PP gets you more than just hps, and you will get a boost every 2 points instead of having to save 12 to get anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are serious about tanking anything hard, you need to buy PP5 for the increase in CHA as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dindarr</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol I wish PP5 effected my CHA. 305 is more of a pipe dream now. Even buffed I don't get over 150. I vote for more CHA on Kizrak and Raex.</div></div><hr />
