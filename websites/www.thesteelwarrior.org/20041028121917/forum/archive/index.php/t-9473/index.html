<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brahmmell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since the hardcap of ac was removed and never heard of a new one implemented, I'd prefer to get AC as high as possible for my character with a nice balance of hp.  Since both help in different ways, I use the old 5hp = 1ac formula.  Using that formula, I'd personally keep the kiz bracer and dump the other.<br />
<br />
28ac / 45hp =  185 (Kizak)<br />
18ac / 65hp =  155 (Magnetic)<br />
<br />
23ac / 90hp =  205 (Flame)<br />
<br />
(Yes, I know.  These numbers don't mean anything and aren't used anywhere in eq, it's just more of a point system I use to figure out which item is best for my char.  I know some used to say the hp:ac ratio was closer to 4:1 or 6:1, I just split the difference and use the 5:1 ratio of hp:ac.)<br />
<br />
I enjoy getting as much raw hp as possible to get those nice flashy raid buffed numbers but I have to always factor in AC since it does help with my incoming damage mitigation.  Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the advice.... I just remembered that with the new sta buff from shaman i get another 40 sta to play with, so i will probably ditch the magnetic if i I do ditch anything.</div></div><hr />

Even though the Conqueror's has more HP than the loyalist shield, the huge difference in AC makes up for the moderate difference in HP IMO.</div></div><hr />
