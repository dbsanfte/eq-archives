<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easy, particularly at higher levels, with which mana is created (FT, C1-5, BL buffs), and conserved (SCM, specilzation) means that, unlike when EQ was release, mana is rarely a limiting factor in group effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself when was the last time you stopped in group becuase someone who was buffed, was OOM?<br />
<br />
This over supply of mana is having unintended consiquences. If hybrids never run out of mana, and have enough spells that the reuse timers are not a limiting issue, then there is no way for no magic using classes to get an keep agro. And if healer mana is never an issue, then the small advantages we hold in AC and HP are trivilaized.<br />
<br />
It used to be that the scaristy of mana balanced its power. But the power of mana has increased while there is no scarsity.<br />
<br />
The magic system has completely gotten away from the devs, and until they make some painful changes to magic, so that it becomes a limiting factor again, things can't really be well fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, to a certain extent this is true.  However, consider this.  If mana was more scarce than it is, would this remove the need to slow PoP mobs ASAP?  And if PoP mobs continued to need to be slowed ASAP because of their huge DPS, wouldn't there still be a need to get the mob off the slower ASAP?<br />
<br />
It seems as those you're headed down the road that says if mana was sacrcer then the Warriors might have more attraction because they would require less mana to maintain.  But it seems to me that the exact opposite would be true.  Since Warriors can't establish aggro early with reliability that means either the Warrior gets torn up big time until the slower feels confident enough to land slow or the slower takes a fair amount of damage in the process of slowing.  Either way, these are less mana efficient scenarios than just slowing on INC and knowing that the Knight will retain aggro.<br />
<br />
If in fact mana was scarcer I think people would be even less willing to use a Warrior tank as a result.<br />
<br />
Now I'll agree there are other ways the availability of mana has trivialized the melee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is not as much scarcer mana for casters.. <br />
<br />
it is for hybrids, that is the problem.<br />
<br />
Hybrids used to choose, do i wanna be a tank who can cast a few spells, or do I want to be a caster  that can take a few hits...<br />
<br />
That choice no longer is valid...<br />
<br />
Knights can tank and hold aggro because of their spells, Limit those and you will limit their tanking superiority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the one thing that the current rate of mana regen has brought us to is that it currently limits ways in which we can bring warriors back into balance.  Without limiting mana regen(and SoE has shown no indication they are considering it), increasing warrior hp/ac/mitigation/evasion will not solve our woes, as healing mana is not an actual issue generally.  I know that when I tank(and I am far far  from uber), I have had clerics that have had to nuke to keep from sitting at FM, esentially wasting some of that mana regen.  Note that this does not always happen, but as my gear and aa's are increasing, it is happening more often.  Making me more able to take a hit is not going to make me more desirable in relation to knights.  That is I think the end result of current mana regen, it took away any real advantage that our extra hp's/ac/etc gave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And yet how is limiting mana regen going to solve our woes?  If healing mana actually became an issue, which are people going to prefer?  A CH on the Warrior and a fast heal for the same mana on the slower or 2 CHs on a knight?  And is the relation really that cut and dried?  I suspect 2 CHs on the Knight probably relates more to a CH on the Warrior and 1-3 fast heals on the slower, depending on how long aggro control takes to be established.  I can't see how this would make things better for us, maybe you do.  Care to explain it to me, perhaps I'm just slow today?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been mentioned before and your assertion is close but not quite right.<br />
<br />
The reason why Knights are so strong is because Casting in general is so strong compared to Melee.  Mana pools and regens are just a symptom of this.  Just as much as some want to blame Knights for superior agro control the other half of the problem is that caster have to generate such strong effects to survive.  And as Glatius says, making them frail is what got Warriors a black mark in the first place.  Removing more mana and making them weaker won't make them choose a class that even has a hint of agro control iffy-ness.<br />
<br />
The key, and many do miss this on all sides, isn't just the fact that Knights have stellar agro control because of spells.  The key is that Knights have stellar agro control because we have so many attempts to gain agro control.<br />
<br />
During a standard exp group, I will load 3 offensive spells (two of which are probably stuns, one of which is probably a root) and 3 defensive spells (usually 3 heals).  This plus 2 aa skills (Divine Stun and Hand of Piety) and good old Lay Hands are some 9 actions where I can not only generate agro but I generate an extremely group friendly effect.  Any one of these activated can advance me on the agro list.  And then there is Taunt...<br />
<br />
So there is the problem.  The number of attempts a Knight has to regain control far outnumbers the way a Warrior has to regain control.  Is it any wonder why they are perferred in groups?  If one wants to argue that SOE needs to reduce the number of attempts a Knight can make kind of ignores the fact that Warriors don't have enough attempts in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense intended.  I really was hoping it could be explained so I would understand, because it seems like I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not sure though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, mana is borked. However I don't see how reducing mana or mana regen will help us.<br />
<br />
Knights (paladins especially)  will still be able to suplement a cleric or druid with nerfed mana and mana regen through fast heals and life taps.<br />
<br />
The disparities between warriors and knights would still remain. Knights will still get close enough to warrior's hp's and ac to make the difference insignificant. Knights will still be able to have hands down agro control.  Warriors still will still rely on the RNG for their agro.<br />
<br />
The one thing that it might fix is the all caster groups that only let pets melee. They might not be able to take down boss mobs and would have to med once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree, limiting mana regen will not help us at all.  My point was only that with the way things are now(and mana regen is not going to go down), increasing warrior's ability to take damage is not going to help, is it is not really an issue with current mana regen.  In fact, with that in mind, I think that if mana regen was lowered, knights would be even more preferred in groups, as Glatius said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the way I see it is the PoP mobs came after magic being broken. They are more a responce, or at least independent of, free mana. <br />
<br />
Heck the first big change to mana regen was the ModRod2 nerf.  And I seem to recall a SK tanking Vindi, without swinging (And I would love to know Vindy's 'burstness' and DPS in reposts) well before PoP was out. I would suggest that the problem was pre-Pop. <br />
<br />
I think that, should mana become scarcer that our tanking would increase because you could not have 100% agro lock down 100% of the time. Nor would you nececerily have casters being able to generate the insane amounts of agro quite as easily. If your Hybri actaully does go OOM, then you an work on issuse like agro transfer after the initial slow, or what have you. <br />
<br />
If you have a way to instantly grab agro, but is too expensive to maintain it like that, using a warrior to take over that duty once the slows are in actually makes sence.<br />
<br />
Not that I am proposing any changes, as mana generation, for the ubers was broken 2 years ago--and I don't think that you can get this genie back in the bottle without significant harm to the playerbase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least for Paladins, aggro is extremely mana efficient.  FoA is only a mere 65 mana.  Even if mana comes at a premium, they'll still be able to toss that out more frequently and longer than a cleric can CH.  And if the healer is having to call for constant mana breaks because mana is so scarce, this will only help the hybrid unless the costs of gaining aggro are significantly increased.<br />
<br />
We cost more mana currently because of our inability to hold the mob's attention.  So even if SoE was willing to look at it from that angle, and I agree that's unlikely, it wouldn't help us simply because right now Knights are the more mana efficient tanking choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clinging Darkness for SKs is at least as much aggro as EB (it's a snare and a DoT), and costs 20 mana to cast.<br />
<br />
Before anyone cared about hybred aggro, it worked just fine to get and hold aggro. It still does, and I find it hard to believe that mana regen will be throttled to the point where a typical SK can't regen 20 mana a fight. If it does get to that point, you've pretty much crippled every casting class.<br />
<br />
For reference - the solstice earring is FT 1 and FT 1 will regen 20 mana in 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
The real problem is that everything has to be slowed right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since we can't nerf our bothers in arms back to the stone age--I guess we warriros need an agro lock or near agro lock ourselves. <br />
<br />
Or Verant goes back to an origianl view of warriors, as masters of armed combat, and buffs our DPS and starts easing us out of the MT role. (Er...in their minds, actual game play I think we have been on the road to roll loose for 2 years.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, from reading some of the posts about how good warrior DPS is in the high end game(I'm not there yet, so my DPS still sucks)  :) , it seems that they are already starting to buff our DPS and ease us out of the MT role.  There's lots of stuff out there that pally's can tank in raids, and unless there's a huge level difference, the choice of who's tanking (aside from mobs that require defensive to tank) in many cases boils down to either which tank has the most ac/hp or whether or not the mob being tanked requires aggro lock.  ('cause sometimes even in a raid it's easier to let the pally tank and lock aggro from the outset)  That having been said, the only viable choices are boosting our aggro significantly, or &quot;nerfing them back to the stone age&quot; and drastically increasing the mana cost of their stun spells.  Or a third alternative is just to increase our AC/HP  and/or DPS to the point that we can effectively solo for xps and let knights have the tank spot they've been contesting with us for so long. (which of course would trivialize some raid encounters)   Sometimes I wish they'd just give all the paladins and sk's all of our melee skills and disciplines and give us either the pally spell line or the sk spell line.  Then rather than having paladin's, sk's and warriors, you'd just have warrior/cleric's and warrior/necro's, and not have to worry about balancing us any more.  Of course then each of the warrior classes would complain about some feature of the other that they thought made the other more attractive/better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what happened is this..<br />
<br />
People got very very very very bored of the 30+ minute SoL boss mob encounters.<br />
<br />
SoE thought of a way to change the mob design to make encounters challenging, yet lower time limits.<br />
<br />
So, they Boosted DPS and lowered HPs.<br />
<br />
Well this became fine and dandy, except now slowing is a requirement.<br />
<br />
then they found slow/heal aggro was way out whack, and  healers/slowers became paste of the ground.<br />
<br />
then aggro became vital to hold and maintain.<br />
<br />
which is fine, aggro management is a great skill..<br />
<br />
except the xp rate is so INSANE people dont want to slow down.<br />
<br />
so getting instant aggro become #1 priority, and holding that aggro thru slow/debuff/nuke #2...<br />
<br />
this left warriors out in the cold, we can do neither with reliability, and 100% success is what knights can give.</div></div><hr />
