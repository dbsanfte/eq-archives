OK in addition to Gems we should have a cross server card game like Yu Gi Oh or Magic whatever.  you can challenge people cross server during down time or while looking for groups.<br />
<br />
now to get the cards there will be a new button/option called Autograph. you highlight the person you want to give an autograph to and you click the button. a card with str/weakness bassed on your curent equipment, level, skill will be given to the player you had targeted. so the stength of your card will vary based on buffs, dots etc.<br />
<br />
now you can only have a limited numbe of cards in your deck, lets say 100.<br />
<br />
cards are saved to each account and not per player, so you could log onto another server and ask someone from there for an autograph that will be saved to your deck.<br />
<br />
cool huh?<br />
<br />
ooh, and maybe you could also get cards each time you make the kill on a mob. so lets say you get the moneyshot on quarm, you would get the quarm card. etc etc</div></div><hr />
