So I went ahead and spent 5 aa's on rampage and now I'm looking for someplace I could use this. I'm on a pvp server, so I don't think I'm going to be able to find any other warriors to try this out with.  Also I'm lvl 70, so don't think any of the luclin zones I've heard about using this on will give exp -- maybe I'm wrong. Anyone have any idea's where I could play with this at and get exp? Also i searched all over for the original thread about shakerpaging fire but can't find it anywhere -- would appreciate a link to it. Thanks</div></div><hr />

i'm goign to slide this over to the proper forum; unless you're goign to shakerpage a cart full of kegs :D</div></div><hr />

Some are more plentiful then others. I know VT will have darks but that isn't shaker friendly afaik. SSeru and Katta will probably have blues as well. UP would probably be your best bet though.</div></div><hr />

unless you meant you couldn't find another warrior or group with another warrior because you are at war with them, etc.<br />

i dont like rampaging outside of PoP though cuz i'd rather not run back when dead. (my comp freezes up when i do it now, it used to not freeze :( ) disease/innovation can be done solo warrior + slower. fire ent can be done with 2 warriors +slower.<br />
<br />
also earthshaker is fun to zone into another guild's raid when they all standing at poe ent and rampage them haha. the more cramped together they are, the higher chance to kill someone who is low health for some reason.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, my only point on the pvp aspect was that no other war's in my guild have the earthshaker, and any other guilds war's would be KoS. PoD/PoI sound great, I tried UP tonight with a bard friend of mine.... died both times, mobs got down to about 50% on the second try. The bard spent a long time trying to get enough mobs, so I'm wondering how easy that would be in PoI. Anyway, I'm going for it again as soon as I can get someone with the balls to pull for me, but thinking I might need WA 5 atm ... I have WA 2. Only reason I thought I could get by without it is iirc the original shakerpage thread was started before WA aa even existed.</div></div><hr />
