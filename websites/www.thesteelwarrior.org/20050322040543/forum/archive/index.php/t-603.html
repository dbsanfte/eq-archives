<br />
The named spawn in the room with the portal that leads up to the emp/blood room... this is all the way up the tube behind the locked door in the assassin camp room then behind another set of locked doors... the PH mobs are imperial guardians... im pretty sure a named can spawn anywhere an imperial guardian can spawn...<br />
<br />
the general is not slowable for sure... he rampages and hits for i think 500ish... has a TON of hps... <br />
<br />
one of the other 2 grav fluxes i forgot which but might want to avoid that one if your doing them with low numbers.... <br />

But good lord, with one group ?<br />
Not that its not doable, but the fight will last an eternity even against the placeholders.<br />
For some sick reasons the imperial guards are all dark blue at 65 while the named are light blue though.<br />
I wouldnt bother with less than 3 groups, so that you can clean out the room at a reasonable speed.<br />
There are like 20 spawns and chances are that you wont be able more than half before you have repops (even with 3 groups).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i honestly dont know how cleric mana would last with 1 group on the named. they got more hp than vindicator and general hits for decent chunk of HP. its not hard by any means, but i wouldnt go without 3 groups. luckily the named are fairly common, best to make a raid day out of so u can clear the whole area. there can never be more than 3 of them up at one time so if u clear fast enough and keep it kill dead, next pop could always be a named.<br />
<br />
best if everyone has floaty for advisor, can make some really nasty trains if you are not careful, u can bash him out of his gflux cast though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Named can pop anywhere in the room.  The best thing to do is pull to a corner - if you can bring a cleric &amp; camp it out would be good too if you are doing it with 1 group cause odds are you are gonna die somewhere along the line...<br />
<br />
Like someone mentioned, advisor gfluxes, but if everyone has lev/dmf its not too bad - if you are disciplined enough to keep him facing the corner while you fight him.  Arbitor has like 1 beelion hps, I could imagine this being a 20 minute fight for 1 group.  General has quite a few hps too &amp; rampages as was mentioned.<br />
<br />
Named always drop insignias.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mightyberge</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks, that info helps  everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kriegartorv</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i did the 2 non grav flux mobs with 1 group 3 people each play 2... it takes a long long time even with 2 wizards with max ft and a lot of aa's...<br />
<br />
we just killed the 2 guards after the up tube... went to through the locked doors... hugged the wall around to where the named were spawned, pulled the named against the wall and killed them there... no need to clear i they are already up...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are 3 types of nameds<br />
1. reg mele mob<br />
2 general - rampage - procs HT on hitfor about 700<br />
3.  advisor (I think) - gflux think its unresistable at least dont remember ever resisting it even thought mob is light blue.I think does 900 dmg? and pretty big range. get levi<br />
<br />
so no resists all hit about 400 and have specials listed above. To give rough idea of hp. If you have done taskmasters they have about that hp times 4(actually pretty simmilar to TMs). Pretty easy mobs actually but as with all luclin mobs too many friggin hp. Any of imperial guards can pop nameds. Bring as many ppl as possible.<br />
<br />
30 ppl raid with average lvl 64 in allright gear takes about 3-4 min to clear nameds general twice that.</div></div><hr />

Just make all your melee aware of it, and then  have them time their bashes/kicks.  Works wonders.</div></div><hr />
