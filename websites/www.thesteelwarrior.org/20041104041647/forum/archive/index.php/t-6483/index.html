<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello.<br />
<br />
I am in a very small guild and we dont raid much, infact its close to never. I am one of the driving forces to start raiding more, but I have never been in a rading guild so dont really know what the targets are.<br />
<br />
I hear many people speaking that &quot;our guild has passes VT&quot; or that &quot;we are going to become a pop guild soon&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was hoping that someone could help this poor soul and explain the normal &quot;chain&quot; when working towards becoming a great guild, whats zones you start with and what to move to when you can manage that. I hear alot about Kael but is there anything before that?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it mainly depends on the average you can gather together for the raids.<br />
<br />
our guild started the &quot;real&quot; raids in kael farming the arena. that's also a good way to teach your tanks how to off tank properly and keep their eyes wide open during a raid ^^<br />
<br />
if lower level, say 45-52, you can still rush nagafen and lady vox<br />
<br />
between 46 and 60 enjoy the old planes (fear, hate and sky), and give some shoots in growth and mischief.<br />
<br />
but the real question is : what is your raid force ? how many ppl ? what level ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plane of Sky is THE worst zone in Everquest.  Under no circumstances attempt a raid to this god-forsaken, boring, time-sink of a zone until epic requirements force you to.</div></div><hr />

After Emperor comes VT and/or PoP.  Some of the early PoP fights would be more Tier 6ish but once you get past the first round of PoP mobs I'd say you are Tier 8+.<br />
<br />
That isn't what I'd suggest, btw.  It is just a breakdown of encounter dificulty levels and maybe some ideas.<br />
<br />
I'd go Kael arena and if that is too easy move to Temple of Veeshan: Halls of Testing (the +CoV faction armor - you should have the faction after Kael) when you have people in HoT or better armor consider moving into North wing of Temple of Veeshan.  NToV is great training for most of what comes later although the upgrades aren't what they used to be.  You can skip it but... what could be more fun then killing dragons???  <br />
<br />
The 3-4 group PoP encounters might be really good too once you have at least HoT level armor.  Mujaki is lots of fun and has some nice drops.  Might want to take 2-3 groups to Barindu and do named.  They can drop spells which will make your casters happy and have some nice loot as well.  If you can handle Barindu, move into Ferubi but definately don't single group here - take a 3+ group raid the first few times.  It is single groupable for raid guild people but not for people who aren't in at least VT level gear.  LoY also has some raids that might be fun to try and shouldn't be too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The places where my guild first learned about raiding in 1999, with 2-3 groups or so, were:<br />
<br />
1) Phinigel in Kedge<br />
2) Fire Giants in SolB<br />
<br />
These days, you could probably get a good first raid experience in a place like Tower of Frozen Shadow or Grieg's End.  You didn't list your levels, but if those are too easy, then maybe Veksar, Hole, or Acrylia Caverns would be good choices.  Once you are ready for a place like Kael, then you can also try Dragon Necropolis and SolC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anywhere in ToV is a great place to learn to raid. You learn so much here, like for instance bring a wizzy or some gate potions =P<br />
But the wide variety of mobs here really help a raid force learn to raid, nothing hit's really hard but you learn to deal with mobs that AE, dispell, flurry, rampage, gate &lt;then summon your entire raid force and eat them one by one&gt;<br />
<br />
My first real guild raids were in ToV and I learned a lot very quickly there and have plenty of fond memories. Also plenty of bad ones, CR's can suck pretty hard there if you don't have an Sos rogue. But the first time I zoned in there and saw those two huge red dragons at the entrance of HoT, that's a sight I'll never forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>macarser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The usual progression that I have seen are these:<br />
<br />
Velius<br />
NToV<br />
Sleepers<br />
SSRA (where we are currently)<br />
Vex Thal (where we should be within a month or so)<br />
PoP<br />
<br />
Each one gears your guild up with loot to face the next one pretty good...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">POP overlaps the other expansions a lot.  As soon as you can handle raiding ST (which I think is easier than raiding NTOV), then you can find appropriate raid targets in POP too, and also in Luclin for that matter.</div></div><hr />

I joined this guild right before they hit SSRA so the steps before it are from what I was told they went through, as opposed to experiencing myself.  I have never seen NToV although I hope I can convince a few of them to go back so I can at least see the zones; I love seeing new places!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">North ToV is lots of fun, I think everyone should experience at least once. Dragons are my favorite part of the game, they seem to pull you back into the fantasy world setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd raid<br />
Velektor - lord bob cause he is always up/velek the sorcer<br />
Work on epics<br />
Royals in charadok<br />
Trakanon - up alot<br />
Cazic Thule rings/gnome runs<br />
Maze in PoN<br />
PoS flag mobs<br />
ToV - armor pharms west wing or hot<br />
ToV - west wing nameds<br />
Tactics - nameds not gods<br />
<br />
thats all good starters and for a family type guild all are a blast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Soulenticer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Think if you're looking to waste time till your guild reaches raiding status I have a few suggestions. Get some bane weapons, seru/shissar (the deep ancient shrooms/mines named). Make seru your bitch. Emp, archlich, xtc/hp keys. VT shards. Farm BoT keys, take 9 non keyed at a time + needed classes, also use charmed pets. Get PoJ trials done (use High Guardian of Justice CoD pet sitting outside trial area if you have trouble doing it normally). Farm ornate in PoTac, do quest to get access, also keep in mind the minis. Also in tactics the zek brothers are nice loot, use at least 4 pets on the arrow one cause he's a bitch if you are only 20ish. Farm BoT towers, make massive use of CoD pets. Sleepers Tomb keys cause primals will never go out of style. <br />
<br />
I really wouldn't worry about flagging untill you think you can take out the big guys that will get you EP access.<br />
A small guild should learn to love charmed pets, more importantly should learn to control them (have another cast an agro spell then sit and ping pong the mob).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Soulenticer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh yeah, rhag 1 is an important target. Your guild needs RGC to progress. Rhag 3 is another target worth while for RGC's but it's much harder. If you find rhag 3 is too hard try having breaks in the fight to regen mana. These breaks can be accomplished by getting everyone move out of melee range. The MT will be the only one recieving damage and he will be running away and getting summoned. Prolly should cast shrew on him or better yet tl him outside and get SoE on him then CoH him back in. I also suggest practicing the technique on rhag 1 just to get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nukg Trollbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you guild has no experience in raiding, I would recomend places like:<br />
<br />
Splitpaw (won't get good loot, but will teach basics)<br />
Dalnir's (Good end boss challenge for beginers)<br />
Droga (Good drops)<br />
Nurga (Good Drops)<br />
Kael (Faction working for..)<br />
ToV-Halls of Testing<br />
either North ToV, or Veeshan's Peak<br />
Growth (Just remember the PoG's spawn every 15 minutes<br />
Hate<br />
Seb<br />
<br />
<br />
not really in order.<br />
<br />

From reading above, Sony regards Inny easier then Tunare?<br />
Inny from the hate revamp is a genocidal maniac<br />
Tunare is a push-over, Ail can be a pain<br />

<br />
Good point - I did post Pre PoP but this was definately the pre-revamp Inny.  The new PoHate I'd guess to be more tier 6ish for maestro and 8+ for Inny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Inny can be a simple in/out in near an hour, or maybe two if you are unlucky.  POG will never be less than five hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ggak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Have read all posts and some are using notations I have absolutly no idea what they mean. <br />
<br />
Anyway, guild is made up of about 6-8 lvl 65's, about 10 or so around lvl 60-64 and then another 10 (or maybee´15) lvl 50-60. The few times we have been raiding we have been to Kael, but we have never taken Vindi (not tried). I know guild has done some trips to Halls of Testing but dont know what they have taken out. The problem is though that we are never more then 3 groups. OK never is a strong word, we have been 20-24 people at one or two times, but that have been with friends and pickups at zones. Usually we end up around 15-17 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Soulenticer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Find another guild that is simular to yours, one that has the classes you lack and requires classes you have. Try out a joint raid. This is if you really wanna raid something interesting. Other wise I have to suggest farming 1 group stuff and sharing within the guild. But before you do that you have to get a crowd control system, or you'll die from stupidty. Give PoN a try, there is that big horse guy and along the way a lot of semi difficult mobs (if they are not handled right). Kael is way too easy, there is no risk at all unless you pull like 5 PoZs. When I say cc I don't just mean mezzers, I mean offtanks as well. Oh and have a bard increase your mr for the horsie otherwise your brave warrior will be running the other direction. The loot sucks but it will get you started on crowd control, crawling, and complete heal chains. DO THIS ONCE OR TWICE, not 500 times cause it sucks and you are just wasting time.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, your guild doesn't sound like a raiding guild. They seem more like a chat channel. Are you sure they are even interested in raiding? If they are just a chat server and have no real interest in doing anything together they will prolly never become a raiding guild. There is a place for chat channels and there is a place for having fun together. Try out IRC, you wont have to pay for an eq account on a montly basis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bleh ! i must disagree here :p<br />
seems like our guild is ranked betsween 6th or 7th guild on our server (entering ST, the ones above us are elemental guilds :p) but we still have the same policy : recruit whoever please us, not looking at levels, class and aas. just the pas weeks we recruited 3 or 4 peeps around level 35 :D<br />
<br />
we are not an hardcore guild (3 raids a week, trying to go &quot;old skool&quot; following the extensions) of course, but we are a &quot;semi raiding/familly guild&quot; that works out pretty well :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Teldarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tawro and Radir in Umbral planes.  Great encounter for unexperienced raid of 2 groups or so.  They drop nice loot and raiding them teaches some of the basic raiding skills.<br />
<br />
My guild start farming them about a year ago and we have now just killed Emperor and are keying up for VT.  We just kept trying harder and harder encounters, slowly climbing our way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shabba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I also think Radir and Tawro are good targets for young and/or new guilds.  They have weapons that will probably be upgrades for many of your members.  The horse in Umbral (forget name) might be a good target to pull the zone in and kill for some FT gear.<br />
<br />
Once you have progressed beyond this I have to agree anything in ToV is a great lesson learned.  Even HoT can teach you so many things.  NToV takes those same lessons to a different level and punishes you a bit more if you don't take care of business.  Encourage your members to become masters of their craft (learn your class) and read constantly about things.  This should get them excited about the future and help them become better players.  Don't be afraid to just try something and learn by failing either.  Sometimes victory after failure is greater than never losing.  IMO if you never lose your not fighting hard enough mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Haha, yeah definately agree to the wiping thing.  I've you're owning everything in sight, try something harder.  Some encounters aren't meant/needed to be farmed for months on end in order to move on.  And by learning, I'm assuming Shabba isn't talking about just bringing more people.  Figure out what went &quot;wrong&quot; (if anything), work out the kinks.  Also find out what you could do better.  Was the right person on rampage.  Were there people that could've been healing, etc etc.  Just this week, we wiped to IV in Akheva with less than 2 groups.  Trivial mob, but still tough as far as strats go.  The first time that night, we got him to 60% before the *only* priest (cleric) on the raid was nearly oom.  Had everyone back out, mem blurred (&lt;3 enhanced forgetfulness), reworked like the suggestions above...then we wiped to her at 2%.  Wasn't anything that people did wrong, but we found very small things that *could've* been done to pull out the win.  But now I'm rambling...yeah, if your guild is on their toes, you should be fighting mobs that take you to the edge of your capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vanidor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I looked briefly at your magelo and it looks like you have a mix of ornate and tradeable items. I'd suggest a few things you guys could try would be:<br />
1) Kael giants for faction everyone and armour pieces for the lower level char's<br />
2) Halls of Testing, park an alt inside to see when its not busy and farm there(guides available on a lot of sites)<br />
3) Tawro and Radir as suggested by others<br />
4) Plane of Storm's Mini's. Quad 900+ type mobs plus storm pet procs but doable with 3-4 groups of level 60-65's. Gives BoT access for ornate farming. Likely you'll need 3-4 clerics+spot healers though with the levels you gave.<br />
5) Prototype's in Innovation factory(need a keyed person). They are not tough exactly, but dismiss to each other's rooms those they proc the dismissal on. It requires lots of pets and spot heals, and nukers to manage their aggro.<br />
<br />
 <br />
One thing you might also want to work on is PoJ flags to prepare your people for BoT keys, and farm Daiku raider emblems to get the guild flagged for Tactics. That lets you equip everyone with Ornate from mini's in those zones.<br />
<br />
Plane of Storm giants, BoT giants and Tactics mobs would help your guild also build up raid and group leadership aa's if you can get 18+ there regularly. One thing you'll need also is shoulder/earring/ring items to do along with the ornate. Bloodmetal earrings for example for your melee's.</div></div><hr />
