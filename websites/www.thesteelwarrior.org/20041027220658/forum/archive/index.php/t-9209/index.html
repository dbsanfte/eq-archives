<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dxkj21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you rank the following Augs in amount of hate. If possible put a number of hate next to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anger I<br />
Anger II<br />
Anger III<br />
Strike of ykesha<br />
Force of ykesha<br />
Vampire Kiss<br />
Rujarkian Bile<br />

Thanks guys! I need to pick out two to aim for augging Velium Gemmed weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Conventional Wisdom:<br />

Anger I ~ Vampire Kiss ~ Rujarkian Bile (aka not much aggro)<br />
Anger II ~ SoY ~ FoY<br />
Anger III<br />
EB (not buyable)<br />
Anger (not buyable)<br />
<br />
Theres a lot of debate on this board atm though, see the spirit of rage and 'Anger III blows?&quot; threads. Unless you have points to burn, the cheap ykesha augs are generally considered to be really good aggro for the cost.</div></div><hr />

So Anger II vs SoY I might as well go with SoY because i get 100 damage in the deal as well?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Right-o. Plus, the debate is whether ykesha is better than anger III, virtually no-one contests that it's at least as good as Anger II if not better, and you get free casting interrupts on &lt;level 55 mobs and a dd.</div></div><hr />

Hrm I read a thread the other day where people said that if the Ykesha stun and dd were resisted that very little aggro was generated. Is this true?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, even if resisted a stun will give you aggro.  But don't put aug's on velium gemmed weapons, aug the droga pair she was swinging, and you'll have way more aggro.<br />

Yeah I didnt change the original post yet. We are definitely planning on keeping her current weapons. Trying to aim for cord hilted spike driver if we can get anothre group to help us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anger1 = Vamp Kiss = Ruj Bile = Icicle strike = not much aggro<br />
Anger2 = 400 aggro<br />
Snare proc= 300-400 (semi-unknown)<br />
Slow proc= 300-400 (ie willsapper ... semi-unknown)<br />
Debuff= 300-400 aggro (no one really knows .. depends on debuff)<br />
Taunting blow= 450 aggro<br />
100dd yak ~ 450 aggro (semi-unknown)<br />
125dd yak ~ 460-470 aggro? (semi-unknown)<br />
Anger3 = 600 aggro<br />
Enraging blow = 700 aggro<br />
Anger = 1100+ aggro (650 raw + stun/dd)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As to Ykesha, keep in mind the push component.  I group with a lot of pet classes and they hate the Ykesha push.  The push screws up pet positioning and kills dps worse then the agro gained over Anger 2 or (possibly) Anger 3.  (i.e.;  they would rather wait a few seconds before nuking and not have to worry about repositioning the pets due to push - or having the pets lose the back until I reposition the mob due to push)</div></div><hr />

Heh true that ... when i have my double stun-gun loaded i can generally push a mob the way i'm looking with 2-3 melees pushing on it's ass ... it can be annoying as hell but mostly i just find it funny.  <br />
<br />
I cringe to think of the push on double stun/KB weapons + 2 yaks.</div></div><hr />

so CHoS and SotBS with 2 ykesha augs might be a bit much?</div></div><hr />

It'll be a lot of push ... but it will be good aggro and a nice perk to your DPS (especially with I3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">how many points are the ykesha augs and where do i buy em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ykesha augs are 510 and 725? points. The type 4 ones are from lguk ldon, not positive about the type 8 ones. The 510 point one is called &quot;slimestone fragment of shock&quot; and has a 100 dd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">510 and 760. All from Sro. (Guk)</div></div><hr />

Is there some formula to figure out how many AP you get per adventure? Trying to figure out the time expenditure to grab two ykesha augs.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
depends on your level and the difficulty setting of the adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dxkj21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">depends on your level and the difficulty setting of the adventure.<br />

<br />
Yeah I know that. Thats why I was asking if there was a formula :). IE Avg level * something * difficulty mod</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Uh, just remember to make sure that if you have a type 4 weapon slot you buy the type 4 aug, not the type 8 (and, obviously, the reverse would be true). Seems like there was a post a while back from someone who bought the wrong anger II aug &amp; had an unfortunate &quot;D'oh!&quot; moment.</div></div><hr />
