<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In total this is my opinion, if you don't like it, be glad it's not yours.<br />
<br />
First thing is that, flawless agroo SHOULD be equal to increased dmg taken.  <br />
Warriors were meant to have a tenuous hold on aggro, we were supposed to take less dmg as a result, thus in the end upping DPS by reducing downtime spent meditating.<br />
<br />
That system was lost along the way, due to FT, long lasting mana regen spells, and partly horses which in open zones make medding something that doesn't happen.  <br />
<br />
That is the root of all problems, the fact that the damage taken, which was less at first for warriors, is now relatively even end game, but ALSO that increased damage taken matters for nothing now: get 10 clerics on a 1 second CH chain, in an outdoor zone with a horse, your looking at a large number of heals per cleric, and an even larger number of heals overall.<br />
<br />
Paladin aggro generation IS a role of their class.  It should make up for, at least in part their lowered hp/ac.  (the other part that makes up for this is the effect of stun in reducing mob DPS and their healing utility).... In this section is where it starts to become hard.  You have a class, originally designed 75% warrior 25% cleric, with healing powers that don't interfere with a clerics, they have quick, high mana heal spells.  Their Hitpoints and Armor should reflect this, they do not.  In my mind the ideal is such... Paladins havign their mitigation and hitpoints lowered, such to the point where it is an actualy decision between a paladin and a warrior just for the fact that it takes that much more mana to keep a paladin alive over a war.   Most definetly, however, this still needs to be signifigantly above at least rangers, because what I do NOT want to see is a grp taking a ranger over a paladin an SK or a warrior, because Warriors have no aggro, and SK's and Paladins have the same mitigation and hp's as a ranger, so why not take the aggro of a ranger along with their DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last part of this problem is itemization.  This is an issue that shoulden't have happened, SoE should have said to themselves, hmm this item has war/pal/sk/rng on it, so let's give it instead of 125 hp's, 100 hp 25 mana.<br />
As is however you have items like ornate and elemental armor where paladins and SK's are getting bonuses of a small amount of HP and ac for a batch of mana, fix this, please, you CANNOT give one class 200 hp/180 mana, and another class 210 hp, with no other bonus.<br />
A different solution to this problem is in effects, sure you can keep your mana, but I get Vengeance20 as a result (or aura of something, a USEFULL combat NOTE I said combat, not a clickable sow or ultravision, a WORN combat effect).  <br />
This gives the paladin/SK/rng a bonus on all their armor that is war useable as well.  Warriors have accepted this forever, it it has pal/sk/rng on it, it prolly has mana, and it's probably not as good as X-item.  <br />
What I personally would like to see is Warrior kept on a seperate loot table in ALL future expansions, where as knights/rng have 100hp/25mana, and get use of both, a warrior will have 125hp, and get use out of all of it.<br />
THIS is the part I'm not sure on however, do you just seperate the two, give them the same gear to choose from, with the 100hp+25mana or the 125 hp bulk?  <br />
At curent neither of these situations hold true, an item that has war/pal/rng/sk with invariably have not only hp's, but also mana, which does nothing for a war, but helps a paladin, so 125 hp's get's turned into 100 hp 50 mana, this is part of SoE's reasoning, 50% of the hp's sounds fair at first glance, it is not.<br />
<br />
I have no suggestions on warrior aggro, I think it is fine the way it is, I think other classes however have grown, and others have not.  The classes who have not grown are feeling the most hurt atm, and we just wish that others could come back down to our size, and play with us in our neighborhood.... we can't walk 3 miles to your park.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand your point. Paladins have been saying the same thing ever since they got enough HP's and survivability to surplant Warriors. They said the opposite when they lacked survivability. By saying so for all this time, it's not surprising that some people have come to believe it. However, it's easy to demonstrate that it is a flawed ex-post facto argument.<br />
<br />
1. To be effective a tank must have both survivability and aggro control that meets the current standard. When Paladins didn't have this during Kunark, they suffered. With all the mana possible in the current environment, it is not a good idea to lower their survivability until it becomes a risk factor. To do so make them no longer viable as tanks.<br />
<br />
2 To have classes that effectively match a Warrior's survivability while having vastly superious aggro control is inconsistant with the Warrior Class Description. From the very begining of the game our role has been to be unmatched in surviving the most brutal battles and able to make ourselves the focus of all our enemies' attacks. Ranged aggro and snap aggro on demand is the standard now - Warriors must have these abilities to remain viable as tanks.<br />
<br />
3. The argument ignores that stuns did not generate aggro for quite awhile in the game. Paladins, like Warriors, were given the Taunt button, DPS, and weapon procs to be used to gain and hold aggro. Aggro was added to stuns as a deteriment for casting them as they had been used to stun lock mobs. Paladins were not designed to inherrently have superior aggro to Warriors. It occurred as a side effect.<br />
<br />
4. The greater strength with a balancing weakness argument was invented after the fact. Clerics are the Premier Healer in the game. What unique thing do they lack that makes them fatally flawed in this role? Nothing. The pure classes are in fact supposed to be MORE effective at their role than the hybrids derived from them.<br />
<br />
Warriors are supposed to be MORE effective in our role as the Premier Tank in the game than the hybrids derived from us. Paladins are supposed to give up some Tank ability and some Healer ability because they get BOTH.<br />
<br />
5. The result of Paladins being better at filling the Warrior Class Description than Warriors themselves while also having spells from the Cleric side of the family is entirely predictable. They are the preferred tank in most experiance groups, preferred in clearing yard trash on raids, and preferred tanking some high level mobs.<br />
<br />
Now that Paladins have FT, KEI, Band song, etc. the only thing distinguishing them from Clerics is specialization and spell selection.<br />
<br />
That SoE understands that Paladins should not be equal to Clerics is reflected in the statement:<br />
If hybrids could cast spells as well as their parent class, then nobody would really want to play that parent class. - Absor<br />
<br />
Now that Paladins have HP's within 4-10% of an equivilant Warrior AND the ability to substitute a side-effect of spellcasting for the tools all tanks have been given to obtain and hold aggro with superior results AND Clerical spells with a lot more mana than anytime in the past - the only thing of real value that Warriors have that they lack is Defensive which is used on raids and by Warriors that MT on them.<br />
<br />
SoE should be able to figure out that:<br />
<br />
If hybrids could effectively match a Warrior's ability to survive battles, exceed a Warriors' ability to make themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, and cast spells, then nobody would really want to play a Warrior. Oh wait, they can!- Battleblade<br />
