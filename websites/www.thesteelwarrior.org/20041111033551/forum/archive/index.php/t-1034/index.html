<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsebach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all...<br />
<br />
I was just fartin around today and an idea came to me... a way to maybe help the current problem with the taunt skill.  It wouldn't be a fix, just a way to make it a little more palatable.  And if this has been suggested before, I apologize... I like to think I have read all of these threads but I'm sure some have slipped by.<br />
<br />
Anyway, right now when we taunt, we get a text echo saying &quot;You attempt to taunt blah blah blah&quot;, same text no matter what.  What if they made the simple change to have that message report whether the taunt was successful or not?  They have a message for trade skills... heck, almost every action in the game has a text message reporting it's success or failure.  Like I said, it doesn't really fix the underlying fault with the skill, but it would take a bit of the uncertainty out of it.  It would be nice to be able to say over /rs, with every degree of certainty, &quot;%T taunted!&quot;<br />

Again, if this is old hat, feel free to let the thread float to the bottom and die. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like this, but I'd go a little further.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is this message and maybe an animation when ANYONE taunts.<br />
<br />
Just like you do with mez breaks, for the same reason; timing taunts is a key skill and it helps for the group/raid to be able to see who's goofing up and set them straight, for everyone's safety.<br />
<br />
I'd hope it would be a simple change to make too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes this has been suggested before, and yes it seems like a really good and relatively simple idea.  Of course a lot of really good and relatively simple ideas have been tossed around here for the last god knows how many months, and nothing has been done yet except to make changes to casters. :)<br />
<br />
Ooooooh!!! It's easier to mem spells now. :p<br />

I'd like to see this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So what if it says 'xxx taunted'. The mob is still gonna turn away to the SK 3 seconds later. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds ok and Dakkin's idea is GREAT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And how about taunt immediately refreshes if it fails, kind of like the spell icons immediately refresh when a spell fizzles?  Yeah, we'd keep hitting taunt until it worked, but hell don't the hybrids keep hitting the spell icon until is casts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;A taunt refreshes sort of like a spell icon if a spell fails.&quot; Why does everyone compared the screwed over melee to the Gods who own Norath, the Ones with spell icons, in Casterquest?<br />

Warriors<br />
1. Worst soloers<br />
2. Second worse DPS (SKs got you beat when you add pet, DoTs, and Taps)<br />
3. Worst travel<br />
4. Worst aggro<br />
5. Worst PvP<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So do you like the idea, dislike the idea, or simply wanted an excuse to rant some more about casters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like any improvement to warriors, I have played this game for 4 years. Improvements have not come, nerfs have come. Sony can keep their game, gotten in Beta form from Verant and continued (esp in PoP) in Beta in proud tradition by Sony. Ranting on this board or any board does nothing. I am pointing out, that WoW is coming, and that will be the death of EQ! Verant/Sony, whoever has had plenty of time to unBeta this crappy game and has choose not to. Now you will have to excuse me while I taunt a Tree Snake and have it KICK at me  or get OWNED by a lt blue naked lizard, half my size. I have armor and weapons obtained by killing Gods. Then I plan on soloing eight blues at once with my Dr00d kiting in Casterquest (equipment obtained in the bazaar for minimum pp for the most part).</div></div><hr />

Well umm fizzleling spells still couse mana and so does resisted spells. (resisted spells also couse agro, but I bet there is a whole lot of ppl that would like that to be remove, but hehe would be too overpowering )<br />
<br />
So what if taunt button also fizzles and you have to regain the &quot;mana&quot; to use it. What would be kewl is a AA that could reduce he time inbetween the taunt refreshes much like monks Rapid FD. but also  the XX is taunting XXX is also a nice idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">But you already do get a response to your attempted taunt.  If it works the mob says &quot;I'll teach you to interfere with me Gonaden&quot;.  This doesn't work on all mobs of course, but the ones that can speak it works on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like the idea of geting a confirmation messge when its successful.  I also know if implemented people will send about a million bug reports because mobs ignore you on a successful taunt for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
I'd simply like to have 3 taunt keys to choose from,  each with different refresh times and levels of effectivness.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What I'l like to see about taunt :<br />
<br />
- A message everyone we can see when taunt is succesfull. so even if the sk take aggro 3 seconds after, it's HIS fault, he needed to restrain himself for 3 more seconds.<br />
<br />
- some special properties and formulas added to taunt, like addind something that do the second taunt checkafter a missed one is always succesfull.<br />
<br />
- the reuse time of taunt decreased progressivly to 4 seconds at level 65. so level 65 will not only mean you have gained the right to grind the AA you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">4. Worst aggro<br />
<br />
thats wrong unless you talking about tanks only. i know for sure i have better aggro then a bard or a druid. and pvp they is all about gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Have the druid snare four times in a row, debuff its AC, debuff its FR and see how well a druid taunts....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tsebach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But you already do get a response to your attempted taunt. If it works the mob says &quot;I'll teach you to interfere with me Gonaden&quot;. This doesn't work on all mobs of course, but the ones that can speak it works on. <br />
<br />
The last mobs that talked to me when I taunted were in Splitpaw at, erm... high 20's? ;)  I'm sure there were a few more here and there (I seem to recall one mob talking in KC), but I'd be willing to bet that no mob in Velious+ gives the &quot;I'll teach you...&quot; message.<br />
<br />
A large part of pre-EB aggro is relying upon your group to work with you to make sure you are taking the beats.  (Heck, I'm sure there is some of that still needed post-EB, but I can't speak to that as I do not own such weaponry.)  And grouping, ie. teamwork, is all about communication.  And right now, aside from constantly assisting the mob to make sure we are still the target (which sucks), we have no way to know FOR SURE if we are the current target.  Sure, we can tell if we are taking hits, but with a sufficiently slowed mob, sometimes (read: many times) it is hard to tell whether the mob is just between rounds or hitting someone else.  Or casting, for that matter.<br />
<br />
Again, I know it isn't that huge of a change... and I understand some of the more negative posts by the people who have been jaded by the ongoing debate.  But I'm of the opinion that anything will help... and by asking for something small and easy, we are much more likely to get it than by requesting a complete redesign of the taunt/aggro situation.<br />
<br />
Then again, I was one of the people who welcomed /shield with open arms, and use it constantly.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

ROFLMAO...<br />
<br />
umm, Bard AOE songs.. instant aggro..<br />
<br />
Druid Dots, about  the 4th or 5th one with CH's and DD's thrown in, you can proc EB all day and until the druid dies you wont get aggro..</div></div><hr />
