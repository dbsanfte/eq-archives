<br />
The rest of it sounds a little buisy for my tastes. Perhaps all these new abilities are just another way to get people to grind out new types of levels. What I mean is that we've spent almost 5 years now working nicely without it. Why add it now?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: I just got to thinking about the new group type exp bar and all the UI's needing updated. /shiver</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also remember, you're giving up 20% of your own exp for these points. Would you rather have an extra AA for yourself that stacks with everyone else in the group, or an extra group AA that you won't use if anyone else in the group has more?</div></div><hr />

What will this change mean for the game?<br />
<br />
- Will it develop a &quot;have/have nots&quot;; aka real officers of battle in who has these points and who does not?   I can see  a case where once a person gets enough of these points they could become a very valuable commodity.<br />
<br />
- Will people fight over the leadership of groups?  Exp is evenly distributed currently but this is &quot;special&quot;.  Is so is this behaviour SoE really wants to encourage (the prime directive of EQ since day 1 has been cooperation and grouping)<br />
<br />
- How will this impact the &quot;casual&quot; gamer?  Will this mean more folks will double and triple box in order to obtain this points?<br />
<br />
- How will this impact the existing SimCorporations in the game?  How will guilds assign these points?<br />
<br />
Alot of open ended questions:  hope someone under the &quot;NDA&quot; is asking them of SoE</div></div><hr />

I can tell you have never lead a raid :p<br />
<br />
And some of the skills listed definately sound like they could be useful tools(the designate main assist etc). <br />
<br />
I dont think most guilds will have problems deciding who will get the raid leader points. <br />
<br />
It will be the groupleader ones that people will &quot;fight&quot; over :p<br />
<br />
But HEY.. if that makes people wake up and actually get raids started quicker because everyone is eager to be groupleader as opposed to standing around picking their nose, then i am all for it :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, there will certainly be idiotic fights over who gets to be group leader and in some gimp cases even over who wants to be raid leader.  A few morons will try to call the raid and claim leadership even though someone else ends up doing all the actual work of putting it together for them.  I've seen that happen once or twice with someone who just wanted the PRESTIGE of being raid leader. lol... they did nothing for the actual raid.  It was just a tag.  Now if they can get some kind of game reward for it, too.... /shudder<br />
<br />
How will this impact the &quot;casual&quot; gamer? Will this mean more folks will double and triple box in order to obtain this points?<br />
<br />
Of course.  I know a guy who 4 boxes already.  He'll have all the leadership points he wants.<br />
<br />
Honestly most of these skills strike me as more EQ for Dummies.  Mark npc, delegate mains... blah blah.  Is it so hard to assist your Main and remember who the hell they were?  I realize if you're out and about feeding the pets, lecturing the kids, watching a movie, and cooking dinner at the same time as you play EQ, you might miss the basic, likely repeated several times instructions of the raid.  Then you deserve to be clueless about what's going on.  :p  Is it really that hard to assist right so you were on the right mob?  I know I've had someone on virtually every raid I've been on fail in these simple tasks, but then that's how we separate the competent and good raiders from the idiots.  <br />
<br />
Eh well... maybe I misunderstand the skills.</div></div><hr />

That's what being a raid leader giving instructions is like, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the skills appear to be  the EQ for dummies type (note that isn't necessarily a bad thing to have still heh)<br />
<br />
Some are minor boosts it seems.. increase  the grps offence, mana, hp or what not.. probably minor but it's something<br />
<br />
Some could be reasonably useful... if you can con a mob and perhaps see it's class, level, buffs or what not would be a neat feature... or find path to player... or mark (yes you can use mark as a DO NOT CROSS THIS LINE DUMMY but also as a fast way to show where to place or pull or what not.. )<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all the leader skills look more entertaining and useful than the class AA's so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scenario 1:<br />
/ enc lfg 65 all<br />
There as no players lfg<br />
Enchanter tells group &quot;make me leader or I walk.&quot;<br />
Group: &quot;Of course sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scenario 2:<br />
/ cle lfg 65 all<br />
There are no players lfg<br />
/ dru lfg 65 all<br />
There are 4 players lfg <br />
Cleric thinks: &quot;This group is probably retarded and don't go without clerics, these druids have the gear of a fancy sponge, and they can't heal for shit.&quot;<br />
Cleric tells group: &quot;Make me leader or you can have fun getting chealed every 10 seconds for 25% of your hitpoints by a druid with no option of quick heals or rez.&quot;<br />
Group: &quot;No question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scenario 3:<br />
/ war lfg 65 all<br />
there are 4 players lfg<br />
/ shad lfg 65 all<br />
there are 1 players lfg<br />
/ pal lfg 65 all<br />
there are 1 players lfg<br />
Warrior thinks: &quot;I'm in PoTime. Everyone of these dumbasses have been drooling over my shit for about an hour now. Plus, none of these lfg fags come from raiding guilds, my lugies can out-damage and out-tank them all.&quot;<br />
Warrior tells the group: &quot;Make me leader or you can watch as trip-900 mobs turn the 6kbuffed ass of Bill_War, Bob_War or Josh_Pal into a whiping gallery&quot;<br />
Group: &quot;You ubers are fucking jerks, but fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scenario 4:<br />
/ rog lfg 65 all<br />
there are 3 players lfg<br />
/ mnk lfg 65 all<br />

there are 1 players lfg<br />
/ nec lfg 65 all<br />
there are 3 players lfg<br />
/ ran lfg 65 all<br />
there are 2 players lfg<br />
Monk think: &quot;Oh shit&quot;<br />
Monk tells group: &quot;Um, guys, any chance I could be leader, would love to get my first leadership points.&quot;<br />
Cleric: ahahahah<br />
Shadow: lol, dream on<br />
Wizard: greedy point-grubbing bastard<br />
Enchanter: try playing a useful class for a change<br />
/target monk<br />
/disband monk<br />
/ooc group need 1 more dps, pst<br />
/ooc Want 65 nec?<br />
/ooc 65 rog avail.<br />
/ooc  Me pls, 65 ran<br />
/ooc 65 magi lfg, I HAEV NUKE!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But, oh yes, leadership AA's are a sure cure for.... nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually with this leadership AA thing maybe people will realize they're not as dependent on certain classes in a group if it means having to give it up, though I doubt that'll actually happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dedicated folks might decide to get these abilities maxed during exp grinds, either with friends or bots, etc:<br />
<br />
Offense Enhancement (5 lvls, cost 3)<br />
Mana Enhancement (3 lvls, cost 3)<br />
Health Enhancement (3 lvls, cost 3)<br />
Health Regeneration (3 lvls, cost 3)<br />
<br />
That combination would make a very persuasive argument for being made a group leader in ANY situation, at least to me.  I'm also wondering if the group and raid bonuses will stack... having a raid leader with those maxed out, and group leaders in the raid with them maxed out, seems to be to be a Good Thing for a raid...<br />
<br />
Didn't apply for beta, kind of wish I had so I'd know the magnitude of the benefits of these...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an incredibly stupid idea in my opinion.  Want to add the Mark, Path, Delagate MA (haha!) and such skills, hey go for it.  Myself and those that lead our raids aren't likely to get them but hey, I can see possible uses.<br />
<br />
The Offense Enhancement and such skills?  Come now, you must be shitting me.  Even if it is 1% per level... how could I *not* want these!  Even at this point I would be willing to say all fine for raids but for pick-up groups??? Jesus, like I need more drama.<br />
<br />
The only possible solution I can think of is to allow any group member to work on Leadership Skills at any time by toggling the slider or whatever.  Then one could pick the actual leader based on who has the best mix of skills.  Of course, that might be how it works but I have my doubts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would guess that these abilities have a tiered accesses in that you need to group ones before you can get the raid ones.<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist (1 lvl, cost 4)<br />
Delegate Mark NPC (1 lvl, cost 4)<br />
<br />
~ In most raiding guilds everyone will pre make all there assist keys so at the basic level it may not help much. If it allows the raid leader to put in an assists list where all tanks will be sorted by that assist and when ever anyone uses the raid assist key they assist the highest person on that list that is alive, that could help in cases of MA death or other changes.<br />
<br />
I think LoY and GoD can be classes as different kind of expansion, they are not standard ones they are more functionality expansions.<br />
<br />
Most of them seem like raiding for dummy’s kind of AA. Of course I would guess most use the &quot;3D target indicator&quot; and it fits in to the same category.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see those who get their leadership enhancements first having a huge edge, too.  <br />
<br />
Early on after GoD release -- &quot;Make me leader, I have mana enhancement 1 and offense enhancement 1!&quot;  <br />
Group: &quot;yeah, okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
So they get even more exp.  Those with nothing early on continue to get nothing.  Eventually... some frequent leaders have multiple levels of all the enhancement skills.  Most other people have none or close to it.  Who's going to be the leader of your group then?  Of course.  The person who has all those skills.  As has already been pointed out, the most in demand classes initially will have the edge in acquiring those skills first and then once they have them, they will have the easy edge in being made group leader to acquire still more skills.<br />
<br />
I just can't see this implementation being anything but a huge pain the butt because of grouping politics.  More drama.... wheeee....</div></div><hr />
