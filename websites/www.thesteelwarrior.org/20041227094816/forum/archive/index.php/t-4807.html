<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruuthie</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I ran and bought all the tomes I could for my war got them all set up and decided to just click Incite to see what would happen.<br />
<br />
Well what happened sucked, the icon grayed out and the timer to reset it wasnt the 30 second timer Incite is suposed to be it turned out to be a 24 hour timer for my warrior. I tried several other discs like Defensive and Evasive these also reset to a 24 hour time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heres a pic of what I got... bascialy a level 65 raid warrior that wont be tanking anything for at least another 20 hours.<br />

<br />
<br />
Anyone else heard of or encountered this problem?<br />
<br />
I've tried all the regular &quot;fix it&quot; stuff camping in/out repatching restarting. None of it has worked. I'm hoping that when the timer runs out I'm set back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really hoping you /petition and /bug that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruuthie</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did petition it and asked if the gm or who ever answered if they could help me out. <br />
<br />
The reply as close as I can recall is &quot;I'll get on that just as soon as I get a degree in computer sciences but that isnt going to happen any time soon&quot;<br />
<br />
No seriously that was the reply. And I pay to play this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korudan</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">from the test server boards  (http://www.l33tgeek.com/testserver/viewtopic.php?t=1502) looks like they had this problem on test as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only bug I noticed is that in the UI, in the Timer1-4 submenues, the disciplines are grouped wrongly :p<br />
Using some on 1 timer greyes others on other timer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another silly &quot;bug&quot;<br />
<br />
I use a custom UI, and I didnt get my ability window.<br />
<br />
It should be grabbing that window from default folder if it is not in my custom one, but it is not.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cause you have to edit your custom equi.xml file and include the combat windows patched in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Equirs</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our regular raid MT had his discs timers set all the way back to 16500 hours... This happened when he used stonewall and ran out of stamina while it was activated. I'm not sure WHAT happened but basically he's useless to us for the next 3 years or so until they fix him cause logging out didn't do anything. Luckily he's due for a christmas vacation soon :P <br />
<br />
So...rofl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol wow<br />
maybe its eq's way of saying &quot; time to switch the mt&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herkimer</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This bug has happened to a guildmate too - all timers set to around 1800 hours :mad: <br />
<br />
He said he noticed this after zoning using LDoN teleport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same bug, all my disc have 888 hours reuse. Which kind of sucks as i havent gotten to try them out :(<br />
Petitioned, waited some hours got bounced from guide to senior guide then he was going to up it to some other gm line, at that point i had to go to bed, guess i have to repeat it agian oh joy:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ararkham</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got no problems with timer but noticed the following bugs : <br />
<br />
- Some disc are not on the good timer (Healing will for ex)<br />
- Is it me or Taunt seems to fail A LOT ????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">geneis</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id have to say that about 3/10 of my taunts succede in an all 65 LDoN adventure. no wonder i couldnt hold agro worth a damn. and sometimes when i tuant i dont get agro back.,,,(grumble gruble damn beast lords)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yella</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The groupings for some of the discs appeared to be wrong. Another thing I noticed was that mighty strike appeared to be not working. At any rate, it wasn't giving any crits, it is supposed to be a crit on every hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ararkham</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, got no crits with Mighty strike too ...<br />
<br />
3/10 seems a good ratio ..maybe a bit less yesterday in some normals adventures...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing will stops right after you start it. Stacking bug maybe? wasnt paying attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cant attack, be attacked or use a clicky item when HW is on, and it doesnt stack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something seems a little amiss with provoke/..../incite too. Was grouping in BoT to try it all out and had a ranger pulling. Firing incite on incoming did NOT grab aggro off the ranger who had just shot an arrow at a mob. <br />
<br />
When used on incoming, I don't think the slower got summoned at all, which is a relief. It worked pretty well during a fight as it seemes to grab aggro back pretty consistently off an overnuking wizard (I told him to hehe). Even as a pulling tool it s not that bad. <br />
<br />
I just don't quite understand the issue with arrows.....seems a bit like the bug with SK direct aggro spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try smacking the mob with melee (or perhaps an arrow of your own) before using Incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing Will got modified with the 19th patch. it should stack with everything but necros and Sk  lifetaps (take a look at lucy).<br />
<br />
And its still &quot;fragile&quot;, we'll not be able to use it while fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynetta</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No bugs ...pulled with Incite and LOVED IT!!!! Only lost aggro to once or twice to a shaman that slowed three times in a row.<br />
<br />
&lt;swoon&gt; The JOY!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that if I pulled with Incite and didnt meele at all, a simple shammy slow would take the mob off me. On the contrary, if I pulled with Incite, smacked the mob a few times (no procs), it wouldnt leave me at all.<br />
But my shammy friend can slow right when the mob is at camp now, and that makes me happy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did an adv last night, normal setting, group was: 59 BST (epic), 52 Shaman, 56 Druid, 56 Cleric, 56 Warrior (me!)<br />
<br />
tried mighty strike a couple times, no crits =/<br />
<br />
used berate, LOVE IT.  my wife (the bst) fights with her primary epic equipped, which procs a 50% slow, shaman was slowing, and except for i think 2 times i held agro =)<br />
<br />
me so happy!<br />
(now if they could just fix mightystrike)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruuthie</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last nights emergency patch didnt fix this timer bug. My war still has 5 hours until she can try out Incite again and 6 hours until she can pop Defensive. I'm seeing reports of this happening on some other msg boards also so I'm kinda glad to see it isnt just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They fixed MightyStrike with the last patch I think, and they also regruoped the disciplines correctly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did they fix the bug with the discs &quot;fizzling&quot;?</div></div><hr />
