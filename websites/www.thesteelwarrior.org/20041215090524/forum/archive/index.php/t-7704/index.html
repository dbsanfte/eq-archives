<br />
Yea, I was an idiot and blew furious on blazzax.  Was 5 min left on the timer when Reparm was inc and I probably should have had somebody else tank but I had never tanked Reparm so I tried it :).  He went down anyway, but no thanks to me.<br />
<br />
I'm still pissed about this.  The very least he could have done was wait a few seconds before owning me.</div></div><hr />

  I never got double procced by Reparm, fortunately... though I barely ever tanked him. I always wanted to see that happen though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fathers day we're in fire all being pretty slack with 50 ish ppl a lil short on clerics and our regular dps.So we killed birds and getting ready to pull Blazz I'm thinking,&quot;Gee, everyone seems distracted&quot; and say something to the effect of ,&quot;Hey guys ...Blazz hit's pretty hard&quot;.Course he's a regular on the menu and I usually tank him and Reparm(er knock on wood) np ,so everythings pretty relaxed:<br />
<br />
Puller &quot;Incoming Blazzax!...er well I think maybe eventually..&quot;<br />
Me &quot; hey guys still don't got di ummm&quot;<br />
Puller &quot; O here He comes sec....er um nope&quot;<br />
Me &quot;how's range?&quot; no rot started sooo im a nervous hunk of paper<br />
Raidleader&quot;HERE HE IS!&quot;<br />
Me &quot;Heal me!&quot;<br />
........LOADING PLEASE WAIT........<br />
<br />
Me &quot;Well fook&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point I consent clerics hopin to get dragged outa range for rezz.4 hot rezzes later followed by immediate deaths,I've looted, got focus &amp; speed and am well ...dps'n.The Raid leader is tanking now, a lotta people down.Looks like half the chain must be in pok cuz his life bar looks like a pogo stick.But, hey we get him down just past enrage....then the rl dies.Next tank in order then dies and I'm not sure who's left anymore so I ae taunt- furious and tank till Blazz at 1pct and port to bind.Now the dps is screaming burn(well wats left of the dps...chanter nukes own) and they say 0 pct,so im like omg we won ty ty.Then I hear those words...&quot;WIPE&quot;.&quot;Blazz back at spawn regenning&quot; ...gah.<br />
<br />
Woke us up hehe.We went back and I one tanked Blazz,Reparm in quick succession with no deaths on rape and no di pops.Then we ran up and offed Fennin flawlessly.I only died once ma'n clearing to Fro and had 1 di pop on fennin i thk after defensive wore and i got summoned.<br />
<br />
So, hehe I guess some humility is good for the soul. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
caprin cycle is reparm for the lower tanks .. but with a bard and GoD its pretty trivial as you resist it every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm too technically challenged to say with certainty Apolyon.Gunnar doesn't parse just prays alot.But,It's been awhile since reparm (knock on wood again)one rounded me.I attribute this to luck and di though.I always go with bard(er unless he's dead),god and circles cause I still don't know all the differant mob resists.Never tank Hydrotha without mr btw omg.I love fero when i can get it and sometimes people convince me to squeeze in pr/dr, though, for me with a chain running those don't seem to make a huge diff.<br />

<br />
Don't quote me on this, but I thought:<br />
<br />
1: Spells couldn't trigger DI<br />
<br />
2: Each hit on you at under the DI trigger level (15%?) gives a chance of firing DI before the damage is applied</div></div><hr />

Hurts don't it lol, I had him double proc (3000 x 2) hit me twice for about 3000 damage in total, then he procced once more...6000 + 3000 + 3000 = me dead :(<br />

<br />
Clerics already have an AA that increases the chance of sucess (if I remember correctly up to 95% with good CHA).  <br />
<br />
I think it would make more sense for the new AA to be on the tank...<br />
<br />
Make it start checking at 20% instead of 15% which would decrease the amount of times it fails because it never got a chance to fire.<br />
<br />
I was thinking all tank classes could get the AA but actually since DI is almost exclusively a raid tool and raids are where things hit hard enough to need a bigger check range... it might be a good warrior class AA.  Getting those extra chances for DI to trigger might further set warriors apart as the raid tank without hurting a knight ability to xp group tank at all.</div></div><hr />

Think about how many times you go down to 1bub of health.  15% isnt too far off from 20%, but that would mean that DI will fire more often not only on times you are hit from 20% to 0, but when a round takes you to 18% right before a heal lands.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
  When you have DI on, 20% is plenty low enough. You don't really want to be going lower than that on any mobs. Mob damage skipping over DI is much, much worse than it going off too often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was under the impression the cleric aa did not increase chance of DI to fire, but increased chance of full heal as opposed to partial heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was under the impression the cleric aa did not increase chance of DI to fire, but increased chance of full heal as opposed to partial heals.<br />
<br />
There are 3 levels of the cleric AA.<br />
<br />
(going from memory)<br />
<br />
First level - gives an additional chance to fire (if you fail your check, it will check again)<br />
Second level - chance of a partial heal even on a fail<br />
Third level - increases heal to full<br />
<br />
The AA doesn't seem to work exactly as it is worded in the description.  According to the text it seems like the third level will ALWAYS heal but we know that isn't true.  But given good CHA on the tank and level 3 of the AA, it has been parsed at (again by memory) 95% fire rate (including partial heals).  <br />
<br />
The main problem with DI nowdays isn't the fail rate.  I don't think you can get much better then 95%.  The problem is that some mobs hit so hard that it never gets a chance to check.<br />
<br />
On a 10k tank, 15% is 1.5k HPs.  Unlike in Luclin when the cleric AA first came out, a LOT of mobs hit harder than that.  Even 20% is only 2k HPs - by elementals you are running into 3k hitters so this still wouldn't save you all the time but would give more of a chance for there to be a chance for it to fire.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what high end tanks are up to these days but 20% of 12k is still only 2.4k so again its not a free ride.  You'd have to get up to 15k HPs before you could have a 3k safe zone.  I'm sure there are tanks that will get there but when they do the mobs will probably be hitting harder then 3k anyway?  Someone further along in the game would know more about the details here but I think in theory I'm right?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind it firing more often.  I hate it when it never has a chance to fire and we lose a tank.</div></div><hr />
