I was considering buying Eyeshiv of Darkness, 14 21  75 dd proc, decent stats, peircer. Required level 45, I'm 46 now, and Using it for a while. How bad off would I be in the end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'd be ok - you'll lose perhaps 2% DPS over an equivalent 1hs/1hb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Piercing maxes at 240 where 1hb and 1hs max at 250.  It is still a good skill to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jziad MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 46 your are prolly not really near the place where the cap makes alot of difference anyway. <br />
Work all your skills and use whatever weapon you have available which is the best at the time, If thats this dagger, then go for it. By the time you cap and level you may well have alternate weapons anyway, but one day you may find that piercer that even with the lesser warrior cap still outshines your others, and you will have less skill raising issues. There are some nice piercers about that rogues don't want, you to can pick up easier/cheaper on raids etc too depending on what level of the game you are playing.</div></div><hr />

Because you are gullible and they needed a good laugh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only rogues can backstab; it's a triggered skill like bash/slam is for tanks or harm touch is for sk's. If you don't have that backstab button, you ain't backstabbin'.<br />
<br />
I speak this as a level 63 rogue, who has never seen his warrior, ranger, sk or pally backstab, ever, not even with +backstab weapons.</div></div><hr />

15% * 0 = 0<br />

Therefore you have 0 chance of landing a backstab with this weapon.  =)</div></div><hr />

although i do see some warriors with only eb weapons use a dagger of distraction when not MT to counteract dbw proc.</div></div><hr />

 A frigging men! I got lucky enough to get a friendly invite on Cursed Cycle and no one there wanted the Windspeeder I now have. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My problem is everytime i get a group i am MT, and trying to build my pierce or 1hb or even 2hb is a chore while still trying to keep agro, Forget about 2hs i haven't even worked on that yet. I get yelled at for trying to get those built up while in a group cause then i can't keep agro from the mob, everyone else around me usually has proc weapons that either poison or stun.<br />
<br />
So how do i go about building my skill in these weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Das_bert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Do it when you are not the MA on a raid.  Thats how I got all my skills up.  Get low delay weapons, and swing away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Or find a group somewhere and ask to work your skills on their mobs.  I did that while I was LFG alot.  At least you'll accomplish something while you wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">misses still create agro and weapon skill has no effect on procs. so use it when you feel like it unless your dps is inportant to living.<br />

should be able to keep agro and raise your skills with them. their is prolly beter but all i can think of for lvl 37 and that proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Karog I see you are level 37 via your sig. Once you hit level 40 your skills are capped until level 51. Take those next 10 levels and you will max out all of your skills without any issues.<br />
<br />
Also you could just goto Katta and attack the banker for skill ups :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well i did a little lvlin and i am now 41, And i have a Steel Rod of the Knight dropped off skellies in Anniversary events. I also got a Board of Bashing off a skellie event, it has a Shock of Blades (http://www.magelo.com/eq_spell_info.jsp?num=324) it only has a MR+25 so i should never get a proc off on any mobs i am fighting now. But it still helps with 1hb, And i guess it wont do in exchange for the CHoS. hehe. <br />
<br />
I also got a nice pierce blade, Lord of somthing*. <br />
<br />
So one more question do i use them in Off hand or do i put them in Primary to build skill faster?<br />
<br />
Thanks and as always any help is usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So one more question do i use them in Off hand or do i put them in Primary to build skill faster? <br />
<br />
Depends.  You will skill up much faster in your primary, but if your skill is really bad your dps will take a hit.  If that isn't an issue, put it in primary.  If you are in a situation where your dps is needed then offhand it, you will still get skill ups but your dps won't take as big of a hit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Little trick to get around the cap for one hand P for warriors. Can do the same for other classes that have lower caps in certain areas and higher in another - monks and H2H comes to mind (or beasts and 1HB - one of them)<br />
<br />
Anyway, notice that if you are maxed piercing/2HB and you put a lance in your hands you get a lowered attack than if you put in a 2HB or 2HS. You cant get around that.<br />
<br />
Putting a dagger in you PRIMARY hand does the same thing over a sword, BUT if you put a dagger in your secondary it does not  lower the attack. Its been over a year since I parsed it, but when I did I found that having a dagger in the off-hand did not lower DPS when compared to a sword/club of the same ratio. I think I was using a 10/18 for both but forget exactly the weapons. Then again, it might have been that dagger on one of the rhags - I cant exactly remember and I dont know if SOE even fixed it.<br />
<br />
I would think they didnt but I have used a dagger in a long time, so investigate and get yourself a nice off-hand if it works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">*havent used a dagger in a long time - correction for the above</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What Mokor said -- that agro does not depend on the damage that you actually do -- shoudl be comforting to young warriors attempting to practice a wide variety of weapons.<br />
An 11/22 1HS and the &quot;same&quot; 11/22 piercing weapon should generate the same agro even if you've maxxed your skill in 1HS and your skill in piercing is 15.<br />
I suspect that most people who have problems holding agro with practice weapons are having that problem because their practice weapon isn't as good as their &quot;favorite&quot; weapon.<br />
<br />
If your main is a warrior in his 30s or 40s and you haven't bought pp online or been given pp by some friends, then you are broke. And that's another reason to practice a variety of weapon skills.<br />
<br />
On my server you can get a Jarsath Trident (pri/sec 11/22 STR +5, DEX -5, STA +5, AGI -5) for under 60pp.  it's cheap because it's peircing and because of the negative stats. But, for around 65 more pp you can get a shimmeriing partisan (pri/sec, 17/39, STR+10, DEX +20, Fire +10). Yeah, it's pretty slow, but pop it in your offhand with the trident in your mainhand and you should be able to hold agro fairly well in your 30s/40s--at least, I did the last time I tried it with a warrior (just *before* the provoke line was added).<br />
<br />
As for people yelling at you for practicing your weapons: if the weapon you are using is significantly slower than your regular weapon, they might have a point in the short run. But if you regularly group with these people, and your practice weapon is okay, then I'd just explain to them that for you to make the best warrior possible, you're going to have to work on a lot of skills. If you're using taunt and the provoke line properly, then a 11/22 mainhand weapon should be generating enough agro for you to do your job in your low 40s even today. <br />
<br />
At that level, almost any other class can steal agro from the warrior if they try. As a warrior you don't want to restrict the dps of the group, but beyond a point the other players simply have to learn do do as much damage as they can without grabbing agro. If they spent a lot of pp on some uber proc weapon--well, okay, now they have agro. Duh. Maybe they should bag *their* weapons and break out a non-proc'ing, higher dps weapon, hmmm?<br />
<br />
If you explain what you're doing and why, and they're not willing to reduce the agro they're generating, and they're unhappy that you're practicing your skills...hmmm. I guess I'd find someone else to play with who needs a tank.</div></div><hr />
