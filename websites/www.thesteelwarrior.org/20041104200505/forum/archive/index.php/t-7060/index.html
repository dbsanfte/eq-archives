<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my guild has both recently gotten our first emp ssra and first rztw kills so we will be raiding VT and EP soon. as you see in my magelo i got a woven shim choker for haste atm and it will need upgrading in the near future. so my question is out of gorget of superiority, cord of midnight, bracer of earthen energy, flowing moss mantle, or band of swirling air, which haste item should i go for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you actually have the choice of all of those, the bracer is probably the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All are 41% haste. Go for the one with the most hp's and/or the one that would be hardest to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">right now im thinking either ring or gorget. the only nice neck item i can think of is talisman of vah kerrath but not sure if im ever gonna get one of those. id like to have gorget, plus girdle of earthen stability, plus raex bracer x 2 plus puresteel mantle, think that would give me best hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kodoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was in the same position and went for the Gorget.  Aside from AHR Neck, there really aren't many terribly great upgrades.  The upgrades you could make to the other slots are better than the upgrades you could make to the Neck slot, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gorget, bracer, ring, shoulder, belt, in that order would be my thinking.  Also, don't neglect to look at http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28937 which is by far the most under-rated haste piece till time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Scalecracker if you can get ahold of one is a pretty difficult to replace 41% haste/range slot, 33ac and 100hp as well along with a few minor stats.  With our incite line a bow is no longer necessary so it doesn't bother most to use range for something other then a bow.<br />
<br />
As far as the rest of those listed, I personally went for a bracer, I had a Silver Bracelet of Speed from Doz for the longest time, and Earth bracer was about to rot basically so I went ahead and upgraded to it, it is the only EP haste item I would take even though it wasn't really a massive upgrade.<br />
 <br />
Moss mantle is the other decent choice, I would not suggest relying on recieving a puresteel mantle, it's both rare and Air is supremely retarded so most hate raiding it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would say that if your guild kills TXD, get a Breastplate of Speed - but you've already aug'ed your Kizraks BP, so the bracer / shoulder slots are in bigger need of an upgrade.<br />
Bracers of Earthen Energy is a good choice, with flowing moss mantle also being a good choice - unless you are counting on alot of farming in Air to get the Puresteel Mantle.<br />
If at all possible for you, pick up a Talisman of Vah Kerrath. Asides from good ac and good hp, it also has a very nice effect.</div></div><hr />
