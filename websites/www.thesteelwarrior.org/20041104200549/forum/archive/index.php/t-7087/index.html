<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If your a guildleader, and want a massive boost in raid leader aa' (health3/mana3/delegate main assist etc..)  AE hate's fury or crypt of nadox, as they are hot spots and the mobs have shitty hp but the exp is through the roof when your ae'ing it all. Just gather a huge train ( fear or blind 2 mobs in different directions and let them do the pulling for you, then just run circles for 5 minutes to accumulate mobs, then drag them all to torigan zoneline to color cloud/pbae them.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">and do that with a 18ppl raid min, right ? :)<br />
Overcrowded zone in hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My favorite Raid Leader AAs - <br />
<br />
1)  Raid Health (+100hp)<br />
2)  MA Assignment<br />
3)  Target's Target<br />
<br />
For those who haven't experienced it yet, Target's Target is fucking COOL.  It adds a second target window that allows you to see the health status of the Target's Target.  So, for instance, if you're fighting a boss mob, the Target's Target will show the MT's health.  This is fucking NICE for tanks to watch the tank line up.  After all, sometimes there is hesitation because you're not always sure if the tank died or not.  If you're a cleric, you can target a mob and it'll show you who they're beating on.  Basically, it's clicky ASSIST, since after all, you can target the target's target through the window (say that ten times fast).<br />
<br />
It's also badass because you can click on a mob and see if it's being tanked or not.  This is ESPECIALLY useful when you're in a zone like Vex Thal where 6-8 mobs in camp is the norm.  Instead of playing agro games with other tanks unknowingly, you can simply click a mob, see who's tanking it, and if it's beating on a caster, you can have at it.  If it already has a knight/warrior targetted, you can move to the next mob and see if it's being tanked or not.<br />
<br />
It's badass and the moment my guild leader trained it, it made big pulls 100x smoother.  Tanks fighting over mobs is now nonexistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Health of Targets target is the best raid / group AA.<br />
<br />
would get before all other raid/group AA's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone else notice this bug?  I had leadership exp on and was the leader of the raid, yet I never recieved any raid leadership exp.  Only thing I ever saw was the standard &quot;You've gained raid experience!&quot; message, never anything about the leadership exp.<br />
<br />
When we were all done with the raid and dropped down to a single group, I immediately started getting the two exp messages as usual, party and group leadership exp messages.  But never anything while I was the leader of the raid.  Is there a limit to how small the raid can be?  This was only 2 groups together in a /raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
18 ppl in raid minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Being group leader and raid leader can make it buggy sometimes. Make someone else group leader during the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">18 ppl in raid minimum.<br />
<br />
Ah, that's it right there.  We only had 12 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">about wich ones to get, i went with Target's Target 1st, MA 2nd, and i really think those are the best ones.<br />
Others can be usefull, but those 2 really helps a lot.<br />
<br />
HoTT &gt;&gt;&gt; MA &gt;&gt; others</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">mark npc is pretty good, lets you basically mark a mob thats coming, so you can say &quot; mez the marked one &quot; or &quot; kill the unmarked &quot; etc... sorta like delegate main assist, except for the mark you make stays on the mob instead of whatever you have targetted at the current moment.</div></div><hr />
