<br />
A.  Have the replacement girl friend send an email to her explaining the new dynamics of the relationships involved.<br />
<br />
B.  Be a man, pick up the phone and call her. <br />
<br />
C.  Feign your death, have plastic surgery, wait a few weeks and then move in on the best friend.  <br />
<br />

Maybe I expected a bit too much, but having option A sprung on me this week has made me a wee bit bitter towards men. <br />

That is unfuckingacceptable that your best friend would (a) immediately date an ex, even before he was an ex and (b) would e-mail you about it.  Both are immature little wankers.  OH! I change my mind:<br />

E.  Date a real man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ending a relationship pretty much always hurts someone - no need to make it worse by being a jackass about it like your ex did.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it sucks now, but if someone would handle ending a relationship that way, you're better off without them.</div></div><hr />

I dealt with the same thing all through highschool.  Seems like all the girls have to get shit on at least 3 dozen times by the &quot;tough/cool-guys&quot;, then attend 15 months of therapy before they finally realize that maybe they are better off with a nice guy.<br />
<br />
You are better off without that jerk, Ceny, and better off without that supposed friend.  Even if it seems like its bad right now, its really better you found out what kind of people that they are sooner rather than later.  Just take at least a few weeks to be alone, and reflect upon the traits these two individuals had that should have lead you to believe them to be capable of such acts, so you may more easily avoid such people in the future.<br />
<br />
In the future, you might want to try and give the nice guys a bit more of a chance.  Sure, they might not have the cool car, or the tuff tatoos, but when they actually listen when you talk, and treat you like a queen, you will likely be far happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Best way to dump your girlfriend <br />

I find that just dumping her in a 6 foot deep hole and cover with dirt works just fine. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats quite funny actually , because imo breakin up over the phone is wimping out.<br />
<br />
If you really want to be a man you will meet her , tell her she is a wonderful person , but that u dont feel your compatible and its only fair to you both to end it ,and move on. Im sure most of ya dont care much but its a nice thing to leave off without damageing her confidence.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ceny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">To be a bit fair, we live some hours apart; so the phone option would have been acceptable to me.  However, and much more damning, just the week prior to the emailing he passed on a chance to meet with me for lunch, giving me a total line about having to go in for training (doesnt have the job yet even today)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Here's how I broke up with my girl friend of 3 years, on Valentine's day of all days.<br />
<br />
Start<br />
1.  Fall madly inlove with girl.  Be amzaed you met someone so amazing.<br />
2.  Watch as girl you love changes over the course of 2.5 years, and realize that who she is now isn't who you want to be with.<br />
3.  Understand but still be upset when she goes to other people with her problems with you.<br />
4.  Live in denail for 6 monthes, thinking things will get better.<br />
5.  Buy anniversery flowers for her, and watch how she lets them die.<br />
6.  Turn the light on, realize that the relationship is dead.<br />
7.  Tell her that, and end it.<br />
8.  Then try to pretend that you are ok with her dating a new guy within a few weeks.<br />
9.  Your lease will end, and you can finally move on with your life.<br />
Finish<br />
<br />
This girl and I had an incredible relationship for 1.5 years, then over the next 1.5 years, things slid, but we were comfortable, and we just went through the motions.  Finally, on Valentine's Day, one of my favorite holidays, I realized just how full of shit I was, and what my feelings for her were.  I didn't know anymore.  So we broke up.<br />
<br />
The only way to break up with someone is by first, knowing what you feel.  Is it good, is it bad?  Do you even like them?  Second, do it in person.  Don't call, don't have someone else do it.  If you like their best friend, stay way from that shit with a 10 foot pole.  If you want to know how messed up that can get, just turn on day time tv and check it out.  While grossly over dramatized, the basic problems those made for TV couples have is pretty realistic.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other fish in the sea.  There is bound to be someone else out there that you can meet.  <br />
<br />
Sorry for the emotional post, but it felt good to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and i agree, nice guys DO finish last, just to prove a point one night, i was a total asshole at the club, guess what?  the girl i had targetted wanted to &quot;go somewhere quiet for a while... like her place&quot;<br />
<br />
I did that one night just to prove a point, felt like shit afterwards, apologized to her, explained what happened... she was not real happy, then she got even more unhappy she figured out that she was part of the problem /shrug<br />
<br />
so hang in there, what i have found to be the case is, if you are looking for &quot;the right one&quot; you will either be over critical, or blinded by your desire to be in a relationship, be happy being single, then, just culture friendships, if it happens, it happens, if not, you have friends to hang out with.<br />
<br />
And yes, where is he?  I have a clue-by-four i would like to introduce him to, possibly multiple times... most certainly to multiple locations of his person.  I find that if you start at the ankles...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Men dont suck for being assholes. Women have more respect for a man who is an asshole, rather than someone they can use as a doormat. Why are women attracted to that? It all goes back to primitive instincts - the 'asshole' is the one that will fight to protect his territory whereas the 'nice guy' is the one that gets his ass kicked by the alpha male. Deny it if you want, but that's human nature and women know it's true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now there's no doubt in the world that women are attracted to confidence, power and success ;)<br />

Spose our basic problem is that being a nice guy doesn't mean walking around showing off your bank roll, putting people in their places.<br />

I personally don't like to get in fights because I'm afraid I will hurt someone so badly, I will go to jail.  What can I say?  You pick a fight with someone you don't know, and you don't know what will come and jab your eyse out or worse?  I'm also not a prone to exploding in public, or public desplayes of anger, rudeness or attidtude.  I guess I'm kind of like a shallow pool.  I'm ok to swim in, just don't dive in and expect to not get hurt.<br />
<br />
The problem I see is that many girls are attracted to the &quot;pretty boys.'  You know the guys who shop out of the places like AE, A &amp; F, etc, and look like they model for them on the side.<br />
<br />
You know what?  Great for them!  The problem I have seen when my female friends (us nice guys have a number of them don't we?), date these pretty boys, they get their little hearts broken when the pretty boy cheats on them, or dumps them for someone else who more fits their &quot;style.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now take an average looking, nice guy, with a friendly smile =)<br />
<br />
Will he cheat on his girl?  You'd hope not.  Would he dump her if she didn't fit in with his style or his group of friends?  No.  Chances are the nice guy will treat his girl very well.  If nice guy happens to have a back bone, he will also stand up for her as well.<br />

I dont look for the pretty boys, actually looks dont mean much to me, what I look for is personality, how he treats his mom (okay, might not know that for a bit), humor and how he interacts with others.  I try to make myself fall slowly, giving myself time to make sure that he isnt one of those pretty boys that is all flash with no substance.  <br />
<br />
My ex-sweetie is a great guy, he treated me like a princess, listened to my thoughts (chuckled a bit at some of my misconceptions about how warriors and eq works and straightened me out), validated my feelings, and spent a lot of time making me a better warrior and tank than him ( and then never complained when i was tanking big mobs that he wanted to tank in his place).  <br />
<br />
But then he just screwed up.  Ripped my little heart out and stomped it a bit before handing it back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The female biological imperative is a bit more insidious: To propogate the genes of the &quot;strongest&quot; male. Of course they go for the &quot;confident&quot; guys, in nature, a shy male is a weak male and thus unfit to have his genes passed on to the next generation.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">One thing I've learned through time is don't let the opinions of others sway you too much.  Too many people are idiots and shouldn't be listened to.  Let your own moral compass guide you and if it seems that the situation calls for being asshole, be an asshole.  Otherwise, don't bother.  There is a time and a place for everything, even being a jerk.  The important thing is learning when it's the right thing to do and when it's the wrong thing to do.<br />
<br />
Many guys either do one or the other.  Either they're 100% asshole, or pretty close to it, or they're 100% nice guy, or pertty close to it.  It's better to mix it up and keep people guessing.  That way they aren't as likely to take you for granted when you're a nice guy.  Frankly, I think many women don't apperciate a guy who is too predictably nice.  They don't respect him.  They don't think he has passion, fire, confidence, whatever you want to call it.  A little arrogance, in moderation, isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I advocate treating people poorly.  But I do advocate giving as you get.  Someone behaves poorly to you, give it back to them.  If they behave well, return that also.   This turn the other cheek thing usually just ends up with you getting two sore cheeks.  And don't let the fact that someone might think less of you stop you.  If they were such good people to begin with, they wouldn't have put you in a position to have to be a jerk, would they?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Well said Glatius.  Being a big ogre in RL,  I've always been too nice because I didnt want people to be afraid of me, and didnt want to hurt anyone. (physically or emotionally)  As I have grown older, I've realized that if someone doesnt treat me with respect, then I am under no obligation to treat them respectfully.  If I am treated poorly, I respond in kind.  Basically, I'm as nice as to people as they allow me to be.  It's worked pretty well so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I'd have to agree with Glatius.<br />
<br />
I do think most men suck, not because they are men, but because they are human.  Human nature, both in men and women, is the cause of a lot of pain.<br />
<br />
For a man to end a relationship in that manner, to me shows that he is not a man, but a child.  Though he may have been nice in the past, his true child was revealed with his actions.<br />
<br />
There are strong men out there though, who can overcome human nature and act mature.  Guys who are confident, and strong, but not a complete asshole.  I hope that when you are ready, that you find a man like that, who is not a child, but a mature man, who can fight what needs to be fought, avoid what is best to avoid, love what is worth loving, and be what you need him to be.<br />

I personally miss being in a relationship.  But the pain of ending one is still fresh on my mind regretfully, even though it happened a good while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">You all have great points and maybe when I said most men aren't worth the skin they are made of, it was kind of harsh, but then again you don't live my life. So don't judge it :)<br />
<br />
Staying single doesn't mean I'm lonely I have more friends and passions now that my life is not dedicated to making someone else happy in thier life. I wasn't recommending being single for everyone. Some people need someone else to make them happy. Me on the other hand, I can be happy all by myself.<br />
<br />
Life is full of choices and who you choose to spend your time with is a big part of living good and being happy. I just haven't found anyone who I can see making my life more fulfilled then it is now and I choose not to jump into a relationship for the sake of companionship because that simpley would not make sense to me and my logic.<br />
<br />
After 6 years in a serious relationship I don't feel like I'm talking out of my ass on this situation, but I do think I take a more cynical view on love then most of you do. <br />
<br />
Ceny I stick with my opinion from before. Which was......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I'm maddeningly cynical, especially when it comes to love.

<br />
Though I miss being in a relationship, the last one has also made me fairly cynical, and I don't see myself getting into another one for a while most likely.  I guess I miss how I felt before learning the burn =p<br />
<br />
And personally, I agree with the part about most men not being worth the skin they are made of heh, and I'm a man =p<br />

It's a shame you have such a low opinion of your own gender, Hussar, because it's not true. Humor me, if you would - next time you're watching television, or listening to the radio, or whatever - pay attention to how men are generally portrayed. You might find it interesting, if not insulting.</div></div><hr />

Actually, most of us are. Any female that thinks like that probably wont have much luck finding a good man because you already are looking for faults. And as a man, I would walk away as soon as I heard a comment like that fly out of your mouth and not waste my time.<br />

<br />
however if a female makes a comment about people of the male persuasion, there is NO retaliation expected, and if it is retaliated, then that is used as ammunition for justifying the original comment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I personally don't give a flying monkey about what any of you think of my opinion on any species. Male/female/human/animal, mineral, or vegitable. None of my opinions will matter in any of your lives in the long run so get over it. I apologized if i had offended any of you but in reality i really don't care, because if a mild comment like that on a message board angers you that much your really not someone i want to try to make my friend anyways.<br />
<br />
In conclusion I base my &quot;opinions&quot; off of things i see and feel in person. So don't think that any ammount of silly deragotory B.S. on a message board from people i've never meet IRL is going to make me have a whole new perspective on life :)<br />
<br />
The only people that are offended by something like this now infamous quote that you all have been throwing around is those who aren't secure enough to say &quot;Hey she said most men not all men and what makes me think that this in some way directly applies to me&quot; and by the way did i ever say women where worth the time that was took to make them?

Heh, I don't watch tv or listen to the radio, and I don't really care how shows that are designed to be humorous (not real) portray anyone.  Even if it's meant to be real, I still don't care, it's their opinion, which you seem unable to accept that people have their own, and just because it's different doesn't mean it's wrong.  I personally think that most humans, male and female, aren't worth much at all.<br />
<br />
You think men aren't that bad, fine, that's your opinion.  From my experience most are shit.  I have no respect for most men.  People like you who insult those with different opinions (like you did Raychael), and insist others opinions are wrong are the type of person who reinforce my current beliefs.  I have no problem with a woman who thinks most men aren't worth much at all.  To me it shows they actually looked at the world, instead of getting defensive thinking that it just might pertain to them.<br />

<br />
I fail to see where I insulted anybody. I'm stating my opinion, which differs from yours - and probably the majority of Americans these days. <br />
<br />
Men are constantly portrayed badly in the media. Not only in sitcoms (where they are generally portrayed as witless morons constantly manipulated by the women in their lives), but in commercials or dramas they are shown as either the same bumbling fools or as violent predators, two-timers, or flawed heroes when they are cast as the good guy.<br />
<br />
While I have no issue with the flawed hero thing, because nobody is perfect - most men are not idiots, or violent predators, or two-timers. In fact, statistally, women cheat on their mates more than men do and more men hold degrees in higher education than women. Yes, more men commit violent crimes than women, but the percentage of violent offenders to the general populace is quite small.<br />
<br />
The only people that are offended by something like this now infamous quote that you all have been throwing around is those who aren't secure enough to say &quot;Hey she said most men not all men and what makes me think that this in some way directly applies to me&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, I responded because you made an inaccurate generalization about men. I'm quite secure with myself.<br />
<br />
however if a female makes a comment about people of the male persuasion, there is NO retaliation expected, and if it is retaliated, then that is used as ammunition for justifying the original comment?<br />
<br />
Precisely. If I had stated most women are bitches there'd be a major flamefest. Of course, in the present context of this conversation you will undoubtedly deny that and agree with me because it supports your argument.<br />
<br />
And isnt it interesting how I'm being called insecure and proving how 'shitty' men are because I'm defending my gender. Turn the situation around in your mind - if Raychael was a poster named Ralph saying all women suck, and I was a poster named Sally defending women - who would you be flaming?</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty silly rebuttal. Can you prove that most men are 'not worth their skin'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Her own experience perhaps leads her to that conclusion and you did make a personal attack against her earlier Sturgis.  You implied that if she has that view then she is damaged goods you wouldn't touch with a barge pole (in essence). <br />
<br />
That was unneccessary wether you agree with her viewpoint or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">That's funny, because it wasnt an attack at all and she apparently didnt take it that way either. If you go back and look at her next response after I made that post she didnt seem offended. It wasnt until I responded to Hussar's post that they both began flaming me. But, hey, I'm just a guy so I must be in the wrong, right?</div></div><hr />

It's called hypocrisy. <br />

It stems from the human desire to inflict suffering upon evil ( read as: undesirable to a culture.  The culture in this case being the politically correct movements~) people/things.</div></div><hr />

I think this is to a wide extent due to growing up in schools where teachers are often ~55 year old females who used to be active in the femminist movement of the late 60s/early 70s. At least that's what it's like in Denmark :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Philomath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">&quot;In the future, you might want to try and give the nice guys a bit more of a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
OMG so many wusses so little time.<br />
<br />
&quot;The nice guys don't get anything until a girl's been shit on a million times. Doesn't just suck for us, sucks for the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Poor girl, good thing most are used to playing the victim / martyr.  They should bear no personal responsibility for the relationships they get in after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being an asshole is all relative. A bystander may think you're an asshole for telling your girlfriend to shut the hell up, but maybe the girlfriend really needs to shut the hell up. &quot;<br />
<br />
BINGO!  Ding Ding Ding you win a prize.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not the asshole-ness getting the attraction, it's the confidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
BINGO!  Some one in this thread with a clue!<br />
<br />
&quot;but only if they're using petty insults like &quot;Haha, what a fuckin' pussy! He won't even figh! hahaha!&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Where the hell have you been hanging out where this is common, find some new spots...<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss a ot of things about a relationship: the passion, the comfort, knowing that someone actually gives a damn about you. &quot;<br />
<br />
The most important thing in any relationship; more important than relative looks; more important than finding that special 'spot' with your tongue; more important that showing up to her families dinner party; is to...here is the secret, Give a crap about how her day went, even if your was crappy.  <br />
<br />
The second most important thing 'for a male' in most relationships is to have a freaking backbone and show some confidence.  I am not talking about smacking her in the lip if she mouths off.  I am talking about taking some stinking initiative.  Relationships get stale, this touchy feely crap only goes so far.  No means NO!  This is an absolute, but most women want to be swept off there feet.  This means taking some blind initiative for intimacy.  There is nothing LESS passionate than some wuss guy who is trying to approach the subject delicately.  She will tell you if she does not want to be intimate.  So drag her into the laundry room if the mood takes you.<br />
<br />
I hate all these spineless, self proclaimed 'nice guys' who have the no-confidence, sit in bars watching the 'assholes' get the girls, then comforting the girl when she gets dumped after being 'tagged'.  So what if you don't think you look like a 10.  So what if you only have a 4 inch...pinky.  So what if the girl is out of your league by your estimation.  <br />
<br />
Does this mean you should go out and try to 'score' every hot chick you can?  Hell no.  However meeting the girl is half the battle.  This is also not one sided.  Believe it or not...here is another secret...Girls get horny too.  If you are not meeting the girls needs then guess what, she is on to the next asshole.  Just because you pick up a girl does not mean you have to 'tag' her.  However don’t be fooling into thinking that if you 'pick up' a girl take her to the park or whatever freaking romantic spot you like then NOT make a move will somehow will translate into you caring about her and her thinking that much more about you.  If you are in that spot and the mood is right take some initiative.  <br />
<br />
There is no bigger looser than the 'self proclaimed' nice guy that has multiple girls as 'friend' who he is attracted to and 'hopes' someday she will recognize him as a romantic target.  Makes me frigging sick to my stomach.  It is ok to have a girl as just a friend, if she is someone you are attracted to in that way, freaking take some initiative.  &quot;Ohh but I am worried that she will reject me and ruin our friendship&quot;...  Bull-ish.  If it does then it was not a real friendship anyhow.  It is better to move on and stop rubbing one out to the picture or you and her at Disneyland by 'goofey'.<br />
<br />
So what have we learned?<br />
You don’t have to be an asshole, but you cant be a pu$$y.<br />
Care how the crap her day was.<br />
NOT scoring does NOT mean you have respect for her.<br />
Respect is caring WTF she thinks.<br />
Grabbing her arse is NOT disrespectful (unless in front of her parents).<br />
Societal norms are hard to break, so take some freaking imitative.<br />
Initiative in meeting.<br />
Initiative in intimacy.<br />
If the mood takes you, don't 'ask for permission' to be intimate.  Initiate intimacy and STOP if she says so.<br />
<br />
Oh and the most important thing of all, be faithful.  If you find yourself being attracted to another girl, don’t just go out and bang her.  If you must go bang the new girl, break up with your current one.  There is NOTHING worse than a philanderer.  You have no respect for yourself or for you committed other, you are just a sick piece of trash.  Have the freaking balls to break up before pursuing something else.  If you don’t want to be faithful then don’t commit, just go sowing your wild oats or whatever the crap you think you have to do.  There is no better intimacy then in a committed relationship where intimacy can happen spontaneously and you care for each other.<br />
<br />
Always dump someone in person.  If you are away from them and you meet ‘someone else’ who is so amazing etc…  Keep your pinky in your pants until you have the time to see your committed other to break up.  If this is too much of a strain to the new person when WTF type of relationship can you expect from that.<br />
<br />
Ok enough said, stop being wusses and victims.</div></div><hr />
