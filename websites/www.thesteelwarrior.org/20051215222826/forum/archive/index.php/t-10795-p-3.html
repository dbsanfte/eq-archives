I have my key bound to E since its right next to my forward finger. Overpower pops I press E click overpower I get the Overpower hit and one Swing of my 2h virtually simultaneously then hit my E key again and I'm back to Dual Wield. It all happens very fast takes no bag opening item switching manually.<br />
<br />
EDIT- http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=208 is the link i got it from.<br />
<br />
<br />
After I finish up MS, cruelty 5, I'm gonna pick up anticipation and toughness and then after that, I dunno. Toughness is really all you need outta that tree. <br />
<br />
Improved Bloodrage and Last Stand are both very beneficial. Just my opinion, but I find the need to pop Bloodrage in PvP alot. Someone gets and Early Root/Sheep and I need to intercept quick but didn't have time to get enough rage I'll pop BR then I can close the gap in a hurry without taking a couple hundred points of dmg. Last Stand is very useful in those times when you find yourself tanking a particularly tough mob and need the health boost or in those close PvP battles. Seems like a decent boost for only 3 Talent points.</div></div><hr />

If I'm wrong and those 3 points could be spent better tell me where as it seems your MS build is similar to mine, and if you have some idea of where 3 points could be spent better then why don't you share your opinion so I can type back about how I could care less about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zulu</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like you can use some advice on your skills too pal.<br />
<br />
In defensive stance, you're not making anyone pay for ignoring you.  You cripple your DPS and expect them to pay attention to you?  Good luck with that.<br />
<br />
And TM is pretty much as good as the talents get.  Some people either can't see it, don't see it, or refuse to see it, but that doens't make them right.<br />
<br />
Im not really crippeling my dps - im going battle stance until he choose to fight me and then i switch to defensive to make him fight more for a long time..<br />
<br />
Besides the stun diminisng turn thingy..here is a tip: You will have enough rage to keep the guy hamstringed all the time - i charge for one reason alone - generate more rage early in the fight. The diminisng return &quot;bug&quot; as i call it wont be affected if you can keep the hamstring on allmost all the time...<br />
So again i say some warriors here are not really playing to theyre optimal - and the ones saying protection specced warriors suck in xp - hah.. group with some good dps giver like rogue that cant stand too much pain and together you are dynamite.<br />
I agree protection specced warriors suck at soloing but i dont do that often anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you talking about hamstring and stun immunity together for? Snares are not subject to diminishing returns, stuns, fear, mes, charms are. That's another arguement tho, as they should be subject much to the same bs we have to deal with on stuns while root / snare can be chain cast all day long with no recourse.<br />
<br />
I don't see anyone saying protection is the most horrible thing for pve, I will stand by it for my pvp opinion tho. PvE protection is an ok spec, but it's when you compare the gains of said talent spec you realize it is nowhere near as effective a boost to your tanking ability as ms / fury is to your offensive output. This is where the problem lies in PvE, and all I want to happen is to have the tree given the attention and corrections it deserves.<br />
<br />
Pvp is a completely different thing tho, and as stated above if you're protection spec'd you pretty much are just taking up space in the current system. Sure once and a while you may actually land that full 5 second stun, or disarm that retarded melee for 13 seconds - but those times are few and far between. Justifying 31+ point investment when the gains for over 20 are near nil.. that's the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bottom 4 talents really need work.<br />
<br />
Imp disarm should incur some type of penalty, perhalps stat reducing in nature. So what if they're not using a sword, still a hard hit or such to the arm / hand should cause whatever is attacking you to have some reaction other then &quot;I have no weapon, /laugh at you&quot;. -2% critical hit chance or like -2% hit rate per rank seems a perfect way to do this.<br />
<br />
Imp shield bash should boost the damage portion of shield bash as well as retain the silence component. Somehow I don't think a 25/50% rank 1/2 damage boost is all too overpowering considering it hits for like 40 on anything worthwhile anyway. <br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs to be made instant, up the rage cost by 5 if really needed or just remove the attack effect entirely. 45 second cooldown will not allow this to be the poor man's MS, I don't see it encroaching upon that realm at all. <br />
<br />
Shield discipline needs to be made innate, have it's agro modifier reduced some and limit it's bash damage enhancement reduced to give no more total then it currently does with said improved shield bash I stated above. Keep the increased damage block modifier to like 30% or so. Tada, shield disc will finally be worthy of it's 31 point cost.<br />
<br />
Unless you've really played the full gauntlet (barring end raids) it's hard to understand just how much of an impact 31+ protection makes on someones character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point was you dont need stuns at all to be a good pvp tank with protection build - just switch to battle stance and hamstring - then if he hits you switch to def stance and let him smach you for 1000 years - if he ignores you then you are doing dmg alle the time while he is hopelessly chasing other people with less movement speed... Now tell me how that isnt usefull in pvp??<br />
<br />
Edit: let me add one more thing - I have an attitude that any type of warrior can work if you learn the strenght and weaknesses of him good enough and truly try to master your style. I could come up with more examples of how protection warriors can shine in pvp but I can also come up with examples how fury warriors will really outshine a protection warrior. So I will really conclude with the fact that you can play the style you want as long as you learn its strenghts.</div></div><hr />

Sounds great for one on one...though you as a plate class will typically be the last engaged anyway.  If youre looking to be a one man snare factory, I guess your fine.<br />

GL with that.<br />

<br />
Every single ability in the protection line is useful in PvP.  Diminishing returns on stuns?  Funny how warriors can think rogue and pally stuns are useful, but ours suck due to diminishing returns.  Silence bash?  Come on, preventing a mage from pouring out dps and a priest from healing isn't useful?  Stunning casters isn't useful in PvP?  Disarm is worthless because some people use weapon chains?  Well if they are using weapon chains in PvP then their dps is lowered, how many rogues gimp their dps?  So what if they run around until it wears off, it then takes them out of the fight.  Utterly decimating a targets armor isn't useful?  Being able to absorb damage isn't useful in PvP?  Come on, do you guys actually go into PvP and find that everyone ignores you because you are a warrior?  I don't get ignored.  I step up first, people target me, and many aren't smart enough to target someone else that is easier to take out after everyone else steps up.  If I need to go dps, I swap in two 40dps 1H weapons with a 10% dmg bonus on each.  Sure, my dps isn't as good, but it isn't ass either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues can kill you in the time you're stunned, warriors can't.<br />
<br />
Pallies can heal themsalves to full in the time you're stunned, warrior's can't.<br />
<br />
Silence bash? Come on, preventing a mage from pouring out dps and a priest from healing isn't useful? <br />
<br />
3 seconds of silence out of every 12, on one caster. Not really awe inspiring to me.<br />
<br />
Come on, do you guys actually go into PvP and find that everyone ignores you because you are a warrior? <br />
<br />
The intelligent people do, yes.  As they should.  There's a reason why PvE encounters are very easy...the mobs aren't smart enough to take out the support classes first.   Your ability to absorb damage is lowered drastically when everyone who can heal you is dead.<br />
<br />
people target me, and many aren't smart enough to target someone else that is easier to take out after everyone else steps up. <br />
<br />
Like I've said a hundred times,  basing your PvP strategy on people who aren't intelligent doesn't mean anything.  I've seen people do some goddamned retarded things in PvP...it doesn't mean I'm doing something right, it means I'm defeating someone who's not as experienced with the game or gets nervous or whatever.  The people who give you problems and destroy your preconcieved notions of what SHOULD work, are the people who do have experience, and aren't getting nervous.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just something I was thinking about when considering a respec to arms<br />
<br />
Crit increase by 1% from weapon spec and cruelty is 1% average increase in dps without other talents to boost crit damage.<br />
<br />
Lets say a warrior has these dps talents that stack so nicely<br />
Cruelty 5/5<br />
Deep Wounds 3/3<br />
Impale 2/2<br />
Two-Handed Weapon Specialization 5/5<br />
Axe Specialization 5/5<br />
for a total of 20 talent points.<br />
<br />
first add the average dps increase from 2h spec<br />
dps == 1.05 of normal dps<br />
<br />
multiply that by average dps increase from crit % boosters taking into account impale's boost of %20 to crit damage<br />
1.05*(1+0.1*0.2) == 1.071<br />
<br />
then assume that the warrior has a fairly nice crit rate of 25% and add the dps boost from implale that comes from the 15% crits that dont come from crit % boosting talents remembering to take into account the 5% dps boost of 2h spec<br />
1.05*(1+0.15*0.2) == 1.0815<br />
<br />
now assume that deep wounds 3/3 will do between 20% and 60% of its weapon damage each time it lands (25% of all hits)<br />
1.05*(1+0.25*0.2) == 1.1025 (on the lower end)<br />
1.05*(1+0.25*0.6) == 1.2075 (on the upper end)<br />
<br />
so from 20 tallent points we get<br />
.05+.071+.0815+.1025 == .305 (on the lower end)<br />
.05+.071+.0815+.2075 == .41 (on the upper end)<br />
<br />
thats from 1.525% to 2.05% dps increase per point (not to bad at all)<br />
<br />
and thats just the increase from 20 points<br />
<br />
on the other hand a prot speced warrior can get 1h spec for 2% dps boost per point. this seems compareable to the 1.525% to 2.05% dps boost per point seeing as 1 handers offer a little less dps to be boosted than 2 handers do. <br />
<br />
any corrections or thoughts?<br />
<br />
this may all look like a huge miscalculation later because Im posting this after an all nighter and Im generally doing or saying stupid things at this point.</div></div><hr />
