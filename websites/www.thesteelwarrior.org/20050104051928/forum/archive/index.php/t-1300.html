<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksign</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard it said, over and over that Haste works from level 1.<br />
<br />
This also jives with most &quot;worn&quot; effects like fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
However, my EQ Companion parses from my lowb, don't show any haste whatsoever, its solidly non-hasted.<br />
<br />
Dark here, is a level 8 Warrior, with a COF and a frosty.<br />
<br />
Despite being super twinked, I am going relatively slow and grouping for social reasons -- taking it easy. I mention this to show that I have a pretty good sample (about 250) fights to use for the parse.<br />
<br />
Parsing 250 fights, EQ Companion shows a delay of 22, exactly that of the Frosty. A Frosty with CoF should be around 16. There is no way the test is off by 6 delay, so I don't think its being hasted.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Everyone insists worn haste works from level 1, but my pretty large sample set doesn't agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who insits that haste works from level 1?<br />
<br />
If you look up a haste item on http://lucy.fnord.net<br />
<br />
It definately shows a level requirement for the effect.<br />
<br />
This has always been my experience. My SCHW didn't start working til level 21.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksign</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just like this <br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=2735<br />
<br />
doesnt work at level 1?<br />
<br />
Or this<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=4583</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know.<br />
<br />
Never used those.<br />
<br />
However I have used a haste item, and I can verify that I have never seen any effect from them. I had the SCHW from level 1. (Took em from my Monk)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksign</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, both of those items are examples of worn effects that work at level 1, despite Lucy giving them an effect level number.<br />
<br />
Most people think that &quot;worn&quot; effects all work at level 1, because the system doesnt seem to have the capactity to check for level of a spell when you equip something, only whether you can wear it at all (required) or what the stats are (rec level), or when you cast it (like proccing weapon or clickies), NOT worn things.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the haste of an item appears to be item effect level +1, which should be independant of the pc's level.<br />
<br />
Either Dark is to low a level and haste has a special worn level check,  there is some sort of haste capping going on or my data/parser are wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mebbe it is a &quot;Worn&quot; Haste cap then.... Mebbe the haste cap on a level 21 char is 22% haste which would make the SCHW work when you hit 21 and not before. (In other words, an all or nothing type cap)<br />
<br />
That would be like a special &quot;cap&quot; check on worn items that you were referring to.<br />
<br />
I don't think your parser is wrong. 250+ fights all saying the same delay... when the delay matches the weapon you are using...<br />
Seems to be strong evidence.</div></div><hr />

FBSS at level 21 )<br />
<br />
<br />
'Sides haste is it's own beast when it comes to gear effects, or even spell effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At level 8, you'll barely notice it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those numbers are an artifact of the way Lucy reports worn haste.  They have nothing to do with actual worn haste in the game. (Or all worn haste items would have identical haste)</div></div><hr />
