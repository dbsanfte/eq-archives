<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dravok</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quit EQ awhile back and once played a 62 SK that had some pretty nice gear.  I've been thinking of returning to EQ but I was wondering if its still a good game for someone like me.  I imagine I can only put about 10 maybe 15 hours a week into it.  I also imagine I will never be in a high end guild, see many advance zones, or acquire uber gear.  I was also looking for suggestion on classes that are more toward a casual players like I will probably be.  I have had thought of a warrior, a SK again, or even a rogue but I thought I would ask to see if there are other classes that match my need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even with a warrior you can still enjoy your time in EQ,  with the introduction of LDON it allows players to earn points towards pretty decent gear.  <br />
<br />
But I would suggest a soloing character such as a Necromancer or a beastlord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta bide time till CoH and WoW =/</div></div><hr />

if you know people that will group with you on a consistant basis then decide amongst yourselves the best/most fun classes that can still get things done.</div></div><hr />

There are a handful of really good things coming soon like World of Warcraft, City of Heroes etc, no sense getting wrapped up in the pile of old junk that is EQ. <br />
<br />
Play Xbox or something, don't give SOE a reason to count your money.<br />
<br />
Just one man's opinion of what he would do in your situation.</div></div><hr />
