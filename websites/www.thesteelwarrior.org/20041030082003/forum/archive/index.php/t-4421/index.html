<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nimbex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a LVL 37 HFL WAR and I have a Swiftblade of Zek. I really want to get a CHOS, but It seems like that would not fit well with the SBOZ, because I think I would put the CHOS in my secondary nad the SBOZ in my primary. Should I sell the SBOZ and get something else? Or shoulf I keep it and put it in primary, with CHOS in secondary? Get that? LOL. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Stick with the obviously superior 11/18 over the non-proccing, gimped stats, gimped ratio hammer with a REC level.<br />
<br />
Until you meet the REC level of the hammer.<br />
<br />
At your level you shouldn't really be asking these questions.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Aggro is NOT a level 37 issue, heh. And your DPS will suffer by equipping a weapon with a reccommended level that will decrease its stats since you are low level.</div></div><hr />

Copper Hammer of Striking procs at lvl 1. I watched a lvl 8 SK in ECommons using one lay waste to orc camps. Disgusting ain't it? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh. Understatement.<br />
<br />
I can't believe they'd allow that. Hah.<br />
<br />
Ah well, disregard much of what I said.<br />
<br />
I still think though, that at level 37, Copper Hammer of Striking is overkill. There just aren't that many aggro &quot;issues&quot; a level 37 encounters. At least not before they're level 38, 39, and probably 40 during that evening of play.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nothing in EQ is overkill these days... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Who gives a fuck if it's aggro overkill?  It's not like it procs enraging blow, it procs a DD spell, which is useful at any level.  Lay waste to an orc camp, solo easier with a big DD proc, or just plain more DPS for the XP grind.  This thing would be useful as soon as the recommended level makes the ratio worth using considering a 179dd proc. 8/20 or so is probably fine.  If it's 8/20, buy it.  The swiftblade of zek is a relic.  Get rid of it before it loses any more value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rec Level doesn't rffect the actual ratios of a weapon,it only effects the stats.<br />
<br />
So even though it may say it is 1 20 or whatever it still htis like it is 13 20.<br />
<br />
If you want to try this just go grab one of those 2 handers from poj for 100 pp in the bazaar and throw it on a lvl 1 war and watch him hit for max capped with it almost every swing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Who gives a fuck if it's aggro overkill?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because it's a level 37 person asking questions about aggro concerns that he just could NOT possibly have.<br />
<br />
It's an exercise in futility.<br />
<br />
It's like watching a level 37 monk trying to decide between TStaff and Staff of Flowing Water when BOTH are garbage at that level.</div></div><hr />
