<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terminator24h</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure where this post belongs because it pertains to equipment, faction, and questing, but I will post it here because it seems this is the most popular section of the boards :D<br />
<br />
I was raiding NToV for Vulak earlier today and I got the Ancient Tarnished Greaves that dropped off the trash.  These can be turned into a giant in Kael along with 3 gems for Warlord's Greaves.  This brings me to my first question: will these be a big enough upgrade over Blood Runed Greaves to justify the extensive faction farming that I will have to do to be able to do the turn in? I'm sorry that I can't provide links - I'm not really adept enough with the forum system to do it quickly.<br />
<br />
My other question is, if I do decide that it's a good enough upgrade to do the faction, what is the quickest way to get Giant faction?  I'm currently max ally to Dwarves, KoS to giants.  Another important factor is that our guild will be clearing AoW and such often pretty soon so I'm going to go back to max-KoS shortly after doing the turn-in :p.<br />
<br />
So, to make a long question short, is it worth the time to build faction from max KoS to ally just to quest the Warlord's Greaves as an upgrade over Blood Runed Greaves?<br />

For LDoNs what I do is take a pair of wrestling kneepads, cut the pad part out and duct tape it to my forehead. That way when I fall asleep and my head bangs down on the desk, I don't get a big bruise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with LDoN.  Instead of the mind numbing faction farming, do LDoNs.  Will be better exp, much better upgrade, plus you'll have Takish maxed if not maxed already enabling you to buy Royal Attendant armor by using any LDoN points from any other theme.</div></div><hr />

Nothing to add to the thread, except that this cracked me up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teeo</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alisdahre How many LDoN's do you have to do to max out a camp or is it points. Have 47 Ruj and 2 boxing L Guk can be a pain. Hope to go Royal Attendant route too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its getting 1492 points to be able to buy all the gear there.  To max out the charm aug, you need ~75 wins at each camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're saying that when you get a certain number of wins in a theme, you can use points from other themes?</div></div><hr />

Once open for purchase you cna use any points earned anywhere to buy the items.</div></div><hr />
