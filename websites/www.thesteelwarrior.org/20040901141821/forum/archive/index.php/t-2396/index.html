<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KargadaOgre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK new to these boards, was told to come here to ask some advice.  I have the note to Kargek which along with the Spiroq Wingblade gives scabbard for EPIC.  I have weapons now which means I will no longer have any use for EPIC weapons.  <br />
<br />
My question is IF I decided to sell this on, what would be a fair price to ask for it considering you need Red Scale, Green Scale, Hand of Meastro and more to get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jesus its been a long time since I did my epic.  I'm a fucking lazy ass warrior so I didn't bother looking this shit up:  but I thought the Spiroc Blade needs to be combined with the Queen's Blade in the scabbard in order to ultimately get the epic.  I.e., Spiroc Blade is not MQable. <br />
<br />
In any event, Hi, there is an identical thread to this one thread up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're thinking of the ancient blade from the sarnak queen. It isnt MQ'able because you have to combine it with the ancient sword blade, and both hilts.  Every other piece of the epic, including the wingblade, is MQ'able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess it would depend on your server.<br />
Do some price checks on the Green and Red Dragon Scale on your server.  Then add whatever it costs for a Maestro MQ.  Also note they changed PoH recently and this price may fluctuate depending on the difficulty of the mob now.  I'm not too sure how hard it is to get the hand anymore cuz I got mine in the old PoH where Maestro of Rancor / Hand of Maestro was done easily by 2 groups.<br />
<br />
On the Nameless Server the prices are as follows.<br />
Green Dragon Scales = 50-55k<br />
Red Dragon Scales = 10-15k<br />
Hand of Maestro MQ = 5-7k (old PoH price)<br />
<br />
So that would make it around 65-75k ballpark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would suspect that with easily-obtainable droga weapons, warriors are no longer as willing to spend a lot of cash on an epic.  Yes, having a bagged epic is an accomplishment...but not really if you are MQing it.  At least I'd think folks wouldn't pay more for their epic than they would for droga weapons (currently around 15k on my server).</div></div><hr />
