<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I just recently got blessed by some stranger with 30,000 pp :eek: .  I know this isn't much to many of the uber warrs, but to me, it's a helluva lot.  So much so that I've got no idea what to do with it!<br />
<br />
I've looked through Alakazam and other sites but I can't find the right thing to get with this money.  I'm a 15 level Barb warr.  I do know that I need to up my dex, as it's only at 70 right now, but I'm not sure if I should get a dex weapon or what?  I'm currently dual wielding with a barnacle encrusted axe and a gnoll hide lariat.<br />
<br />
In any case, thank you for the suggestions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm............A MAGELO would be very helpful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fools_Errend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, to be honest if you are a lvl 15 with no twinking....use this gift to help youon your way rather than becoming a super twink.<br />
<br />
I would suggest a full set of crusty (you can pick this up for a few hundred pp). and then maybe get a couple of good weapons that will last you a while... This would get you the maximum benifit in the long run. <br />
<br />
<br />
As to weapons, well CHoS and SoTB are within your price range and will last you almost your entire life. Alternatively a frosty is also very good. I would suggest getting a 2HS also. Try to snag anything that is dam = delay or better.<br />
<br />
Also, it would be a good idea to get some form of haste. There are quite a few options about these days...see what is available in your bazaar.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cuch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Reaver is a good 2hs weapon (dmg = delay) and it's not level dependent and was only about 5k on emarr last time I looked.<br />
<br />
For haste, Silver Chitin Hand Wraps are 22% with some stats and are relatively cheap (around 2 to 3k on emarr I think...been a few months since I've looked though.)<br />
<br />
CHoS and SoBS are nice and will last you a long time (I still use em at 62), but they cost 10 and 5k on emarr so that may be a bit much....although they would be sweet at your level.  :p <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, like someone else said...if you post a magelo you'll get much better responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dont SotB and CHoS have rec levels?</div></div><hr />

dont SotB and CHoS have rec levels?  <br />
<br />
Forgot about that...;) ...yep, they both have recommended levels of 50+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be sure u get a frosty (2-2.5k) they rock at low lvls and when they start proccing u will love it!<br />
<br />
Just look at some other magelos to look for nice items...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the advice guys.  I've heard if Magelo, but can anyone point me to a site that explains it in depth? I'll try to look one up in the meantime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Firstly, check out www.magelo.com and register your name/password, once you log in, the menu on the left should include a &quot;your characters&quot; button. Click this, add your warrior, and then under &quot;upgrade your character's equipment&quot; add in all your stuff.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not sure if the recent patch fixed it, but weapons with recommended levels are currently bugged, meaning if you are level 15, and a CHoS is displayed as a 3(13)/20, it will still behave as a 13/20. This only seems to work for regular melee, IE backstabs and other abilities treat the weapon as a 3/20, like they should.<br />
<br />
So unless the patch fixed it, feel free to grab a weapon with a rec level in the 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zilden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I sugest a Guard captians mallet and a Frostbringer for weaps. Get both blunt and slash skills up and no recomended lvl. Cobalt or Cultural armor would also be good for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK guys, I just did my Magelo, check it out here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=852480) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BTW, when you guys say Frosty, do you mean Frostreaver or Frostbringer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Frosty= Frostbringer.<br />
<br />
Another weapon you want to look into at level 20 is the Wurmslayer. It's a 25/40 1hs, primary only, and will out damage every other one handed weapon you can find until at least level 40. And at lower levels, it's generally easier to keep aggro in groups, so the high damaging wurmy will do more good than say a lamentation, or centi longsword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea, I think I'm going to go w/ Wurm and Lammy combo.  I believe Lammy has one of the best ratios for the price, also it's not a req or recco lvl weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At lvl 15 I dont think you should worrie about Agro much. But yeah Frosty would be nice and they are cheap, would allso add to the combo a Lammy or a Wurmy and for 2hs I would go with a  Crafted Velium Battle Axe which is 30/37 or Crafted Velium Claidmore 30/36 shouldnt be more then 5k-7k each. Crusty and Crafted for armor.. or I belive you can use some of the Acrylia plate armor which I used alot from 40 and up.<br />
<br />
Haste: Silver Chitin Hand Wraps, 1hb would probly be Guard Captin's Mallet for training 1hb, 2hb probly a Great Maul of Hatred (30/33 and some stats)<br />
<br />
Hp rings would get some Velium rings the 6/65hp rings to save you some cash for other stuff.. umm thats all I can think of right now :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just curious, but I'm wondering why I need to train all  my weapon skills?  I get the feeling that this is a flammable topic, but why can't I get by with just dual wielding 1hb and 1hs?</div></div><hr />

Just curious, but I'm wondering why I need to train all  my weapon skills?  I get the feeling that this is a flammable topic, but why can't I get by with just dual wielding 1hb and 1hs?  <br />
<br />
Hm. Ok well I'm not sure how the mechanics of 1handers vs 2handers works in the level 20-50 or so range. They've changed quite a few things since I was playing a melee of that level.<br />
<br />
In any case, there are quite a few reasons to have your 2h weapon skills maxed too. At higher up levels, 2handers will usually do significantly more damage than fairly equivalent 1handers (by equivalent I mean difficulty to obtain). 2handers are also nice to cut down ripostes, keeping aggro off you if you don't want it, and prevent you from killing yourself on a nasty damage shield.<br />
<br />
You also never know what the next nice warrior weapon will be (ie like CHoS/Sotb). It could be 2hb or 2hp. IMO you should keep your 1hs, 1hb, 2hs, and 2hb up. You can let piercing slack I suppose if you want, because there aren't many good piercers and the skill is easy to raise quick if you do happen to get a good piercer.<br />
<br />
Seriously though..... why limit youself to just 1hb/1hs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In the lower levels, you might not be able to keep your skills up and stuffs, but if you dualwield one of each, keeping 1H skills maxed isn't tough at later levels (40+) at all.<br />
<br />
Piercing can be raised real fast with some fine steel daggers, or something like it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, at level 55 there the Great Staff of Thunder which is an excellent aggro weapon and really, really cheap to get. Would suck not to have 2HB then, right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">what Taminy said is the truth.<br />
<br />
It's always good to know how to use all available weapons of each variety just because ( speaking from experience ) there will come a day when a weapon that is just too great to be true will end up in your hands; and when you got a low skill in that you'll end up wondering why you didn't train it.<br />
<br />
I think until 55 or so the 2H weapons will still be a little lower in total DPS as compared to DW ( dual wield ); but in situations it will be the most logical choice to use that other 2H weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm since you are on FV server, there are a probably a few more gear choices than on the other servers buyable.<br />
<br />
But just go to bazaar and search, put like 200 - 800 as price, warrior,  hp, then when you get a list (if you get more than 200 results change the price range) sort by hp and try to fill all your amor slots with the best HP / price ratio items you can buy for under 800 (try to save 20k for later levels)<br />
<br />
for weapons, well some got suggested already, might wanna do a search in bazaar and look for the ones with low delay and high damage, maybe in the 1 - 2k price range. <br />
<br />
later when you made level 30 you can check out bazaar again and change upgrade stuff with the cash you have left (hopefully still around 20k)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks for the advice guys.  I've got my 2HS weapon, a crafted claidhmore, and I'll be looking for that maul, but not many folks are selling them.  BTW, is there a way to hotkey weapons?  I'm just curious because I'd like to be able to switch weapons during the fight.  Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Straythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">open up your inventory and left click on your weapon icon and hold it.  You'll get a floating weapon slot.  Move that to your hotkey bank and left click.<br />
<br />
I keep my two weapon slots and a bag with my weapons next to it.  I can swap easily that way.  Since my warrior is a dwarf, I ended up swapping in a shield to bash in my offhand until lvl 55 when my kicks could stun with this setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>aeternum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmmm, it still won't let me equip the weap by hitting the corresponding hotkey button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You have to actually move the weapons to equip them. Simply clicking on them won't do it.  <br />
<br />
To change out a weapon click on the one your currently using which will put it on your cursor, then click on the hotkeyed weapon which should swap the other one to your cursor. Now place the new one in your melee slot and your all set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Norim the Stump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">yah, heh... we cant equip weapons like NWN =P  boo sony hehe</div></div><hr />
