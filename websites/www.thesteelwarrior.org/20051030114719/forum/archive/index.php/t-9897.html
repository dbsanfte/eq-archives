<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, I've been browsing this section of the forums for a while now, but up until yesterday I had been playing a warlock as my main, and gotten him to 17. However, after 4 years as a tank in EQ, I just cannot cope with the fact that my warlock has armor ranging from 15-30 armor whereas a similar level warrior has 100+ in each slot. So, I rolled a warrior last night and got to level 10 before I had to log. So far, I love it.<br />
<br />
However, I've yet to duo/group with anyone, and am concerned about how well I will be able to keep aggro when I do. My voidwalker pet on my warlock had an ability that generated aggro, and it spams it every time possible. As a result, I could stack 3 DOTs, a few nukes, and do more melee damage than the pet does, and still not get aggro unless the aggro spell gets resisted. <br />
<br />
I don't really see any warrior abilities that would do the same as the voidwalker spell. Are there any abilities that are similar to stun/debuff/hate/incite things in EQ, that are great for keeping aggro? I know relying on dps for aggro can't work that well, since warrior dps seems fairly low compared to rog/mag/warlock/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the quest at lvl 10 to unlock defensive stance. Under defensive stance you have some goodies like taunt and sunder to generate aggro.  There might be more but I mostly play battle stance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you get defensive stance, its easier to hold aggro.  I mainly use it when I am tanking in groups.  Here are the abilites I use for getting and keeping aggro:<br />
<br />
Demoralizing Shout - AE attack debuf, can chain cast.<br />
Sunder Armor - Armor debuf, can chain cast, our main aggro ability.  imo this is the WoW warriors incite<br />
Rend - DoT that generates threat and rage.  works very nice when applied to multiple mobs<br />
Revenge - a counter attack that is pretty good aggro.  Becomes available after you block (like the shield block ability ;-)<br />
Taunt - good old taunt.  Works like EQ taunt. 10 sec refresh.  gets resisted a lot when the mob is higher level.<br />
Disarm - just got this so I've not used it much, but its decent aggro against mobs that use weapons.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure how good the aggro is on stuns/interrupts but so far it seems decent.  So add Shield Bash to the above list if you use a shield (I do).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defensive stance is useless if you ever lose aggro.  I wouldn't use it with a pickup group.  Battle stance at least gives you other options to compensate for your group's lack of aggro management.  <br />
<br />
Sunder Armor appears to be the highest aggro thing we can do and is usable in Battle Stance as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This should be the norm in any game...but, as we all know, rarely is.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol yea no kiddin.  You can almost tell the new warriors from the warriors who played EQ (especially pre-incite) by how much bitching they do about aggro.  They want aggro lock and knights nerfed lmao.  Guess some things never change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I demoralize first on mutli mob pulls, then proceed to Sunder, and hamstring after that.  Sunder seems to have more aggro than anything else, and Hamstring isn't too terribly high, but I've seen mobs turn after a hamstring, so I toss it in anyway.  At the very least, the mob will walk slower away from me.<br />
<br />
Rend doesn't seem to do dick for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">defensive stance generates more threat.  Mouse over the stance button and it'll describe it a little.  My theory is that its probably somewhere between 15-20% more threat.  This is to counter the 10% less damage that you do because you are in defensive.  Now, add defiance, a talent that adds 15% threat when in defensive.  <br />
<br />
What it seems to me is sunder armors in defensive is one heck of alot more threat than sunder armor in battle stance.  If you hit taunt you are now dead even in threat with the rogue or mage....a single sunder would then propel you massively ahead of everyone else.   Often its enough for me to do this and then switch to another mob completely...first mob will stay on me long enough that'll it'll be dead before it switches.  You've also now been beating on a mob long enough that you'll keep it on the second as well.<br />
<br />
Taunt before you break sheep and open up with a sunder.  Blam, taunt is on you the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heleron</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to have any major problems holding aggro on Defensive stance.   Depending on the situation I normally charge in and then switch to defensive stance or just pull with my cross bow to get initial aggro and taunt/demoralize/revenge/shield bash.  Grant it, on elite fights I will switch back to battle to do some hamstring hits for those runners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Just started a warrior in WoW last week.  I noticed before coming ehre a Major difference when grouping when I was in defesnive stance.  Another Nicety is Bash ... Imagine .. a Bash that actually interrupts.  <br />
<br />
I am only lvl 18 right now, so My question is ... Dual weild or Sheild?   The Sheild's in WoW can be pretty bad ass.  Allready I have a shield that is +398 AC WITH stat's and a block rating of 6 .... I can't wait to see what the high end shield's are like.<br />
<br />
Another Question .... THunder Clap .. would it not generate nice aggro?  I mean a 10% slow with damage component SEEM's atleast like it would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">really it's a personal choice. dual wield is nice but it'll lower your overall accuracy by a bit, so you pretty much need a beastly offhander. also, when I tank in groups that kill mobs around my level, I always use a shield. always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It just matters group by group.<br />
<br />
It SEEMS like I get better aggro with a 2h weapon , so I use that when I'm having problems, but 90% of the time, I'm using a shield.<br />
<br />
The 1000+ AC I get from a shield &gt; Extra DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SabreOscar</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dual Wield imo is just for flash when Im not tanking in a group.  I played around with dual Wield while I was soloing and I found that the mobs dropped faster but the beating I took from missing the Armor and the stats from my shield just wasnt worth the down time (use bandage, eat food, etc.).  <br />
I killed more efectively with a nice 1h and shield then DW.  I also bring out the 2h just to keep my skill levels maxed.<br />
<br />
As for the original topic, getting agro off a priest or any other class for that matter is hard if you are in Battle Stance. Mocking Blow (or something like that) just doesnt grab enough aggro and has the chance of missing and the recast timer on it just blows.  If you are going to do alot of grouping the Defensive stance is the way to go for aggro.  Just my 2c</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been able to hold aggro very well with the Whirlwind Axe (warrior quest axe).  Its slow but it hits soooooo hard!  The damage range is like 103 to 154.  It hits hard in friggin defensive stance with the 10% dmg reduction.  Big hits = big aggro and BIG rage generation.  Once you got the rage its all sunder armour and demo shout.  But you gotta be in defensive stance if you wish to hold aggro.  Battle and Zerk stances suck for that (good for dmg though).<br />
<br />
I tend to use sword+board when I'm taking a beat down, other wise the Axe is in use.</div></div><hr />
