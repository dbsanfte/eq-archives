<br />
When on raid, I ussually keep agro better than when I am in groups.<br />
Currently my Guild is in Qvic/Inktu`ta, and I am Using EoE, and a GBoS(wtb Fleshbiter)<br />
<br />
When I group, I lose agro frequently to DPS classes, but, I never lose it on raids, unless its to a warrior with DB+EoE/Epic.<br />
<br />
Is there some reason for this?<br />
Only thing I could come up with is that my hate stays on top, while everyone elses changes at the bottom, but because of so much flipping of hate list, that the mob doesn't worry about anyone else but the tank?<br />

Would be cool if someone could explain.</div></div><hr />

=&gt; if no then it can be the answer : they don't now how to scale down their dps to stay under your hate generation because they are stupid or because they don't know you well enaugth to do it on the fly.<br />
<br />
2. do you use the same buff to increase their hate generation ?(remember that your swing hate is directly linked to your haste)<br />
=&gt; if no, this could explain the difference.<br />
<br />
3. maybe it's something else.<br />
<br />
4. it can be a cumulation of all the above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use EoE-GBoS both with Yak.<br />
Pretty much during a fight I bellow on inc, taunt, and go to work. Every time taunt pops up, i hit it to maintain top of agro, and I kick when it pops.<br />
I have EoA(15% hate mod), Ussually use Salik+Tribute haste+WUnshi.<br />
Stats are 410str,365sta,325agi,410dex,1900atk.<br />
<br />
I have WA3,Ingenuity3,CF2,Ambi, and TM3.<br />
<br />
I do the same thing on raid mobs, and group mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, yes, I only group with guildies, or people from guilds near my guilds level(Qvic+)</div></div><hr />

You could churn out mathematical equations and answer questions about game mechanics in multiple 4000 word theses.  You could slay gods singlehandedly, up hill... both ways!  You're not, however, going to hold agro against a Qvic/Inktu`ta level guild using Tier3 PoP one-groupable shit weaponry.  <br />
<br />
And no, this isn't a bash against your character.  If Darkblades and Fleshbiters simply aren't dropping, who are you going to blame?  No one is to blame but the luck of the RNG.<br />

In the meantime, work on your AAs bro. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, there are a few opints in favor of a raid force regarding aggro :<br />
<br />
1. More than one debuffer, thus they can spread the hate so it's not all on the same person.<br />
<br />
2. In a raid, people are more patient and don't mind waiting for 10 seconds before starting nuking like mad. Which means you have longer to build up aggro.<br />
<br />
3. People are often more &quot;awake&quot; during a big fight, and thus makes less mistakes.<br />
<br />
4. Squishies are more alert to the fact that they are just that. Especially those who can reduce their own hate (Evade, Feign Death, Concussion, Jolt .. etc.) and do so more than in an exp setting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhmm .. there's probably more, but I think you can figure it out yourself. :)<br />
Btw ... only WA3 ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's possible that in a lot of exp group settings your well-geared dps groupmates simply know that they aren't going to die if the gank aggro for a couple of rounds. If you're experiencing, perhaps they're going all out to get the mob dead and an aggro bounce or two is acceptable risk to them.<br />
On raid mobs, they're minding their aggro a bit more because it causes problems if MT gets ganked.<br />
You might ask those guildmates who don't take aggro on raids but do in groups what they think is going on.<br />
I'd stop tapping taunt evey time it pops, though. You could also try tagging incoming mobs (when practical) with a range weapon before inciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same situation. I very infrequently have aggro problems on raids, but XP groups are  a taunt-fest. I figure it has mostly to do with the fact that on a raid i've got a few seconds (at least) to start hitting the mob etc before nukers start in. In an xp group, usually the slower and some of the nukers have started casting sometime between my first arrow and incite landing. They know they won't die, the mob is blue con so I can taunt it back reliably, and more dps is more xp for everybody.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe wizards really do just afk through raids...</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a decently endgame warrior you sure don't seem to know your ass from your elbow when it comes to the taunt button.  I know there is an argument that a caster could be ahead of you numerically w/ aggro while at the same time not being the person getting hit thanks to distance issues, but mainly mashing the taunt button = bad.<br />
<br />
That said, if you're really concerned about aggro generation, perhaps you should swap to anger3 augments instead.  There are those here that might disagree, but on the whole the general consensus is that anger3 is about 150 more hate per proc.  <br />
<br />
Finish off WA5 as well.</div></div><hr />

Had this problem not as MT but as off tanker on trash if to many came, If i remember correct some of these mobs are UNDEAD ??? i think im correct..The way i fixed it was proxy agro, for some reason i had to pretend they were rooted and got as close up as i could with them (undead mobs) and it seemed to help me alot..Back then i was useing FB and a BOC...and yes you need more AA bro. Put yourself into grinding mode and get them done. But like i said try to stand as close to the mobs as possible if there undead. (sorry this was about 6 months ago and about 10 30packs ago.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Higher lvl mobs ( more +hate on your stun procs )<br />
<br />
2) Melee / casters usually wait to DPS on raids + you're probably OT'ing so even more time to build aggro<br />
<br />
3) You hit taunt on pop which helps more on raids since you got more pet / range caster aggro to draw from.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spikela</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I have found to work well, when practical, is to have the puller run to right behind ya. Taunt as it runs to you. If that lands, perfect! If not, eh, oh well. Incite. If taunt landed, Taunt + Incite will hold you over pretty well in exception of some Necro/Shammies going crazy. If taunt didn't land you might be in harder straits, but again, incite.<br />
<br />
As for the original issue...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's possible that in a lot of exp group settings your well-geared dps groupmates simply know that they aren't going to die if the gank aggro for a couple of rounds.

<br />
That seems to sum it up pretty well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me to!<br />
<br />
Well, I finally augged my weapons, and well, I havn't lost agro, yet, not even in Qvic. GBoS works surprisingly well, but can't wait for FB/BBB/DB or MSC lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proximity is important on all mobs.Undead of course more so.A lot of raid bosses are pretty heavy on prox aggro too.Generally, bein on a mob's nutz is the thing to do when tanking as a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axeman1n</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">people keep saying more swings = more procs, but I thought procrate was standard regardless of haste, and number of swings?<br />
True, but if your swing rate is low, bad streaks can make it seem that it wont' proc at all. With a really fast delay, the proc rate will look much closer to the average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bellow on inc, <br />
<br />
Don't do that.  When you're not on the aggro list the +hate from the bellow will cap at like 150.   Tag with an arrow or just use prox aggro to hit it once then use bellow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axeman1n</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought I read the Taunt brings you to the top of the agro list. However, it does this only just. So if you'd had a huge hate discrepency, then hit taunt, you actually lose hate on the mob, cause you get bumped to just above the Number 2 guy. <br />
<br />
For this reason, it's important to hit taunt on inc, before you hit Incite. Then, keep an eye on the mob, and hit taunt only when you lose agro. This is what works for me. That means a lot since I have POS agro weapons, yet I am still able to hold agro using these rules.</div></div><hr />
