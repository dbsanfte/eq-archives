<br />
I'll start, heh. <br />
<br />
Non-mandatory high-end raiding. <br />
Officers never ever mistreat members in public channels, even if we have a very bad raiding day. <br />
No cursing or bashing in guild chat. <br />
Lots of &quot;family&quot; players - family members, friends, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 1 leader and 1 officer, everything is decided democratically.  Including new apps, what direction we go and why.<br />
<br />
Everyone is family, we can joke with each other, give each other a hard time and everyone knows we are just playin around.  At the same time we can critique each other and voice our opinions, and everyone knows that once the discussion is over we are family and the &lt;3 is there.<br />
<br />
We are a small guild and as such we have to do everything by skill instead of by zerg.  I can't remember how many times another guild told us we can't possibly do an encounter with our numbers, just to have us attempt it and pull it off flawlessly.</div></div><hr />

Friendship.<br />
<br />
Doubt i'll ever see it again though. But i'll never forget what it was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like being in a small casual guild because with my play-time, I don't know that I could contribute much in any other type of guild.<br />
<br />
I like knowing everyone (and their alts) in my guild. I like not having to worry about being embarrassed by the play or immaturity of anyone else in the guild. I like being able to loot just about anything that has a tradeskill tag on it and being able to find out what it is for (if I don't know) by asking in /gu. I like the fact that most members of the guild have been around a long time (in the guild and in the game). I like it that the only time we have a looting &quot;conflict&quot; is when everyone who can use something insists one of the other people who can use the item loot it. I like taking small forces places and beating mobs. I like it that in this guild I've never seen guildmembers be rude to each other. I like meeting strangers who want to group with me because they've grouped with other members of my guild.</div></div><hr />
