I can't bring myself to write very much about this at the moment, as I'm extremely devistated and borderline about to break down myself but earlier today we got the worst news possible, one of our guildmates had passed on. <br />
<br />
The following was posted by his brother, whom has our deepest sympathies.<br />
<br />
I really don’t know how to write this, so forgive me if my post is not as eloquent as it could be. I think the best way to write this is to be direct. My name is James. The one you know as Makavelli is my brother. Shane, Makavelli, passed away late Friday night. He came into town to visit me for the weekend. Our first night out we got split up at one of the bars and he apparently went out back to have a smoke. This is where he came upon two guys taking turns beating a third one. Shane went to intervene, but what he didn’t know was that one of the guys had a gun. Shane was shot four times in the chest and ended up dying before the ambulance even got there. The two guys that were giving the beating took off and we still have gotten no word from the police as to who they were. The third was able to get away as well. He told the police that the two men had thought he was hitting on one of their girlfriends. According to him they were going to shoot him in that ally, but Shane arrived to take the bullets for him.<br />
<br />
Shane was a great player, a great guy as well as a hero and unfortunetly we won't ever be able to let him know that we'll always view him as one. He will be greatly missed by his online family and again, to all his friends, family, I offer my deepest condolenses and as soon as I am able I will post an email address where anyone who would like to, can send a message to the family. For now I have started a thread in the message boards entitled Makavelie which I'm sure the family will read.<br />
