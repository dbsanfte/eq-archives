It is serious at times, and outright hilarious at others; but, it was put together in such a way you are in awe for the next hour, not able to get the movie out of your mind. <br />
This movie makes you wonder.. why and how is Bush still our President? The man has done more wrong than that is just in Michael's movie, and the right he has done cannot balance his wrongs. <br />
If anyone has bought their &quot;Bushism's&quot; calandar they are going to love the end of the movie. <br />
Trust me, even if you are a stout republican.. there are things in this movie that you NEED to know. <br />

I mean if your have Bush and Blair coming out in 02 saying they have an IAEA report saying that Iraq is 6 months from a bomb, and burry in paragraph 18 or 21 that the IAEA denies any such report, your headline shoudl be something like &quot;Presidents sights false report as reason to go to war in Iraq&quot; Not &quot;Iraq 6 months from atomic weapons.&quot;<br />

 Instead, he took away most of the troops in Afghanistan and stuck the rest of the mobile part of the army in Iraq for a sideshow that 130k+ will be targets in for a good many years. As a result, Al-Qaeda is still functioning, recruiting more people than ever, and still a danger to the US.<br />

<br />
One person was cited by CNN that he would have put those Saudi's on the plane today if he had it to do over again. What was not asked or answered was did any of those people provide financial support to any ultra-orthodox religious organizations opposed to Western civilization and dedicated to Islamic Fundamentalism that weilds secular power. Feeding and nurturing a hornet's nest until it explodes and people get stung is being a terrorist.<br />
<br />
Let's remember, at the outbreak of WWII we evacuated diplomats from the other side. Such actions do not indicate those evacuated weren't up to their eyeballs in harming the US, but rather they enjoy a sort of diplomatic immunity that insures we don't have offsetting hostages. It wasn't in our interest to offend the Saudi's no matter what.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm skeptical of some of the claims reportedly made in the movie, but a heck of a lot less skeptical than the words of the &quot;politicians&quot; in charge of policy the have shown time and time again they are liars. The chain of command and the Sec. of Defense himself created the conditions that resulted in the War Crimes commited in those Iraqii prisons and are responsible for the torture murder of an Iraqii General/PoW at the hands of Americans.<br />

Wow, BB and I can agree.  I am also a veteran - and am pissed at how the prison scandal is being handled.

<br />
Well, speaking *without* having seen the movie/documentary, I'm sure the editing and content was designed to further a specific point of view.  Bush &amp; Co. could do the same thing in the other direction with their own film and I'm sure plenty of viewers would come out of theatre wondering why we didn't nuke Iraq into a giant parking lot.  All I'm saying is that you have to be wary of one-sided presentations or &quot;single sources.&quot;   I would be interested in knowing if the film discussed US-Mideast policy, specifically, US-Israel policy, which I believe accounts for at least two-thirds of our problems in the Mid-East.<br />

Thats the reason.. I know most of you think a documentary should be a totally un-opinionated view on said topic.. but a lot of things in this movie were just to make you think some more. I know again.. that most of you hate Michael Moore.. for many reasons; but, even though the man is a bit porkly and opinionated, he knows how to make a movie that will move certain people (really only people that will let themselves be moved by it.. but I digress.) <br />
In the first scene of the movie they showed how stacked it was that President Bush won Florida. The Director of something or other at Fox went and Called the election at a 48% to 49% with Bush Winning, he was a close relative of Bush. The Govener of Florida of could.. and he went on and on showing these things. Again, it could've not happened and that election could've been truely the way it was set up.. but these are just things designed to make people think. .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Birth of a Nation was touted President Wilson as being a great movie accurately depicting history. Read about it if you want to see what conservatives and sometimes even main-stream Americans thought was a good documentary.<br />
<br />
One of the first major political semi-documentaries that wasn't pure propaganda was Harvest of Shame by Edward R. Murrow. Interestingly enough while most Americans were agast, there were immediate responces that it was skewed - migrant workers are actually treated very well living in dormatories just like on college campuses, make oodles of money, are so happy they sing while working, etc.<br />
<br />
Being a farmer's son and very acquainted with the truth, I was shocked at just how much effort the established people in power will go to in order to move their agenda forward and what they will say even if caught red-handed.<br />
<br />
BTW, Caesar Chavez and the migrant worker movement of 15 years ago returned our attention to these issues. But as Dr. Spock observed about the Grinch, our hearts were 3-sizes too small and we were unmoved.<br />
<br />
Tinted car windows were invented so the rich wouldn't run the risk of establishing eye contact with the poor as they drove by in their limos. Being well aware that sometimes there's an alternative viewpoint and that's it's the powerless that often can't get it a hearing, I'm willing to  listen. I don't need tinted windows (or to stick my fingers in my ears and &quot;la la la la&quot;), I can look anybody in the eye.<br />

No responsible person would go to Michael Moore for their information though, he is for liberals who want their beliefs reinforced, and fuel for their angst.  Seriously, if you are watching Fahrenheit 9/11 to learn about current events, then you are in no way educating yourself, you are just reinforcing your beliefs, and allowing your opinions to be manipulated by a man that obviously has an agenda (and wants to make a lot of money).

I agree with this statement 3/4 of the time.  The other 1/4 (election years) the signal to noise ratio is too low to get any info from.  I have stopped watching cable news until November.  There's not much there but political horseshit on any network.<br />

If you want unbiased news, www.economist.com is the best source I have found.

While there is plenty of room for criticism of the administration and the way they went about justifying the war, from a purely &quot;ends justify the means&quot; standpoint, I don't think anyone could say that it's a bad thing that Saddam is gone, for Iraqis or the rest of the world.</div></div><hr />

Granted, there were better ways to go about it, but the only thing Bush wanted (at least publicly) was to oust a fucked up dictator.<br />
<br />
Okay, lets assume that you're right, just for the sake of discussion.  Now, lets consider a couple of things.  First off, why, if this was Bush's motivation, didn't he come right out and say, Saddam is a horrible leader for the Iraqi people, a menace to his own people internally, a proven menace to his neighbors, and a man shown to be willing to use most any means to get what he wants.  We, for the sake of the Iraqi people and for the greater good of the entire middle eastern area, need to remove Saddam from power and replace him with a more benign, less violant, and less over all oppressive government of the Iraqi people's choosing.  These things would at least have the virtue of being true and proven.  They might not be enough to inspire the world to support an invasion of Iraq, but they would have the strength of being irrefutable.<br />
<br />
But instead he beats the drums about weapons of mass destruction as the motivation for the invasion of Iraq.  Based on secret U.S. intelligence that they can show us only small portions of, but which we should take at face value as being true and accurate and support an invasion based on them.  Yet, once the invasion is successful, this supposedly very believable, very detailed, and very accurate secret U.S. intelligence that was used as the justification for the invasion turns out to have been wrong.  Not just slightly wrong, like listing a faciliaty or two as being WMD producers when in fact they produced something else, but completely and totally wrong.  No huge facilities pumping out WMDs like there is no tomorrow.  No gigantic stockpiles hidden away of WMDs waiting to be used.  And, just to support even further that they didn't have them to begin with, no WMDs were used to slow or attempt to stop the invasion.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't know about you, but when a man lies to me, intentionally or unintentionally, I look at that with suspicion.  I begin to have grave doubts about everything he says.  And I begin to question his motivations.  Particularly when it comes to being misled about something as important as invading another country.  This isn't about whether or not he's done a little coke once or twice.  This isn't about whether or not he inhaled.  It's not about whether or not he's gotten a little on the side and doesn't want the wife to know.  This is about turning the entire might of the U.S. military machine on a sovereign nation, destroying its government, much of its infrastructure, and killing thousands of human beings, a portion of which had to have been complete innocents, because that's what happens in war.<br />
<br />
When you do things like that, it is my humble opinion that they should be based on a bedrock foundation of irrefutable and indisputable truths.  Not an elaborate facade of smoke and mirrors.  And it is also my opinion that WMDs were used as the justification because it was a criteria that could be used to justify invading Iraq but not necessarily other nations who have governments that are just as bad or worse.  Is the government of Rwanda bad?  Well, we don't have to invade because they don't have WMDs, that makes it an internal problem.  The government of Honderus is oppressive?  That's okay, they don't have WMDs so it's an internal problem.   Yet the WMDs don't appear to have existed in any kind of quanity to make it a non-internal problem.<br />
<br />
So, if I was a citizen of a foreign nation, and I was looking at all of this, I would be thinking to myself, if the U.S. will invade Iraq based on false or inaccurate information, who might be next?  And it would make me just a little more nervous about the world, knowing that there is a super power out there with the armed forces capable of leveling a nation, and not really knowing or understanding when or where they might use it again.<br />
<br />
If, for example, the U.S. had only a modest military, one that was large enough to defend our borders and to assist in keeping internal peace, but not one large enough to really be a threat to those in the world around us, how might we feel if say China had a very large and powerful military machine and invaded someplace like Suadi Arabia?  And it turned out that the reasoning that China used for the invasion had no real substance to it?  That the intelligence they used to support it was flawed or just plain fabricated?  I think that might have a pretty chilling effect on us.  It would make us extremely nervous about ourselves and the world.  Now, consider how the world feels knowing that we've done something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Beautifully put Glatius.. and yes Brutul.. that is VERY true that these Documentaries are very biased. I read page after page of these things so I knew what was true and what was not in the documentary. I believe though that if certain people who think our president is infallable and say to blindly follow our leader because that is what is right and patriotic can see a different (albiet a little skewed) version of their president. This movie isnt going to change much at all, since the people going to this movie will be democrats and independants and the republicans will refuse, calling the guy fat, unpatriotic, doesn't support the troops and hates America. <br />
One thing I very much disagree on with Michael Moore is the way he handled his business in Bowling for Columbine. He made the people pay for when he screened the movie there.. and then He didn't give much to any Columbine fund (I haven't found anything showing he did donate, but I've read some things saying he didn't) I understand fully why the people there might not like Michael.. and If it was me I probly wouldn't like the guy either because he made that much money off of the pains of our community. <br />
I also read at economist a bit, I also read at Commondreams etc etc and then balance it out with some republican-biased place to try to get a full perspective and not just as if I was just reading commondreams.org (which would have to be a *little* biased =p) I like the site actually..(of course) since there are a lot of people with the same opinions and you can build off of them. But, you can't read exclusively at one site.. or else you only hear about one groups activities/opinions and never hear the other side of the story. <br />
One of the main things that bugs me about Bush is he tries to see the world in a black or white, evil or good, right or wrong place. But, the world is more complex than that.. a President of the United States should be able to do better than that.</div></div><hr />

Thats the reason.. I know most of you think a documentary should be a totally un-opinionated view on said topic.. but a lot of things in this movie were just to make you think some more. I know again.. that most of you hate Michael Moore.. for many reasons; but, even though the man is a bit porkly and opinionated, he knows how to make a movie that will move certain people (really only people that will let themselves be moved by it.. but I digress.) <br />
In the first scene of the movie they showed how stacked it was that President Bush won Florida. The Director of something or other at Fox went and Called the election at a 48% to 49% with Bush Winning, he was a close relative of Bush. The Govener of Florida of could.. and he went on and on showing these things. Again, it could've not happened and that election could've been truely the way it was set up.. but these are just things designed to make people think. .<br />
Thanks,<br />

When you only show one side for the sole purpose of getting someone else elected, When your stated purpose is for Bush to be defeated. When you tell lie after lie and call it truth. You should not call a movie like this  a documentry. A pile of crap comes to mind. Moore lies time and time again not only in this movie but in his others. I know many of you hate Bush but open your eyes, think . Moore has said time and time again he hates Bush and Republicans and would like nothing more then to see them all loose. If you really wish to see this thing at least go in with your eyes open.<br />
<br />
As far as Florida the votes were counted by the media time and time again after it was over. Guess what Bush won every time their was not one re-count that he lost in. I have not seen the movie but I am betting he didnt say anything about that. Moore is full of crap his bias shows at every turn. I for one wont see his newest pack of lies.</div></div><hr />

A somewhat biased tone thats really funny, a completely biased tone is more like it. I dont care who you support only that you think about what is being said from both sides. I admit I support Bush but I dont close my eyes and ears to the other side. Oh and by the way Do you really not believe your own bias shows here?<br />

I have seen his anti gun propaganda film. Where he leaves out may facts and skews others to make his point. I really dont mind his bull but I will call it what it is. Umm, lets see crap anyone</div></div><hr />

I thought I had been clear, with no intention of disguising my bias.  I dislike Bush.  I find his demeanour arrogant.  I find his choice of advisors to be questionable.  I find his intelligence to be suspect.  And I find his decisions to be deplorable.  He is not a man I personally feel is a good leader.  If I could remove him from office today, I would. <br />
<br />

<br />
You're probably right about Moore leaving out facts and skewing others to make his point.  Just as George Bush is just as guilty of leaving out facts and skewing others to make his point.  The major difference between the two  is that Moore provides entertainment value and questionable propaganda for his viewpoint, while Bush destroys governments, levels the infrastructure of countries, and kills thousands.  Personally, if I have to live with one of the two, I'll go with Moore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Actually, if you give it even a modicum of thought Moore would be much much more effective harming Bush's re-election chances by telling the truth rather than lying now wouldn't he?<br />
<br />
I think this may be a case of there sometimes being two ways to imterpret facts and events. Goodness knows Bush messed up enough for Clinton's book to be a best seller, Moore's movie to make boxoffice records, and the director of the CIA to resign.<br />
<br />
Oh, there's going to be plenty of propaganda between now and the election. But some lies have directly hurt America and some are from people standing on the sidelines.<br />

Moore bending the truth a bit to prove a point (that should be an obvious point anyways) or Bush outright lying to the American public time after time after time.. who is making the bigger impact on your life? I Don't see why people can get so angry at the man when the man they support takes lying to a new extreme! This is myself though.. some people cannot be convinced of my point, and they cannot convice me.. so it is moot. <br />
After the movie I received a paper scrutinizing Moore.. don't tell me that there was no skewing or lying on that sheet so they could prove their point. It was mostly little untruths and exaggerations that only the stoutest of republicans would believe. What more can I say.. <br />

I happen to have made mine. As to Bush lieing about WMD, IMO its not true. Almost every country in the world thought Iroc had WMD I really dont think they were all lieing. Some didnt think we should go to war over it but they all thought he had them. <br />

It seems republicans would rather nitpick about Moore than look at anything the man himself brought up with his movie. <br />
Lets stop bashing Moore and lets look at some things the movie brought up.. an actual discussion instead of this digression into falsified bickering. <br />
<br />
Some points the movie brought up that I thought were very interesting:<br />
1) The magnitude of the opposition at Bush's inaugeration<br />
2) Relations between the Bin Laden's and Bush's<br />
3) No reason for the war on Iraq? anyone??<br />
4) Amount of Civillians killed in a pointless war?<br />
5) etc etc.. i bet you can list some things from there that intrigued you as well<br />
<br />
One thing I didn't like is how they put an R rating on a movie that was based on reality and only reality. I can understand R ratings on insane horror movies and the like but it should've been at least pg-13 so kids that need to see this movie will see it. <br />
One theory people had behind this was that the kids would be cowards if it came to war.. but this is reality, and they have a right to know. The army commercials always show people fixing things etc etc planes flying low through the grand canyon and then a vanishing mirage.. think about it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I've just had a Conference Call with Michael Moore at my house this night.. 35,000+ people around the nation.. over 100 from my town of 80,000. This was organized by the Moveon Organization. (www.moveonpac.org)  What I can assure you is that Moore is not the bastard represented in the mantra of the Republicans. He has brought out some issues and rocked the boat.. which most people don't like. I don't understand why people will subject themselves to total conformity without rocking the boat. I've talked to people that I know are smart.. but, they feel like since he is the president we should follow him blindly like a sheep to their shepard. Again.. don't bring this discussion back to the fact that you might think  Moore to be a bastard.. look at the issues he has brought up.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">i agree this movie should be seen, even if you dont want to pay to see it then download it. moore has openly stated he doesnt like the US copyright laws so he doesnt care if it gets downloaded. while the movie is left biased it brings up many thought provoking points and as long as you dont buy into everything thats said in the movie and view it skeptically its pretty interesting. <br />
<br />
of course fahrenheit 9/11 is biased and based of moore's agenda. this thread is full of people pointing that out and screaming for moore's head on a platter. but if rush limbaugh or ann coulter made a movie it wouldnt be any less biased. im very skeptical of alot of the facts in this film however when moore shows the army records he got in year 2000 vs the ones that got released recently its obvious bush is guilty of the same half truths, creative editing, and censorship that opponents of moore talk about. <br />
<br />
also why do people care so much if michael moore is fat? so what? is this elementary school when people pick on the fat kid because they prefer not to engage in argument on a mental level? disagree with him all you want idealogically but saying he is fat makes you look like such a moron.<br />
<br />
also to rysingsun's clinton thing. bush started a war in a country that was in a relative state of peace. clinton sent troops into countries already engaged in war to try and help out civilians rather than conduct large scale military encounters. i think war sometimes is necissary, i think that wars over unimportant issues are horrible things. i think bush sucks for being in the air national guard and not doing anything in vietnam then asking families and soldiers to give their lives and go through terrible ordeals that he never has had to over issues that are highly suspect and are now being debunked. ive never gone to war, never lost a relative to war, but that doesnt mean i cant imagine how horrible it is, and thats why i think its wrong to do so over reasons that have no warrant and turn out to be ficticious (sp?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're smokin some good stuff.  I don't dislike Bush because of his stand on abortion, although I'll admit it doesn't agree with mine.  I dislike Bush because of what he's done and how he presents himself.  His stand on abortion is at most a side issue.<br />

<br />
Somolia was a cluster fuck from the word go, no two ways about it.  We had no business being there and it caused us nothing but grief in the end.  But Clinton didn't claim that the Somolian Warlords had WMDs and it was therefore imperative that we level that nation's infrastructure, kill thousands of its population, many of whom were civilians, and overturn its government.  The problem in Somolia was a lack of any government.  And we didn't &quot;invade&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yugoslavia?  You mean the peacekeeping forces in Serbia?  That was a U.N. supported and blessed activity.  One where we lost only a few troops, correct me if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
And you misunderstand, or at least you misunderstand me.  There is a time and a place for war.  There are clear justifications for it as well.  The invasion of Iraq during the Gulf War to rest control of Kuwait from Iraqi hands was clearly justified.  Even if the U.S. had gone in completely alone, I personally would have felt it was a &quot;good&quot; war, one that needed to be fought and one that deserved to be won.  And if we had at that time kicked Saddam's butt into the deepest darkest dungeon of a prison, you wouldn't have heard me utter one word against it.<br />
<br />
The current Iraqi conflict does not have the same credibility and righteousness behind it.</div></div><hr />

 I'm not against wars per se, but I was against this war at this time. We had Al-Qaeda's leadership on the run and could have caught quite a few with a bold movement into Pakistan. Instead we've allowed Al-Qaeda a breathing space that they've used to actively recruit in, and they also have most of their top brass still out there plotting and planning.<br />
<br />
 As far as Iraq goes, militarily it was a joke. 400,000 unpaid troops. Little armor. Few working planes. No CBW worth mentioning (Yes, I originally believed he had a small stockpile, but not even enough to affect a military battle. I was wrong, too, but MUCH less wrong than the 'thousands of liters' crowd.) Had he tried anything with any of his neighbors, they would have smashed his ass flat faster than you could say 'Six Day War'. Hell, even some of his top generals were eminently bribable, which explains part of the lack of resistance in Enduring Freedom. You're gonna SERIOUSLY claim that that was more of a danger to America than the group that killed thousands of Americans on US soil? Or worth more effort?</div></div><hr />

They have a right to know why they are fighting then.

So by June 20, Michael Moore had &quot;evolved&quot; a bit as many in Hollywood tend to do. He said this on an ABC News program: &quot;(The movie) is an op-ed piece. It's my opinion about the last four years of the Bush administration. And that's what I call it.

The UN Inspection team found no creditable evidence of WMD's. Let's kindly break up WMD's into the three main catagories:<br />
<br />
1. Radiological weapons. The only evidence Iraq had radiological weapons was debunked prior to the war.<br />
<br />
2. Biological weapons. This may in a number of years turn out to be a major problem. However, in the only known incident the United States appears to have been the source for Anthrax loosed on the general population. Oh, at the time this occured, we CLAIMED not to have biological weapons or programs - we of course do. Where are the only existing samples of smallpox curently kept?<br />
<br />
3. Chemical weapons. Since many precursors to chemical weapons are used in legimate manufacturing, the capability to produce chemical weapons is universal. Witness please the release of nerve agents in the Japanese subway system a number of years ago by AMATUERS. The key is stockpiled completed chemical weapons. UN inspections showed none. Saddam after years of such inspections stopped them briefly when it was clear some inspectors were using their acess to compile a target list in preparation for invasion. Despite this, he did allow inspections to resume pior to the war and the UN inspectors found NO evidence of manufacturing or stockpiling.<br />
<br />
Even with the overwhelming evidence that no significant WMD activity was ongoing, there is one more compelling piece of evdence.<br />
<br />
The first Iraq War reduced the fighting capability of Iraq from perhaps the world's 5th most effective conventional force (according to Jane's) to rubble. The artillery was gone, tank battalions gone, WMD's stated to be destroyed and no evidence they weren't, anti-aircraft systems gone, air force gone - and NONE of it replaced. Only around Bagdad and two or three other sites was there a creditable force. Iraq's military capability was so eroded by the first war that Jane's didn't even concider it a major regional power.<br />
<br />
With the No Fly Zones, Iraq did not even control it's own airspace.<br />
<br />
In such dire strats, invasion of a neighbor was suicide. Use of WMD's was suicide. You can not use WMD's against UN forces and expect to remain alive. They are the gun that can not be used unless you either:<br />
<br />
a. Are assured of losing and in retaliation want to wreak havoc on your enemies (the supposed Israeli motavation for having such weapons). Not much of a problem unless your enemies are already bent on your destruction. OR<br />
<br />
b. Are assured of winning and dictating surrender terms (US use on Japan).<br />
<br />
As a former CBR NCO, I assure you that (don't look if you are in the military) the protective gear, atropine, etc. are NOT sufficient to protect ground troops for any protracted time. Activated charcoal is too easy to overwhelm, vomiting agent + nerve gas too  insidious, wounded + major contagious agents (anthrax or ebola) too difficult to handle.<br />
<br />
No one, absolutely no one (except for Iranian massed human wave attacks), would commit ground troops if there was the least suspicion the enemy had an effective WMD capability.<br />
<br />
I'm certain, with no doubt in my mind, that the UN Inspector reports and CIA information was sufficient for the General Staff to KNOW it was safe to invade while those intent on invading used ambiguities to pretend that the danger they KNEW was not present existed and to make a case for invasion.<br />

Despite this, he did allow inspections to resume pior to the war and the UN inspectors found NO evidence of manufacturing or stockpiling.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
The UN inspectors were not allowed to go any where they wanted and were watched by Iraq intellagence at all times. Very few belived they were seeing everything.<br />
<br />
Since I keep getting asked where I am getting my info I will do the same to you who debunked it The UN?<br />
<br />
As far as biological weapons they had them, they used them. Where they got them is really a moot point. We are not the ones that used them to wipe out our own people  to quell an upriseing. Everyone knows at one time he had them. We have them the Russians have them the Brits have them the French have them.  The diffrence is I dont believe we would use them and I am sure we would not use them against our own people<br />
<br />
Chemical weapons are a problem as you stated their  are many legimate uses for the chemicals, its when you combine them that there is a problem. As to the inspectors and inspections, Saddam stoped the inspections for years not briefly and the fact that you really believe that he kicked them out because the inspectors were putting together a target list is silly. Believe what you will but that is just laughable.<br />
<br />
I would answer the rest but I dont have time. But let me just say Saddam was insane. You claim you cant use WMD without being blown to bits, but he did use them on the Irains  and his own people and nothing happened to him. He did not believe the US or anyone else would attack if faced with the threat of WMD and he didnt give a rats ass about his troups or what WMD would do to them. I say again Saddam was a threat and still would be if you had your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">As far as biological weapons they had them, they used them.<br />
<br />
No, it absolutely is not a moot point.  The claims were that Iraq had or was in the process of creating WMDs in sufficient quantity to be a threat to the region and a threat to the world.  This has catagorically been shown to have been false.  Not a single substantiated and verifiable piece of evidence has been found that supports it to any significant degree.  Yes, you can poke around the ruins of Iraq and make logical stretches as to how this or that factory could have been used to create this or that WMD, but that isn't PROOF.  And if there was such PROOF I think we all know that President Bush would be trotting it out night and day, 24/7 just to improve his chances of re-election.  But it's not being mentioned.  In fact you'll notice that the Bush administration is extremely quiet on the whole topic of WMDs these days.  Very quiet indeed.<br />
<br />
Hillaan, you strike me as a true believer.  Someone who has decided that Bush should be taken on faith and nothing will shake you from supporting him.  And that's fine, if you want to, in my opinion, blindly follow the man, that's your right.  But don't dismiss other people's critisism of him out of hand as if it had no substance.  The man has done things and said things that people don't like.  Some of us don't believe him.  Some of us don't trust him.  And some of us feel that he's a bad President for the country.  You disagree.  Okay, now support that with something more than &quot;it's laughable&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">If you trying to say no one knew for sure whatever or not Iraq had WMDs I'd agree with you. Saying that foreign governments believed something means that their officials had made such statements publicly and that certainly had not happened. So asking me to provide &quot;evidence&quot; on something that has not happened is silly at best.<br />
<br />
Everyone did know UN was not accomplishing everything they intended in their checks and that partial info was not helping anyone any.<br />
<br />
Sadam was right to believe that were was no reason for anyone to attack him. If US had a different president I highly doubt that anyone would be invading Iraq over the WMD issue. No one else was gun-ho to go into war over this. Seriously even if Iraq did have WMD US should have been the last country to worry since Iraq did not have missiles capable of targeting US at least from all the reports I’ve seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The last site there was a standoff with inspecting was the Presidential Palace. Ultimately it was inspected. Interestingly enough, the inspectors abused this by embarassing the regime with reports of how oppulent it was. (The Saudii's can put that place to shame any day of the week).<br />
<br />
Of course Iraqi intellegence kept an eye on inspectors. My goodness, we kept an eye of the Soviet Military Liason Mission allowed by treaty in Germany when I was there - even issued them special plates (SMLM 1, etc) and shadowed them everywhere.<br />
<br />
We've admitted the document we presented as evidence of an Iraqii effort to obtain yellowcake was a forgery - look it up.<br />
The diffrence is I dont believe we would use them [biologicals] and I am sure we would not use them against our own people.<br />
Please kindly also look up Sir Jeffery Amherst, Smallpox, and blankets. This little trick was also performed on the Seminole Indians much later.<br />
<br />
Afterwards you can look up starving Indians to get them to move to reservations, overthrowing the legally constituted government of Hawaii, use of Agent Orange as an herbicide, Paraquat in the War of Drugs, etc.<br />
its when you combine them that there is a problem<br />
This is only binary agents - your lack of knowledge is rather extensive.<br />
<br />
It is alledged that he used an agent agaist the Kurds some 15 years ago. It's alledged we used Agent Orange knowing it could cause long term problems. This is something possible in valleys, areas with a lot of vegitation, and depressions. Depressions like the boggy area south of Bagdad that we sent troops through without decontamination stations and on foot, not in troop carriers with filtration capability used everywhere you would be fearful of a chemical attack.<br />
<br />
I say that the basic ideas of deposing Saddam were made by core members of Bush's team at the American Enterprise Institute in 1996 and presented to PM Netanyahu (omg SP?) of Israel, shelved, and put into effect when Bush took office and these same people became advisors.<br />
<br />
Ho Chi Minh was perhaps a greater threat to American interests and given the chance to take a stand, Bush took a powder.<br />
<br />
I say the evidence was flimsy at best, has resulted in a near disaster, and that Bush is a major threat to world peace and stability. My goodness, after WWII the Werewolves and other German resistance only lasted until about 1948. We've created a whole generation of enemies bent on revenge for invasion, occupation, and prisoner torture/abuse.<br />
<br />
It looks to me like it's possible to have more than one opinion about these things and Bush has managed to deeply divide Americans.<br />

<br />
IMO, it didnt change much of America's safety.  Iraq is way over there and unless they are smuggling chems into our borders, I dont see much of an improvement in our security.  Yeah I do agree that Hussain was a horrible person, but I dont think we should have gotten rid of him the way we did.  (By ourselves + England)<br />
<br />
Before the war, America was hated over in the Middle East.  Now, we are loathed in other countries like France, Germany, Russia AS WELL AS the Middle East still.  The way the Bush administration handled the situation was terrible.  We alienated ourselves from most of the respectable UN countries, and the countries that are &quot;in the fight&quot; are starting to pull out.  Yeah some people are like, &quot;who needs france, etc&quot; but with enough countries together that makes up the world.<br />
<br />
Now Bush is touring EU trying to get back the support of those folks that we said we didnt need their help.  The administration messed up, thought it was going to be an easy fight.  Now we have Al-Qaeda as well as Iraq resistance militants killing our boys.  And we are taking a toll on their civilian population as well.  Its just a bloody mess.<br />
<br />
We did a trash job handing over soverenty to Iraq the way it is now.  Its like we just gave it back to them because we couldn't handle it.  The true fight is against Al-Qaeda and we pulled out of that fight real fast, diverting our attention to a long standing duel between Father and Hussain.  Al-Qaeda members are still at large and they are the folks that HAVE successfully attacked us.   :mad:</div></div><hr />

Actually, as soon as Bush declared war on Iraq, I honestly thought we were fucking toast.  I was sure that either terrorists were gonna bring the fight here, ala 9/11, or that someone like North Korea whom we were having problems with at the time was gonna backdoor nuke us.  It would have been the single biggest tactical mistake in US history, and Bush would have single handedly been then reason for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of american lives.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for him, that didn't happen, but it was still a very real possibilty at the time.  Do I feel safer now?  Fuck no...I've never felt not safe.   You can't go thru life worrying about shit like that.  I might get run over by a bus today, who the fuck knows.  I can't be bothered by wasting my time with that.</div></div><hr />

I would personally answer that with a resounding No.  I lived in Saudi Arabia from 96-2001, and the mentality of the people is downright scarey.  <br />
<br />
In some area's (most I ever talked to as a matter of fact) are brought up learning that they can get into heaven by killing an Israeli.  What happens when they start teaching their young the same thing about americans?  <br />

To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness.

As much as some might try to marginalize this film as a screed against President George Bush, &quot;F9/11&quot; — as we saw last night — is a tribute to patriotism, to the American sense of duty  —  and at the same time a indictment of stupidity and avarice.</div></div><hr />

A complete lack of proof is not speculation.  It's not my opinion that no significant quantities of WMDs have been found.

Even if the gorey violence was allowed for the teenagers to view, the simple fact that the movie is a one sided presentation of a two sided topic, makes this not a good idea to show to younger teenagers.

This whole WMD business and complete turn around on reasons behind the war not once, not twice, but THREE times shows him questionable at best. <br />

Especially since whole war was started based on American ideology of making world “a safer place”. First it was whole &quot;world is going to be a safe place&quot;. Then, &quot;America will be a safer place&quot;. Which brings us to today… no place is any safer now then it was, but we did start a war, enjoy.

-9/11 ... we're pissed off and looking for answers<br />
-After failure to find Osama, the US starts hunting down his supporters<br />
-Saddam and several iraqi officials are known supporters (with supplies/money)<br />
-UN inspectors go back to check Iraq for weapons<br />
-Saddam violates his agreement by denying the access<br />
-Bush puts out the ultimatum to Saddam:  Back the fuck down and leave Iraq<br />
-Saddam doesnt back down<br />
-We invade to oust saddam.<br />
<br />
<br />
The war over as soon as saddam was captured.  The weapons of mass destruction were never guaranteed to be up.  The entire POINT of the war was to oust saddam, and everybody on both sides knew it.  Saddam violated his agreements for the last fucking time ... and everyone else was pissed off and tired of it.  He's a bad man and a ruthless dictator, and he's personally been responsible for thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands) of inoocent deaths.  How were we to know if there were weapons if he violated UN agreements for checks?  <br />
<br />
Cloud the waters with &quot;Its all about the oil&quot; all you want.  Personally i dont believe that horse shit for even a second.  I'm sure that people had other motives for instigating things, but this was our war against saddam, not against iraq.<br />

If anything going after saddam hurt us in an ecomonic sense because the other Arab nations now hate us.... and we knew this when we went into the war.<br />

<br />
Yes, Saddam violated the agreement.  And yes he should have been penalized for that.  A tightening down of the sanctions.  An increase in the size of the no fly zone.  A number of things could have and should have been thought of and executed before invading.  <br />

I don't dislike Bush.   I find Bush sounding stupid often when he speaks.  I don't mind conservative thought at all.   I favor a balanced budget and a strong defense.  But when I hear him speak its offensive because my 6th grade daughter is more articulate.   There is no spin way to really spin this fact.   They just try to keep him away from events when he has to speak on his feet.  The debates of 2000 were heavy regulated by the Bush team so as to hide this weakness.     I watched every debate and Bush seemed like a stooge.   I am independent and went in with an open mind.   I bet he will rue his fuzzy math comments this round of debates.  To be honest, I had such a negative impression of Bush that he has surprised me sometimes as I had really low expectations.   I just do not want to hear the guy speak as its embarrassing to our country.  I been in other country 's recently and he is considered a laughing stock by the people with whom I spoke.<br />
<br />
I am going to see the movie.   I listen to Rush sometimes and he is pretty much one sided as it gets.   I don't figure this movie will change my mind one way or another.   But I really want to see his reaction to the news of 9/11 in the classroom in the movie.   If he handled it well I may vote for him .  If he looks like a deer in the headlights well then we don't need him in office.  My reaction will be determined on whether he was trying to  hide int he book or calmly calm the chilldren by maintaining the classroom environs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Saddam and several iraqi officials are known supporters (with supplies/money)<br />
Actually, this is the opposite of the facts on the ground.<br />
<br />
OBL is Saudi Arabian as were many of the 9/11 terrorists and their handlers. Several Islamic charities based in Saudi Arabia had their assets frozen post-9/11. Osama's personal wealth was derived directly from his family's affuence.<br />
<br />
There is a religious/educational movement that recieved financial backing by (I need to be careful here) members of the Saudi elite, including OBL, that are pan-Islamic, anti-Western, and fundamentalist. They funded religious schools throughout the Middle East, Afganistan, Pakistan, etc.<br />
<br />
These students are inculcated with a very focused religious education that in some ways makes Western culture seem not only foreign, but heretical - not accepting the will of God. As very devout religious practitioneers, they have been recruited to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and elsewhere for decades.<br />
<br />
Look at them and their supporters as a core pan-Islamic population with a world view much different than ours AND much different than Saddam's - Iraq was a very secular state NOT a natural ally for this crowd (in fact he fought a war against the Iranian theocracy).<br />
<br />
Osama funded many of these schools and used them as recruiting grounds as well as some of the more fundamentalist Mosques. US support for Israel and Western culture has largely replaced the Soviet Union as this group's bete noir.<br />
<br />
Just as the US has used Israel as a check on pan-Arabic or pan-Islamic nationalism, some Middle Eatern states have developed these Islamic Holy Warriors as a check on US (and European) imperialism and other more secular Middle Eastern states. BUT, as Iran shows clearly, it is playing with fire. The popular press is often filled with &quot;blood libel&quot;, the Protocals of Zion, and even worse distortions of fact and history.<br />
<br />
Bear baiting the US comes at the cost of maybe finding your Middle Eastern state replaced by a more observant and fundamentalist goverment no matter how much &quot;charity&quot; you show to religious schools and students. This is a major fear in many of the more secular states including Iraq, Egypt, etc.<br />
<br />
A very complicated situation. But Saddam at worst would not want to offend these people while at the same time would want to restrict their access to his population. However, &quot;conservative&quot; elements from Eqypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc., etc, etc. not only funded them, but created and funded the religious schools, created and staffed the training facilities, provided warriors in Afghanistan, and supported this infrastructure ever since. Saddam was not such a player - he didn't have the proper resume or religious credentials. He was not accepted as a caliph (no one is atm) or a Sherif (although he claimed to be one).<br />
<br />
I have only a nodding acquaintance with the ins and outs, but Saddam as a major supporter of the current crop of terrorists is another out and out lie.<br />

He's a beligerant mongrel and no amount of &quot;do it or else...&quot; is going to make him back down. Violence is his tool of choice in governing his nation ... Violence is the ony thing he has ever responded to.<br />
<br />
Why exactly were sanctions still in place on Iraq?  Because they were thought to still be producing or attempting to produce weapons of mass destruction.  That's exactly why the sanctions were there.  Yes, inspectors were being given the run around.  Yes, Saddam wasn't adhering to the agreements forced upon him.  And if there was in fact strong evidence that he was in reality producing and stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, I doubt we'd be having this discussion.  If all the U.S. had, as it appears was the truth, was a suspicion that Saddam was working on and stockpiling WMDS, then increased sanctions was the way to go.  If they had hard concrete irrefutable evidence that it was true he was producing and stockpiling WMDs, then the invasion would have been justifiable.  They claimed they had hard concrete irrefutable evidence.  They used it to support the invasion.  And that evidence, for whatever reason, no one really knows why who isn't deep in the administration, turned out to be complete and utter bullshit.<br />
<br />
Does this make Bush a liar?  I don't know.  I don't know what he knew or when he knew it or who told him what.  I do know this, though.  He came to me, an American citizen, and said, trust me, I know what I'm doing here and this is important.  We have the goods on Saddam and he must go!  And I, as an Amercian citizen, said Okay, Mr.  President, do what you have to do, you have my support.  And once the smoke cleared, I feel that my President, the man who asked me to trust him, screwed me.  He didn't have the goods he claimed he had.  He acquired my faith in him under false pretenses and he abused it.  And I won't be likely to make that mistake a second time, thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And perhaps that is your whole problem. You are so blinded by idealogy that you cannot see the many holes and flaws in that movie (and in the commondreams website).<br />
<br />
Just a simple example - in one part Moore says that Iraq had never harmed or attempted to harm any Americans, yet not 10 minutes later in the movie he says something about how the &quot;real&quot; reason that GW jr hates Saddam is because Saddam tried to kill his father, GW sr.  DUH!!!<br />

I am not so much as you might think a one-sided person from that beginning thing, and I cannot edit it to put the thoughts I truely meant. From this paragraph thats what you may draw out. I did see some of the holes and flaws in the movie because I went to some sites that were made against the movie.. but even those sites you have to take with a grain of salt. Commondreams is not the only site I use. I always try to look at both sides of this Issue whenever I can. <br />
What I think though is some people are scared to doubt our president, or dont believe that we should. I truely dont understand this blind-following of a leader. I understand that if you voted for him, you have similar beliefs but I dont believe that you can blindly follow them no matter what (this again being my belief, not yours, so if you dont agree dont take offence)<br />
This &quot;documentary&quot; is propaganda.. but it is needed propaganda. If OUR media isn't putting out what the people need to see, and not some lame-brained another thing to try to get you worried about. (I was talking to someone today and they were PARANOID about these mosquitoes because they heard that there was a higher chance of getting west nile this year.. where from what I've heard there isn't.)<br />
If your own Media will not tell you what you need to know (again, I am not saying that everything in this movie should be taken as the cold hard facts), then there should be someone/something that should. <br />
<br />
So to answer you; No, I am not blinded by whimsical ideologies and I could notice any holes in the movie. <br />
<br />
<br />
I want to hear a republican bring up something about the movie that they found interesting, something that made them think. Stop talking about what minute details you can find wrong with the movie, or not agreeing to the way he said something, because you know its propaganda. Start talking about something important. If you have seen the movie you might have gotten a thought from it. Share it! <br />
If you haven't seen the movie and are just bashing Moore off of what everyone else has said.. please stop. If you have seen the movie, share what you have thought from it. Besides I hate Moore, he is so fat, why is he so fat, i dont like moore, or fat people.. i mean really!<br />

<br />

<br />
Well it was okay for us to try to kill him by bombing him from the air, because that technically isn't an assasination attempt, it would merely be fortunate collateral damage.  Of course if a few dozen or a few hundred innocents are killed in the process, well you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs right?  And besides, we're good and he's bad!<br />
<br />
And him attempting to assasinate Bush Sr. well that's just evil!  Goes against everything good right and proper in the world!  The terriorist dog should be shot in the street!  Or better yet, bombed from 10,000 feet......<br />
<br />
Saddam was/is a sadistic evil bastard, of this I doubt anyone will debate.  But the fact of the matter is that when seen from a third party perspective, the actions of the United States don't necessarily come across as all that much better.  People dying because of an assasination attempt or because of precision bombing are still people dying.  And if you're the one who loses a friend or a loved one, it's really hard to look at either as being &quot;okay&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Or like a GWB political ad?  Nah, the movie is too based in fact to be a GWB ad.  In seriousness tho, of course it is biased, and I do not believe Moore is claiming otherwise.  Labeling him a 'fanatic' for expressing his opinions is cheap argument.  If you cannot actually debate what he says, and are forced to just name call to refute him, it suggests that your position is weaker than Moore's.  One of Moore's talents is to express his opinions in such a way that people actually pay to see him do so.<br />
<br />
The war over as soon as saddam was captured. The weapons of mass destruction were never guaranteed to be up. The entire POINT of the war was to oust saddam, and everybody on both sides knew it. Saddam violated his agreements for the last fucking time ... and everyone else was pissed off and tired of it. He's a bad man and a ruthless dictator, and he's personally been responsible for thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands) of inoocent deaths. How were we to know if there were weapons if he violated UN agreements for checks?  <br />
<br />
Let's start with 'The weapons of mass destruction were never guaranteed to be up'.  Oops, we goofed..turned out our excuse for invading was invalid...so sorry about all the deaths and destruction.  Have a nice day.  Sorry, you do not  invade another country simply because you suspect maybe, possibly, that something might be going on.<br />
<br />
Now, moving on to this: 'The entire POINT of the war was to oust saddam, and everybody on both sides knew it. Saddam violated his agreements for the last fucking time'.  I am too lazy to look it up, but if you would care to, check and see how many treaties GWB decided where 'flawed', and would not be bound to.  How can GWB expect the US to not be bound by it's treaties, but Iraq must be?  If we are going to use UN security council resolutions as a justification for invasion, why are we not going after countries that have violated far more, for much longer...say Isreal and Turkey for example?<br />
<br />
Next is this gem: 'He's a bad man and a ruthless dictator, and he's personally been responsible for thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands) of inoocent deaths. '  You refering to Bush here?  As the person who made the descision to invide Iraq, he is personally responsible for all the innocents killed in the name of making them safer(I guess being dead is pretty safe).  While no one will claim Saddam was a good man(in fact he is pretty despicable), we lack the ability to claim much moral high ground, as we have(and continue to) supported regimes that are no better than Saddam's Iraq(in fact at the time he was doing most of the things we condemn him for, we supported him).  I will shed not a tear uppon Saddam's demise(in fact I will consider it a very good day), but removing Saddam was not nearly worth what the war has cost us.<br />

Conservatives were very quick to call Clinton a draft dodger, embraced GWB the war hero *giggle*, and yet hate Kerry who actually served with distinction. Someone has a double standard.<br />
<br />
A few conservatives might hold Kerry in distain because although he did served, fight, and get a few medals, Kerry joined VVAW after his enlistment was over and spoke against the Viet Nam War. Yet these same people rever Oliver North who gave weapons to our enemies (aid and comfort) that were holding American hostages. (I was delighted that Daniel Innouie (sp) was kind enough to show North, the Republican poster boy when he wore his uniform to the Senate hearings what a genuine war hero is. Feel free to read Sen. Innouie's Medal of Honor citation). Someone has a double standard.<br />
<br />
Clinton getting oral is horrible, but Long John &quot;Pubic Hair&quot; Thomas is the pinacle of juducial temperment. Someone has a double standard.<br />
<br />
I'll never forget almost all the Republican Senator's in the Watergate hearings denying the truth right in front of thier eyes until the existance of the tapes became public. I thought that showed the extreme of conservative hypocracy until of course Bush came into office and spoke of WMD's that weren't there, didn't fire cabinet members that encouraged and turned a blind eye to war crimes, and I suppose thinks he generalled a stunning victory in Iraq, a country whose capital still doesn't have electricity 24 hours a day/7 days a week even a year later.<br />
<br />
A large number of diplomats, former General staff officers, and cabinent members from various adminstrations and with a range of political beliefs recently created and signed a document lambasting Bush. Unlike some Republicans that will deny that truth right in front of their eyes even when confronted with the audio tapes, the pictures, the video, the conclusions of the interrogation teams that rung out Saddam, Chemical Ali, etc. trying desperately to find at least a can of Raid insecticide, they are not blind.<br />
<br />
BTW, what ever happened to Robert Vesco - the guy who bilked GI's, was never found, and gave Nixon that slush fund they were going to use as hush money? Ya ya, Nixon's not a crook and Bush isn't a meglomaniac.<br />

Those interested in the rumor, here's a rather biased anti-Kerry source (http://www.b66.info/JohnKerry/).  In 1993, Senator Kerry reportedly went<br />
on a mission sent by President Clinton, to deliver to the Vietnamese microfilm of some 3 million captured Vietnam War documents that pertained to finding American POWs and MIAs. <br />
A photo was apparently taken during this meeting and placed in the War Remnants Museum in Vietnam.<br />

John Kerry earned a Bronze Star, a Silver Star and three Purple Hearts in Viet Nam.<br />
<br />
BTW, I served (volunteer) 1968-1971 (no service in Viet Nam) and later protested that war. I think I earned the right to do so.<br />
<br />
Muhamed Ali was a contentious objector that went to jail for his beliefs. Kerry served, was decorated, and later was opposed. Quayle and Bush hid - if they said it was because they felt it was a senseless war, I wouldn't fault them one iota.<br />

My opinion on Kerry is he is an educated man who has served time in our military. So, he would not send hundreds of thousands into War without SOLID reasons. And since he is there to oust Bush, I like him all the better. I've read up on him and I believe him to be a  not-too-shabby (meaning better than this one) cantidate for president.

And he did do that patriot act to help make the world a safer place.. well that took away our rights faster than you could say &quot;uhhh.. what?&quot; since that act was written in such an inane way that you have to know every other bill passed to read the thing. (is that how it is with all bills?). <br />
Well, he did pass a $450,000,000,000.00 medicare plan.. but it didn't lower the cost of drugs. <br />
What can you say to a president that does that?<br />

The reason Haass said that you should try to have independant thoughts is that even without discussing Saddam being railroaded, just because your leader said it was right, you will follow him blindly without a second questioning thought.

Hillaan, most of your points apparently aren't well thought out nor are they articulately presented.  Often times it seems as though you're just regurgitating something you've heard said by some right wing radio talk show host.  Must of what you say is with a &quot;I say it therefore it must be true,&quot; or a &quot;the President said it therefore it must be true,&quot; attitude.  Well the facts speak for themselves and you've not countered them in any significant fashion at any time other than to kind of foam at the mouth.<br />
<br />
Do I believe Saddam was railroaded?  Personally, no I don't.  I happen to believe the man is pretty much as vile as he is generally thought to be.  But I also believe he is a survivor who is reasonably intelligent, more in a crafty way than in a clever one, because he managed to stay on top of a dictatorship without being assisinated for a long time.  But to consider someone a communist or a non-patriot just because they're willing to consider the possibility that he might have been railroaded, strikes most people as extremely reactionary.<br />
<br />
Let's face it.  Our government lies to us.  Our governmental leaders lie to us.  Sometimes they do it unintentionally.  Sometimes they do it intentionally.  But to just assume that everything told to us by our government or our governmental leaders is the god's honest truth and never to examine it with a critical eye, would just be stupid.   Any reasonably intelligent American living in the world today has got to be somewhat sceptical of anything our government tells us or they just aren't living in reality.</div></div><hr />

I agree and disagree with this.  I unfortunately can't trust our own government enough right now to believe that Saddam is guilty of everything they say he is, however, with that being said, I do believe he is guilty of many crimes and should face what ever justice an Iraqi court decides to dish out.<br />
<br />
What I disagree with mostly is Flair basically said that he saw Saddams trial with his own eyes and Saddam seemed very intelligent and lucid and because of this he thinks Saddam may have been railroaded.  Hitler was a much more intelligent and dynamic public speaker, but the fact remains he still cooked a mean Jewburger.  Just because Saddam isn't the raving lunatic, foaming at the mouth that the American government tries to make him out to be doesn't me that he isn't guilty of some pretty serious crimes.  But that's really for the Iraqi court to decide.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe that the guy was railroaded, but I don't think he is as bad as the government tries to make him sound. After all we always label our enemies monsters or reds or something to detract from them that they are still in the end human beings. I read something interesting and have been trying to do some more research to prove it true or false.. but the article was talking about how it wasn't Saddam who was responsible for the gassing. <br />
<br />
A report prepared by the top CIA official handling the matter says Saddam Hussein was not responsible for the massacre, and indicates that it was the work of Iranians. Further, the Scott inquiry on the role of the British government has gathered evidence that following the massacre the United States in fact armed Saddam Hussein to counter the Iranians chemicals for chemicals <br />
<br />
Have to research a bit more to see if I can find similar articles etc etc. <br />

1. It appears to me that we are holding people in Guantanimo and abusing them. The Surpreme Court has recently ruled that 200 of them are entitled to a hearing.

<br />
Innitially the prisoner abuse scandal was presented as the acts of a few bad apples at one site unencouraged by anyone in authority.<br />
<br />
It appears to me that policies were made and carried out that went beyond the bounds, orders were given that should not have been, an Iraqii General, a PoW was murdered under interogation, and thus far instead of using early convictions to get cooperation from the convicted anyone higher up the chain of command is being protected from proscecution.<br />
<br />
2. The reasons stated for invading Iraq were by and large not true. I resented the Gulf of Tonkin sham incident being used to set policy back during Viet Nam. I'm sorry if I believe we should be a nation of truthtellers even if the entire rest of the world lies.<br />
<br />
In all, I get a sense of an administration that plays fast and loose with the truth. It's like Clinton lying about Monica, except in this case people die, are tortured, people suffer, etc.<br />
<br />
Months ago I hoped the administration would just &quot;own up&quot;, say mistakes were made, and this is what we are going to do about it. Now, I believe they aren't offering an explanation because there just isn't anything they can say that's plausable except - We lied.<br />

Probably time you looked up the word &quot;Fact&quot; in the dictionary.  You use it, and many other words incorrectly.  Facts can not be &quot;yours&quot; or &quot;Mine&quot;, those are called opinions, and they are different than facts.<br />
<br />
You are entitled to your opinions, but facts are universal, something which you seem to dismiss whenever they don't suit your argument, which is basically all of the time.  You don't have facts, you just have an opinion, and you spout the same shit over and over without really having a source for your opinion.  That's fine, but don't be surprised when people call you uninformed when your jaws part and words fall out.</div></div><hr />

I understand that what Russia, France and the like say does not affect the US as much as what or Persident says. But people are quoting what they say as fact. What France and Russia say is not fact. Many claim Bush lied and yet believe much of what France says, Their is no prof that Bush lied but it is stated as fact. Many countrys believed their were WMD in Iraq something over looked by many just trying to make their points.<br />
<br />
I to have a problem when their is no due process. I do not have a problem with these people getting a hearing.  But many of you attach an evil motive to what happened. I do not, I truly believe they thought they were keeping our country safe. Forgive me if I dont find putting pantys on someone head to be torture. Wrong yes torture no. Should we get to the bottom of it sure, but once again you are claiming as fact something not in evadince. That being that Bush oked it<br />
<br />
You claim the reasons stated for invaiding Iraq were in large part not ture. Ok I will admit their was no WMD at the time we went in. However most countrys believed their was WMD. Many countrys didnt want us to invaid but they still thought there was WMD. SO when someone stats BUsh lied about it I guess many countrys and leaders were lieing, including John Kerry who not only voted for the war but said on the senete floor that Iraq had WMD. Oh thats right he was mislead by Bush, or was that Cliton who said the same thing in 1998 when he bombed an asprin factroy and stated his goal was to remove Saddam.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I find sad is that, were many of you on this board to have your way Saddam would still be in power, killing and raping. You seem to justify this by saying the US was the bad guys here we should have left him to kill as he liked. In your world he should have not been removed. But I wonder if you would still feel this way were you to be the one inslaved by him.<br />

 We are greatly concerned about any possible linkup between terrorists and regimes that have or seek weapons of mass destruction...In the case of Saddam Hussein, we've got a dictator who is clearly pursuing and already possesses some of these weapons.. A regime that hates America and everything we stand for must never be permitted to threaten America with weapons of mass destruction. <br />
<br />
Dick Cheney, 6/20/2002, Detroit fund raiser<br />
<br />
 Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.  <br />
<br />
Dick Cheney, 8/26/2002, Speech at VFW National Convention<br />
<br />
 There is already a mountain of evidence that Saddam Hussein is gathering weapons for the purpose of using them. <br />
<br />
Ari Fleischer, 9/6/2002, press conference<br />
<br />
 Iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons, and is rebuilding the facilities used to make more of those weapons. We have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons -- the very weapons the dictator tells us he does not have.  <br />
<br />
George W. Bush, 10/5/2002, radio address<br />
<br />
After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon...<br />
<br />
...We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas <br />
<br />
 George W. Bush, 10/7/2002, speech in Cincinnati<br />
<br />
It has rebuilt its civilian chemical infrastructure and renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard, sarin, and VX. <br />
<br />
 John Bolton, 11/1/2002, speech to the Hudson Institute<br />
<br />
And this, to me, is the best one of all, although NOT the last....<br />
<br />
The president of the United States and the secretary of defense would not assert as plainly and bluntly as they have that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction if it was not true, and if they did not have a solid basis for saying it. <br />
<br />
Ari Fleischer, 1/9/2003, press question.<br />
<br />
 There's more, of course, but as you can plainly see (if not plainly admit), he flatly stated that Iraq had them. To date they have found:<br />
<br />
 No trailers or mobile labs. The two they supposedly found were hydrogen producers for balloons for artillery usage.<br />
<br />
 No WMD.<br />
<br />
 No storage facilities.<br />
<br />
 No WMD factories.<br />
<br />
 A couple handsful of buried, rotted shells from the Iran-Iraq war/first Gulf war that were unusable.<br />
<br />
 THERE'S your 'imminent threat.'<br />

 Not Saddam, or WMD, but the sheeplike masses that swallowed it and voted this guy into the most powerful position on Earth. Thanks, guys, from the bottom of my toilet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off Hillaan, let me clear something up once and for all.  I am not a left wing liberal.  Admittedly from your perspective you probably consider me one because I disagree with you.  Well disagreeing with you, or thinking that President Bush is a lousy president who at the very least misled the Nation through incompetence, does not make anyone a left wing liberal.   From where I stand all it does is define them as being at least somewhat in touch with the real world.  Now, that was editorial opinion.  Let's get down to some facts, shall we?<br />
<br />
Fact:  The Bush administration clearly stated early and often that Saddam Hussain, the President of Iraq, had and was attempting to procure more weapons of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
Fact:  Based on this assertation by the Bush administration, which was presented as having documented and proven evidence upon which we could base significant reliance, an invasion of Iraq was launched.  <br />
<br />
Fact:  This invasion  resulted in hundreds, if not thousands of Iraqi deaths.   Most of whom had absolutely nothing to do with WMDs.<br />
<br />
Fact:  Once the invasion was successful and the smoke had cleared, no verifiable evidence of WMDs in any signficant quantity have been found.  Nor have any factories found that could be conclusively shown to have been involved in creating WMDs.  No paper trail could be found.  No credible eye witness testimony.  Nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  The big goose egg.  Nothing to even credibly suggest that someone somewhere in Iraq was doing more than thinking about maybe some day making WMDs.<br />
<br />
Four facts.  If you are going to argue that those facts are wrong, you're going to have to show one or more of the following:<br />
<br />
1) Prove that the Bush administration never claimed there were large quantities of WMDs in Iraq.  I think Partha already addressed that one handily.  <br />
<br />
2) Show that in fact there was no invasion of Iraq.  It didn't happen.  It was all just one big April Fools Day joke or something along those lines.  Good luck on this one for sure.<br />
<br />

When China lies or Russia lies<br />
<br />
I know this is off topic, but I feel strongly enough about this to mention it.<br />
<br />
Dude I am sick of hearing this coming from Americans. Cold war is over. Why are you and what I feel a good chunk of Americans still painting Russia as &quot;the bad guy&quot;? I am sick of it. Probably good chunk of it comes from Hollywood where every Russian ever shown is mafia of some sort. Did you know that &quot;evil&quot; Soviet Union didn't even paint USA as &quot;evil&quot;. What propaganda told back then is that Russia is the best; most definitely much better then America. That was the picture that presented to the people. The one that inspired not taught to hate.</div></div><hr />

When I say when China lies or Russia lies, Bubba nods his head in aggrement thinking &quot;Filthy lying commies.&quot; Once Bubba starts nodding his head, he has trouble changing to shaking his head in disagreement.<br />

If I was to point out Israel violated many many more UN actions than Iraq, Bubba would be torn - &quot;Jews own everything, but at least they are kicking Arab butt.&quot;<br />

If I was to confront Bubba with a direct challange like &quot;Bush lied.&quot;, Bubba doesn't have the circuits to handle that. &quot;Sheet, Bush is jest like me, but rich like I oughta be. IF he lied it was for a gud reason. Prove it yas liberal hippie commie!!!!&quot;<br />

I'm going to use a harsh term here sir and please do not be insulted, but you are ignorant of the facts of what happened there if thats your stance on what occurred there.  Please research on your own (and for God's sake dont use CNN/FoX/ESPN) and you will discover considerably more than just &quot;panties on the head&quot; occurred:<br />
<br />
1. guards instructed dogs to attack prisoners (see photos released in The New Yorker magazine showing a prisoner being attacked in this fashion).<br />
<br />
2. Incidents were prisoners were blind folded, told to face a wall and fire arm placed to the back of their skull (documented in several locations)<br />
<br />
3. forcing prisoners to eat pork, strip naked in public, be naked in the presence of the opposite sex.  Taboos for Muslim's that are just as revolting as a number of taboos we have as christians in the US for religious purposes.  Folks in the US tend to ameliorate these concerns as they have no cultural context by which to understand it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">If you really believe Saddam was railroaded your the one who needs some independent thought. <br />
<br />
Sigh to complete my thoughts (and this is all pretty well documented):<br />
<br />
1. We built Saddam as a part of the cold war doctrine of &quot;regional balance&quot;.  With the fall the Shah of Iran (our previous counter weight to the Soviets) he became even more paramount to support in thr 1980's.<br />
<br />
2. We supplied a great deal of arms to Iraq throughout the 1980's in their 8 year war with Iran.  We ignored &quot;mistakes&quot; by Iraq (such as the bombing of a US naval vessel in 1988) as part of the cost of regional stability.  We also ignored the WW1 style trench/gas warfare both side committed in this war.<br />
<br />
3. Post Iraq/Iran both sides were exhausted economically.  The key point of contention for the entire war was access to a small parcel of land that provided the best natural port in the region (which Iran retained).  <br />
<br />
4. Iraq required cash reserves.  In a disputed claim with Kuwait Iraq claimed that the former was drilling deep slant wells into reserves over its border.  This dispute was raised to the US State department which with the cold war over told them to go jump in a lake.  This was the true precursor to Gulf War I.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying Saddam is a good man.  But there is a body of knowledge out there that shows our responsibility and accountability for these actions as well.  What I'm attempting to do here is get you to understand there is alot of areas of grey and although it may make you feel uncomfortable we all need to own up to it.<br />
<br />
FYI also my personal opinion is that the cold war doctrine we followed was perfectly appropriate and that we also did the right thing in Gulf War I.<br />
<br />
Now I'm curious if WMD/etc all is so important to you why Israel gets a free pass?  Or do you just have no clue what atrocities they inflict (with a great deal of justification mind you) as well.  It would seem the litmus test would be the same?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">First off Hillaan, let me clear something up once and for all.  I am not a left wing liberal.  Admittedly from your perspective you probably consider me one because I disagree with you.  Well disagreeing with you, or thinking that President Bush is a lousy president who at the very least misled the Nation through incompetence, does not make anyone a left wing liberal.   From where I stand all it does is define them as being at least somewhat in touch with the real world.  Now, that was editorial opinion.  Let's get down to some facts, shall we?<br />
<br />
Fact:  The Bush administration clearly stated early and often that Saddam Hussain, the President of Iraq, had and was attempting to procure more weapons of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
Fact:  Based on this assertation by the Bush administration, which was presented as having documented and proven evidence upon which we could base significant reliance, an invasion of Iraq was launched.  <br />
<br />
Fact:  This invasion  resulted in hundreds, if not thousands of Iraqi deaths.   Most of whom had absolutely nothing to do with WMDs.<br />
<br />
Fact:  Once the invasion was successful and the smoke had cleared, no verifiable evidence of WMDs in any signficant quantity have been found.  Nor have any factories found that could be conclusively shown to have been involved in creating WMDs.  No paper trail could be found.  No credible eye witness testimony.  Nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  The big goose egg.  Nothing to even credibly suggest that someone somewhere in Iraq was doing more than thinking about maybe some day making WMDs.<br />
<br />
Four facts.  If you are going to argue that those facts are wrong, you're going to have to show one or more of the following:<br />
<br />
1) Prove that the Bush administration never claimed there were large quantities of WMDs in Iraq.  I think Partha already addressed that one handily.  <br />
<br />
2) Show that in fact there was no invasion of Iraq.  It didn't happen.  It was all just one big April Fools Day joke or something along those lines.  Good luck on this one for sure.<br />
<br />
3) Show that no one died in the invasion of Iraq, it was in fact completely bloodless.  Good luck there also.  <br />
<br />
3) Show that indeed there is credible evidence, evidence that not only U.S. citizens can accept and believe, but the world community can accept and believe, that in fact large quantities of WMDs can be shown to have been in Iraq just prior to or at the time of the invasion or factories can be shown to have irrefutably been in production of WMDs just prior to or at the time of the invasion.  Now this is the one where you seem to base most of your arguement, which primarily consists of &quot;Na ah!&quot;   <br />
<br />
I deal in facts Sir.  Your opinion is not a fact.  If you can show that the facts listed above are wrong in some credible way, I'm willing to listen to what you have to say.  If not, you're not doing anything more than sticking your fingers in your ears and saying &quot;I can't hear you, I can't hear you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fact) Saddam had WMD he used them against Iran and his own people.<br />
<br />
Fact) Saddam kicked out the inspectors in 1998 so we could not tell what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Fact) UN Securty Consuel res 1441 states Saddam had WMD and was atempting to produce them.<br />
<br />
Fact) the CIA and British intelligance Both had what they deemed to be credable evidence that Iraq had WMD and was attempting to produce it.<br />
<br />
Fact) Bill Clition believed Saddam had WMD. He said so in many speaches<br />
<br />
You know, we can play this game all day long but the truth is you wish to overlook anything that does not prove your point you remind me of Mr Moore. Overlooking all facts he disliked or didnt prove his point.  As to the world beliveing, many did the fact that you want to overlook this just proves my point.<br />

<br />
Fact) the CIA and British intelligance Both had what they deemed to be credable evidence that Iraq had WMD and was attempting to produce it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I figured I'd just point out that you are pointing out speculation as being fact here since it turns out that Iraq did not have WMDs.  So instead we invaded a country on shakey information at best and subsequently thousands of lives have been lost.  I'm not saying that Saddam shouldn't have been removed from power,  but don't kid yourself, the government overstepped it's bounds on this one and started a war under false pretense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">Fact) Saddam had WMD he used them against Iran and his own people.<br />
<br />
I'll accept this as fact, given that I have seen documentation of his using them against his own people.  However, had is a key word.  At one point he had some WMDs.  And we didn't feel they were sufficient justification for an invasion at the time he used them, so why is it suddenly justification several years later?  Sorry, doesn't hold up as being logically consistant.<br />
<br />
Fact) Saddam kicked out the inspectors in 1998 so we could not tell what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Yes, Saddam kicked out inspectors and let inspectors back in repeatedly over a number of years.  However, the Bush administration didn't claim that they didn't know what Saddam was doing.   They stated unequivocally that they new what he was doing and had the intelligence information to prove it.  They didn't.  Fact.<br />
<br />
Fact) UN Securty Consuel res 1441 states Saddam had WMD and was atempting to produce them.<br />
<br />
The U.N. Security Council is primarily about politics.  It deals in facts only at its leisure and its whim.  Attempting to use U.N. Security Council resolutions as documentary evidence of anything other than the existence of a U.N. Security Council resolution is like trying to claim that the U.S. Congress ensures that every budget item is an extremely necessary expenditure of tax payer dollars.  It just isn't necessarily so.  The U.N. Security Council saying they believe that Iraq has WMDs isn't evidence. <br />
<br />
Fact) the CIA and British intelligance Both had what they deemed to be credable evidence that Iraq had WMD and was attempting to produce it.<br />
<br />
Apparently your definition of credible evidence and mine dramatically differ.  My definition of credible evidence is that when someone says they have the evidence that another country is producing and stockpiling WMDs, that when said country is invaded, there are in fact a fair number of WMDs somewhere.  Not just a few old and decaying chemical shells down in the back basement of some facility.  But WMDs in sufficient quantity that people go, yeah that was clearly a threat!<br />
<br />
Fact) Bill Clition believed Saddam had WMD. He said so in many speaches<br />
<br />
What Bill Clinton believed or didn't believe is fairly irrelevant.  Unless you're attempting to say that the Bush administration called former President Clinton in for consultations and based on his input decided to launch an invasion of Iraq?  If so, I would apperciate you presenting something that shows that to be true.   Otherwise, what Bill Clinton believed has absolutely nothing to do with anything since the Bush administration didn't care what he believed.  All they cared about was what they believed. <br />
<br />
See, you're not presenting facts that counter my facts.  Saddam had some WMDs at some point, check.  Saddam kicked out inspectors, check.  The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution or even a couple of dozen resolutions, check.  The Bush administration and the U.S. intelligence network stated they had credible evidence, check.  Bill Clinton may have also believed that Iraq had WMDs, check.  I won't claim any of what you have said it false.  But it doesn't refute my previous facts at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;your kind of proof&quot; - actually, Bush decided what kind of proof was necessarry. Incontrovertable proof that Saddam had Weapons of Mass Destruction in sufficeient quantity to be an imminent threat to the world was if I recall the reason they must be attacked and we could wait on the inspectors no longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;threat out there&quot; - yep you are correct, any threat was &quot;out there&quot; not a threat to the US directly. Given the non-existance of Iraqii artillery, armor, or air force not even a threat locally.<br />
<br />
&quot;defend ourselfs [sic]&quot; - excuse me sir &quot;defend&quot; ourselves? Which Acts of War against the U.S. by Iraq were we responding to? They were boarding our ships, attacked our borders, bockading us wqith their navy? Oooooh we were defending ourselves in advance.... hahahahahahahahahahaha Good gosh almighty, we're down to Bush wanting to be a War President sooooo bad that the school yard bully's excuse - &quot;He was thinking about starting something.&quot; is concidered a Cause of War.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, our allies that help destroy Hitler, England, France, and Russia no longer adequately understand evil and imminent threat. We have a SeKreT KoNPuer that gauges threat 100% correctly and all other countries be dammed.<br />

Agree or disagree with Moore's totally partial bent on Dubya and the gang.. it doesn't matter.  People should always question their governments, and this movie will at the very least cause the questions to be asked.  <br />
<br />
What really stuck with me was the time spent on Bush in the day care when he heard of 9/11.  Or as more aptly, or perhaps brutally, summed up by General Sir Michael Rose, Former Commander of the UN Protection Force in Bosnia: <br />
<br />
&quot;For a full five minutes, Moore cruelly dwells on Bush's vacuous, tortured face in close-up immediately after he had been told about the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. The message is clear. Here is no Roosevelt, Churchill or Thatcher, but a deeply inadequate man whose mind is frozen with indecision and fear. It is a look I know well - if he had been a subordinate commander in battle I would have immediately relieved him of his command.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if you're asshole buddies with Dubya, you gotta admit he looked like a deer in a headlight there.  There's no polishing, spinning or context to be provided or interpreted.  He was challenged by a horrifying attack and he froze.  Is that what passes for leadership in the States these days?</div></div><hr />

Whoever mentioned Roosevelt and Churchill is completely right. We all know what an exceptional leader is like.

All of these links are in response to the charge of Saddam gassing his own people. Much of this info is coming from the CIA. Gassing the Kurdish people was one of the major charges Bush used to get us into the war in the first place. If Saddam is no longer a monster because we can see and hear him on the TV, and he doesnt have WMD, and if he didn't gas his own people.. this will get many people thinking. Even though the Baath Party that Saddam was in did not condone torture, apparently we don't either anymore. <br />

<br />
1) Iraq and Al-Queida have many ties and have for a long time<br />
2) Saddam Hussein gassed his own people (which I dont know and you dont know)<br />
3) Moore hates America and the Troops (and he did call him a fat bastard)<br />
4) There were no good points raised in Moores film (yet he hasnt seen it or didn't even know the name)<br />
5) There are no Connections between the Bin Laden family and the Bush Family. (2 Oil families could not, not have connections.. but theres were much more than they let on)<br />

Yes, we know he had chemical weapons, we know he had a willingness to use them.  But we were at war with Iraq previously, you may or may not recall this event.  At the conclusion of this war Saddam and Iraq were ordered to destroy all such weapons as well as facilities to produce such weapons and allow inspectors to verify this.  I'd like to see the proof that he had weapons of mass destruction when we invaded his country for the second time and started killing Iraqi's that we were supposedly liberating.  Show me the proof that Iraq had anything that violated this agreement and in so doing warranted not only the lose of innocent Iraqi lives but also the lose of American lives as well?

<br />
We will start with this one.  First,<br />
<br />
<br />
The Tuwaitha nuclear complex was dismantled in the early 1990s after the first Gulf War. But tonnes of nuclear materials remained there, under the seal of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, until the second Gulf War, when it was left unguarded by the U.S.-led invading forces and looted by Iraqi civilians.<br />
<br />
Looks like it was a facilaty that the world was aware of and was non-opporational as of the first Iraq war, and was incapable of producing weapons grade uranium even during the time it was in full production.  But it was dismantle, following the guidlines set out by the U.N., post  Desert Storm.  It was a U.N. fuck up that the uranium was even left there in the first part and it wasn't being used by Saddam, but was instead looted just prior to the US invation.<br />
<br />
Second,<br />
<br />
Sarin and Mustard Gas Discovered in Iraq (http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,120137,00.html)<br />
<br />
This is a much talked about article that is a bunch of crap.  Inside this pre-desert storm era war head was found the 2 components, when mixed, that produces Serin.  However, the contents were so old that they couldn't mix and even those exposed to this were not diagnoised with any ill effects.  Whoever planted the bomb did not even likely know it contained the components for Serin and were just using the war head for the explosives and shrapnel it would produce.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">The Tuwaitha nuclear complex was dismantled in the early 1990s after the first Gulf War. But tonnes of nuclear materials remained there, under the seal of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, until the second Gulf War, when it was left unguarded by the U.S.-led invading forces and looted by Iraqi civilians. <br />
<br />
This is Uranium confiscated by the U.S. during the first Gulf War and that was being kept secure until we, embarrassingly, abandoned it.   Saddam did not have it in his possession.  Not a smoking gun of any kind except perhaps the occassional d'oh factor of human beings.<br />

12 canisters of chemical weapons is still not a great deal, given the tonnes we were led to believe were involved.  If it's 12 canisters of say biological weapons, that would be a horse of a different color.  Can you link the article you're getting that from?<br />

Edit: Okay, read the article.  And it basically amounts to them finding somewhere in the neighborhood of 20, 1991 era, sarin gas artillery shells.  Is this the big reason we invaded and killed thousands?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">From your article.<br />
<br />
The discovery of these shells also does not answer the question of whether Iraq produced chemical weapons after the 1991 Gulf War.<br />
<br />
from the article I linked<br />
<br />
U.S. troops have announced the discovery of other chemical weapons before, only to see them disproved by later tests. A dozen chemical shells were also found by U.N. inspectors before the war; they had been tagged for destruction in the 1990s but somehow were not destroyed.<br />
<br />
Prior to the war, U.N. inspectors had compiled a short list of proscribed items found during hundreds of surprise inspections: fewer than 20 old, empty chemical warheads for battlefield rockets, and a dozen artillery shells filled with mustard gas. The shells had been tagged by U.N. inspectors in the 1990s but somehow not destroyed by them.<br />
<br />
Sarin-type agents produced by Iraq were largely of low quality and degraded shortly after production, U.N. inspectors said in a March 2003 report. They said it was unlikely that agents produced in the 1980s would still work today.</div></div><hr />

In one of the very articles you link it talks about chemical weapons Saddam is thought to have had in his possession which are unaccountted for.   Can you in all honesty say that President Bush knows exactly where all U.S. chemical weapons are stored or that there aren't potentially old stores of chemical weapons in the U.S. that have been forgotten about or lost in inventory?  And if it's possible in the U.S. it seems like a forgone conclusion that it would happen in someplace like Iraq.</div></div><hr />

 The only thing missing here is your brain. We didnt go in because he a gassed the Kurds. But his gassing of them proved 2 things. One he had a willingness to use them and 2 he had them. You keep saying Bush lied about Saddam having WMD you just proved yourself wrong you truly are an idiot. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok please answer this question (as WMDs are so evil and a scourge to all humanity): WHY DID WE DO NOTHING WHEN IRAQ USED MUSTARD GAS AND OTHER WMDS DURING ITS WAR WITH IRAN?  Please answer the question....support the illogic of Reagan/Bush Sr in ignoring this behaviour 1980s and the morale high ground of asserting intolerance for in it in 2003?  Its not a question of whether there EVER were WMDs (I question why the Kurd incident in the mid 1990s has any more saliance than what occurred in the 1980s)...its a question if in 2003 had Saddam had them (clearly he didn't).  Its also a question of why we did NOTHING when it was politically expedient do nothing (moral certainity does not allow for this inaction)?<br />
<br />
Also, WHY IS OK FOR ISRAEL TO HAVE WMDS WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN REPRESSION/KILLING OF PEOPLE WITHIN ITS BORDERS?  Why does the adminstration allow anti-freedom/terror actions by one of our own allies?<br />
<br />
Your position is one of ludicrous hyprocrisy.  There is no morale high ground on WMds here but conditional responses with specficic policy goals in mind (see the Dominance doctrine espoused by Rumsfeld).  This is the glaring core of the currents adminstrations dishonesty with the American people.<br />
<br />
 Who said &quot;Evil&quot; and &quot;Russia&quot; in the same sentance? I am perplexed. I, personally, like Russia. <br />
<br />
The Russians are not evil.  The Soviets were (I define evil as threatening on a daily basis every single life on this planet).  I also define as evil all the policy planners that held the entire human race hostage based on the policy of MAD from the late 1950s through 1989.<br />
<br />
 The Tuwaitha nuclear complex <br />
<br />
If memory serves this was the complex destroyed by the Israeli's in the early 1980s in a rather daring airstrike (forgive me if I am wrong...I do not state this as a fact I'm driving of a 20 year old memory here).  They stated that because the world would do nothing they would take security concerns into their own hands and as a direct result the formal Iraq nucleur program was severerly curtailed.<br />

<br />
While in the 1980s I was stationed in Key West, Florida.  The naval base I was at was right next to the Fort Zachery Tayler national park.  The history of this park that it began as a Civil War era Fort and then was eventually converted into military outpost of concrete bunkers during WW II.  In the 1980s some excavation was done at the site in an attempt to locate potential Civil War era artifacts and restore part of the fort so it could be used as a museum/tourist attraction .<br />
<br />
What did they find?  They found literally tons of buried cannons, black powder, and black powder cannon balls.  Still explosive.  Still a danger.  Buried under a WW II bunker complex.  Enough black powder explosives to have torn that bunker complex apart if a bomb had ever actually landed on it.  The archives had no record of such a munitions dump being buried in place at Fort Zachery Tayler.  It was completely unexpected.  And the Navy Seals spent a couple of months hauling these old, decaying, and extremely unstable explosives off the coast of Key West and destroying them.   The explosions woke me out of a sound sleep, since I was rotating through graveyard shift regularly, more than once.</div></div><hr />

Think. For a second. Lets play a little game:<br />
<br />
England invades the US after no Provocation, they are here to get rid of President Bush. In the process they kill your family, your friends, and pretty much ruin your life. Now, there is this organization called Al'Queda that says that they will help you get revenge on these people that invaded your land. <br />
<br />
We have been feeding Al'Queda more and more new angsty helpers to help against us, and many other people. If there were actually the WMD's that they said there were, I would've probly not said much about the war except my side still believing that there are better ways to deal with problems. <br />
<br />

<br />
personally, I think you are a lunatic.         Back to England. If we attacked England because they we Supplying weapons to Iraq, and we lost, and then England dropped nuclear Bombs on LA, DC, and NYC. And then some fool said, we should've dropped two more! I think you lack any compassion or empathy, sir. Think about how many innocent lives were taken! You are so wrapped up in trying to be a patriotic american that you can't even see anything wrong our government does because you are jaded beyond comprehension. I don't know, I usually don't flame people like this but when one person thinks that dropping 2 more of those bombs on Japan just because. <br />
 People are people, people don't have that much control over their governments, no matter how much you wish you did. Governments can be dumb, and the people will be punished for the decisions of a few. <br />
<br />
The reason the Japanese attacked us was because Germany and Italy were angry about the US supplying the Allied powers and Japan was told to attack since they were so close and could do it stealthily enough. <br />
<br />
the entire middle-east hates us, they attacked us without provokation, we fucked em up....it's pretty much that simple.<br />
<br />
No, they just hate people like you. You are blinded, sir. Enjoy your sheeping around with your shepard, Mr. Bush. I can't say anything to convince you, because you are blinded; so, I will just end here. I hope you will stop your ignorance one day. <br />

The left in this country keep saying over and over that Bush lied to America.  Sorry to burst your bubble.  But the ball was in Sadams Court.  13 years and 17 resolutions pretty much saying the same thing.  In fact Resolution 1444 authorized the use of force if Sadam did not comply with Resolution 1444.  Sadam continually lied to America and the world not Bush.  The resolutions stated that he destroy his biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons under UN inspector supervision.  This never happened it also stated that if he had destoryed them to show some sort of documented proof.  This also never happened.  Bill Clinton said he had weapons of mass destruction in 1998 and infact he bomed Iraq for this reason.  John Kerry said in 2003 that if Sadam goes unchecked he poses a great threat to the world.  He also voted yes to use force against Iraq I might add.  The United Nations said he had them in resolution 1444.  Should be blaming Sadam for this war not Bush. <br />

Pogi, you need to wake up and smell the coffee.  Iraq was no imminent threat to the United States.  All the evidence presented to date indicates just the opposited.  There has been no connection made from Iraq to the Al Quaida.  There has been no WMDs found.  Saddam thumbed his nose at the world, yes.  He lied, absolutely.  Does that mean Bush has been forth coming with the facts?  NO.<br />
<br />
While the U.S. might have the right to protect itself, it doesn't have the right to blow the crap out of every pissant little country that happens to annoy it without having any really compelling reason for it.  The really compelling reason Bush presented has turned out to be complete 100% bullshit.  So now it just looks like Bush had a hard on for Saddam and was going to do what ever it took to take him down.  Period.  Trying to justify it is just weak and lame.  We KNOW better.</div></div><hr />

interesting article on Farenheit 9/11.<br />
<br />
From the Article<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps Kristof, like President Bush, refuses to read. At least that would explain why he missed the raging international debate surrounding the Bush administration's well-documented, then-secret oil negotiations with the Taliban in the summer of 2001. <br />
<br />
The book FORBIDDEN TRUTH:  U.S.-TALIBAN SECRET OIL DIPLOMACY AND THE FAILED HUNT FOR BIN LADEN (can be found on Amazon) was an international bestseller. Written by French Intelligence experts Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquié, the book asserts that the Bush administration threatened the Taliban with the now- infamous words: &quot;Either you accept our carpet of gold or we'll carpet you with bombs.&quot;  The threat was made about a month before the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. &quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u188"><b>Pogi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p188">O, made a mistake it was resolution 1441 not 44.  You can find this document at the UN website.  Should prolly go read it.  In 2002 the security council voted for this resolution allowing the use of force if he did not comply with UN demands.  Might I add Russia, France, Germany all voted yes for this resolution.   When Sadam did not comply it was only Bush wanting to make the inital push to go to war.  If you want to blame someone blame the entire world, everyone lied as you say because there are no WMD's (which they did find wmd's Seren Gas ) altough not stock piles that were mentioned.  Kerry even said he had them and it had to be taken care of and voted yes for the use of force.  Clinton said he had them. <br />
<br />
We are in the War on Terrorism, if you cannot see that Sadam was the leader of a large scale terrorist group you need your eyes checked.  If Sadam continued to go un-checked he would have posed a much larger threat down the road.  If Sadam produced wmd's and Osma wanted to purchase them to kill americans I don't doubt for a second that Sadam would.  Sadam was a threat to us and the world.

<br />
Ya, just like that War on Drugs. I still see drugs around everywhere...we musta lost that one too eh?<br />
<br />
So we shouldn't fight it at all??  Sorry but I belive we must confront it and stand against it.  Because 15 years from now I do not want to be worried about dropping my son off at a movie theater and have to worry about someone walking in with a bomb strapped to their chest just like in Israel.  Don't tell me that will never happen because it can if we do nothing.<br />

RELATED TO IRAQ, was the part of the sentence you very conveniently desided to leave out. Seems like you do that a lot, leave out important facts.<br />
<br />
Didn't know the only way you could be a terrorist was to attack the united states. News to me.<br />
<br />
What does being a terrorist in Iraq have to do with being a threat to the U.S?  What does the world being wrong about there being large stockpiles of WMDs have to with out President coming out on National television stating as a known fact, with evidence in hand that was compelling and convincing, that there are beyond a shadow of a doubt large quantities of WMDs in Iraq?  <br />
<br />
The U.S. didn't go to war with Iraq because the German government thought Iraq had WMDs.  Nor because the Israeli government thought so.  The U.S. went to war because our President stepped up and told us that Iraq did.  And not only was he wrong, but the evidence he claims to have had to prove it is no where to be seen.<br />
<br />
And as for the rest, I hate to say it, but you come across as exactly like the right wing war mongering hate filled extremist that scares the bejesus out of the moderates in this country.   You don't just scare the left wingers, you scare everyone who doesn't think like you do, because in your mind anyone who doesn't agree with you isn't worthy.  It almost borders on a Nazi mindset and it sends cold shivers up and down people's spines.</div></div><hr />

In 15 years the young boys in the middle east will have grown up. These boys fed with images of American soldier's torturing people in Iraq,  images of dead civilian in Iraq, Palestine. Growing up with the fear of being bombed or invaded. <br />
Will it be hard for terrorists to have them hate america ?  to fight americans ? <br />
Bin Laden and G. W. Bush succeeded in getting a lot of people hate each other, is it going to make your world safer ? <br />
<br />
If you think, now, that invading Iraq have and / or will improve U.S. citizen security you are just stupid, it's pretty clear to everyone that this was a huge waste. If you though that Iraq was a threat, it's probably not your fault considering you were given misleading information by the media / intelligence services / politician, but yet ignorance is not excuse, you should have known, especialy when pretty much the rest of the world tells you to not go. <br />

20,000 people weren't allowed to vote in the election because they had a similar or same name as a known Florida Felon. <br />
<br />
Using your Logic and words, Pogi, here is what I have come up with.<br />
<br />
Yeah we fed weapons to Bin Laden so they could fight off an evasion from Russia I think it was in the early 80's. Don't know how that is considered terrorism though. In my regards to the comment I specifically said for the use to kill americans. If you can't see that you are blind and nieve.<br />
<br />
If Sadam continued to go un-checked he would have posed a much larger threat down the road. If Sadam produced wmd's and Osma wanted to purchase them to kill americans I don't doubt for a second that Sadam would. Sadam was a threat to us and the world. The world is a much better place without his terrorist network.<br />
<br />
So what you are saying here, is that Saddam supplying weapons to Bin Laden (since you think he would've done so and has such a strong connection with him! ) is wrong. But, the US supplying Weapons to Bin Laden, as you said, is right. <br />
This is the same logic that says &quot;Us attacking Iraq is fine, but if Iraq attacks us they are in big trouble!!&quot; It doesnt make sense.. WE are shown as the terrorists right now.. WE were the ones who attacked unprovoked (as the evidence shows now.). <br />
<br />
<br />
John Kerry said in 2003 that if Sadam goes unchecked he poses a great threat to the world. He also voted yes to use force against Iraq I might add.<br />
<br />
John Kerry was fed the evidence that the Bush administration fed to the public. I watched the presentation Bush and Powell did.. He highlighted places that were &quot;KNOWN&quot; chemical plants, or &quot;KNOWN&quot; WMD Facilities. If they were known places.. how could've they vanished? They weren't WMD facilities.. they were just some buildings. Many Senators, not just John Kerry, were fooled. <br />
<br />
We are in the War on Terrorism, if you cannot see that Sadam was the leader of a large scale terrorist group you need your eyes checked.<br />
<br />
What Terrorist Group? Al Queda is Bin Ladens. He is in one group, that is the Government of Iraq. Last I checked that wasn't a terrorist organization.. I don't think I'm the one that is in need of the glasses here. <br />
<br />
You can ignore everything we say that you don't agree with, your choice. I hope you get some glasses, the world will make sense if you let yourself see.  <br />

Are you old enough to remember the first Iraq invasion? (not a slam on your maturity level, I&quot;m just asking).  I am.  I remember the TV coverage as the sky rained fire over Baghdad.  I remember the tracers from anti aircraft guns lighting up the sky in the middle of the nite.  I also remember that literally overnite, the Iraqi infrastructure was completely destroyed by laser guided bombs.  We could literally put a bomb thru a window, down a chimney, where ever the fuck we wanted, and we have the video to prove it.<br />
<br />
I also know that not a single F-117A Nighthawk was so much as even SCRATCHED over Iraq.  They had nothing to do about it.  We came in, did what we wanted, and the first indication that they had we were there, was the explosions. <br />
<br />
I know that the Iraqi tank division was completely decimated by the A-10 Warthogs.  State of the art tanks were turned to smoking piles of twisted debris at our will.  What could they do about it?  Not a damned thing, as there are MANY stories of Hog pilots coming back to the base with half their wing blown off, one engine not operational, and various other structural damage, AND THE PLANE WAS STILL FLYING AND STILL KICKING ASS.<br />
<br />
Iraq is no fucking threat to America.  This isn't some underdog movie here where the Iraqi government gets their ass handed to them, stripped militarily, and then struggles back to strike a death blow at the evil oppressors.  Even IF Iraq was manufacturing nukes or chemical weapons, their arsenal currently includes no vehicle or method of actually transporting said weapon to American soil.  Iraq doesn't have ICBM's, they don't have long range strategic bombers, and they don't have a submarine fleet.  What they have is some antiquated Russian MIG's who would last all of 10 seconds against the state of the art interceptor planes that the US employs in it's various branches of service.<br />
<br />
The first Gulf war had a justifiable purpose.  Iraq invaded a sovereign nation, that's a no no.  We don't do that, and we taught them a lesson, we demilitarized them, and we let the UN inspectors make sure that nothing like that was going to happen again.  This war, was based on a farce.  Whether it was faulty intelligence information, or DELIBERATLY FALSIFIED information to feed our President's agenda is basically a moot point here.  They had no chemical weapons, they had no biological weapons, they have no uranium, they DON'T HAVE SHIT.  And in the process of finding that out, we have become the ones who invade sovereign nations and dictate our will on the world.  That's fucking wrong.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I have absolutely no idea how people can stick so strongly to the people who blatantly lied about our motives for invading the country, have got caught in that lie, and there are many people who are still unwavering in their support of this administration.  I'm not a fucking liberal.  I hate the democrats just as much as I hate the republicans.  I know bullshit when I hear it, and this, qualifies as grade A bullshit.

As near as I can tell, Kerry will do his duty, act honorably, and do what is right and consistant with American values. He did all this when he volunteered to serve in Viet Nam, because of first-hand experiance opposed the war, and served his country in the Senate. I think he is driven by Duty, Honor, and Country.<br />
<br />
At a minimum Donald Rumsfield and his fellow travelers will be working for one of the many private contractors that they hired to provide over 10% of the manpower, mercenaries, security for our Iragi puppet goverment, and our many talented &quot;interrogators&quot;. I predict Haliburton - do you disagree?<br />

A new cabinet, National Security Advisor, a less cosy relationship between the Bin Ladin's and the office of the President will surely change things quite a bit.<br />

This is not a case that the devil we know is better than the devil we don't. We know GWB and he's the scariest man that EVER has held this office.<br />

I fully expect OBL to be caught or killed btw. The public price on his head is $10M. I rather imagine the private price is muuuch higher. Given all the money private companies are making in Afghanistan and Iraq, $100M isn't too much to pay for his capture and GWB's re-election.<br />

I'd like to see the article or speech you get this information from.  I'm not necessarily a big Kerry fan mind you, but this seems a bit hard to believe.  Therefore before I accept it as unvarnished truth, I'd like to see something more to support it than merely your word that it's so.  Like some reports from a fairly impartial news source, not the drivel of some right wing editorial commentary.  For example, Rush is not what I consider an impartial news source with credibility.<br />
<br />
And if we really want to get down to cases the facts of the matter are that George W. Bush Junior used the money and influence of his family to avoid his military obligation during the Vietnam War.  While the patriotic and the poor went over, fought, and in many cases died for their country, Bush stayed at home, safe and sound, supposedly showing up for his monthly drills in the reserves.  And there is some doubt as to whether or not he actually did that.<br />
<br />
Kerry at least has the distinction of having actually served his country in a manner that can actually be defined as service, rather than him merely side stepping having to serve it.  Frankly, a man who has actually been in the military and seen combat gets points in my book.  It's one of those things lots of people talk about but only those who've really been there can address with credibility.  Bush can talk all the smack in the world about being a war president, but when the chips were down, where the hell was he?  And a man who has survived combat has a much healthier respect for the costs involved with sending others into combat, I don't care what your political background is.  Seeing men die with bullets in their guts has got to impact a man.</div></div><hr />

While I don't know that Kerry &quot;admitted&quot; to any of these things........<br />
<br />
Villages were burnt down under three circumstances:<br />
1. There was an effort to deny the VC refuge in smaller villages in several areas. The village &quot;mayor&quot;/elders were &quot;consulted&quot;, the population was evacuated to larger nearby villages surrounded with wire and having &quot;self-defence forces&quot; insurrng they would be less likely to be unable to say No to the VC. The VC was known to enter smaller unprotected villages, demand support, and kill village leaders if they didn't get it. The descision to consolidate villages into American controlled was made at the highest levels - not by platoon leaders. Such actions, if Kerry was ordered to participate in them, may have been a factor in causing him to eventually oppose the war.<br />
<br />
2. American troops came under fire from a village or a village was known to have an arms stockpile or otherwise be supporting the VC. Sadly even a house of worship under such circumstances might find itself a legitimate target.<br />
<br />
3. Vengence attacks such as the Mei Lai Massacre. This is the only situation where a War Crime is committed. Men, women, and children were killed outright and the village burned. No one has charged Kerry with participating in such an event.<br />
<br />
The 50 Cal machine gun is officially an APC and anti-aircraft weapon. Ever since it came into use, it has been routinely been used to fire on people. I might add flame throwers have also been used extensively for this purpose. While such use is frowned upon, no one has ever to my knowledge been disciplined for using this weapon on enemy troops. The VC did not have an air force or APC's. Yet the 50 cal was standard issue and found everywhere in Viet Nam. It's use was particularly prevelent in the urban warfare during the Tet Offensive.<br />
<br />
Intentionally shooting unarmed civilians is an atrocity. Killing them by the ten's of thousands in &quot;collateral&quot; damage is not. No Fire Zones are decided, but not subject to any international agreements. Someone shoots at you in Saigon, you have the right to shoot back. However, there are numerous &quot;war stories&quot; of GI's having &quot;target practice&quot; at civilians. I'm unaware that Kerry has been accused of any such conduct. It may be indeed that he was ordered to fire on a target in a No Fire Zone - field commanders (people higher up than Kerry) CAN and do give such orders. Another reason he might have eventually opposed the war.<br />
<br />
Your list of &quot;atrocities&quot; intended to besmirch a genuine war hero is pathetic. If this is the kind of crap being reported on Fox News (owned like 175 other TV stations, magazines, and newspapers by that arch-conservative Rupert Murdoch) then there is apparently no limit what conservatives will do to steal yet another election and deflect attention from their candidate George W. (it does NOT stand for &quot;War Hero&quot; btw) Bush.<br />

Hey, you can't say that about Bush cause no one knows anything about his military service.  You see, the files that could have proved that he didn't shrug off his military duty were destroyed.<br />
<br />
http://www.genslab.com/gwbrecords.htm<br />
<br />
Oh wait, that's not it.<br />
<br />
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3880141.stm<br />
<br />
See, my theory is that he was a member of the super secret Air National Guard Anti-Communist Black Ops Unit and was sent to infultrate and bring down the Russian Communist Regiem from the inside.  Any record of his involvment with the US military during this time had to be destroyed to both protect Bush from Communist revenge plots as well as to absolve the US of any possible involvment with this highly secret and dangerous mission.  So you see, Bush is clearly single handedly responsible for the end of communism in Russia and the birth of a Democratic Russian society.  This drive has continued on in his presidency as he again strives to bring down a harsh dictator and form a free democratic society in Iraq.  Though he can't tell you what his motivation and past experience is, because it &quot;never happened&quot; according to military records *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*, but this is his true motivation.<br />
<br />
What do you think about Kerry's military service now?  Bet he never brought an end to communism in an entire country single handedly before.  Of course I have no concrete proof of this occurance but through hearsay and conjecture I have a gut feeling that this is 100% correct.</div></div><hr />

following orders, you must have missed the part where he said granted, then he realized he would be putting all that on himself and immediatly after he said granted, he said o, uh ordered to do. The way he justifies these actions is he did the same thing 1000's of others soldiers did.  <br />
<br />
Also note on his voting record, he said in his compain speech that he would rely more on the intelligence of the national community.  But after the first world trade center boming he still preceeding to vote yes to cut our intelligence spending by 7 billion dollars.  I don't think he has our national security has a priority aka protecting americans.  He is more interested in what the world sees him as and wants despertly to cater to them.<br />

O, almost forgot that if you are ordered to do something directly against the Geneva Convention I belive you have the right to decline that order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">Yeah, okay Pogi. Kerry is a war criminal that should be prosecuted for his crimes.  Now, why exactly hasn't the Bush administration followed up on that, since they're the law enforcement branch of the government?<br />

<br />
However, I was sent this website this week and it has some interesting info. It may not be any more factual than the movie you saw, but it's probably partly based in fact also (just like the movie.)<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think we know all the real info that people at the top do/did about Iraq/911/Al Quaeda and I don't think we should. Down the road, sure but not right now. You either trust your governmental procedures or you don't. Our leaders may make mistakes, who doesn't, but at least we're better off than most.<br />

<br />
Check out this site, It's my side's version of F9/11<br />
<br />
I can honestly say I was kind of dissapointed when I saw this came out, I don't like seeing republicans criticize the other side so much, but I guess the only thing we can do is fight fire with fire. At least this site is truthful (and can be proven truthful) in many of it's points, unlike F9/11, just look at Kerry's voting record on the site (Yes, it's probably only his partial voting record, but I think that his entire record should be something you look at very carefully if Kerry's your man) <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to start shit with anyone, if you wanna look at the site look at it, if it pisses you off don't flame me about it, I'm just putting it out there incase anyone wants to see it.<br />
<br />
ps... that jibjab clip was funny as hell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Thromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">oops duplicate post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u223"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p223">Well, three things to note about that site when you look at the 'Real John Kerry'.<br />
<br />
 One, just like with Bush, any quote you see with '...' in it from the RNC has been bobbitized to remove any bits that might be logical. Therefore, they should be ignored. Just like if someone quoted me as saying the sentence above,<br />
<br />
 'One, just like with Bush...the RNC has been bobbitized. Therefore, they should be ignored.' YagetwhatImean?<br />
<br />
 Two, voting records are a really poor way of judging someone, literally. Congressional bills are not simple two line sentences, and every bill ends up with some kind of lobbying in it - a gun bill might have a tax break for toaster manufacturers inserted in it, trying to work around any objections people have to tax breaks for toaster manufacturers. A lot of bills are also brought to the floor solely as weapons to use against the other side of the aisle. This happens on both sides often enough that I ignore that as well.<br />
<br />
 Lastly, they claimed he only got a 35% lifetime score from the Chamber of Commerce. He got a 36% score. I dislike fudged numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
kthx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u226"><b>Thromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p226">I agree that the site is skewed a bit, that's one reason I was comparing it to Fahrenheit 9/11 (Which is supposed to be the topic of this thread) Although I don't believe the RNC skews the facts in such a manner as Moore has.<br />
<br />
I don't agree however that senate records are a bad way to judge a candidate. True, bills can be used as political tools to force the other side to make an unpopular vote and lose support, and if you don't agree with one of his votes, do some research, but to simply ignore his past 20 years in the Senate because some bills are political tools seems a bit rediculous to me. It's likely that if you did look at his voting record you might support his votes. All I'm saying is that you owe it to yourself and the rest of the country to find out about both candidates records, and their stance on important issues. But do the research on your own, don't let NBC, FOX, or Michael Moore make the decision for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u227"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p227">I certainly wouldn't ignore John Kerry's last 20 years in the Senate, but I'm far more concerned with George Bush Jr.'s last 4 years in the Presidency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>Thromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">And that's fine too, it's good to be skeptical. I however feel that GW has done a great job as president in the past four years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">Compared to whom, exactly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u231"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p231">See, my theory is that he was a member of the super secret Air National Guard Anti-Communist Black Ops Unit and was sent to infultrate and bring down the Russian Communist Regiem from the inside. <br />
<br />
Yeah he probably had them all sit down with him to watch football with him so he have them choke on beer and pretzels.<br />
<br />
OMG are these idiots serious about Kerry as a war crime criminal?  Talk about flip/flop by the republican-rigtht wing....guy who coulda been in college hiding volunteers for active duty.  Then seeks out active duty in a hazordous position.  Then does his duty.  Do they support war veterans or not?<br />
<br />
I think if you look at Kerry's Senate record for the BCCI scandal and his foreign services record in the 80s you will se how ridiculous those accusations are as well.  Attack his social record in the Senate...that i think you might have a point about.<br />
<br />
Yet we have a guy in office now who dodged active duty, had a number of drunken driving arrests and actively used cocaine on a regular basis in this period...and that isnt fit as a topic of conversation?</div></div><hr />
