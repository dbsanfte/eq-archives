We are tired of the leveling grind on Blue and want to start a Shaman/Warrior duo on a Red Server.  The chief reason we decided to change was that, even though the level grind is still there, the PvP element of risk would liven things up a bit.  SO my questions are-<br />
<br />
1.	Is Shaman/Warrior duo a decent combo for PvP?<br />
2.	Are there any guilds that recruit new PvPers?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />

Warrior - one of the worst classes for pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A shaman/SK combo is not something I'd care to face as just about anyone. Between Malaisment, Slow, Snare, and a deep pile of dots backed up by melee damage that you can't really just ignore, I suspect there's some real potency here. However, take this with a grain of salt, I'm just a bluebie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 out of 3 isn't bad!<br />
<br />
1. SKs will own you. Don't bother.<br />
2. Warriors are only the worst if you know how not to play.<br />
3. Rogues are pretty damn good in PvP once you learn how to do a backstab from the front. Also, poison is a great PvP tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chadekaz</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent 3 years on VZ before I moved to Brell and played both a warrior and an SK.  The shammie/sk combo would be a hundred times better.   Being able to dark or snare in a pvp encounter is a HUGE plus.  Another great combo would be a shammie/ranger combo.  The ability to track is a nice perk and they can also snare.  <br />
<br />
I've played all three of the melee classes mentioned so far and if it were me I'd go with the shammie/SK setup.  While the ability to track is nice the SK's ability to FD will come in very handy.  There's going to be plenty of times where people will train mobs on you in an attempt to give you an exp death.  Being able to FD and have your shammie gate will prove to be invaluable in my opinion.  Not to mention the fact that...what goes around comes around.  Some numbskull tries to FD train you, lay it right back on him.  Another plus would be the ability to summon your corpses.  If someone is corpse camping you just make your way into the zone somewhere and summon your corpses.<br />
<br />
As far as guilds go..you won't have a problem finding one.  Guilds on PvP servers are a matter of day to day survival.  Pickup groups are nowhere near as common and you'll find alot of zones you're used to seeing alot of people in are underutilized on pvp servers.  Guilds are how you get groups and get things done on a pvp server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make a shammie and sk.<br />
<br />
Warriors are good in PvP, in fact melees in general are superior to casters due to what people can get resists up to nowadays.  That is more true the higher you go up in levels.  What good is a 3k nuke for a wizard when it's nerfed in PvP to 66% and gets resisted 90% of the time?  Even lures are commonly resisted nowadays.  But SK's are better than warriors for a lot of reasons, they are all mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Be prepared for all sorts of lameness.  The general atmosphere on PvP servers is do anything to win, the rules of fair play and conduct have been thrown out the window.  If you want to succeed in the PvP environment be prepared to be lame in return.  There are guilds that maintain honor and fair play, and they are usually treated in the same manner by other dishonorable guilds, but they are also laughed at by them because they are generally much weaker and easily beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bilhee</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replys.  I kinda came to the same conclusion about the SK's role.  Another question Tallon Zek Question<br />
We are thinking that we want to play for the underdogs.  From all I have read this appears to be the &quot;good races&quot;. Is a human SK considered a &quot;good race&quot;.  Or more to the point can a human SK and a frog Shaman group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monglok</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play on Sullon Zek and as far as &quot;good race&quot; is concerned, dont do it! Evil reigns over all, take it from a Froglok Warrior. Its a pain in the @$$ to do anything. DE SK and Troll SHM would be the way I'd go if it wern't for so many RL friends playing &quot;Goodies&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RystarVZ</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok if you want a true opinion from someone on a PvP server, Shamans pwn in pvp hands down so that is one of the best choices you could make.  <br />
<br />
After that I would say make a Pally over a SK, SK rock dont get me wrong but in the high end game you just cant beat a pally for overall killing.  Pallys pretty much will kill any SK as long as they dont get DTed (even then a good pally wont allow himself to get DTed ).  The Snare is a nice factor for a SK, but to be real honest in the high end game its really hard to land those unless debuffed, and in that case root will be better anyway.  <br />
<br />
But I will also say this the changes they are talking about making for Warriors may change alot of things so if you want to make a Warrrior go for it, dont let our opinions change your mind.  I play a War and love it, even though I have a disadvantage in pvp.<br />
<br />
anyway just my opinion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chadekaz</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do what makes you happy but playing the underdog team is highly overrated.  Whatever team you choose you'll have plenty of opportunites to get your fill and then some as far as PvP action goes.  All playing the underdog team does is limit the zones you can hunt in for exp and make it harder for you to get ahead as far as character progression goes.  It's why I left VZ in the first place.  Take that for what it's worth.<br />
<br />
With a shammie partner doing debuffs getting dark to stick to PCs will be alot easier to you.  And if you plan on duoing for exp then having a tank that can snare will easily double the rate at which you level and make plat.  Indoor zones usually have better exp modifiers and drops, Guk and Seb being good examples, but if you try hunting there without a snarer/darker you're going to be ass out.  SKs also have a certain intimidation factor to them.  You're not going to want to PvP every single time you log on, sometimes you'll want to exp or quest.  After a couple darks, even if resisted, people will often decide you're not going to be an easy mark and move on.  Alot will leave when they get low on life too since they won't know whether you have your Harm Touch ready to go or not.  And all that is without factoring your shammie partner in.<br />
<br />
TZ/VZ are hard coded by race not deity or class.  So a human SK will be &quot;blue&quot; team with your froglok shammie bud.  You should have no problems with that racial combination.  It's been awhile but I'm fairly certain froggies are blue team.  Someone else who still plays there should be able to confirm or deny that for you.<br />
I haven't played TZ for years but VZ is pretty well lighty/xteam dominated...just as an FYI.<br />
<br />
In any case, PvP servers can be a blast and I wish you the best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Another question Tallon Zek Question<br />

<br />
There is no such thing as PvP teams.<br />
<br />
Almost everyone on Tallon Zek crossteams.<br />
<br />
If you want to try to play PvP teams, you will be in the minority.<br />
<br />
Anyone can group with anyone.  In fact you're probably better off having different races, that way you won't have as much of a chance of having to deal with invulnerable healers, and you yourself can take advantage of having an invulnerable healer at times.<br />
<br />
Make a Barb Shm and a DE SK.<br />
<br />
I think the most common problem you will have if you go evil will be invulnerable DE clerics healing good races you are fighting.  Having a barbarian shaman will help you deal with that.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I played on TZ for about four years as an evil, and I couldn't tell you the races that make up the 3 good teams.  The 3 &quot;good&quot; teams always crossteamed.  No matter what you do you will come across the invulnerable healer problem, but you can minimize it by having the two characters be on different &quot;teams&quot;.<br />
<br />
Or just go straight evil and go Troll SHM and DE SK.  Nice team there.  But expect to be dealing with DE clerics that you can't touch healing people you are trying to kill.<br />
<br />
If you play PvP teams you will be an underdog to the crossteamers no matter which team you choose to play.  If you want to be the worst underdog possible, go evil.  Evil only guilds have the three &quot;good&quot; teams against them and all the crossteamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SZ is the only real pvp server. The others are more or less bloobs at this point. <br />
<br />
Evil dominates and has the only time enabled guild. Unless you plan to go evil and get in Hate your best bet is to level off server and come in with flags, but then you miss on lower level pvp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bilhee</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we are still not sure which side we will pick. If SK/Shaman is the way to go the why has noone mentioned Iksar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iksar Sks are good.<br />
<br />
Iksar make great shammies, but alot of them are put down because they can't use the JBB crutch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id go with SK/sham.<br />
but if you want an ultimate killer combo there are better options<br />
e.g bards, necros</div></div><hr />
