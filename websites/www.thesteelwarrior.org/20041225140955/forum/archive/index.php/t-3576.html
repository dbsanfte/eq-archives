<br />
I made up my damn mind so just back your ass up and learn one simple fucking idea. The MODERATORS have the final fucking say on what goes and what stays and what is deemed worthwhile bitching ( which some of it is really good btw here ) and WORTHLESS MINDLESS DICKWAVING FUCKING DRIVEL THAT DOESN'T EVEN BELONG IN THE INTERNET UNIVERSE.<br />
<br />
Got It ? I KNOW you better GET IT REAL FUCKING SOON because I for one am FUCKING TIRED of your bullshit and blatant cockwaving at whatever shit you think doesn't stink that comes out of your mouth. You do NOT have the final say on what is what here. If you want your own place to go off on whoever you think you want to go off on THAN BY ALL MEANS NO ONE IS STOPPING YOU FROM DOING IT.<br />
<br />
I for one am tired of it. Extremely tired of it.<br />

<br />
Just gonna add one thing to this...If it ever gets to the point where we are afraid to moderate the outhouse or it's causing us too much stress, it will simply disappear as quickly as it was made. <br />
<br />
It's here to give you guys a place to vent. Read the rules...It's not here to be your personal playground. Use it, but stop abusing it. I guarantee you that if we had this forum gone there would be a few things happening...<br />
<br />
-More people banned<br />
-More threads deleted or locked<br />
<br />
In addition to that, it would be EASIER on the mods. It's a hell of a lot easier to point to a black and white rule and say &quot;You broke it, you pay the price.&quot; TSW has always had an air of civility in disagreements though. There was never a need for 'harsh' moderation. I don't like having to be a bad guy, and I can promise you none of the other mods do either. This forum is not a right, and it WILL disappear if it needs to. But, I don't think that's necessary at the moment. Don't prove me wrong please. I'd hate to have to lock certain peoples access to only the library...</div></div><hr />

<br />
first off if i didn't like you or something along those lines; i'd just take it as that and not even think of typing anyhting out.<br />
<br />
secondly; yes, you are a valuable and often highly voliatile ( hey you're passionate about your class and what you know..can't fault you on that ) member of this community.<br />
<br />
All I am getting at is when someone who is an admin/mod here; and asks a &quot;few&quot; times for things to somewhat squelch themselves on their own doings...I kinda expect it to be done. Not get backtalked and second guessed every step of the way.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is the outhouse. Yes, things get ugly here. But there are levels of ugly no one needs to be a part of. And a lot of what was here yesterday was beyond that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided last nite that you're gonna have to ban me if you want me to go away, because I contributed cash to this board, and I'll be damned if I'm walking away from it because someone pissed in your cheerios yesterday.<br />
<br />
So last nite at work I had a good laugh, because the king of dickwaving himself, Mr. Post Count, tells me that I do too much blatant dickwaving.  Lets cut the crap.  Do I use what could be called the &quot;harsher end&quot; of the language spectrum?  Yes.  Does anything I do around here count as dickwaving?  Not much, that's for sure.  I don't attack people, I try to follow forum rules, I don't spam the boards with innane shit about accomplishments no one gives a fuck about (Woot 65! Woot Emp down! Woot AoW down! Woot Rathe down!  Woot, who gives a shit), I don't start threads just to watch myself type, and overall I'd say I contribute quite a bit.  If you think i'm your biggest problem, I can name a few people who haven't contributed jack shit other than some 1 line insults, but apparantly they're exempt from the rules because they're part of the &quot;L33t Overlord&quot; chat.  You wanna talk dickwaving? Start there.<br />
<br />
So, on to the core.  You said : <br />
<br />
This has been a record day here in regards to things locked and moved and deleted. Don't break this record again. EVER. <br />
<br />
So I get up, read that and think &quot;Wow, Shik kicked some ass around here, I wonder who.&quot;  And I look.  And I look, and I look.  And I can't find one fuckin thread that was either locked or moved, so that means they were all deleted.  Which of course elicits this response :<br />
<br />
Wtf are you talking about? <br />
<br />
Hello McFly?  How the fuck is anyone supposed to know what is acceptable and unacceptable if you delete the unacceptable?  MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF PEOPLE SO WE KNOW WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN.  If you're going to draw imaginary lines, well then people just may ask questions about  where that line exists in your mind.  I don't see anything anywhere that goes anywhere near overboard like you described it, so I asked you what the hell the problem was, having not seen whatever it is you deleted.  Of course I get reamed for it, big fuckin deal, but the more I think about it, the more i want you to point out the bullshit and dickwaving you say I do.  If having an opinion and not being a spineless fuckin fanboy is dickwaving, well then I guess I'm guilty.  Please show me where i'm an asshole to anyone who isn't blatantly asking for it.  Please show me where I tell anyone that I'm better than they are.  You show me where I cross the line, and I'll give you that last post, otherwise that's as much of an attack as I've ever seen on this board, and you're gonna look real bad.<br />
<br />
You don't like me?  Fine, no one asked you to.  But apparantly I say what a lot of people think around here, because I've been told it numerous times.  Cockwaving bullshit my ass. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you're gonna have a forum for bitching, and then complain about people using it, then just remove the forum.  If you're gonna say things like &quot;Some bitching is okay, and others isn't&quot; without leaving the examples of what's not okay, then that's not cool.  Am I out of line for thinking that pure melee need a better bracer from my only thread I started in the war room?  Am I out of line for thinking that an SoE employee should do his goddamned job?  I don't know if those fall into your category of unnaccetpable or what.  If you're going to make rules based upon guidelines that only you're aware of, then i'm gonna ask what they are.  If I don't, then everyone, including myself, is just gonna go on thinking what they're doing is fine as long as there isn't a PM in their box</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have all kinds of opinions of what is appropriate and what is not even here, but the moderators have the final say. I'm REAL sure there's a stickie with the rules, but common sence ought to guide you. Here's my guess without even reading the rules:<br />
<br />
1. Spirited debate is expected but not back and forth arguments. When a discussion gets to the &quot;Yes you did&quot;/&quot;No I did not&quot; stage it's over.<br />
<br />
2. Off-color words are tolerated and creative insults are OK, but disparaging personal insults intended to wound can cross the line especially if they are repeated to the point of churlishness. I can call someone an Ebayed Porno Fluffer who get their rocks off by watching their sister-wife hump the goat - but not Ebayed Idiot followed by subsequent posts that call them this repeatedly and otherwise don't add to the discussion.<br />
<br />
3. No race, nation, gender, sexual preference, politics, religion or threats please. Have the decency to keep your prejudices to yourself.<br />
<br />
4. Pointless unfunny trolling is a waste of bandwidth as is starting a thread entirely to provoke an argument.<br />

<br />
Again, I didn't tell you to go anywhere. Don't play the martyr card because the shit is old. I said if someone who has set the rules and has made numerous attempts at squelching it yet you keep twisting the knife another turn afterwards...expect repercussions. As much as you might hate this concept; and to the dismay of all the other people who'd like to see my head up on a stick in the middle of a field.....<br />
<br />
I am a moderator of the board. Like it or not; I deserve a BIT of respect. Out of nothing else but the title. Don't liek it? Tell Raaj and sHORTY to demote my ass. So far..my PM box is quite empty. <br />
I for one am not afraid to ever stick my head where it doesn't belong; take a chance on trying to keep a bit of restraints on things; and will play my hand as it was dealt. I'll take my chances.<br />
I'd bet the farm people would love to see me go before you go Haass; because basically this board, this Game, and this little internet universe of which we all co-exist is a place to have fun and to not bring any more chaos to things than there already is.<br />
<br />
I'm all about the fun. I honestly couldn't give a rats ass about game balance, what a fucking mud ring is; nor the AC differences between a BoW and a SEWS or what percentage taunt works. You Know these things; and what you bring to this community is invaluable. <br />
<br />
But the rules and whatever still stands. Hell, If I didn't even give a shit about you and whatever goes on in your head I would have just outright banned you back to the stone age and wouldn't have thought any different of the outcome.<br />
<br />
But, I am sure the repercussions of it would have been probabally my dismissal and total anarchy from other members of the board. And I for one am only one person, one moderator; one loud mouthed brass balled, shit talking badass motherfucker in game and in character yet in the RL persona am probabally the easiest going, easiest to talk to; and most understanding and empathetic(sp?) person I know. <br />
<br />
And I for one would not want you to be anywhere but here.<br />
<br />
You used this board in a manner explaining yourself and your stand. I used mine as well. Believe me I have dealt with stuff liek this as long as I can possibly remember and what comes of it will be up to you to decide.<br />
<br />
I crossed the line in some parts; and I apologize for my rude mouth. But I demand a shred of respect for my title and job here and I would like for you to observe that. I don't think it's asking too much.<br />
<br />
for the record too:<br />
the posts that have been locked are here still in our private forum. nothing is altered or deleted unless raaj or sHORTY do it; or it is outright offenses noted in our rules of all forums ( pr0n, etc ).</div></div><hr />
