<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok while trolling the SK forums again  I found this. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.shadow-knight.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=50<br />
<br />
<br />
My only question to the knights did you stay the fuck out of our threads when we were discussing our weaknesses and what we needed.  Did we ban anyone except for those that deserved to be banned.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL read the post that Naubi posts that is some good funny shit.  She is complaining about 500hp we got through GOD AA and she want it fixed with itemisation.  When itemisation caused the HP gap to become non-existent in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe poor naubi :( ( guildmate of mine when i played EQ )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe poor naubi :( ( guildmate of mine when i played EQ )    :) Shikarii told me I can post here whenever I like and I'm always right  :) <br />
<br />
Anyway, if you re-read what I posted (on the SK board btw)... you'll see that I suggested it would have been better to acheive the same effect as the hp aa with itemisation. *Not* that I was suggesting new itemsation for knights to compensate for the hp aa (which is what you, apparently, think I said).<br />
<br />
Warriors biggest problems with knights was the lack of snap aggro... which made them useless for offtanking. And sub-optimal group tanks. <br />
<br />
After fixing this, all they really needed were minor improvements to their tanking. I'm no good at math so I can't really comment on the mitigation boost, but the flat 500hp irrespective of gear seems wrong (would have been better to fix it with itemisation). <br />
<br />
And there was no need to put in stuff that requires a warriors discs into single group content. <br />
<br />
I hate how they always manage to use 'utility' to cloud the issue. Do you see this happening when the rogue vs wizard dps debate happens... like the rogues are saying &quot;but you can port so stfu&quot; and the wizards are saying &quot;hey stfu you get sneak&quot;... no, because it's irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So you meant:<br />
<br />
Rather than spending 59 aa (4/8/12/15/20) to get 500hps it would have been better to give it to warrs via 500hps in class specific armor?  Just making sure I understand yer point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with her point that there was no need to put mobs that require defensive in single group content!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unfortunately, shadow knights, the utility argument will alas ALWAYS be thrown into your face. Not because you get &quot;hide&quot; or because you get &quot;fear&quot; and can fear kite/solo for long stretches of your career. And not because you get ATK buffs. And not because Disease Cloud used to be insane aggro in a can.<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
You will always get the utility argument thrown into your face because, like rangers you can snare, and like monks you can feign death.<br />

Welcome to my world, where Feign Death is the be-all, end-all reason why Class_X should be able to out-damage me. It's dark and hell is hot.<br />

:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I kind of agree also on the gear needing fixed vs's aa's for hit points. Even with the amount of aa's it requires I would have rather seen them fix the gear itself. i guess it was just easier, I am grateful for it. <br />
I am still in the air on these mobs requiring a warrior. The main thing I see wrong with it is it being on a trial. I might not be remembering right but wasn't there a few mobs placed throughout the game where you pretty much had to have a certain class tank? It seemed like there was one that even required a mage fire pet to tank. If it was not in a trial I wouldn't think these mobs might pose a problem. There should be some mobs for each of the tanking classes where it was a real good idea (necessary) to have a paticular class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehehe, I'd like to know how they can ban warriors.  I can make a magelo for my level 32 shadowknight, put it in my sig, and *tada* I'm not a warrior anymore and can say anything I want.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey! Nice lies about what my guild has and hasn't done.  I posted a fairly mature response on the sk boards, however here, this is the outhouse.<br />
<br />
Most raid stuff at my level actually drops crap gear compared to mine.  So it may not seem like we raid, however we have done quite a few mobs.  We also excel at low numbers stuff.  Especially single group.  You know, some people actually do use low numbers, instead of 150 for their first Rathe kill /cough  Seriously, if you're gonna post whines, at least get your bullshit somewhat correct.<br />
<br />
Edit: And sorry Shik, I don't mean anything against you with that.  Just saying there's a large difference between using a small guild who farms out stuff so all members get a good amount of items, versus a huge guild where items are more scarce for the individual.  If she wants to compare magelos, use a knight that has farmed out their raid mobs so much that they have almost everything they need from them.  Not some random gimp with a few items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im to tired to give a flying F$%^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess all im pointing out is that they shouldnt have put in a flat hp upgrade and mitigation upgrade to warriors... one that applies irrespective of gear. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to register for the SK boards, I'll just reply here. Naubi, I disagree with this statement - that's exactly what they should have done. Well, maybe they should've put in a 5% boost to HP rather than a flat # (which is only attainable at what would seem to be appropriate levels, via AA), but either way, I do believe some form of innate warrior HP boost was appropriate.<br />
<br />
I hate how they always manage to use 'utility' to cloud the issue. Do you see this happening when the rogue vs wizard dps debate happens... no, because it's irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Actually, yes 'utility' is basically always tossed around in dps debates. But that's another discussion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And no offense, but you're saying you've spent 6 months in Time, but you're just clearing 7k hit points (assuming your Magelo is current). Comparisons to lower tiered warriors whose gear better represents their level of progression are misleading. Half your gear is pre-Time, and several pieces are Luclin. Again no offense, but your hp/ac/shielding are behind SKs I know who've been in Time for that long.  I've actually got higher hp/ac, but I'm a rogue, and over half of my gear is pre-Time.</div></div><hr />

What nerf?  What nerf? and again WHAT NERF?  We did not asked for knights to be nerfed, we didn't want knights to be nerfed.  We wanted to ne upgraded.   We did not ban any knights that came to this board and post thier concerns or their greivences.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When there are three tanking classes in the game and you need to balance one or the other you  have to haveinput from that one class.  Just because some might disagree with you doesn't mean that they should be banned.</div></div><hr />

God you're an idiot aren't you?  You do realize that almost all warriors didn't want a nerf to knights right?  And that they DID NOT NERF KNIGHTS?  I suppose you don't have the occasional idiot on your boards?  Oh wait, it's you.<br />
<br />
We were underpowered, we got upgraded.  GoD did come and screw up some stuff, however that was none of our doing.  Unless it's your fault that PoP screwed up things for warriors?  Doesn't make much sense does it?  Dumbass.<br />
<br />
We let all your idiots still post here (/poke arbosch), maybe because we aren't babies when it comes to others opinions?  Plus, if we were banned, no one would have called naubi on bullshit.  Thats because if you only hear one side, you're going to hear a tainted opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An outright lie.  Almost every warrior on this board was foaming at the mouth screaming for a nerf for knights.  <br />
<br />
And that they DID NOT NERF KNIGHTS?<br />
<br />
Not completely true.  Knights are not balenced anymore.  Class development didn't go forward it went backward.<br />
<br />
We were underpowered, we got upgraded.  <br />
<br />
During PoP you were percieved as underpowered due to a shift in party dynamics.  For once in the history of EQ warriors weren't the best at everything and you couldn't handle it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">While most of the posts in that thread actually made some sense, you cannot exclude utility from any discussion on class balance.  Utility is exactly what Hybrids are trading that specialization for, so it definitely has a place in class discussions.<br />
<br />
As far as SK class balance, Pre-Elemental at least they are fine, IMO (excluding some spell bugs).  I often defer XP tanking to my brother because he holds aggro better and I have to heal him a whole lot less (when I box my healers).<br />

<br />
Almost every warrior was foaming at the mouth for a nerf, eh?  Did you actually READ those threads you linked?  At most 1-2 warriors said a nerf was called for, most others simply discussed the situation, never calling for a decrease in knight power.  The foaming at the mouth, rabid posters are the low level knights here and at PoN screaming that because there were a few issues in GoD that they deserve an increase in power across the board.<br />
<br />
Upset that we weren't the best at everything?  We're the best a tanking.  Period.  We have never been the best at anything else, and for a long while we weren't even the best at tanking in the non-raid situations during much of PoP/all of LDoN.  I guess &quot;everything&quot; means tanking on raids only, huh?<br />
<br />
Utility DOES get you groups.  Tanking is a utility.  DPS is a utility.  Pulling is a utility.  Buffing is a utility.  Corpse recovery is a utility.  Rezzing is a utility.  Etc, etc, etc.  It's for the whole &quot;utility&quot; reason that knights simply owned most warriors throughout the entire LDoN period.<br />
<br />
Knights who post on this board (mainly paladins) are the ones spewing &quot;raw sewage&quot; (it's quite relative, as to what's considered sewage...) and you don't see any of them getting banned.  We let them post what they want and agrue, quite colorfully at times, about the issues.  That's us working with the knight community, because behind all the name-calling, etc, the issues are brought up and discussed instead of simply silencing the opposition and having one-sided conversations with ourselves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>blizterkrieger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Class descriptions :<br />
<br />
Shadowknight <br />
Shadowknights are unholy warriors who use fear, pain and disease to attack all that is good in the world. Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. When needed, shadowknights use their powerful harm touch ability to greatly damage their opponents.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them. Combined with spells that degrade an enemy's ability to fight, a shadowknight becomes a fearsome foe.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. The shadowknight's lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight. <br />
----------<br />
Paladin <br />
Paladins are holy warriors who use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath. Paladins are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<br />
<br />
Paladins are able fighters and battlefield healers whose combat spells focus on stunning enemies and smiting undead. They also have several spells that increase the health and armor of their allies. Every so often, paladins can lay hands on themselves or their friends to instantly grant a powerful heal.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the greatest force against undead. At higher levels they gain special abilities to smite these foes. Paladins also gain a limited ability to resurrect their fallen friends with lessened penalties for death.<br />
<br />
Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal. Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play. <br />
----------<br />
Warrior <br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle. <br />
<br />
<br />
       We are the masters of armed combat and defense, not paladins and shadowknights.  We are the cornerstone of a good group, not knights. We are far hardier than any other class, including knights. This is the way it should be, and it is a beautiful thing. knights gave up something for their other abilities, thats a choice they made, just like the choice I made when I wanted to keep them. You wanted spells, you got em; you wanted HT/LoH, you got it; you wanted to be a knight, you got it. Maybe the consequences of knights getting what they asked for wasn't as apparent as before, when they could tank everything just as easily as a warrior, but now it is becoming more clear to them. Warriors take damage, thats what we do, it's what we are the best at. If you want the job done right, call the specialist. <br />
   <br />
      I think that for single group situations, knights should be able to scrape by, but warriors should always be far superior at performing out specialty. Hybrids do not have specialties, thats why they are hybrids, they perform many tasks much worse than that tasks specialist. Warriors complained because we were having trouble performing our specialty as well as classes that are 1/2 warrior. Now that those issues are being balanced out, knights are feeling the loss of that other half of a warrior that they haven't missed before. Let it go, of course you will miss it, but it was never supposed to be there in the first place. Instead, embrace the other half that you wanted when you chose your class. <br />
    <br />
      My job is to tank, A cleric's job is to heal, I'm not sure what a necro's job is, but I'm sure there is one.  :cool:  A knights job is to fill the space between the classes, assist with both aspects of your being and stop focusing on one half more than the other. there is so much for you to offer without limiting yourself to doing one thing that can never be the best at. I am a warrior, I love being a warrior. If you are a wizard, you should love brurning things. If you are a knight, you should love being a knight and realize that you will never be a warrior, you will never be a cleric, you will never be a necromancer; you will be something different, and that is beautiful in itself; you will be something more, and that is amazing; you will be something beyond both in some ways, and that is marvelous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for making my point for me.  So what you're saying is no group should ever rely on knights because knights were meant to always play second fiddle to warriors in all situations.<br />
<br />
I agreed you needed some fixing.  Warriors should be the kings of mitigation.  However you crossed the line with all the aggro changes you wanted.  Where is the tradeoff?  Now there isn't one.  You got what you wanted, the game walking backwards right back into the holy trinity days of Kunark and Velious.  You seem to only remember the brief period where you were at a grouping disadvantage.<br />
<br />
Monks- They are still screwed up.  The melee changes really didn't help them all them all that much.  Monks have a habit of looking at Beastlords lately and asking &quot;Why?&quot;.  I can agree.  Monks have also been a lot more patient in regards to this.  <br />
<br />
Rogues-  Got some burst DPS.  Not particularly earth shattering.  Makes them a little more useful.<br />
<br />
Look at the melee changes and it comes to one conclusion.  It was made to shut you up.  Why aren't knights getting any new toys?  Because there aren't enough knights especially SK's to make enough noise to equal the earth shattering whine you generated with your &quot;Warrior Standdown&quot;<br />
<br />
I am an SK.  I started back in 99.  Don't you even dare try to talk to me about class balence.  I was at the shit end of the stick for years longer than any of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zandorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Before the gap between warrior taunt and knight taunt was a large gap and the gap between tanking was a slim one.  Now its a slim gap between taunting with knights still on top and tanking has a large gap for like a &quot;handful&quot; of mobs.<br />
<br />
The knights I group with are amazing, they do things I could never dream of; like keep a group going after the cleric dies, or split mobs when the monk dies or or or the list goes on.<br />
<br />
I personally feel knights are alot better than whiny guys like you make it out to be, yes I love the upgrade warriors got but honestly, I would have been fine withouth then because all of us ahd been doing our jobs since 99 also, incase you forgot, you weren't the only person to make a char in that year.<br />
<br />
Hell when I'm in a group with a knight, I will personally ask a knight to tank, why you ask?  Because they are damn good at it and not bitching about balance nonstop.  Its just the person behind the char that makes it good, not only skills and what gear you have.<br />
<br />
Lots of warriors are hoping for knights to get something,  but comming here slinging insults is one surefire way to make those hopes and support vanish.<br />
<br />
Warriors were made to tank, your damn right we won't play second fiddle to no one when it comes to that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>blizterkrieger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">once again, taken from eqlive's class descriptions :<br />
<br />
Warriors are a melee class<br />
Paladins are primarily a melee class<br />
Shadowknights are primarily a melee class<br />
Rangers are primarily a melee class<br />
Beastlords are primarily a melee class<br />
<br />
     beastlords aren't complaining about their abilities, even though everyone makes fun of rangers, they are well versed in their skills and know their own uses. I was an SK in beta, I have been a warrior for over 4 years. each has their uses. I recomend you reflect internally, find the true reason you feel inadequate, then, if you still want to tank like a warrior, make a warrior. because, as stated in the class descriptions :<br />
<br />
     &quot;warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; We will continue to me unmatched. <br />
<br />
     claiming that, &quot;I was at the shit end of the stick for years longer than any of you.&quot; is very presumptuous, and is not constructive in the least. I happen to believe that the aggro changes were not neaded, nor was the introduction  of the incite line. They are nice tools to have at one's disposal, but the old ways work as well. You fail to understand that warriors do not need a trade-off in our tanking abilities, that's all we were built to do. That is why warriors will always be more suited to tanking than any similar knight, because thats all we were meant to do.Knights must have trade-offs because they chose to acquire skills in addition to wanting skills similar to a warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">After the melee changes went live back in December and leading up to the release of GoD, I do not recall seeing the sheer volume of paladins whining about how there class sucks and that they needed to be upgraded.  As I recall, everyone felt the classes were as close to balanced as they had ever been.<br />
<br />
With GoD, the developers put in mobs for group encounters (intentionally or unintentionally) that result in a very very low success rate for the paladin.  The questons/statements to the developers should be 1) will subsequent itemization correct the difficulty level of these encounters, 2) if itemization will not correct the difficulty and the encounter is designed as intended, then the you (developers) should provide the paladins with an appropriate means to increase their success rate and 3) if the difficulty of the encounters was unintentional, then the will you (developers) fix the content.  <br />
<br />
Of the above, only number 2 warrants some form of modfication to the a paladins ability to tank in GoD.  I can personally (after weeks of reading the debates) agree with a paladin receiving some form of damage mitigation if the content is working as designed and that there is no future itemization that will help the paladin (or SK) have a greater success in the trials.  However, I can not agree with the paladin or SK class receiving an upgrade in abilities when future itemization will increase the success rate or when the developers F@#$ed Up.<br />
<br />
As an aside, EQ has become two games wrapped into one cover.  There is the pre-time/elemental game and the post-time/elemental game.  The two worlds do not mesh well together.  Content in the old worlds that used to take raid forces now can be done with single groups or a couple groups. Even pajama classes can tank named on rare occasion.  Thus, a paladin receiving an upgrade at the GoD level does not really matter because they already can tank everything below Time.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for those of us not post-time/elemental, the game will never be as it was for those who blazed the trail.</div></div><hr />

Then you have an incredibly poor memory. For the first 3-4 months of EQ SK/Pallie/Warr had the same hps, armor etc.  There was NO reason to play a warr at that point other than love the *idea* of what we were supposed to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">An outright lie. Almost every warrior on this board was foaming at the mouth screaming for a nerf for knights. <br />
<br />
That is an outright lie.  There were a few vocal people that wanted knights nerf, but the majority did not.  You do realize that almost does not mean all right?  So yes, there were some, so yes, you can find some.  That's not the point dumbass.  I've been on these boards for a damn long time, I know what was and wasn't said.  And the majority didn't want nerfs.  But then you'll keep going on saying all did, cause there is no getting in your thick idiotic skull that a vocal minority is still a minority.<br />
<br />
For once in the history of EQ warriors weren't the best at everything and you couldn't handle it. <br />
<br />
Appearently you don't understand what happened.  It's ok, we know you're slow, so I'll try to spell it out easy.  Warriors were SHUNNED because we could NOT KEEP AGGO when slowers had to slow early.  And to not slow early, you'd use a lot of healer mana.  Warriors weren't just not the best, they were purposely avoided as much as possible.<br />
<br />
One thing is for sure, you all sure do know how to bitch and moan like pros. <br />
<br />
Coming from the master?  You're whining about us being made balanced in PoP.  You're even expecting something given back to you for us being put on equal footing.  Just because you were on your power kick high, doesn't mean that classes should remain at the relative power level they were.<br />
<br />
You got what you wanted, the game walking backwards right back into the holy trinity days of Kunark and Velious. <br />
<br />
Actually, once again, most want knights to be made viable tanks.  However, each time an dumbass like you posts this idiotic bullshit.  Or posts like the one on your boards calling for warriors to be banned across the board.  For every one of those, you are making more and more warriors hope your class just gets fucked over and kicked to the street.  It's hard to remember that there really some great knights out there.  I really hope the intelligent knights get not only balanced, but put in a position where they are really happy, without being overpowered.  However I hope knights like you just quit EQ before that happens, so we don't have to listen to you anymore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I didn't care how they fixed it be it a nerf or adding in tools. When you say nerf your saying it like  take the character down to nothing which is not the case at all. Most that said a nerf would work were only talking about the total aggro affect from low level stuns. I still think had they lowered the aggro generated off of a stun it would have come close to the same results in respect to aggro. It might have even kept it interesting making it to a named mob in that people would have had to pay attention to aggro like the game used to be. It seems now days the only time you really try to watch aggro is on the named mobs and getting there is just a zerg through. I am glad for how they did put in the fix though. It helped out our aggro without making it trivial (or atleast not trivial to me at least 60% of the time) and gave us a few utilities that are unique or atleast fun to have in a pinch. <br />
<br />
Now we have 3 or 4 mobs that not just anyone can tank and actually pushes a warriors limits. They should have mobs to push all the classes limits. If you can tank everything in the game with the exception of these mobs and they are for trials, then the mobs are in the wrong place. Not they should trivialize things even more so that everyone can tank everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Knights really arnt asking for everyone to beable able to tank everything, Knights are asking for a reasonable chance of sucess to tank any single group encounter at appropiate gear levels, If you (not anyone in particular rather just whoever is reading) doesnt agree with that statement, well, then we just dont agree on what Knights should beable to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">But knights can already tank everything with the exception of the mobs that they have thrown into a trial in the GoD expansion. It's not that knights can't tanks any single group encounter, it's that they can not tank this one paticular encounter. I can see the problem in that, but if it is only the one set of encounters that they are having problems in and all the others they have shown more than capable of tanking then I would have to believe it is the encounter that needs the fixing vs. an augment made to a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">They should just say &quot;fuck it all&quot; and put in a 3-minute 50% spell damage mitigation disc for Paladins (they already have Sancitification, fits right I think) and a 3 minute 25% spell/ 25% melee mitigation disc for Shadowknights perhaps (with Warriors having the 50% melee mitigation).<br />
<br />
Then they can balance raid encounters based on the fact that each of the three tanks have a specific specialty in tanking.<br />

<br />
Here's your problem, then.  The single group encounters (Ikkinz trials) are ranked among the HARDEST things to tank in the game right now, single group, raid, whatever situation.  If &quot;knights are asking for a reasonable chance of succes to tank any single group encoutner at appropiate gear levels&quot;, you are in fact asking to be able to tank everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">They arnt close to hardest things to tank, its that the cost of loosing the tank, because of the nature of a single group enviroment, is extroidnarily high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">What I don't get is if they are capable of tanking everything with the exceptions of these mobs why change anything other than moving the mobs from a trial encounter to another location.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Because they want to be warriors, yet not.<br />
<br />
My point with my above statement, Tyrrax, was to have each of the three tanks have a specific advantage against different types of damage, making it easier to balance the three tanks in their roles, and therefor make balancing the classes themselves more interesting and simple.  That way it'd be very very VERY easy to say &quot;This was intended for a Warrior to tank&quot; or &quot;This was intended for a Paladin/Shadowknight to tank&quot; where people would believe it.  But no, all three tanks &quot;have&quot; to be able to tank anything in the game, don't they?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Because they want to be warriors, yet not.<br />
<br />
I would say that what they want, much like what you're saying, is to be able to do everything a Warrior can do as a pure tank, but at a slightly lower effectiveness while still retaining all their other spell based abilities.  They're willing to allow a Warrior to be a better tank, but he can't be better enough that it really means anything.  If a Warrior would survive an encounter 9 out of 10 times, then the Knights want to survive it 8.5 out of 10 times and keep their spells as a bonus.  That's what I see.</div></div><hr />

Not sure on the difference for war/knigth for base sta-hp, but with the 500HP AA and 390 for being a warrior, you're at +890 HP's while naked. factor in the other + HP mod's to that and .... ya</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. We're not at a &quot;minimum of 1k more than a knight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Situationally, paladins can EXCEED warrior hitpoints. With a druid healer, for example, a paladin can use his cleric buffs PLUS BSS, where with a warrior in that same group, all they have is Po9.<br />
<br />
Need a concrete example?<br />
<br />
Best pally HP in my guild: 7200<br />
best warrrior HP: 8200.<br />
<br />
magelo's provided upon request.<br />
<br />
With BSS and AoTC alone, the HP difference drops to 300-350ish. Note this is with a cleric in the group. With a druid healer, there is a 350HP advantage in the PALADIN'S favor. With a SHAMAN healer, the difference is more like 1k in the PALADIN's favor.<br />
<br />
So, no. We DO NOT have a &quot;minimum 1k advantage.&quot;<br />
<br />
We have an advantage most times, yes, depending on the level of gear and the group makeup, but we also have a DISADVANTAGE at times, depending on many of the same things. <br />
<br />
Now, if you were to say that warriors have an advantage over SK's, then that's fine, that's true. But all knights? No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">The minimum 1k advantage is just another retarded argument. I love the 'ranger &amp; monks tanks better than paladin'. But of course don't post any parse to back this. Since ranger tank better than paladin, they must be able to tank ikkinz named no problem.   <br />
<br />
And just like Pinaduz said, properly geared paladin can tank Ikkinz trial, they can tank Uqua trash, and well in fact they are especialy good at tanking 'trap' mobs.<br />
<br />
A lot of very knowledgeable paladin ( with anything between 4k and 6khp preferably)  like to say how it is 'impossible' for paladin to tank in GoD. Wake up if you don't have 10-15% shielding 8k5 hp you don't belong there. A 8k5 hp warrior can barely survive those shit, there is no reason a 7k hp Paladin should.<br />
<br />
This is a CONTENT problem not a class balance problem, we need either this content tuned down or get a way to gear before it. It is not right to have to gear in a previous expansion, expansion should be self contained and having farmed previous expansion should not be a necessity. <br />
<br />
In short I think SoE dev did catch the real problem : GoD content is fucked up and need some serious tuning.</div></div><hr />

I have a SK saying that when they gave warriors incite it  took away the only job an SK has on a raid. Offtanking. Saying that we have snap agro now with Incite.<br />
That since warriors are better tanks they are now used for offtanks instead of SK's<br />
    What he fails to relize is that Incite  dont hardly do shit. Only time  you get the snap hold agro like he is talking about is if you land a taunt , Incite, and a wepon proc that adds hate. All of those going at once will make the snap agro that an SK has.<br />
  So since they are going to ban us does that mean we get to ban them?<br />
  The gates AA for HP is crap. The fact its 4 AA's for 100HP is shitty. After that it goes up to 8AA's. It will be a long time before i finish that set. I would rather get my stability LR and the other mitigation AA's.  So talking how SK's got screwed because of those new AA's is a lame excuse for a halfass geared SK.<br />
Yes warriors have more HP and can mitigate better than anybody in the game. Thats how it is and thats how it should be..... end of story.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty good for knight classes that are intended to be the 2nd best tanks in an expansion that's so new.  Give them more time and guild advancement to gear up and the number of knights who pull off Ikkinz and their chance of success will keep going up.</div></div><hr />

You failed to notice the main difference between GoD and ANY other expansion, you could do NToV without VP gear, you could do Ssra without NToV gear, you could do Rallos Zek without VT gear. Uqua without FULL PoTime gear ? sorry not going to happen. <br />
<br />
This is the most incredible cockblock ever, you won't get PoTime geared in 2 weeks, or in 2 months, you'll need something like 20+ clean to get decently geared. <br />
<br />
MY GUILD HAS FUCKING CLEANED 20+ TIME PoTime and we HAVE to go back there to stuff applicants and even improve our gear, this is just retard, especialy reflagging, yay PoEarth ring, so challenging, yay TRC omg so hard it was already so fun the 4th time in PoP, not to add Coirnav when you have 3+ guilds reflagging for PoTime, that really should have no business there, it's so cool for upcoming guild to get 1 shot / 2 months on Coirnav. When you were at the top you could just move on and forget the last expansion. In GoD no you have to mother fucking reflag for PoTime every single applicant in order to gear them.<br />
<br />
There is clearly a 'tier' missing in GoD, the equivalent of WToV / EToV, Ssra, Tier 3 in PoP. <br />
<br />
This is especialy a problem since most guilds have to massively recruit (check any top end guild web page, they are all recruiting or have been recruiting recently) to have to go in PoP, we spent 1 year there, thanks  that was fun but we want to leave it now.<br />
<br />
From an upcoming guild point of view, you used to be able to gear FASTER when an expansion was released, more target, other guilds leaving previous target, that would give your guild that had enough motivation to catch up with the top guilds in your server. Now, no thanks, farm PoTime 4 months and come back. This is retard, I'm all for having farmed previous expansion give you an edge to conquer the new one, but in GoD, even raiding 24 / 7 it's just impossible to catch up the guild that had been farming PoTime for 6 months, you'll have to wait for your turn on Coirnav, then clean PoTime once a week for months.<br />
<br />
When PoP was released, my guild moved right on from mid end luclin content to PoP content, yay Berto / MM with 5500 hp MT, we wiped countless time, but it was possible.  Get your bazaar - low elemental geared guild in GoD, good luck. You'll be able to kill 1 or 2 shit in Ferubi and that's all, you won't be able to go any further without doing ALL PoP content and for a LONG time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probabally why I quit EQ. The investment of time needed at the elemental+ level of play was too intensive and my lacking of gear made it impossible without plenty of time investments to keep up. Hell; I could have bitched about it as well but; eh; it's less money they'll get from me. I had my 5 years of fun. Now it's onward and upward. I paid my dues reflagging myself plus other guildmates; and they ddi it to me as well when I couldn't log on...but than; what's the point of playing? i'm paying for someone else to play the toon so i can get some asstacular piece of pixelated shit in my lemming fur bag..<br />

20 PoTime clean does not equal to 80 fully time geared people Yeah with GoD event are limited to 54 people, but let's face it, if you have 50% attendency in Uqua that's fucking awesome.<br />
<br />
And 20 time cleaning is what ? 20 * 3 * 5 loots (p1-4 is shitty) 300 loots, that's barely 15 players fully stuffed, that's 4 loots per players + another 5 p1 - p4 loots.<br />

I'm asking for the exact contrary of what you seem to think : Aggresive, motivated and dedicated upcomming guild should just eat up half casual decaying uber, you should not hit a wall when a new expansion is released, it has never been so and should never be so again. <br />
<br />
My guild did not exist when people were killing emperor in my server, and with PoP we were able to 'climb' over them. It's no longer possible, now it's just a matter of time, and not of playtime, but of REAL time, a matter of day, a matter of how many time (ie how long have you been time flagged) you cleaned PoTime. There is no skill evolved in farming  / beating a previous expansion, challenge lies in the current expansion. Yet newer guilds HAVE to go there, to fight gimped TRC, shadows of what they used to be, and farm again and again PoTime. If you dare say it was so before, you are mistaken, this new.<br />
<br />
There were challenge to beat PoP starting with bazaar / low end luclin gear, now it's just straight impossible to beat GoD with bazaar gear.<br />
Ah and it's trivial to beat PoP with bazaar gear. Bazaar war have 7khp by now, it's just a little under what warrior in my guild had when we reached potime ...</div></div><hr />

No, I helped the guild I joined that could barely handle ToFS to become one of the premiere Guilds on Terris Thule.

In a ladder you should be given the opportunity to pass the guy in front of you, it's not just 1st in will forever remain the 1st.<br />
EQ does NOT have a true ladder. It's a platform you and the 71 other people are at where;without even trying; can keep your spot; and others can do it to you as well by just blowing a spawn; starting a trigger; etc.[/b]In EQ you can't solo Quarm so NO you can't describe yourself as YOU. YOu are a member of a GUILD; a GROUP of people who spend just as much time as you trying to accomplish a goal. Iyou've seen it as well as I have; you're prepping a 54 man raid; 41 log on. WTF do you do? You can't do what you wanted ( esp if the missing parties are clerics and enchanters ) ... you go back down the ladder; back down to encounters you past because you cannot even move laterally across your tier. Welcome to LadderQuest. <br />
Expansion were good from a competition point of view because it was sort of a wipe, and top guilds had to show they were still top not because they were there 1st before but also because they were more skilled / dedicated than others.<br />
Exactly. We agree there.<br />
Of course you think that because some guy that quit EQ 3 years ago killed the 1st Nagafen on the server, people that wear the same guild tag should still be the 1st on their server ?<br />
If they were dedicated enough and spent the time climbing the ladder of EQ; than sure; they become the top dogs of their server again. If they do the work. If not; fuck all they can go off and keep killing Nagafen. Their goal; their premise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but, you can't change Game Mechanics. EQ is designed to encourage cockblocking and preservation of the ladder in order to encourage all the bad points that piss off the above average-top end player in Everquest.<br />
If every time player had a 24/7/365 window of killing quarm without fear of wiping and/or blowing a spawn; you think anyone would go back?<br />
<br />
No......The cockblocking preserves SoE's Vision of Gameplay. Shit; or get off the pot. I've seen it enough and personally I was fuckign tired of it. why the fuck should I reserve time 3 or 4 days from now in RL terms to spend a day/day+ clearing aa zone when some other group of jacktard fuckwits can beat my guild there by 10 minutes and take the spawn?<br />
<br />
It just don't make sense man. It just don't make no sense. PoP sent EQ down the shitter so far for anyone who can't log into EQ whenever the need arises..Go across your server's top guilds and see just how many people left Eq after Quarm ate dust for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>hayniss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">My personal opinion(65 sk):<br />
<br />
     I don't want to be a warrior, like many have stated, if I wanted to be one I would roll one up.  I do think the issue is with GoD and not the rest of the game.  The mobs in GoD can one round any, I repeat, any class if they dont have a means of mitigating the damage.  <br />
    The way I've seen GoD trials, right now rangers, monks and rogues (and warriors, as a given) can tank named better than me (with /disp) because the fights are so short.  Hence, several knights are asking for something similiar because, as of now, we have no way to mitigate that much damage.<br />
<br />
     Couple of things that add fuel to the fire, from fan faire:<br />
<br />
 No fix for SK Terror line. Hate dosesnt work properly at level 65, and it would be more trouble than it is worth to fix this. <br />
 Cloak of Ahkeva will not stack with BSS. Pally version stacks but it shouldnt have; they realize its not fair, but will not nerf pallies, nor change to help SKs. <br />
     <br />
     The first one was suppose to been a fix for a nerf we took earlier with disease cloud - can be read SK's arent worth the effort to fix.<br />
<br />
     The second one is what, I believe, created the hp aa's that was made available to warriors with GoD.  Which puts at least 1k or more gap between top warriors and top Sk's, with pally's in between.  Again I take that statement as Sk's arent worth the effort to fix.<br />
<br />
    All I want to do is be able to advance in GoD with what my character can bring to the table.  Something I can't do right now, sure I can be gimped through the trials, but doesn't leave me with a feeling of &quot;I earned the right to be in this zone&quot;.  <br />
<br />
     From SOE history and recent fan faire statements, I don't see this being resolved well and no amount of suggestions will be taken into account when they do decide to fix it.</div></div><hr />

I don't tank anywhere near as well (GoD or otherwise) as my Knight peers - SKs or Paladins, either one. No contest.  Neither do the monks or rangers in my guild. If you're suggesting that I (or a ranger, or a monk) tank better in the opening ~12 seconds of a single fight, every time our respective disciplines have recycled, well - no shit.

     That's what I said, killing the named in the trials take about the same amount of time as the displines.  <br />
<br />
<br />
     I want the ability to survive the named better than praying the RNG(random number generator) is kind to me.  How to do that and still keep the trials challenging for everyone, is going to be interesting to see.</div></div><hr />

You're claiming that these mobs, which are too tough for knights to tank, are dead in less than 12 seconds (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4515&amp;source=Live). And that this (false) claim somehow proves that rogues and monks and rangers are better tanks in GoD than knights.<br />
