<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aumak</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently I came back from a 6 month break and gave my droppable stuff away cuz I was in such a nice mood that I just dinged 65.  Well now that I am back I am reoutfitting those lost slots that need filling.  I got some crap stuff to put in the slots for right now.  Example I am actually using an orc fang earring in one of my ears and a Spider Fur Cloak again ahh the days when that stuff wa standard gear.<br />
<br />
The bulk of my question is this for my Primary I have SotBS and a Bonechiller.  I am currently working on Ssra Temple with a guild that I am applying.  Can you guys make any recomendations to the gear I should be looking  for?  Any specific zones I should go hunt short of LDoN since I do not care for that expansion as of right now?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the information a lot gets hazy when you take a break to make a girlfriend happy.<br />
