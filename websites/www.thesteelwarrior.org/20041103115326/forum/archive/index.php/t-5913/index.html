<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>axxeman01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Folks,<br />
<br />
We'd like to hit AOW soon, and I'd like to get some info on him first, I checked the library, but have not been able to find a guide.  I've read the post on cornering, so I'm pretty sure I can handle that portion.<br />
<br />
What type of force/levels is needed to take him out?  Any strategies in addition to cornering?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1200 quad unslowable<br />
Clerics to keep the MT up<br />
DD to kill him<br />
Winner~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depending on the tank (Not at home, Maeglo is blocked so I can't see yours), you will need a 2-3 second rotation.<br />
<br />
Spot heals are nice too.<br />
<br />
So say...5 clerics on rot, 1 or 2 off spot healing for your first few times.<br />
<br />
Make sure Tanks are DI'd. Helps when your rotation fails.<br />
<br />
Get as much melee and nuke dps as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The guy is exactly the same as Vindicator with more Hps and a truckload more DPS.<br />
<br />
so! More DPS, More and Faster Healing, Dead AoW.<br />
<br />
Corner with a Lev'd Gnome. (can Guarantee this one works)<br />
<br />
Hasted CoD pets are gud!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AoW does not rampage like Vindi.<br />
<br />
There is one really easy way to see if you can handle AoW, fight the idol unslowed. If you are fine with the unslowed Idol, then you should be fine on AoW. Also, if you wipe on the Idol, you won't blow the AoW spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fire based spells also will not land on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Idol is lower-level than AoW and thus takes less damage and puts out more.  Still, a nice warm-up.<br />
<br />
Easiest to corner him using Gnome illusion so you can be sure nobody's closer than the MT.  Regardless, it's all about distance.  Get the MT close and everyone else far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">kilva/DS/Bard DS a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GroovinFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">max melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All you really need is DPS and Healing power if you can kill Idol unslowed you can kill The Avatar of War easyly, Dunno how much hps you have or what the highest hp war in your guild has but guild tank has 9.3k buffed so we dont use up that much mana on him. If your clerics have 60% mana after Idol unslowed you should be fine, Good luck on your AoW killing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">P.S. if you can kill idol unslowed does NOT mean you can kill Aow easily.<br />
<br />
AoW is a step up. Idol is just the best and closest approximation.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, Make SURE your Tank Rotation is set.<br />
<br />
We werent prepared for the sheer number of Hit Points AoW has and the Third tank (yes 6-9 mins+) did not do a good job of getting and holding agro.<br />
<br />
We lost at 1% :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Strategy is simple.  Reduce AoW HPs to Zero before you run out of tanks and healer mana.  He's pure melee.  No special abilities whatsoever.  The only real tip for beating him is make sure your tanks have as much DS as possible.  130-150 point DS is a huge boost to DPS on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Use levitate on your warriors if you want AE Taunt to work.  A simple run through the unleved raid force before transition should bounce you up to around crotch level.  Thats where you need to be for AET to work.<br />
<br />
Shrunken wood elf works as well for cornering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you see he is not slashing at all...take a dive.<br />
<br />
If he is slashing on every hit...push your guild and make sure he dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Originally posted by GroovinFV <br />
max melee range.  <br />
<br />
heh; if your guildmates run up to AoW and don't know max melee range axxeman; they WILL after you fight him :D<br />
<br />
can't emphasize that enough as groovinFV mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if you fear running low on mana, stick a necro or two with the cleric group and park a slowed caster giant nearby (knight tanked) for mindwrack. helps tons for those first close fights in case mana is a problem.<br />
<br />
another thing, iirc, his aggro is similar to &quot;undead&quot; aggro. or &quot;root&quot; aggro. i may be off on that one though. seemed that way when we did him anyway.<br />
<br />
good luck, it's still a great sight to see him curl up his toes ;)</div></div><hr />
