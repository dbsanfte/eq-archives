<br />
Thanks,<br />

Edit: Damn my fat fingers!!  Meant the 3/30 patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">umm....are you talking about a 3/30 or 3/20 patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a patch on the 30th of March.<br />
<br />
Cornering doesn't seem to be fixed so far, mobs don't go through walls but you can't pin them like before, at least in Ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually cornering is much better, still finding the tank dropping through the wall as an issue. VT seems especially horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In VT atm, cannot corner anything, neither shrunk twice (which never gave any problems before) nor with gnome illusion.<br />
Been thinking of trying unshrunk large races so the mob wont get pushed ontop of the MT.<br />
<br />
Add that tanks fall through the walls right and left. Fun fun...<br />
<br />
Edit: Either repop timer changed, or stuff doesnt repop in VT either atm. Also appeared that the raid dps was about 50% of what it usually is when killing TVK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoEB cornering was nicer today..mobs came close to corner...and there wasn't the annoying summoning out from corner that existed before....finding though that I'm sticking on PCs in raid a lot more now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just finished VT, horrible tanking situation. We were forced to box the mobs /sigh. Mobs just climb walls and such.<br />
<br />
I noticed a very slow respawn rate also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was tanking Emperor after patch and could not corner him max shrunk.<br />
<br />
Fell through wall once but got summoned back tho.<br />
<br />
This shit has got to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gask</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Could not corner PoE ring bosses at the zone in at all today, nothing went through a wall though.  Aggro was very funky also and so was proc rate with WA5.  Anyone else notice any aggro oddities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cyprex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Last night in a Sol Ro exp group, I proced my BoC 18, yes 18 times in a 1-2 min fight. Max melee stats, no WA at all yet. 18 Procs and still couldent get mobs off the beast lord that slowed once. Rest of the mobs I proced more than 6 times on in 1 min.<br />
<br />
Aggro was still hard to keep, AT taunt dident seem to do a thing, but Incite seems to work just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you haven't figured out why you're falling through the wall, it's because monsters have a bit of pushback when they melee, just like a PC, and in most cases they do quite a bit more pushback.  Well, when you back yourself tight into a corner, this melee pushback will push you through the wall, and make you fall through the world.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are 2 simple fixes; The first being not to corner the mob.  That's right, you heard it here first kids, not all beastmonsters have to be cornered in order to win. In fact, none do! wooot.<br />
Secondly, if you really do want to corner the beastmonster, you could try backing into a corner, then pressing the forward arrow key, or whatever key you have bound to the forward movement action.  In most cases, especially with larger beastmonsters, you can still effectivly &quot;corner&quot; without being completely backed into the corner.  It works wonders :)</div></div><hr />

I'd be happier if they just made cornering work the way it did before last week's patches ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Attempted to do MM last night, we pulled the first trigger tried to corner tank, he warped into the wall around 30% and came back with another trigger mob +4  adds, twas not a good night. This was after the ninja patch also, so other than smoothing out collisions some they haven't done much to fix the big problem people are having.</div></div><hr />

I'm just having a hard time understanding why people are still trying to corner mobs when they know the mob is going to end up falling into the wall or something similar, and I'm saying, there are ways to kill things without cornering so that maybe people will still be able to kill stuff untill/if they fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't you think AE rampage mobs were meant to be cornered though?<br />
<br />
Otherwise you would have to Cursed style fight them with 1 tank meleeing and everyone range attack it down. Maybe AE ramp mobs can be tanked in the open but how your melee stay on the tip of max melee range with a mob moving back and forth is what I would be interested to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Also, what about mobs with massive knockbacks like the Inny in Nadox?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">AE rampage monsters and knockback monsters can be treated very similarly.  The MA would stand at a corner, but a few steps out, so that he is in melee range while backed up all the way.  If he gets knockbacked, he would just move back up to his spot. For AE rampage monsters, what works is having the nukers facing away from the mob, pushing him out toward the melee, and the melee pushing him back in the corner, if one side is out pushing the other, then some of the melee can angle toward the side, or a nuker can face toward the monster and help the melee.  Take a look at this picture, it describes what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are ways sure, but cornering is conveinient, adds DPS and reduces damage on other meele then the MT so we want it back. <br />
BTW I'm not too worried about falling into the wall thing, its the fact that I cant HIT the mob when I try to corner it that breaks cornering for me.<br />
<br />
Sucks being OOR for heals dont it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Cornering is fucking awful.  It's seriously stupid.  Not only do mobs occassionally warp through walls, but you do too!  I couldn't corner a damn thing in VT last night.  No biggy, so we push them into the corner and fight them from the front.  It takes a little longer, but they're easy anyways.  So I'm fighting Mini-Aten when her melee pushes me back some and she summons me.  Excellent, I don't get summoned in front of her, I get summoned INTO the wall.  Well, tough shit, cause I just fell down from Mini-Aten's room into Blob1's room, aggro'd the Akhevans standing by the door, and the raid is all the sudden swarmed by a billion freaking adds.  Thank god they were all just mezzables and were locked down in short order.  <br />
<br />
It's seriously retarded.  Mobs warp through walls.  Mobs SUMMON YOU INTO WALLS.  You hear that SoE?  I hope you're reading this.  The *only* positive thing I can say about the entire ordeal though is that rangers can pink cornered mobs with their arrows like no tomorrow.  Now, if we could just start cornering *with* the benefit of ranger archery, that would fucking own.<br />
<br />
Btw, I can't ninjar look through walls anymore.  I know you were never really supposed to, but come on, that's the glory of being small!  :D</div></div><hr />

Maybe because they are testing to see if the cornering issues have been fixed.. some mobs will corner, some won't, it's trial and error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tanking Agnarr, the raid force was doing the pop at 75% health and a pet knocks him through a  wall. He summons me, and I fall down into the lava on the Evynd level, except I can't swim out. I'm OOR for heals so he beats on me, DI fires, he beats more, I die. Same happens to my back up before Agnarr repops in his chamber at 100% again. Meanwhile 2 top warriors can't get their corpses to be rezzed/summoned or anything else. They GYed just as Agnar died.<br />
<br />
Nice job by the people remaining to pick it up and win but what a piss off to have to stand in the GY hoping for a corpse to pop because of this stupid bug-assed shit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I was curious if anyone recalls a thread regarding caster push.  I was pointing out the modified TM) graphic used above and had a few casters adamantly stating that thier nukes did not have any push unless Lucy specifically showed a knockback.  Now, as long as I've been raiding I've always heard and believed the opposite but I don't really have any data to back this up.  I'm sure I can arrange a demonstration perhaps but it would be better if I could link them to a previous discussion on the matter.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heh cornering doesn't seem to be fixed at all, I had tormax jumping on my head when I tried cornertanking him earlier in kael... Also experienced the same shit in chardokb tanking korocrust... they just pop on your heads a bit and dont really go into the corner like they used to heh. Along with in BoT towers, you couldn't really push the mob into the corner anymore, he'd just pop up into a wall and you think he's gonna go into it so you have to have everyone back off and box the mob in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I corner tanked Tormax last weekend with no problems at all. Shrunk 2x barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Its kinda strange there are some corners where you actually can get a &quot;ghost&quot; of yourself to show in the first person view when you look straight up.  Definately some weird crap going on (it was pretty funny tanking the ancient in ST and seeing an image of myself between me and the mob).<br />
<br />
In most of the corner MT fights I've managed to work corners by doing side strafes out of the corner and then popping myself back in (yes dangerous).  This seems to reset the MOBs &quot;center of geometry&quot; back out of the wall so I can position myself between it and the corner.<br />
<br />
I suspect the real problem here has to do with collision detection of mobs vs that of players.  With the &quot;new&quot; collsion a mob can have its center of geometry more deeply pushed into objects than a player can.  Perhaps naively I think this is probably a simple fix in wideing large model mobs center of geometry numbers. This would prevent them from going &quot;farther&quot; into walls than a player.  They could also just not allow mobs to be pushed through players (see functionality that keeps a .5 elf from running through a barb PC).<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the getting summoned into a wall crap, falling through the world and dying is just plain sloppy work on SoEs part.  I think what is happening is that the mob is having its center of geometry actually pushed through the wall object....it then kicks in the code for OOR/Summon...the problem of course being the player then gets summoned into a solid object and then the default code &quot;for return to zone safe spot&quot; routine kicks in.  This routine of course forgets about the z axis calculation (which calcs falling damage) and you wind up dead as you are put to the &quot;safe spot&quot; (it gives you the gajillion pts of damage as the z axis differentional calc has a null because it wasnt kicked of legitimately).  3 bad code functions written together kicked off by an untested piece of new functionality.  <br />
<br />
Any way my 2 coppers on this...I'd hope that Soe has some analysts thinking through this set of events rather carefully.</div></div><hr />

Why do you corner exp monsters?</div></div><hr />

For some of us these exp mobs are still a decent fight  ;)   <br />
<br />
Plus, I think the point of the thread is to find out if/when cornering is fixed for any and all mobs...which it apparently isn't.</div></div><hr />
