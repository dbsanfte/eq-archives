GAME BITS: 'World of Warcraft' to debut week of Nov. 22<br />
<br />
October 24, 2004<br />
<br />
BY HEATHER NEWMAN<br />
FREE PRESS COLUMNIST<br />
<br />
One of the most anticipated PC games of the year now has a launch date.<br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; the online world game from the makers of the incredibly popular &quot;Warcraft&quot; strategy game series, is scheduled to launch the week of Nov. 22, the Free Press has learned.<br />
<br />
Most stores have predicted Nov. 15 would be the launch date for &quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; guessing that Sony Online Entertainment's behemoth &quot;Everquest 2&quot; would come out on or near the same day. But Phil O'Neil, president, North America, of &quot;Warcraft&quot; publisher Vivendi Universal Games, said the game will actually launch a week after the company's other hot holiday title, &quot;Half-Life 2,&quot; which debuts Nov. 16.<br />
<br />
&quot;We think that it will do extremely well,&quot; he said. That's pretty much a given internationally, since textbooks have been written on how earlier games from the developer of &quot;Warcraft,&quot; Blizzard, have single-handedly changed the economy in countries like South Korea. Here, though, it may face stiffer competition from &quot;Everquest 2.&quot;<br />
<br />
So what are the two games like? I've had the luxury of playing both in the beta tests that are currently under way.<br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; is a fast-paced fantasy set in the world of the strategy game series. You choose to play as either Horde (orcs, trolls, tauren and undead) or Alliance (humans, dwarves, night elves or gnomes).<br />
<br />
Some servers will give players the chance to fight the other faction when they're in contested territory. Others will be more player-vs.-environment focused, but still allow for dueling, raids and specialized battlefields where factions can face off.<br />
<br />
When not fighting against each other, players complete quests (typically fetch and deliver, kill monsters or collect items) and craft simple items. There are more than enough quests in the game to level a character from 1 to 60 without having to randomly kill the monsters in the world if you don't want to.<br />
<br />
That's also true in &quot;Everquest 2,&quot; which adds the feature of hearing all quest text spoken aloud by actors. (In &quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; it appears on screen like writing on parchment, with some small introductory vocals in some cases.) Players in &quot;Everquest 2&quot; choose Good or Evil factions, with some neutral races able to choose between either.<br />
<br />
The crafting system of &quot;Everquest 2&quot; is also much deeper than &quot;World of Warcraft,&quot; with more complex recipes, a system that can actually kill you (!) and some items that carry better statistics than most drops you can get in the world. The pace of the two games is drastically different. &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; speeds along, making it easy to level up and experience new areas, quests and challenges. &quot;Everquest 2,&quot; while much faster than the original &quot;Everquest,&quot; still moves much more slowly.<br />
<br />
Expect a head-to-head review in the Free Press as we get closer to launch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vivendi owns Blizzard, so if they say it's gonna come out on the 22nd, it probably will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm amazed at the number of people that are pissed off that VU would have the gall to announce the release date instead of &quot;letting&quot; Blizzard do it.<br />
<br />
What's even more amazing is the &quot;official&quot; word from Blizzard is that the release date has still not been officially announced.<br />
<br />
Sounds like someone's asking to be fired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">draken</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree  VU seems to be leap froging bliz on the date or the guy never got the memo  saying  let blizz make there own announcement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezon</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be happy to see it by xmas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreyre</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vivendi is a publicly traded company.  They can not bullshit around with releases and release dates due to the laws surrounding stock markets.  I know most people feel that VU should let Blizzard do everything on their own but they really just cant as they are publicly traded.  They just can not be silent about the release of a multi-million dollar making product that will be released soon.</div></div><hr />
