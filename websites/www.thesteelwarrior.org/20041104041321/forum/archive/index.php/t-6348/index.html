<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once again I ask, after having made some improvements along with a few levels. I am looking for suggestions from the masses again.<br />
<br />
I belong to a small family guild that can yield 2 groups 60 to 65 on a regular basis. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Das_bert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try to get BoT mini's for ornate, or maybe if you cant field the force, check stats on SS armour, or grind in LDoN's, some nice AP gear there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guess I should add that no LDON on this account, maybe I should go ahead and get it eh?<br />
<br />
Also need to get 62 before I can even think about BoT but just how effectively will I be able to get groups as a 62 Warrior short of guild groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Das_bert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless you know the people in the groups, your chances are pretty slim.  Sorry I generally 4 box, 65 war, 65 chanter, 62 cleric, and a 61 druid.  And then fill in the 2 slots with any dps lfg.  I really recomend LDoN's for armour for a small guild. sometimes your resources may not be enough for BoT, LDoN's are good for the points, and while upgrading augs drop too.  Thats what i am doing right now.  usually no more than 20 people on in my guild at a time now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zilden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Untill you get lvl 65 and really start to feel the need to do bigger encounters your armor isnt to bad. The thing i noticed most was your need for a better 2handed weapon for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">get 2 bracer of benevolences. lose some hp but will put you near 4k unbuffed</div></div><hr />
