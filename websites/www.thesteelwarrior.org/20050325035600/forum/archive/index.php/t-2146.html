My guild tried him last night and we couldn't keep up with the Blindness. I had a couple people chain casting Remove Curse on me, but it just wasn't good enough.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that Remove Greater Curse would make the difference for us. But, I am also wondering if the Blindness can be resisted. My resists were well over 250 and that did not seem to help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any input :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best way i've seen yet to deal with single target blindness is....<br />
<br />
Two boxing a 2nd toon (preferably on a 2nd monitor).<br />
<br />
Close runner up would be a phone call to someone who can see what's going on directing you.<br />
<br />
For IV (or any rooted mob), another good idea would be to build up a TON of aggro before you start; then he'll make sure you stay right next to him w/ periodic summons. :)  How to build (or let someone else build and then clone!) massive aggro left as a exercise for the reader...<br />

<br />
1) debuff mob<br />
<br />
2) Have an SK chain cast those +hate spells that dont do any damage for a long time<br />
<br />
3) Have the warrior go up and taunt the mob until they get insane_sk_agro + 1 then back out.<br />
<br />
4) engage mob with raid force while the agro SK feigns or stays back<br />
<br />
If you do this you should have so much agro that you will get summoned back to the mob if you ever get out of range.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">put 3-4 ogres behind MT at the stone ledge thingy, with IV's back to the centre of the room. if no ogres, use illusion. the Fatwall can attack IV from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when my guild was doing IV we found there is a spot with the MTs back against the structure behind IV that the MT could still attack from but when KB'd he wouldn't move anywhere due to the structure.  So once the MT had good aggro (since the spot is a fairly long distance away you lose proximity aggro) everyone else could simply beat him down from behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhisz</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, there most definetely is a spot you can stand to avoid getting knockback'ed. For ease of getting into that spot, use the trick described above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menia</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And for the blind-part: My guild used GameVoice or normal phone to guide the tank while blinded (we only have two Warriors who can bot another toon). Takes some time to get used to it, but works great... and in most cases, it isn't needed 'cause of Barb-Ogre-Troll wall, anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mrith</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah,get the mt infront of the pillar thing where IV is,all the caster behind/to the sides of it,but before you do all this,have a shamy go up infront of IV out of his range and debuff him,the shamy will have agro so the raid can set up behind the pillar and the warrior can get infront,and with all of the melee you want them to like box the MT in so when the mob casts blast back he stays there,but if you have ogres use them instead,they work best,we would always use a druid or someone to chain cast GRC,you shouldnt be blind for more than 10sec if he is chain casting correctly,this is just the way my guild use to do it,hopefully it will help some.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild killed this guy yesterday. Unfortuneatly I was stuck playing cleric and was behind the wall healing. I have no idea what the guild did but they killed him. Works for me!<br />
<br />
(Some help this post was.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried the &quot;Wall of Fat&quot; technique yesterday on IV and it didn't quite work as intended. Here is what we did. <br />
<br />
Had 3 warriors + MA get ogre illusion. Sk agro'd IV and MA + wall of fat got in possition in front of IV.  3 warriors not MAing stood with their butts on the wall, MA stood in front of them. I was MAing so I would get blinded and still tossed up behind the wall of fat. <br />
<br />
So what were we doing wrong? Should the MA be shrunk so he wont clear the wall of fat? That's what I think at least. I should have just stayed in dorf form instead of being made an ogre. <br />
<br />
We still killed him. I got used to being able to tell when I was knocked back and if I got summoned back in front of him. Once I was blinded I would just listen for a second and if it wasn't quiet it would mean I was tossed but not summoned, hence I would just move forward a few steps until I could hear me hitting IV again.<br />
If I would hear that I was summoned I would just backup a step or until I could hear me hitting IV.<br />
<br />
Like 3 people died because of me being OOR of IV and him switching to someone else but other than that it went pretty smooth. I just wish the wall of fat would have worked better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas-<br />
<br />
Just a tip, but on most non-undead-aggro rooted mobs, if you build up enough aggro, it won't matter if you are OOR- nobody else will get hit while you are knocked/summoned back.  If other folks got switched to, you probably didn't do enough aggro building before the fight...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just have a Sk / Pally agro tank it then? Sounds like an easier plan. No one getting hit = good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because alot of guilds do not have the healing power to keep up with a non-defensive tank for as long as it takes to kill IV.  My guild is working on him now.  We actually caught him up with enough people to try him but while we were killing his guards one gated on me (we didn't know they would gate, hehe) and then summoned me to IV where the other guards aggroed me and then my healers and proceeded to make short work of all of us pretty fast.  We never did get to try him.  We were planning on using a defensive chain, though.  All out top tanks can basically pull aggro off each other at will, so switching isn't tough at all for us and all are well equipped (we're currently racing each other for the top HPs - I'm barely winning at 7400+ in raid buffs).  We have a good tank team, but we are low on DPS classes so the fight would take a while for us.  His DPS really isn't bad but we want to be able to last the fight for certain, so a SK or Pally tank really isn't an option for us (especially since our 2 SKs are 53 and 58 and we can't seem to hang on to pallies for some reason).  In reality, aggro isn't a problem for us because our top 3 Warriors are the best equipped melees in the guild and can out damage everyone else in pure melee.  Oh yea, 2 of us bot.  Me with a 62 Druid and another with a 63 Cleric, so the blind is easy for us to handle.<br />
  <br />
Hoping to get a shot at this guy again soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fake enrage btw.<br />
pallys + SU3 = dps ;) <br />
<br />
keep your DPS on the carpet,<br />
keep your tanks on the stone structure (there's at least 1 spot where you don't get knocked back)<br />
<br />
we used to bio orb the living daylights out of him (monk did that pre-charge), which really pissed him off. then the clerics and bard and casters (i think casters as well) walked past him and set up camp slightly to the side behind him, MTs went into position, and attacked.<br />
sooner or later he turned around to the MT and beat them silly :p<br />
dps turn on atk, go afk (not really, just in case he turns, don't want to catch a knockback because of possible adds).<br />
stupid long ass luclin fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">done itraer a few times.  placed #1 a few times while parsing(was only 2+ paladins with SU3 enabled when i first saw this guy). Get some SU3 paladins on these undead luclin mobs, I   did over 60k damage before on him alone.  However, usually im too busy casting GRC to others telling me (blind sucks), or casting heals on others who got eaten by adds, or temporarily tanking an add till a warrior gets on it (unless its undead :) )  But once we got enough druids and other GRC casters the spell i usually ended up dps... sorry to say but knights tanking this guy hurts, bad (i had the tiny experience of doing so).  Got it to the point where this guy dies before my undead disc was over (5minutes) when we had enough  online (~40) and i was doing nothing else other than meleeing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been farming IV now for a while.  We discovered that IV is nowhere near as tough as he has been made out to be.  For one thing, if his AE is hitting, it isn't really doing much.  We never have to heal anyone but the tank.  Second, his melee is absolutely crap.  We have an SK cast aggro for a while, then rush him.  A single Druid can keep up healing on the SK once IV is debuffed.  After all the hype made about this guy he is somewhat disappointing.<br />
<br />
PS - we have yet to bother with RGC or group heals at all during this fight.  Nobody has died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we did IV was have someone build up insane amount of aggro, usually someone who debuffs, then warrior and 4 odd people set up behind IV.  Warrior either shrinks or gets illusion gnome so he is small.  4 odd people stand behind warrior and get illusion gnome and stand real tight next to each other and do not move.  Then they remove thier illusion and get illusion Ogre so that there is no space between them.  Once warrior engages, he will be blind almost instantly. and get hit with a knockback, as long he is small and the ogres are there then he shouldnt get past the ogre wall and still be able to maintain agro.  I am luck enuff that my wife plays a cleric so when I get blinded i just look at her computer to see the action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of that is basically the inflation of the game, you're five levels higher now and your UNBUFFED hps is equal to what my BUFFED hp was at the time IV was a challenge.  The real issue wasn't him anyway it was his room and the 'bad' things that could happen.<br />
<br />
When we did wipe on IV it wasn't from him killing tanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IV is easy, and you don't need a wall of ogres.  Here's how:<br />
<br />
1)  fight your way to around behind the IV.  There is a short stone wall right there.  Get everyone possible behind it.<br />
<br />
2) Have an enchanter repeatedly cast Tash on IV.<br />
<br />
3)  Have the MA create a hotkey with the /rsay message &quot;I am BLIND&quot;.<br />
<br />
4)  Assign someone to keep the MA targeted and cast cure blindness when the MA indicates he is blind.<br />
<br />
5) When all the above are done, have the MA walk up to IV, put his (the Tanks) back towards that low stone wall, and hit Defensive, AE Taunt, and auto-attack.<br />
<br />
6) Have the raid engage the IV in a furious beatdown.<br />
<br />
7) When the MA is blinded, hit your special hotkey.  When you can see again, move up a step if you need to.  I have never needed to, but you never know.<br />
<br />
Using this method no one but the MA gets hit or blinded.  It really is a pretty easy fight.  If you zerg your way from zoneline to the IV room the whole raid can be over in maybe 30-45 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shei was bugged last time we tried it, real Shei popped before vendor and the adds were dead. 2 shei's plus 8 adds plus DT and more adds, it ended up looking like caprin cycle except robes instead of skellys.</div></div><hr />
