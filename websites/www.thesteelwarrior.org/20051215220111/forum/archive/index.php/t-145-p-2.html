Other tests have been done with statisticlly significant amounts of data.  They are found on old forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your results don't need more hits to generate acurate average hits. You need more tests at various ac levels  to determine the slope of your curve. <br />
<br />
As posted before, the last, and highest ac test didn't yeild the results that would be expected from the linear trend could be due to getting close to the minimum hit damage of the mob. I hope it is that, because it is the only data point where you are buffed and it has been surmised that ac from buffs works a little differently from raw and gear ac.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the same, or a more thorough test done on a diferent type of mob. I think that you will should get the same curve, and that curve is what will shed light on the math behind the AC number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I would like to point out to the people that say there is no more softcap. By the nature of the way the combat engine works, there is necessarily a soft cap. Due to a mob always having a minimum hit, the slope of the line when you graph AC/average hit is always going to flatten out as your AC becomes high enough that the majority of hits are for minimum.<br />
<br />
The trick is finding the point at which the gains for more AC are not as great as the gains for more HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wandor : biggest problem is there is no definite answer to that trick : the point you are looking for is not the same for different mobs.. i would say it has to do with the ATK of the mob.. so the 'softcap' for xp is not the softcap for raid tanking ( as bosses prolly have more ATK ) ... so the real softcap would be the one versus the hardest mofos in game... and i think noone is willing to run parses versus them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Sylvaiania.  The soft cap for xp mobs and the soft cap for Fenin Ro are probably different and both are probably based on that mobs attack rating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so the 'softcap' for xp is not the softcap for raid tanking ( as bosses prolly have more ATK ) <br />
<br />
This has always been the case. 1200ac was way more than you needed for most exp mobs in Velious, that just happened to be the point that bosses ATK overcame the additional benefits of any more AC.<br />
<br />
The difference now is that the PoP uber mobs have considerably higher ATK ratings. There have been a few FR and RZ parses, but nothing conclusive yet. The good news is, if you are tanking these mobs, you don't have to choose between AC or HP, the gear you have access to has both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actaully I tend to disagree :p<br />
<br />
I will have to take a look at it, but lets dispell an untrue hypothesis right now, hitting harder does not mean a mob has more ATK.<br />
<br />
As we know for a fact from players, more atk does not increse a players max hit, it just means you hit near max more often.<br />
<br />
Im guessing that how hard a mob hits is a completely separate entry in the database than a mobs innate atk value.<br />
<br />
Lets use some real world examples.<br />
<br />
Xegony the queen of Air = 2440 max hit.<br />
Rallos Zek the Warlord = 1072 max hit (iirc)<br />
<br />
From pure hit size alone, one might deduce that Xegony has far more ATK than RZTW.<br />
<br />
Xegony = 40% min hits(DI=1), 60% of the rest spread equally over DI=2 to DI=20.<br />
RZTW = like 60% max hits (DI=20) and the other 40% spread between DI=1 amd DI=19<br />
<br />
I have parsed RZTW with chain cure and bard song so that most of the fight I was at 2k AC. he still hits for max a ton.<br />
<br />
My point is, RZTW atk is oviously cranked up. More AC doesnt seem to help very much.  WHile Xegonys ATK isnt that bad, you can mitigate a large number of her hits to min and more AC helps alot.<br />
<br />
So which has higher ATK, obviously, to me at least, RZTW's ATK &gt;&gt;&gt; Xegony's ATK.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you parse your average exp mobs in PoP, it seems that the % of min hits and distribution of all hits are about the same on exp mobs as they are for uber mobs. This tells me that their ATK levels are very similar, even though exp mobs hit for double 500, and ubers hit for quad 1-4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Solinar.  Using a &quot;slightly&quot; less uber example, take the boss in the hedge quest in PoN.  He hits for around 1100 or so max, but most of his hits are for around 300 or so.  So he has a pretty high max damage, but I'd say he has a pretty low ATK.  I think this is true of a lot of the PoP mobs.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion that's why AC seems to matter again.  We can actually get our AC between the minimum needed to be effective (AC floor?) and the softcap.  With Velious and Luclin bosses, presumably the mobs had such high ATK that it wasn't possible to even reach the AC floor so your AC didn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well you may true sol ... i though it was clear for everyone here that atk and damage was not related ... <br />
to clear it :  we know dmg = DB+X*DI for a mob , with X random between 1 and 20 , and DB and DI dependant on mob...  atk allow to hit closer to max , so increase X . AC ( well , mitigation one, the one from stuff and buffs ) allow hit to land for lower damage, lowering X. that is why Ac and atk are directly opposed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I reread the uber mob tanking thread that is stickied.  Anway, the notions that wars on this board have about ac/attack and mobs are really stated in that thread and my post alluded to that thread really.<br />
<br />
I would guess that any damage table has min possible values and max possible value where ac can mitigate OR attack can increase damage values and then you approach one extreme and the value of increasing/decreasing starts to show fewer results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hidaguard</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I'm glad I read back through before posting, or I would have sounded like a complete idiot, lol, but I do have a question.<br />
<br />
Did you parse for the same amount of mobs per ac lvl?  (have to have some sort of &quot;control a&quot; you know, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was 1 mob. I didnt kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zewlaga</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just been tossing this around today after reading this post. But basically it looks to me to be something like this:<br />
<br />
DMG = DB + (x+(y*(av-ac) / 20) * DI<br />
<br />
Where x = random number 1-20 (damage intervals)<br />
            y = random number 0-20 (can still hit for min so 0 included)<br />
            x = max(20) anything over 20 will return 20 or max dam.<br />
           av = an attack value assigned to each mob<br />
           ac = armor class value based on your ac<br />
<br />
This will push the damage curve to the right given a higher attack value for a mob (they hit for closer to max damage more often).  And push the damage curve back to the left with more AC ( they hit for less more often).<br />
<br />
This would mean that each mob would have a different AC softcap, but that number could be determined given enough sample data.<br />
<br />
I can explain the formula if needed, but I think it is somewhat self explanatory.  Let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
