<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Attached is a screenie of the first level AA costs from Beta(NDA was lifted).<br />
<br />
However since I never actually made enough exp to buy level 2 in any skill, I was wondering if anyone could tell me if the 3 level skills like shield block, veterans wrath, death blow are 3+3+3=9 AA to complete, or 3+6+9=18 AA to complete?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While on the subject, anyone know if reflexive mastey and defensive instincts are 5 - 5 - 5... or something different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Two answer my own question(and the one above), it appears that the 3 level AAs that start with cost 3, go 3-6-9.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was fiarly sure the devs had said there will be no level requirements for the AAs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As in you won't need a certain amount of aa's before you can level up because that had been rumored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No devs have definatly said no AAs needed to level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, I was saying as in you don't need aa's to level up but like PoP you need to be a certain level for some tiers of the aa's.<br />
<br />
Devs said you wouldn't need a certain amount of aa's to level up but they never said that you didn't need a certain level to obtain certain aa's or tiers of aa's.  I'm referring to the level requirements posted a few above.</div></div><hr />
