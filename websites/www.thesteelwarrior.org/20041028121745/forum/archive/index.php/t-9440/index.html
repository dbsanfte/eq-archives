<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>arganax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering what it takes to tank in this zone.  I know that my normal group isn't quite ready for MPG yet, but I was hoping that we could start going here some.  I'm really tired of WoS and DH and this would be a nice change.  My magelo is linked, and the rest of my group is similarly equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be fine. If you can handle the north half of WoS, the central portion of RCoD shouldn't be much if any harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The statue in the center of zone is a good camping spot.... covers 3 ph's for named. Warrior can easily single pull too.<br />

You're gtg gear-wise, although I'd recommend to others that more defensive aa's would help quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Even with a cleric, shammy, ranger x2, beastlord... all 67-69, I came close to dying a handful of times in a couple hours (read as under 6% hps).<br />
<br />
Cleric, quite reputable, said he was being mana effecient.....  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>arganax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replies, yeah I agree I need to get the defensive aas asap.  I had to get my agro issues taken care of first, but now that I've done that (for now at least) I am concentrating on the defensive aas.  Actually, I'm lvl68 atm and I'm thinking I should get LR5 and ID5 before I make the push to lvl70.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, you're better off than me, and I've tanked there with guild groups numerous times.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd recommend doing that. XP in WoS/RCoD is going to decrease a bit at 70, and without them, even with 70 you're going to be getting beat up badly in MPG. It's probably not a big deal though, if you win a 69 rune i'd go ahead and level up to scribe it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've crawled around in Ruined City with guildies in less than blanced groups hehe.  It was challenging, but no real problems at all.  Besides being less croweded than WoS, there are the Sewer and Catacomb expeditions there too =)<br />
