<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorno Snave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A long while back when augments first came out SoE was debating on how to handle the warrior epic. Since its combined in the scabbard to switch from two 1hs to one 2hs.  They made an annoucement stating that the epic had to be turned in to an NPC to recieve the new augmented versions.  I did not do this for fear SoE would screw it all up.<br />
<br />
Can anyone post information on what I need to do in order to get the augmentable versions on the first epic?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Goto where the quest started in East Freeport (the slums) and talk to the dwarf. He will ask for the scabbard and 2hander. Give those to him and voila you get 2x 1handers and the 2hander back that you can aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>daoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">btw, apparently if you did the trick with the summoned blade to get both the 1 handers and the two hander at the same time, you can have 2 redblades and 2 blueblades, one of each that can be augmented and one of each that cannot</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kailyn posted about it. <br />
<br />
I'll do a search.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Well, I can't find Kailyn's post but there is another: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8311&amp;highlight=scabbard<br />
<br />
Basically, it uses the mage summoned item sword, which will allow you to make your blades like normal if combined in your scabbard.  Once done, take scabbard and 2hs to the dude like normal. Voi La! <br />
