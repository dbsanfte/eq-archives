Put the entire group that passed you over on your ignore/no-grouping list, and ask all your friends and guildies to ignore them too.</div></div><hr />

I can't run a 4 minute mile.  I know this is true.  I know people who can.  Am I causing the perception that I suck because I can't or is it merely the truth?  <br />
<br />
The problem isn't that Warriors are generating a false perception that their class &quot;sucks&quot;.  The problem is the game mechanics now clearly favor other classes for our primary and really only significant role and we, as a class, have been given nothing with which to compete nor have we been given other tools that add equal value.<br />
<br />
Perception is perception.  Facts are facts.  Perceptions don't always equal facts, as for example when during Luclin and Velious Knights were still seen as second class tanks.  The facts didn't support the perceptions.  However, the current facts are that Warriors can not under any common circumstances compete with Knight aggro generation.  While Knights can quite commonly compete very closely with Warrior damage absorption. <br />
<br />
Facts are stronger than perceptions, when all is said and done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on if you need to run a 4 minute mile or not.  <br />
<br />
If you decide that you suck because you can't and loudly announce to anyone who asks (and quite a few that don't) that you suck without explaining why, then people will just assume you suck.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the lower popularity of monks in pick up groups has nothing to do with the near certainty that taking a monk in a pick up group will subject you to whining about how much monks suck until you disband the monk in question.  Never seen that happen, not me.</div></div><hr />

It had to be said, now take a few deep breaths and remember feedback is your friend, Feedback everyday and hopefully if Absor comes back to the tavern treat him somewhat decently and ask where our class tuning is.<br />
<br />
Then ask if we can at least score one goat away from the paladins... ^_^</div></div><hr />

About the only thing i have that helps me get groups anymore is reputation among those that Know me. How about a rapid taunt AA skill for warriors. That way mashing taunt every 0.10 second would actually mean something. Anyway time to get  back to duoing in PoD with my Necro friend. fun fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavr</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gotten groups lots of times from friends that ooc'ed for me to come to their group.  I rarely check to see who is in zone when I go in.  <br />
<br />
Your just assuming that group wanted a paladin rather then a warrior because you think paladins are that much better then warriors.  The truth could simply be that they wanted that person because of friends, or perhaps they had a warrior already.  <br />
<br />
It's better to get all the facts before you bring even more fuel to this fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Stop trying to throw that in there, because frankly its retarded. A 62 paladin getting picked over the 65 war is dumb, and shouldn't be happening. <br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that they may have gotton chosen because they already had a warrior was at least a good point. A rare, but good point. If I was the group leader though I would go after a higher DPS pc.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the group allready had a warrior. Maybe... a thousand reasons why,  but from a snipet of a SS we will never know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
AA's are on of the defining factors once you reach lvl 65,  that is why people care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, but if the other group doesn't know you, why should they trust the numbers you tell them?  And it's not like they're going to ask you what AAs you have.  I occasionally see something like &quot;AM3 &amp; EQ Ranger LFG&quot; but otherwise, the # of AAs don't mean much to me if I don't know you.  There are certainly other factors that are more important than AAs given an unknown player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its also some other factors that come into play.<br />
I get tells for groups from complete strangers sometimes even if i dont have LFG up in PoTranquility.<br />
Obviously some people look for others from certain guilds assuming that their AA/gear is way superior to any untagged or smaller guild tank.<br />
But all in all i am not unhappy with my own situation.<br />
Yesterday i was called to stop playing my cleric and get on my main by a guild group when knights were available(PoEarth group).<br />
So some people still appreciate a warrior tank.</div></div><hr />

Or it could have been a druid healing the party and needed the Paly for heal abilities.  Add in a &quot;and symbol buffs&quot;, I rather agree with this statement, although I rarely ever see a paladin actually carrying around peridots for symbols (scary, I carry around all the reagents for my spells, even if I barely use them).  I usually see a &quot;anyone got any peridots?&quot; from the paladins...or a &quot;let me go get Virtue&quot;.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

I remember one time I mistyped 'Brells please' to &quot;symbol please&quot; while buffing up in raids and sure enough, got the &quot;no dots&quot; response.</div></div><hr />

I usually don't carry dots because I very rarely cast symbol. When I'm out, I try to remember to go buy a stack, but I usually end up giving that stack away to clerics in bits and pieces before I use them myself.<br />
<br />
I did a LDoN assassination last night, and we had a druid healer. First time in a VERY long time that I used symbol, and I symboled everyone in the group. In hindsight, it wasn't needed, but we were playing it safe.</div></div><hr />
