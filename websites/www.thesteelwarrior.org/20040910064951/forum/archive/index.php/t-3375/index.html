<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A dozen times I have read posts from Plaladins and Shadow Knights that Warriors have to be limited to disfunctional aggro control because Survivability + Snap Aggro on Demand + Ranged Aggro &quot;Breaks the Game&quot;.<br />
<br />
For purposes of this discusion I'm defining Survivability as sufficient AC, HPs, and mitigation to tank effectively.<br />
<br />
It's pretty clear that Knights have the Survivability to tank in experiance groups without causing the Main Healer to request frequent med breaks. Their Survivability + Snap Aggro on Demand + Ranged Aggro allow the experiance group to kill faster and with less risk.<br />
<br />
This would seem to bolster the claim that Survivability + Snap Aggro on Demand + Ranged Aggro &quot;Breaks the Game&quot;. I suppose Knights believe breaking only the non-raid portion of the game doesn't count.<br />
<br />
Let's concider Griegg. A Paladin MT's. Is he Breaking the Game? No? Why?<br />
<br />
How about AoW, Seru, Rallos Zek, Finnien Ro, or Quarm?<br />
<br />
What we have now is obvious. When a Paladin uses Survivability + Snap Aggro on Demand + Ranged Aggro to &quot;Break the Game&quot; it's OK because it's either the non-raid portion of the game (doesn't count) or it's the raid potion of the game and it doesn't count because..... because...???. Gosh, I don't know why!<br />
<br />
Surely it's not because they aren't really MT's. We've already agreed all three plate wearing tanks are and should be MT's.<br />
<br />
The only possible explanation is Defensive. Yep that 3 minute discipline is the only rational reason.<br />
<br />
So I have a proposal. Give Warriors a unique skill that is scaleable and provides Snap Aggro on Demand and Ranged Aggro (0 sec Stun? Call it Deadly Insult or something?) that is available only when Defensive is not in force.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Breaks the Game&quot; objection is easily overcome. Without this ability, Warriors are beefy Knights with disfunctional aggro control and no spells in an experiance group environment where their extra beef is not required.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think the arguements bull in the first place really. For the sake of arguement though it would also have to disable defensive for a period after it's use for say, a minute?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I disagree with it disabling Defensive for a minute. One of the purposes would be to allow slowing on incoming and to be just as certain as Knights of grabbing incoming mobs.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Furious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Took me a minute to see what you're saying, but I like it.<br />
Warriors would have the choice of fighting in 2 different modes - offensive or defensive. If offensive, you have snap agro and similar agro-lock as knights, but defensive is not available. I think in offensive mode you should have a way to increase DPS a modest amount or maybe even a group shield -- more utility along with knights.<br />
In defensive, I think maybe increasing the disc to 5 minutes.<br />
I think the idea of disabling defensive for at least a minute is a good one. That would keep the warrior from generating a lot of agro and then going defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the point is simply this....<br />
<br />
EVERYONE...<br />
<br />
If we give warriors... <br />
<br />
AGGRO-LOCK, SNAP AGGRO, RANGED AGGRO...<br />
<br />
This will BREAK the game....<br />
<br />
BUT....<br />
<br />
PALADINS ALREADY HAVE ALL OF THIS....<br />
<br />
BUT.. paladins say...<br />
<br />
We dont have DEFENSIVE.... <br />
<br />
SO its balanced they say...<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
What really happens is this... <br />
<br />
THE GAME IS ALREADY BROKE.. <br />
<br />
Except for the 5-6 mobs that a defensive warrior is actually prefered on...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So it is OK, for Paladins to break the game, but NOT OK for warriors??<br />
<br />
Either NERF THE HELL out of Paladins, or GIVE US the same AGGRO GENERATION ABILITIES...<br />
<br />
I dont mind sharing the playing field...<br />
<br />
But I am damn tired of playing T-ball in bumfuk egypt, while the paladins play Yankee stadium...<br />
<br />
We aren't even in the same league anymore.. <br />
<br />
We Know it..<br />
Paladins Know...<br />
EVERY CLASS KNOWS IT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I say its BS.  Very little would change if Warriors had stronger skills that generated agro when needed even at range.<br />
<br />
If this was really a problem, then why would SOE alow this to happen with Warriors in raids?  There is no challenge or test of skill in making sure the Warrior MT holds agro.  So why are some players so sure it will break the game if Warriors could at least contribute something to their own role?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i agree with BB, most of the defense of claims made by paladins when ive caught them when their wrong is &quot;you have defensive, i cant MT yet, so you get raiding and i get xp&quot;<br />
<br />
honestly i dont think we owe them shit, and having the dev team admit at the last FF that taunt was broke and that melee dmg was shit just bolsters what ive been saying.<br />
<br />
and you know what makes matters worse is i cant get a BoT group to help me get better HP and AC so im fucked, but a paladin can get his ornate and move on, so that just shits a brick on our hp and ac advantage's pillow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have played two warriors both to 65. I have never had an issue getting groups or getting gear and upgrades.<br />
<br />
I can hold aggro off a paladin/sk unless he/she really wants it and /shrug if he does yeah me less carpal tunnel from pounding taunt and I let him tank.<br />
<br />
I agree our aggro generation is weak at best and having seen SKS tank RZtw , VZ,TZ and Ele minis I cant see how defensive is our is &quot;balancing ability&quot;<br />
<br />
But I just have never experienced any group telling me &quot;sorry we dont want warriors&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While some knights do come here posting wildly defensive things, others really are trying to forward the discussion of what might provide Warriors some balance.  For example, below is a quote from Knight/Warrior Class Balance thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3093) that I made on September 18th.  There are other examples of Paladins making valid contributions to discussions on this board as there are Warriors who make valid contributions to discussions at Paladins of Norrath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Graderr mentions the idea of 2 aggro abilities on a 30 second timer. I think the amount of aggro he uses is a bit high (600 – 650 hate), especially on the ranged version. But I like the idea in general. I would like to see the melee-range ability have higher aggro, enough to counter one cast of slow. The ranged version should have enough to get aggro from the puller, but not enough to counter slow. Maybe half the aggro of the first ability. These abilities should be WAR only.<br />
<br />
This would give the Warrior a way to get aggro focused on him/her on incoming, and then immediately cement it once the mob gets to camp. It would give Warriors the initial aggro of a Paladin casting Cease on incoming, then Force of Akilae once the mob gets to camp. Knights would still retain an aggro advantage because our stuns recycle faster, but the advantage would be much closer to the Warriors advantage in HP/AC/Mitigation than is the case now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ideas discussed in that quote might not meet anyone's wishlist of what should happen, but they certainly not made by someone who is not interested in discussing balance.  Notice my post mentions both the things that Battlebalde discusses in his post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i have had a group do that to me, we were all ready to go and then our chanter left, we got another and then the group leader(with out asking my hp or ac) told me that he didnt think i would be enough of a tank to hold the agro(had CHoS, SoBW) and that they had a pally on the way, so i said &quot;burn in hell assling(he was a haffer rogue)&quot; and left the group needless to say a GM was bugging me later but didnt do anything to me because he thought their grounds for kicking from the group was crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sounds like a good argument to remove defensive from the game to me.<br />
<br />
Oh and this quote is 100% true:<br />
<br />
THE GAME IS ALREADY BROKE..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/agree Splaktar...and a heck of a lot of you too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The game is broke and I dont think they want warrior to have Knight aggro because it makes the game unchallenged. With a knight there is a trade-off (albeit a damn small hp/ac trade off for aggro lock) and more healing on the knight. The warrior has the less aggro (not that big of a difference, I have sham's slow on INC and at best they take a bit of damage and heal themselves while i get aggro) but need less healing because of his hp/ac/mitigation bonus. I dont think warrior aggro will ever be improved any more then it is now except maybe more itemization. But I agree that groups make a bigger trade-off by taking a warrior into the group because we bring less, and knight hp/ac is to close and should be fixed. I am not saying a nerf. But whatever the hell SOE needs to do to fix the damn gap.</div></div><hr />
