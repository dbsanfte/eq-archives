<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm fairly certain you either need to do the first parts again, or hope that /petition will land on the desk of a sympathetic GM. <br />
<br />
The second option is likely to work, since your server went down. When you fill out your petition, ask the GM to check the transaction logs which prove you did the turn-in.<br />
<br />
About that stupid Vah Shir ---- the spoiler is useful, but the fact is that this particular leg of the quest has some variable timing in it. That guy doesn't always spawn when you think he should, he doesn't always spawn WHERE you think he should, and you've got to get the timing right once you encounter him.<br />
<br />
Good luck with getting this resolved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Will give that a try then Lathen, thanks!<br />
<br />
Oh btw, sorry about the Canada thing.  you can always move to a real country.  /wink<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gummo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd recommend re-starting the quest, it will be faster and less dissapointing than petitioning and getting told that there's nothing the GM is willing to do to help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mendler has nothing to lose with /petition, gummo.<br />

And I sure wouldn't start over, even if the GM does refuse to intervene. What I would do (and what I advise my buddies to do) is to stay away from all the first stages of the quest until you've got Valdanov's ashes. All that stuff could be done in a single evening with a good group. But there's no point in doing all that junk if you can't get your hands on the hardest part, the correct ashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The times I have helped do Kerzar recently, he seemed to spawn and then path over to right outside the door to the Vamp tower, then just stand there for quite a while. So I would just go there and wait, he stops like 100 feet out from door at bottom of the hill. And it can take like 20 minutes for him to spawn after hand in.</div></div><hr />

Im not sure if that is the exact location, but you want to wait near the grimling zone line. He will spwan near the boreder of the zone and then start walking to the cordian casle. I did this with a ranger with me to track incase i missted him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zannuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Everything  about this quest except Heratius's ashes is easy... well and maybe if you are KoS and do faction, but that can be avoided with illusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jobara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't worry about the zoneline, if you miss him you won't know it.  Just hang out by the castle entrance and he will go right in front of it.  I waited at the zoneline and missed him and he ended up past the castle and despawned when I saw him.  He can take awhile to spawn, like 30 mins it seemed.<br />
<br />
Destroy the item and you can start over again and with a friendly wizzy and a bind affinity and TL back to bind you can make short time of this part.  I also did this with my wizzy to trigger it while my warrior still held the badge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You don't need Heratius' Ashes.  You need Valdanov's Ashes.  I did the entire quest 2 years ago and still haven't seen Valdanov spawn.  /rude SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok i got the pesky Kerzar after having to redo the quest twice!  Went ld once and then a named from castle jumped me during fight.  So both times he despawned to luck.  Was still done in less that 90 minutes.  I would have another with you to kill him if you dont get him slowed.  He doesn't hit hard just has a lot of hps for light blue.  I had no buffs and unbuffed I only have 5900 hps and crap for ac.  If you have lots of hps and great ac easy solo.  He was an easy duo.  funny thing though is that he respawned right after we killed him then I was able to do the text.  Don't get discouraged just follow the text and you will get your key.<br />
<br />
I do have another question though on this quest.  The spoiler says that I need to go down stairs in Nathyn Illuminous' house.  I can't find any stairs that go down stairs.  Is there a secret way to get down there that I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Naythyn is located in his house UPstairs to the left. Go strait in, up the stairs, move into the room, look left, he should be right there beside a desk. He's a human in robes, shouldn't be too hard to miss.<br />
<br />
You are at the right house, correct? The house right beside the big ramp that goes up behind the bank? Or another way to put it, the house on your left as you enter from shadeweaver's thicket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And if your looking for the chest in nathyns house it is on the first floor, through a hidden wall. Just go to right on first floor and walk through the wall in center of room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah I'm looking for the hidden room in Nathyn's house.  I'll check it out now.  Thanks Khabok and others.<br />
<br />
Mendler</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">haha I have on idea how I missed that but I did.  Thanks Khabok for the info!<br />
<br />
Off to go finish the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">One last question, I hope.  The quest says to turn in Shade Summoning Figuerine and get A Record of Events.  THat spawns 4 casters.  It then says to hand the figurine to one of the spawned casters.  Does it give it back to me when I first turn it in so I can give it away again?<br />
<br />
Anyone actually do this quest that can help me with this?<br />
<br />
Mendler</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">NM i figured it out)  I got the shield now!<br />
<br />
WOOT</div></div><hr />
