<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ourgarr</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok currently Im my guilds main tank!<br />
Were a family guild and not elemental however most are over 60.  <br />
We have about 2 grps a night of 65 plus and then another 3 grps at 60 plus.  However most of us are not well equipped other than what we can get 1 grping and the occasional win on pick up raids.  I would say that we are Luclin geared at best.  <br />
<br />
I want to know what upgrades you think are good for me so I can keep tanking for my guild as we are starting to now do things like NToV and BoT towers to get better equipped for Planar Progression.  Most of us are like 2 or 3 kills from EP.  <br />
<br />
I cant afford the 300k price tag on a BoC on Lanys.  Wish I could but just no way I see me being able to get that sword.  I was looking at a sword in Bazaar and wondering if it is better than my current set up.   <br />
<br />
Also I currently have 0 AAs have not been working them in order to get up in levels as fast as I can.  When should I start doing those to maximize my efforts?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the helpfull info I have gathered from this board already and any other good ideas you might be willing to pass on to me on these topics.<br />

<br />
Level first to 65 and then do aa's.  If your server does PU raids go on them to get the free aa and flag. Maybe you'll get lucky and get a drop too.<br />
<br />
Ldon seems to be the best route for you to go.<br />
<br />
(We have similar stats, check out my magelo for ideas.)</div></div><hr />

Good BP's, some good weaps, misc groovy caster things, and a short re-pop will make this your bread and butter raid target for a bit.  <br />
<br />
Having on average 2 groups 65+ along with 3 more groups of 60+ should also give you enough to add AoW, Tormax, Seru, Grieg, XTC, and Cursed to the menu.  Uprgrades for all from these.<br />
<br />
WoS has a lot of drops that would be nice upgrades too. Get a few groups out there and just go nutts, hehe...join forces for nameds if you have to. If you get enough people out there you evetually be able to kill Shadowhunter who is a short spawn and not highly contested. <br />
<br />
LDoN will have to be part of the diet for agro augs, AC augs, HP augs, etc.<br />
<br />
Your gear looks good. Maybe add another FH bracer and Ornate gaunts for the self haste. The rest upgrade as you can.  Getting AA's will up your HP's quite a bit too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just rambling here. Good hunting to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hellz yeah, the Greatblade of Storms, Ornate BP and a few other random goodies will make you and all the other tanks very happy.  I would try to get a few GOOD weeks of farming out of these (doing 1-3 bosses a night) before doing AoW.  You could probably take Vindi and Tormax before farming the towers hard, but AoW may be a different story.<br />
<br />
Good luck making the guild bigger and getting some nice upgrades for everyone!!!</div></div><hr />

We started a family guild a year ago of 62-65 level players.  Farming the towers twice a week (takes about 3-5 hours depending on how efficiently you can run it) helped us to skip VT entirely and let us slowly build our numbers to prep for Planar progression.  They are hands down the best investment for the return on that level anywhere around.  The fact that you can do them all with 12-24 individuals easily ... and even 1group or 3-box them if you're hardcore makes it especially nice.</div></div><hr />

Ok that BoT towers sounds pretty good.  However do you think with my current set up I can effectively tank in there.  As main tank that is.<br />
<br />
When we are in there its with 2 guilds going in and they are providinig the main tank he is a Whopper of a tank too.   Over 14k hps and only in there to help out his wife in the outher guild.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the great info.<br />
<br />
Edit:   My back up tanks are a 67 SK with over 100 AA and a 66 Pally with about 50 AA.<br />

<br />
I would say without having CA/CS its going to be hard, but not impossible, for you to tank there.  I personally wouldn't want to do it but I think if you had all new buffs you might be able to pull it off.  <br />
<br />
Anyway the problem with AoW is a lot of the time small groups of ubers have a tendancy to kill it on our server for greed :/.  If you catch him up during the afternoon you'll probably have a decent shot till people from Aph, Sigil, RoA get done raiding.  Same thing with Tormax.  NToV and Ssra named are great targets.  Arch Lich can be stunned by pallys, making him very easy.  Creator is VERY easy and you should have no problem with him.  Also consider trying to do the first two parts of the cursed cycle.  Cursed is actually very easy too after you get the basics of raiding in Ssra down.  Theres a chance that you'll be able to pull out a nice hategiver or even better from Ssra and won't need the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">like Bloodfrenzy if you can possibly take down cursed himself<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy &gt; BoC statwise &amp; effect wise.  anger proc is the same on both weaps (enraging blow).  Cursed is a botch tho :p<br />
<br />
I remember one time i was in ssra in the basement, and another guild invited us to come help with cursed...we did exiled easy...then came cursed.  everyone from BoV that was in the raid told them multiple times NOT to melee cursed and to sit at max range and range attack when called for...we had an amusing time watching the rest of the raid wipe because they went up and meleed...we just kinda sat there laughing... :p</div></div><hr />

Thanks that would be great will look for you in game later tonight.  Need a job?  lol  <br />
<br />
Would love some pointers and any help you might be wanting to share.  SSRA hints or helping out always welcome.  We are just starting the raiding thing as a guild since I took over.  Even though we are one of the oldest guilds on Lanys.<br />

Umm. Yael can be a small problem too. Don't oversimplify the quest, there are bottlenecks to everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another upgrade option is the PoI dragon.  He's easier to tank then the BoT towers and has a 41% haste neck item and a good agro wpn (Cord Hilted Spike Driver - I think that's the name.)  He also drops some caster upgrades.  And...he's a triggered spawn with a 2 hour timer.<br />
<br />
I think it'll be tough to MA a BoT tower boss without some AA's.  (I'd still try...you never know what you can do till you try  :p )<br />
<br />
Also, it's not great for melee types, but you can look at things like IV in Ahkeva and the Nadox Inny for FT upgrades for your casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only hard part i had with strength of elements was finding the durned guy in ww &gt;&lt;  he was in water when tracker finally found him lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeaps, and best part is you can also single pull the gargoyles from the Guardian of the Seal that is a raid mob. I don't think you're ready for GotS yet though  :( <br />
<br />
XtC is tankable at 62 or 63. I earned my Hategiver when I pulled this off after MT died for some reason, while wielding a GSOT no less :D Raid was about 3-4 groups too I think. Just takes ages to kill anything in SSRA though. <br />
<br />
By the way, it seems that OOW has lots of upgrades everywhere. Don't forget, just because people call the names one groupable doesn't mean you can't raid/zerg them to death for good upgrades  :D<br />
<br />
Lots of fun stuff awaits you as MT. Enjoy! :D</div></div><hr />
