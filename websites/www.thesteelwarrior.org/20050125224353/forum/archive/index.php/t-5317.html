<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aubryn</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just recently started playing EQ again, after stopping right before PoP was released.  I have LDoN, but have yet to try an adventure yet.  I dinged 63 last night and hope to get 65 soonish, but I'm kind of timid to try an adventure because of my equipment as of now.  It seems like all the wars around my level have a lot better gear, and I'm curious if you all think I could tank an adventure with this gear? Or should i just stick around PoV for now? I've got about 40k in the bank, so I'm also looking for some suggestions for better gear, etc.  I have no idea what 3/4 of the new items are, so any help would be appreciated. :)<br />
<br />
Here's my Equipment: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=912987<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
Decent upgrades:<br />
<br />
2x Valorium Ring of Gallantry (5 AC, 65 HP, 8 STA, other minor stats)<br />
Earring of the solstice (5 AC, 5 STA, 55 HP and some saves)<br />
Mosquito Leg Earring (8 AC, 7 STA, 65 HP)<br />
<br />
On Ayonae Ro, that'd cost about 35k total, and it'd be better (if only slightly better) than what you currently have in those slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For your armor, you're just fine.  Jump right in - you're actually probably on par (or even better) than many folks at your level.<br />
<br />
It's your weapons that are a little iffy.  That's because in LDoN the fights are fast and furious, and there's not much waiting until you have solid agro before people engage.  Make sure you pick up your Provoke line of skills - that will help a lot.  Keep in mind that though the Willsapper is good agro when it procs, for me it sure is stingy proc'ing, and never procs when I seem to need it. In LDoN you need fast and heavy agro generation.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly my suggestion is run to your nearest bazaar and pick up a Greatstaff of Thunder.  Should be only a few hundred pp on your server, and it's a godsend for cheap but strong agro. <br />
<br />
If you want to dual wield, I'd have to suggest picking up the new Droga weapons, the Copper Hammer of Striking and the Sword of the Bloodsworn.  These are good ratio weapons that proc a 0.0 stun and some DD, and are good strong agro weapons as well.  At your level a group can hunt them easily, or pick them up in the bazaar - they're not too expensive.  SoBS is usually cheaper, and I would use that in offhand with Willsapper in main hand until you can pick up a CHoS.  Swap in your primal later in the fight after agro isn't an issue, of course.  <br />
<br />
For dungeons, I'd go the Butcherblock/Mistmoore ones first.  They are usually the easiest.  I would suggest against Guk to start - it's noticeably harder.<br />
<br />
Lastly, dungeons are set by average level.  If you want a fairly easy dungeon (will be poor xp, but good to learn from), group with players lower level than you.  You can have a 7 level gap between highest and lowest player.   I would mention to the group that it's your first LDoN so they can be aware, but that should not be an issue.<br />
<br />
Give it a try.  Personally I love LDoN, and with so many nice warrior goodies there, it's a smart decision to do them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aubryn</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I'll look into those weapons/upgrades.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to pick up one of those rings of gallantry, they look like they are worth it.  Thanks for all the advice paladin, and I agree with you about the willsapper procs.  I got the provoke skills the other day and they seem to be helping a little, but I'm still having trouble maintaining aggro and keeping them off the casters every other mob.  :( However, that's an entirely separate issue.  The Greatstaff of Thunder looks like a good buy, but will it be able to keep aggro any better as a 2hander?  I'm sure it will be better for ripostes though.<br />
<br />
Btw, I guess the revamped Droga if those drop there now.  How hard is it compared to say, CT?<br />
<br />
P.S. Oh, and I guess I'll try a ldon adventure tonight with some lower level peeps, wish mah luck! :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say it's probably on par with CT in terms of mob strength.  However, Droga is a nice clean revamp so pulls are easy, wanderers and adds are a minimum, agro radius is pretty small, and you can pretty much invis anywhere you want in the zone, including right to where you need to be to camp the CHoS and SoBS.  Getting these weapons will not seem a chore, at least it didn't to me, with a well-rounded group at your level.<br />
<br />
About the GSoT, yes it is a very nice agro weapon.  In fact, plenty of debating around here about if the GSoT or the dual wield CHoS/SoBS is better, which means they are plenty close.   I prefer the GSoT, but either setup will work fine.  Consider the GSoT is 50pp on my server, and the CHoS is 20k and the SoBS is 10k, the bang-for-your-buck winner is clear.  And what's nice is that if you don't like it, you only spent a tiny amount of plat to test it out. Certainly win-win.<br />
<br />
2H agro can and in plenty of cases is better than 1H weapon agro. Assuming the weapon is build for agro, don't hesitate going 2H over 1H.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aubryn</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I'm definitely gonna grab a GSoT when I logon then, sounds like its more than worth the cash.  If that doesn't work out, I can probably get a group together that can handle Droga and try camping those two weaps.   I had always thought two 1handers &gt; 2hander for aggro, but I guess that's changed too or I thought wrong. :)<br />
<br />
Also, out of curiousity, how does the GSoT compare with CHoS/SoBS dps-wise?<br />
<br />
And a side note about LDoN; does it matter where I get my adventure points from? You mentioned butcherblock, rather than Guk; if I get points in BB will I be able to spend them in Guk or any other adventure camp?<br />
<br />
Sorry bout the 20 questions :P<br />

As for LDoN points, you have to adventure there to unlock the points at those camps.  So, if there is something you want from a particular camp (say Anger III from Everfrost at 1150 points) you have to do enough adventures in Everfrost to equal 1150 points.  However, once you unlock them, if you want to buy stuff there, you can use points from any LDoN adventure.<br />
<br />
You might check out <br />
<br />
http://www.squidbox.com/skp/eq/ldon/list.cgi<br />
<br />
to pour over what different camps have available.  Everfrost is my favorite place by far because the 2nd best plate (Malevolent stuff, on par with Pop Kizrak's Ornate armor) and Anger augs come from there - and the dungeons don't suck too bad and lots of pick up groups will go there.<br />
<br />
As for your gear, heck man don't sweat it just dive right in!  Have fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without any offensive AAs and disciplines, at least with my limited parsings, I found that the two were very close DPS wise, but I opted to just sell the droga weapons since agro felt the same and I could use the 30k for equipment upgrades.<br />
<br />
Some day I'll get them again, but not until I have enough cash flow to warrant buying them again, or some willing friends take me back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aubryn</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll probably just go with the GSoT for now then, so long as it can hold aggro. :)  <br />
<br />
Everfrost sounds as good as any, so I guess I can try that out for a while.  And thanks for the website Ernie, I'm sure that will come in handy.  I'm sure I'll have more questions as I go, but you guys helped a lot. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Now for some everquest..<br />
