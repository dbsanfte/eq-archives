<br />
My guild is in the process of recruiting and needs, especially, warriors. I know your site to be one of the best online resources and would love to be able to post a recruitment message here but, of course, have no intention of soliciting where it isn't welcome. I did not see any server specific type thread and was wondering if this type of thing would be allowed and if so where?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as i know there isnt such a thread on these boards.<br />
<br />
However, I dont think anyone would take serious issue if you did post your recruiting requirements and a little bit about your guild..<br />
Probably the best place to post it would be in this forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is where most guilds put there reqruitment threads, as that is where people looking for guilds are more likely to look.</div></div><hr />

I don't feel this is the place for them but I've asked the other mods what they think, may have an answer for ya soonish.</div></div><hr />

Again, I know that some boards really object to solicitation for guilds because they feel it ruins the flavor of the board. I wouldn't want to do that here so I want to make sure it's alright first. <br />
<br />
The reason I would rather post here than on the server board is that I expect we would get a higher caliber of warrior from here than from a general post on the server board. That's the whole point, I guess. I, for one, am a researcher. I try to know my class inside and out and when I played a warrior for a bit this is where I came for info. I have more faith in the warriors that read this board.</div></div><hr />

Either way, a link in your sig to your guild's recruitment boards or whatever is cool, as long as you don't post just to post.</div></div><hr />
