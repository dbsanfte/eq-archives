<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious on peoples' opinions on this... The biggest current issue with balance seems to be stackability. A group of 6 people, requires a tank, slower, healer at bare minimum. Ideal groups add CC and a puller to that. Now, that's not always optimal and whatnot, and there is overlap between some of those roles of course.<br />
<br />
  What do ya'll think of increasing group size as a solution? The same classes fill the same required spots, however there is room for extras. For example, having 2 tanks and 2 healers might be a very viable, because you could still have room DPS after a slower and a puller. Even in a traditional group, less optimal classes still have a spot in a larger group, because the required spots can be filled with spots to spare.<br />
<br />
  Why doesn't the raid function fulfill this, you might ask. Well, not only is the experience severely decreased in a raid, you have to have the groups set up to be somewhat independent. Without easy health watching, it's more difficult to heal the members in other groups. Also, it's simple perception. If groups had room for 8 people, for example, people would get 8 people to fill it. Once a group has the basic group requirements met, they're normally much less choosy about who fits in.<br />
<br />
  Problems: LDoN would need to be rebalanced, or at least take in to consideration group size better. The max speed does make it less important though. Raids may or may not need changes. UIs would require a small update. Lots of other stuff that just isn't occuring to me right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't see the need, frankly.<br />
<br />
 There is plenty of overlap in 99.9% of the content that a group can do that doesn't REQUIRE anything.<br />
<br />
 Tank? Warrior/SK/Pal make perfectly good tanks, and when you talk about things like LDoN's or sub-Tier 3 XP, BL's, Rangers, etc. all can and do hold down that tanking spot.<br />
<br />
 Healer? Clerics are nice, Druids and Shamans do just fine at it tho for, once again, 99.9% of all one group content.<br />
<br />
 Slower? Pick your poison. Shaman? Enchanter? Bard? Beastlord? Necro? (Veksar only need apply. :D )<br />
<br />
 In the days when duoing and trioing of most of what used to be called 'group' content is becoming the norm, I'm not seeing what EXPANSION of the group size will really get you. Most any content that you're willing to do with 6, usually can be done with less - we all know about folks who quad LDoN, or have 5 in BoT. The extra member is just a safety margin anymore. (And, I might add, Sony saw this as well when they fixed the group XP again)<br />
<br />
 The ONLY reason anyone's given lately for expansions of groups is these damned trials again. And, of course, having two extra members in a group won't prevent a Knight from getting one rounded. It's an unneeded fix for a problem that doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think it is an EXCELLENT idea, but it would have to only work in some new special instanced zones and what not... it would have to be closer to a small scale army battle, with loads of adds, i think that would be really neat.<br />
<br />
the way to implement it would be have it working in only a select few brand new zones, and have the feature not work in other zones, that way a massive retune isnt needed</div></div><hr />

I dont see that increasing the size of the group will fix any stackability issue, and I dont think the biggest issue with balance is stackability.<br />
I think what you are trying to say, and let me see if I understood it well, it's that, the basic classes fill up most of the slots in a group, leaving no room for extras... but I dunno what extras do you mean, I dont find any class as extra. You have a tank (Pally, War, SK), healer (Druid,Shammy,Cleric), slower (it can even be played by the shammy too, chanter,bard), CC sometimes (chanter can slow and CC, so again, you save a spot, bards can too), then 2 or 3 spots more for damage.... I really fail to see where you dont have room for all the classes hehe.<br />
<br />
I have done normal adventures with just a shammy and a druid (and me of course :p ), you dont necessarely need a full group neither, as Partha pointed out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well you need 1 crowd control, 1 healer, 1 tank and 1 slower.<br />
<br />
thats a 4 to 2 ratio of needed classes, or 2:1<br />
<br />
we need to make the misc. slot ratio better so its even(even is balanced) to 4:4  A.K.A.  1:1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerick is understanding, though I don't think Partha or Ealsur are missing the point either. It's not that experience stuff CAN'T be done with fewer/less optimal groups. Of course it can. I don't want to increase group size to make content easier. You can ALREADY do that via raid (outside of 6 man instances). For example, if you really thought BoT was too hard for you, you could take 2 groups to go do an experience camp in a raid. I surely don't think experience content is too difficult. <br />
<br />
  People fill groups. When I do LDoN, if it's a pickup group I literally just find a single healer and throw whoever else in. I don't need a slower for normals. Does that mean I wouldn't take 8 people if I could? Not a chance. If I'm experiencing in EPs, or BoT, or wherever, would I fill my group to 8 if I could without the akwardness and penalties of using a raid? Yup. This is exactly what Gerick said: &quot;we need to make the misc. slot ratio better...&quot; <br />
<br />
  As is, why would you add a second cleric? It's rarely worth it. A second shaman? Waste of a slot. Add a pally when you have a warrior? Only if there's undead to be slain. More group slots = fewer people LFG, and it means you can just fill those extra slots to fill them. Once you have the &quot;required&quot; spots filled, ANYONE you add will help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, for that rare chance that I am grouping in Runnyeye.  <br />
<br />
I think your insane, there is not much I would do anymore without Supernal light / remedy caster.  And if you put a druid / shaman in then you have to put a Pali / necro.   <br />
<br />
Yes 7 or 8 person groups sounds interesting, I would give a thumbs up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not certain, but I would think nothing really would prevent SoE from increasing the Expedition size to eight. This need not affect group size in any way. Want Exp, do PoEarth. Want to farm or get flaged, then a two group in a raid eight-member expedition would work just fine.<br />
<br />
Knights would still get one rounded? An 8 member Expedition is clearly not a group and even the flimsy argument that Knights should MT all one-group content (and have nifty spellbooks) as well as Warriors would disappate like flatulence on a windy day. Warirors usually MT high DI raid mobs. In an 8 person Expedition there would be no reason for Warriors not to be strongly preferred.<br />

<br />
If you had 8 spots, you would add a second cleric? One thing is trying to add more misc ppl, something very different is adding ppl that will have no actual function in the group. If the reason to add more slots is to have less ppl LFG.... those ppl that are LFG can't make another group?<br />
Like I stated already, you can fill the &quot;required&quot; spots with a 6 person groups and have 3 slots open for &quot;misc&quot; ppl, why do you want more? I still fail to see a strong reason that it's breaking the game somehow or making some class playability undesirable because of it. Its logical that if in a group, a person has a role already, you wont hire another with the same role, even if you have 8 spots, unless its a friend you dont wanna leave outside, but not for performance reasons.</div></div><hr />
