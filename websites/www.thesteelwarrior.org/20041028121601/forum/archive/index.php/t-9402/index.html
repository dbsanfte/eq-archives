Should i/could i tank in GoD for some of the nice upgrades that come out of there? I can currently tank in WoS with some down time between nameds and I have around 900 LDoN points saved up atm, was going to push for Royal Atten. armor before Omens came out. Well our guild has been raiding VT like crazy lately and i'm probably 5th on the list as far as tanks in the guild maybe/probably lower for DKP and gear wise, i'd like to push for mainly 1 groupable gear. Just dont know if i'd be able to tank in GoD and get some of the nicer drops. Or should i keep doing LDoN's and AA's before going there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>werdara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can tank in WoS fairly well, you can tank GoD sewers 2 and 3, probably 4, just fine.  You'd also be ok in Qimini.  Every one of those areas can drop nice stuff for a warrior at your level, just randomly off trash mobs.  Very rarely, but they can.  Just take friends so need factor comes into play.  You can imagine how mad I was when the Time-geared cleric who came &quot;just to help, don't need any drops&quot; won and took the Taelosian Runed Girdle over the three melee for whom it was an upgrade in HP, AC, and Haste % because it would gain him like 50 hp / 50 mana...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was going to say that you should be able to tank GoD sewer 1 with no problems based on the fact that your AC and hps are similar to or better than mine (I've successfully tanked that trial). But then I looked at your AA's, and now I'm not so sure. <br />
<br />
I think that if I were you, I'd turn off the level exp for  bit and finish up the archetype defensive AA's (CA, CS, ND) and physical enhancement from our class AA's. Your healer will gush with joy over your ability to mitigate and avoid damage, and all the raw hit points you've already got built up will get a really nice boost from ND3.<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cp. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Lathen. You're not going to see many solid upgrades from GoD pre vxed/tipt, and I wager you'll get beat up pretty badly in there. You're going to find it harder to make AA at level 70 too, as a lot of the popular hunting places for people around your aa/gear level will be outside the 5 level &quot;bonus range&quot;. finish defensive aa's, and focus on getting gear upgrades from your vt raids.<br />
 <br />
I think you could get through sewers if you wanted to and had a good group, but I don't know what upgrades you're expecting to see from it. They'll be minor at best, and you'll probably take an AC hit. You could try for the trash rares in barindu and ferubi, but you're likely to be very disappointed.<br />
<br />
If you're guild (or open raids on your server) kills the skyshrine dragon you might look into those quest items though, they're one groupable and very nice. You might check my magelo and  &quot;1 group&quot; alt profile for some interesting 1 group upgrades, although most of them are gonna be tough for you to swing, at least while tanking.</div></div><hr />

Tak BP is not that substantial of an upgrade for you. If you are doing VT rountinely I would save all my dkp (assuming you guys play straight and dont have alternate loot assignment) and get the BP off Aten. That BP is still farily leet only really matched by Raex and Vadd (so far). You would likely never have to upgrade until you got Raex+ (which would be a stat play not really an AC play). Of course if they gonna dump the first couple BP drops to the top 3 tanks that might change things. My semi-casual guild has seen 3 drop in like 9 full runs before we lost two of the originals to 1) retirement and 2) the likely next Time guild on our server :( The major drops off Aten seem about 33% chance happen in my experience (other than neck of course which my chanter wears now).<br />
