<br />
Also as a side note could anyone tell me the best places to lvl for diff lvls, im lvl 45 warrior and doing tanaris and uld runs which arent bad expo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw, I may have got too many math lectures (applied math diploma here) because everytime I read 'expo' I have a really hard time not to think at 'exponentiel' or 'exponent' :) ; and to go on further I would points out that there is no 'o' in experience...<br />
<br />
note: your punctuation didn't improove much but your expression did. So keep working on your english, one day Haass may forget to nail your grammar ;)</div></div><hr />

But ya again i will continue to work on it. Btw sorry i just said expo cause i don't know lol i will say experience from now on. :)  But you guys didnt answer my question?</div></div><hr />

But that's all relative.  The worst suck in the world is still exponentially (hah) better than the suck of leveling in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">04-15-2005, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, lol i never played EQ so i wouldnt know. But now being a lvl 45 warrior leveling does suck but by killing higher lvl monsters i get more item drops that are for higher levels meaning more money :) but i totally agree with you on the lvls u stated. And the sad thing is that i want a pvp dueler so im makin a mage cause mages can be bitchs in dueling! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">04-17-2005, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30s sucked, 40-55 np np, and 55-60 kinda sucked too.</div></div><hr />

Funny How You say that, cause i hit lvl 46 last night. And let me tell you gettin 120,000 experience ain't that easy.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, it takes alot more instance runs to ding now then it did when I was tanking in VC. My worst levels were the product of a few friends in my instance group taking a break from WoW. There is nothing like a well trained group, and nothing worse then a bad one.</div></div><hr />

i think what sucks and what not is not so in the game, moreso in the person.<br />
Sometimes i feel like grinding for some hours and exp is going very fast. Sometimes i get bored of grindig and exp is slow. <br />
Sometimes i have just entered a new area and picked up a dozen new quests, sometimes i have messed up with my questings and have a few random quests all over the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leveling in WoW is just so easy compared to EQ that it's hard to say any levels suck.  Almost two years to level 65 in EQ, 4 months to 60 in WoW.  You think getting 120k or whatever xp is bad in WoW, go experience level 59 in EQ, and from what I hear (never done it) 69 is absolutely horrid.<br />
<br />
Having said that, as long as you kill mobs when rested, then quest when not rested things really don't slow down that much.  Sure, level 59 is a lot hard than level 49, but not exponentially so.  As long as you are in the right place and doing quests regularly it flows smooth.  Only time I felt things were going a little slow is when I was almost in my mid-50's and really liked the spot where I was fighting level 47-49 mobs and grinding slowed a bit.  But that was due to my own reluctance to move onto new zones.</div></div><hr />

yep, i never expected blizz to make it this easy. <br />
In diablo 2 they used 2 exponentials for xp initially (1 in the xp requirements and 1 in the xp you get from lower lvl mobs while there were no lvl 99 mobs in the game) <br />
In a patch, when they found the game was too easy, they made the mobs about 3 times more difficult to beat and added another exponential to the higher level experience curve. <br />
<br />
i sure expected them to do something similar in WoW.<br />
<br />
and i think lvl 59 is actually only a little harder than 49. <br />
Probably not even 1.5 times as bad.</div></div><hr />
