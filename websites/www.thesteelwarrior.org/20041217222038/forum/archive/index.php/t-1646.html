<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok first a little background.  I along with some RL friends got burntout/tired of the who guild thing so we disbanded and have been grouping together for a few months now.  Although I realize I am missing out on alot of content only available to raiding guilds I am having the most fun ever. :)<br />
<br />
All of us enjoy doing quests  that are challenging(and i don't mean timesinks) and that also provide some kind of reward either for an individual or for the group as whole.  My current frustration in the lack of single group quest. <br />
<br />
Group consists off:<br />
<br />
61 Warrior (ME)<br />
61 Druid<br />
60 Paladin<br />
59 Rogue<br />
63 Enchanter<br />
58 Paladin.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I ask are there any quests left out there that we could do that would net some kind of reward useful to us.  I know its a pretty broad question but I really don't know a easier way to ask.<br />
<br />
Quests type stuff we have done or are doing:<br />
<br />
Benevolence : Druid and I can do this DUO<br />
Rogue Epic : currently working on getting more help for the General<br />
Circlet of the Falinkan: For the Druid and Enchanter, this was one of the most fun quests ive taken part in.<br />
Qeynos Badges: for whoever wanted one<br />
Strength of Elements: for ME :)</div></div><hr />

When you're higher, add a cleric to that group and maybe a shaman and you're g2g for Ring of Slime in CT.<br />

Could probably do the escort the gnome thing too =)</div></div><hr />
