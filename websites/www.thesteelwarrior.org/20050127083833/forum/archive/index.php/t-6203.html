What is the attraction that people still have for the Windblade?<br />
<br />
Quite possible the first thought entering your mind is is this guy smoking crack?  Get hit on the head too many times?<br />
<br />
Generally this is what I found from personal usage.  I enjoy seeing the rather large numbers in Crits I land.  Especially when going into Beserker mode and dropping the Fellstrike Disc.  Have yet to see a 1k crit..close though.<br />
<br />
People swear by this thing its one of the best to have for those not up to Tier 3 and beyond.  I just find it rather...slow.<br />
<br />
Went out and farmed for Greatsword of the Bloodsworn.  Not the same ratio as the windblade yet I keep the mobs more entertained.  I don't know.  It seems to me its better suited for a Pally or SK rather than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Aside from that wish to ask for a weapons suggestion.  As you can see from my magelo I'm usin a Hooked So'Shar and SotB.  Generally holds aggro fairly well except when the wizzie's are consistently landing 6k critical blasts.<br />
<br />
Our guild is progressing into get the flagging done for Tier 3 mobs.  Considering I have never seen this side of the world I am just paranoid that my weapons won't keep mobs entertained and start slaughtering us.<br />
<br />
I'm currently pursuing the warrior epic in which case I would use the Blade of Strategy in Primary and the Hooked So'Shar in off hand.  Now that you are wincing in your seat from reading that I'm asking for suggestions on what to try for.<br />
<br />
Looking at this weapon here:<br />
<br />
Curse-Smelted Long Blade  <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 2.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY  <br />
Damage: 14 Delay: 19 <br />
Ratio: 1.357 Amazing<br />
Damage Bonus: 13 (lvl 65) <br />
Comparative Efficiency: 107<br />
Offhand Efficiency: 45<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
AC: +8 Dex: +7 Agi: +7 Cold Resist: +7 Magic Resist: +7 Poison Resist: +7 HP: +75 Mana: +50  <br />
Weapon Skill: One Hand Slash <br />
Classes: Warrior Rogue Bard Ranger  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 1<br />
Slot 2: Type 4<br />
Slot 3: Type 6 <br />
 <br />
Which after I put some aug's into it (dmg aug, hate proc, etc.) would think that would a good resolve.  Just have a long ways to go on getting the LDoN points, but if the general consensus says that's the route to take than I shall.<br />
<br />
Now that you are suffering from eye strain from reading all of this troll's rambling and got a skill-up I'll leave it be.<br />
<br />
You have become better at Crathsor Rambling (1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">windblade is all about the big numbers; and with the proper offensive AA's + mobs that hit you for 1K+ ... it's a lifesaver too. i'm sure you've gotten riposted to hell with your DW setup; i think everyone has. the 2Hers can help minimize that...plus; rarely will you find a 1Her with a greater damage than delay ( i can't think of one offhand ) ... so on that alone you maximize your posible DPS.<br />
<br />
overall; eh, whatever works for those individuals it's all good for them. but these days with the damage bonus plus some big sweet ratio 2Her....it's a win/win situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm it's been a long day and I'm tired, so I might not have caught what you were asking for, but I'll try anyways.<br />
<br />
People like the windblade because they see the 50dmg and think that it must be kickass damage as a result. People pay many many times more for a windblade than they do for a war marshall's bladed staff... because they are ignorant/stupid/etc. Granted, the windblade might be better in a few situations, but as a warrior, it is too slow for aggro, and too expensive to be a situational dps weapon.<br />
<br />
Now, as for aggro weapon upgrades.. unfortunately, the best route is the old, boring, disheartening CHoS/SotBS combo. These are the best buyable aggro weapons short of SoD/BoC, and are dirt cheap for the amount of aggro they generate. You can also take a group of friends to droga and camp them both for free, and make decent plat/exp while doing so. If you think you can get a raid together to go after some mobs, possible targets might be Xanamech, the dragon in PoI that drops a 13/19 with 450 hate proc, two of the BoT tower bosses (Auliffe and.. Einride?) Auliffe Chaoswind drops a 41/31 75dd proc 2hb which is a great dps weapon for the efforst, and Einreid or whatever his name is drops a 14/18 with stun/dd proc (Greatblade of Storms). All of these mobs are good targets that will give you better weapons. Other possibilities might be vallon zek, for his scimitar, or avatar of war, for a BoC.<br />
<br />
Once you do get a good aggro setup that you are happy with, you will eventually want to augment one or both of the weapons with an aggro proc. Anger2, Anger3, the guk stun/dd procs, are all pretty good for aggro. Let me tell you though, you do NOT want to waste an aggro augment in a weapon that doesn't already have a good proc of its own. a frostbringer with anger2 will outaggro a 14/19 noproc, with anger2. Get a 1hs/1hb/1hp with a +aggro, stun/dd, or dd+ac debuff proc, and augment that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">windblade 50/44 damage bonus 45 produces 95/44 (sort of) or a ratio of 2.16.<br />
<br />
war marshal 31/28 damage bonus 35 produces 66/28 for a ratio of 2.36 or about 10 percent more dps.<br />
<br />
so it seems to me the only reason for the windblade which costs 3 times for is for people who really really hate ripostes.<br />
<br />
but for that i recommend a weighted axe. that thing hardly ever ripostes :)<br />
<br />
tangent .. CHoS? well lets see ... at level 63 my 1hb is about 130. (/weep). im so tempted to buy one to test it for agro since my split blade / hsagra combo has no innate procs.  sure dont look forward to leveling up another 120 count just to see if i like it or not. any comment on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well coincidentally now is your time to avoid paying big $$ for a windblade.  The &quot;fabled&quot; exec axe and mith 2 hander are both very viable  cheap alternativesfor casual exp/2 tank damage.  All you need to do is get a group together and head to L guk and have the patience of a saint.  I got the fabled exec last night and with WA3 it procs fairly consistently....nice to see big boom crits again also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the attraction that people still have for the Windblade? <br />
<br />
Well, for me, it's a few things.  First of all, it's now become a status symbol (WIndblades are too expensive, you should just buy this piece of shit instead).  That's fine.  Makes me look like I paid a lot of money for mine (which I didn't, but that's okay, everyone can think that).  Second, if I'm actually using 2h, I'm using it for a purpose, and that purpose is to avoid collateral damage, specifically damage shields and ripostes.  Swtiching from dual wield to a 28 delay weapon to me seems retarded, especially since my dual wield combo outdamages my 2h anyway.  You may be able to argue that the War Marshall's staff is better DPS, but there's no way you can argue that the windblade prevents more.  Finally, I just don't like that naginta.  Windblade may not be the best graphic I could have asked for, but I'd much rather be carrying around a big ol' axe if I have to be carrying something.  One of my first memories of EQ was seeing Kalorn Iceblade in freeport, looking badass with his full crafted and his Executioner's Axe.  I'll never forget it, and it kinda shaped how I want my characters to look in EQ.<br />
<br />
Is it overrated?  Probably.  But you have to understand that the main reason that a lot of people who have them are still using them is that when PoP came out, it was THE weapon to have.  There simply wasn't anything else you could get cheaply that could compare to it, damage wise or aggro wise.  People were finding that they could actually hold aggro when they were cranking out 500 damage a round from it.  The people that had them back then probably still have them because there's just not a good alternative for it.  Could I switch to WMBS?  Sure..but what would be the point?  I already have a windblade, the extra 0.0001% dps that some people claim from a WMBS isn't worth the hassle.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, tossing a red epic into your setup would be a bad idea.  Your weapons are fine. I wouldn't be too concerned about them, altho I might switch hands.  Bloodsworn proc should be no problem being more than 250 hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would never say the Windy is crap, what do you play the game for?  I play for fun so if you like big hits go for it.  Not one person here is with you behind the keyboard when you get that 500 hit and go OMG look at that.  If you like it and can get it then get it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
   For aggro get the Copper and Blood and anger 2 aug both, you will have NO prolbems up to EP.   I have never gone back over my log file and found where riposte was a problem, never once.  From LDoN, LDoN hard, Raex to Agnarr never once.  If the rng wants you dead your dead.   Agnarr did 25 dps riposte damage, LDoN hard I take 15 dps from riposte, LDoN 7.5 dps, Bot 7.5 dps.   To me its really simple I can get 6 procs per min with 2 1h with a bit more riposte dps or 4 with a bit less riposte dps, for me I will  take more procs.  I die as MT on raids from mistakes not from riposte.<br />
<br />
Just my two coppers and I am sure a lot of players will say different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the war marshal's bladed staff looks like crap compared to the windblade.<br />
<br />
Yes, the war marshal's bladed staff will save you a bucketload of money and give you the same DPS (and perhaps more).<br />
<br />
Choose your priority :)<br />
<br />
The LDON 1 handers look nice and perform nicely, but the time investment to make one is pretty severe, and the resulting DPS will not be much different from a windblade.<br />
<br />
If you feel that you absolutely must have your best aggro and DPS combined in a single set of weapons, then yes, go for the LDONs.  Otherwise, use CHOS/Sho'shar/SOTB when you want aggro, and windblade/WMBS when you want DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd take a Windblade over WMBS any day.  I like the looks much better and the big hits and crits are nice, the dps difference is negligible.  But I'm on Stromm and have only seen 1 Windblade for 100k in the past month or so, and I'd much rather stick with my WMBS for 8k than shell out 100k for a Windblade.  If/when prices come down and the rest of my gear is where I want it to be, then I'll shell out the pp for a Windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice name you have there.<br />
<br />
I had a Windblade and gave it to a friend when I picked up a WMBS.  I don't think the Staff looks that bad, and lower delay means higher DPS on some mobs.  I don't think either choice is really wrong, though.  It's all about what you want out of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're on a PoP raid, you're not MT, but you need to position the mob in one place so you attack from the front to balance out the push from others attacking from behind.  That's the perfect situation for a Windblade.<br />
<br />
If you're going to be MTing in PoP do yourself a big favor and put Ykesha or Anger3 on your GSoT.<br />
<br />
The problem with ripostes is not that they do some more damage to you over the course of the fight, it's that they can happen at the worst times and kill you.  From what I've see, it's only really bad in PoP.</div></div><hr />
