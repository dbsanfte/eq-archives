<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ascence</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
What can a warrior do at a low lvl before he/she can afford any aggro weapons. I am duoing with another warrior (for RP purpose), and we are both lvl 11. We also share the bank account, so it would be hard for both of us to afford the awesome weapons with procs. <br />
<br />
We will probably duo most of the time until we can get to lvl 20, after which we would be in LDON exclusively. But at my lvl, here is what I find<br />
<br />
1) We cannot taunt off each other. Who ever pulls the MOB gets to tank it until it dies. This is fine most of the time, since we can take turn pulling. But when one of us is lower in health, the other one cannot taunt off him/her.<br />
<br />
2) I can no way taunt off a Paly or a SK who is often the puller when we are in a group - unless the Paly or the SK backs off intentionally. This really does create a little frustration for the group. So I guess it's really more efficient to let the knights be the MT - since everyone can go all out without having to back off.<br />
<br />
So what are the solutions at my LVL? Should I get certain weapons that would ensure I would out damage and out agro the knights? Can someone recommend what I can do at my lvl?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First make sure everyone else isnt just mashing their taunt button constantly  :D<br />
<br />
Proximity aggro can play a large part in this.  If you are low on health going into a fight with your warrior partner and dont want aggro, dont hit taunt (duh) and stand as far away from the mob as you can and still hit it.  Have the other warrior get as close to the mob as they can and still hit it.<br />
<br />
If you have aggro (and dont want it) turn off attack, wait til taunt lands from other warrior then either wait a few more seconds before attacking again or back up, wait a few seconds and start bandaging.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also if you are a large race that can slam, do so.  Im just a pansy elf, so I dont know a whole lot about slam, but Im pretty sure it produces more aggro than a kick.<br />
<br />
You can also make a disarm hotkey and hit it whenever it refreshes.  This produces a tiny bit of aggro, but hey, gotta take what you can get.<br />
<br />
Do you have a magelo, or can you just tell us what weapons you are currently using along with how much dough you have on hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cheap DD's..i think the velium axe of the venemous brood ( 11/24 with like 10AC + proc .. i think it's at 20 ) seems to be nice at the lower levels; afther that i think a short sword of ykesha proc's at 37 ( 75dd+0sec stun) ... than a praetor blade of debility proc's at 40+ ?  obsidian dagger i think is 30.....umm<br />
<br />
black blade of tormenting and the kunzar ku'juch won't proc until 40+, and the club of the ice ocean can't be equipped until 51 ( quick edited by me, i'm fogetful )..and even cheap tash proc from a Journeyman's walking stick won't work until 40 or so.<br />
<br />
you're kinda going to have to do the &quot;if i want aggro i pull&quot; or &quot;turn attack off until i call it&quot; as the main tank. the newb levels are rough unless you got decent twinkage against the spell casting hybrids :(.<br />
<br />
i'd say just roll with it; and keep up fighting. as you gain more levels you'l start to see what kinda things work for ya, and what you really shouldn't be beatng your head against the wall about.<br />
hybrid aggro is one of them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, I dont' mean to be making light of your situation, but at lvl 11 a druid can tank mobs so does it really matter at that level?  I don't really remember aggro problems at that point in the game but I probably pulled for most of the time though and it seemed to me that the first person who aggro'd the mob usually tanked.  Enjoy the game for the time being and just focus on becoming a good tank using skills, not gear.<br />
<br />
Not until the late 30's to early 40's do I remember starting to have issues with aggro but usually this was against people who had gear well above their level and we doing much more damage than me or were taunting or casting high aggro spells like rangers snaring on incoming.  I finished getting crafted armor at 40 (/waves goodbye to the bronze) and was using weapons with ratios like 10/29 and 11/25 (which I thought was uber at the time).  I now regularly see better weapons given to pets.<br />
<br />
I really do think you will have some problems until you accept some things in EQ.<br />
<br />
1.  Almost any class can generate more aggro on demand than a warrior using mana.<br />
<br />
2.  Aggro weapons rely on the random number generator to favor you because they are all based on proc's.  We don't have superior dps weapons to other classes that are warrior only.<br />
<br />
3.  Taunt fails ALOT<br />
<br />
4.  Even if you obtain some good aggro proc'ing weapons, they probably won't proc until lvl 40 or so.<br />
<br />
Now,  with that being said, how do you get/maintain aggro?  First if you want aggro, engage the mob early.  Pull if you can.  Get as close to a mob as you can.  Use disarm when you get that skill as fast as it refreshes.  If needed, ask your group mates to wait a few seconds before attacking a mob so you get a headstart.  Ask group mates to root the mob and crawl into its armor with it.  Make sure you are the closest to it.  If someone else pulls shoot the mob on the way in with arrow(s).<br />
<br />
LDON I am afraid won't be the answer you are looking for either although I enjoy the expansion so far.  The adventures are timed so the group really doesn't have much time to let you solo the mobs before engaging.  But, groups with multiple tanks are very viable in LDON so that part is good for warriors.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the warrior class as I know I have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're lvl 11. Mobs don't have time to hit anyone else cause they die too fast would be my guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the time I finish writing this you could/should be level 12.<br />
<br />
By the time you actually read this, you could/should be level 15.<br />
<br />
And that's without any PLing or powergaming taking place.<br />
<br />
Your levels fly by at this point in your career. So don't sweat it so so much.<br />
<br />
In regards to some of your questions though ...<br />
<br />
&quot;But when one of us is lower in health, the other one cannot taunt off him/her.&quot;<br />
<br />
HOW low on health exactly? Remember, your HP pool is much smaller at level 11, so low health aggro is actually something that happens.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can no way taunt off a Paly or a SK who is often the puller when we are in a group - unless the Paly or the SK backs off intentionally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
1- Having others back off intentionally works. And should be used as a strategy. It works at level 11. It works at level 40. It works at level 65. If you're grouping with people who don't want to back off if/when they get aggro, you're grouping with the wrong people.<br />
<br />
2- Paladins, SK's, monks, Rogues, Warriors, Druids ... you all tank about the same at level 11. I wouldn't worry too much about not being a tank in a group at those levels. Worry about it when you're playing at a level of the game where you can't ding 3 levels in a couple of hours. Where kills take longer than 15 seconds and do not yield two blue per kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This really does create a little frustration for the group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why would this create any frustration for the group? It's EVERYONE'S job to manage the monster's aggro and who it pays attention to. If your paladin friend can't be bothered to turn off attack, then your paladin friend needs to get better gear and start tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess it's really more efficient to let the knights be the MT - since everyone can go all out without having to back off.&quot;<br />
<br />
At level 11, going all-out is really not anything to worry about.<br />
<br />
Applying high level tactics to this level of the game will skew your gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
For ME ... at level 11, I was camping orc 1 in EC. Our BIGGEST problem was crowd control. We had two choices ... get a crowd control class (enchanter or druid) to help us with single pulls ... or load up on melees and offtank.<br />
<br />
In scenario 1, it didn't matter who tanked. We just had to kill the mob. In scenario 2, EVERYONE tanked. <br />
<br />
Seriously ... you shouldn't be worrying about this stuff at level 11.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are the solutions at my LVL?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOLUTION: Level up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I get certain weapons that would ensure I would out damage and out agro the knights?&quot;<br />
<br />
Something to remember: Scepter of Destruction procs at level 1. Get that, you'll be fine. Most mobs at level 11 will be half dead with just one proc.<br />
<br />
Something else to remember: MOST weapons won't proc until the mid-30s or higher. So don't sweat procs.<br />
<br />
Something else to remember: DMG BONUS does not exist until level 28.<br />
<br />
Something else to remember: YOUR DAMAGE IS CAPPED.<br />
<br />
You know what one of the most effective weapons at level 11 is?<br />
<br />
Blackened Acrylia Blade.<br />
<br />
Or, ye old classic, Jade Mace.<br />
<br />
Or a Centi sword of some kind.<br />
<br />
Don't sweat your weapons. Not at level 11. You're going to give yourself an ulcer, because you've got all of your 40s, 50s and 60s to worry about aggro, weapons and inferiority tanking complexes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can someone recommend what I can do at my lvl?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOLUTION: LEVEL UP! Have FUN. Don't worry about this nonsense until is actually should be an issue.<br />
<br />
Jeezis ... does it really matter who's tanking that Orc Lego?</div></div><hr />

I am positive a Wavecrasher procs at very low levels - most people say at level one and many on Allakazams said they personally had it proc at 4.  The wavecrasher procs a 20% slow and a dot and on my server costs about 120K less than a SoD.<br />
<br />
On my server a Wavecrasher sells for 10K.  Go for the Wavecrasher if you have the cash.  Of course, you can switch between you and the other warrior to help on switching aggro between pulls.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tillain</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really doesn't matter what you use at low lvl's. The best way to keep agro at low lvl's is to do the most dmg. Also, not sure if this was mentioned but whoever gets low health probably has low hp agro. Mobs that are low lvl don't work the same as mobs at higher lvl. If you've ever played a mage at low lvl then you'll notice that you can chain nuke and a mob will never come off your pet. Mobs are idiots at low lvl's and I wouldn't even worry about the agro part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loredena</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 11, just don't worry about.  I'm going to make a heretical suggestion.   This is your first character?  Log off the boards.  Don’t read the class boards until you’re at least 30.   If you like tradeskills, sure, visit eq traders.  Get lost all the time, and the joy of exploration is wearing thin?  Check out eq atlas (though I do recommend exploring too).  But don’t worry about class issues, gear, techniques until you’re older.   Most of us have been playing for ages, we know the basics now, and most of the talk is aimed at the higher end game.   50 plus at a minimum, often raiding and level 65.   Enjoy the game as a game while your character is young, worry about the rest of it when you’ve been playing awhile.<br />
<br />
Have FUN! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Is Guts</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first started eq I used to duo with another warrior all the time, we had no healer bar bind wound.<br />
<br />
We came up with a way to share our hit points to reduce down time, first one with aggro would tank down a bub of health then turn off attack and back off abit, other warrior would mash taunt till mob turned, then the first one would engage being carefull not to get aggro back. We kept swopping as needed.<br />
<br />
Idea was a single warrior with say 400 hp's isnt as good as a pool of 800hp's shared.<br />
<br />
After abit of trial and error we got it off to a fine art :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since you didn't mention if it's your first character, or your buddy's first character too, and how much platinum you have to spend .. or what expansions you have, it's a tad hard to say what to d and what not to do. For now I will guess that you have bought the box set with all expansions except LDoN and are a new player.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once a character gets sufficiently low on HP (less than 30 % or so) a monster will frenzy on him/her and pulling off aggro on that person is next to impossible and only seen once in a blue moon on the second sunday of the week.<br />
<br />
The trick is to switch before one of you get that low, switch aggro when one of you are around 50% HP. This is done by letting the one who got down to 50% to stop Taunting and stop attacking, while the other attacks, kicks/bash and Taunts all he can - The MOB should switch to the second tank within 1 or 2 combat rounds. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
As for weapons, Crystalline Spider fang have been mentioned, But Centi Shortswords are also wonderfully cheap (approx 40 pp I think ?) to get in the Bazaar. And don't forget, at level 13 you get dual wield (just train one point into it, it goes up quickly by itself) which also helps some on damage output.<br />
<br />
Unless you decide to use two-handed weapons offcourse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the Bazaar as I mentioned, is a zone on the moon (which is called Luclin, the moon that is) where players can set themselves up as traders and sell their loots. As I mentioned, lots of people sell the Centi Shortsword for a cheap price and quite useful at 12 Dam, 24 Delay. Not to be confused with the Centi Longswords which are 14 Dam, 27 Delay and quite a bit more pricey.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways if you have Luclin expansion (qhich is quite likely), get you and your buddy to Paludal Caverns and start in the easy end (towards Shar Val, there's newbie maps which can be called up with backspace, in the zones between Shar Val and the Cavern and POK book teleport thing and all that jazz, if you have that expansion, so easy to find) - Kick ass exp in there for your level. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and POK teleport thing is if you have the Planes of Power expansion, which is a tad less likely if you made a boxboy, but still quite possible. The easy way to figure out if you have it, is to go to the zone you started in and find an odd wooden bookstand and click on it ... if you are transferred to POK (Plane of Knowledge, a friendly zone) then you have easy travel access to many places and shops within easy reach to boot.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the POK book thingy is noted down on the Newbie maps and all, should make it easy to find.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
uhmm .. that is all I can think off right now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wavecrasher procs level 1 but costs about 8 to10k.  If you can get one it will be useful until low 50s.  The 200 dot is way nice at under level 10.  Its primary hand only so a good complimentary weapon would be a crystaline spider fang or one of the weapons below.<br />
<br />
Tentacle whips from terrors (level 22 or so) in Najena proc lifetap I believe at level 1 but not completely sure.  I think below level 30 a lifetap proc is pretty nice agro and also it heals you a tiny bit.<br />
<br />
Gnoll Hide lariate procs stun but drops in Splitpaw and might be hard to get yourself.  They are very common, dirt cheap, and are usually in bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thnk this is incorrect, I had one on one of my twinks and it wasn't procing ( I leveled the twink to 36 iirc )<br />
Unless it has been changed ( which I really doubt ) SoD still don't proc until lvl 46.</div></div><hr />
