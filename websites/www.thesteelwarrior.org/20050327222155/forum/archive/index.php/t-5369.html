<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so i'm trying to get me that sword from the imp nameds, as well as that wis caster 1hb for my friend(got her a coral headed mace there last time) from sharks. And some Sk swarm weps for guildies, last one rotted because we didn't have any with us :(. <br />
Anyway, i'm trying to figure out what's the right way to make them spawn? So far this is what i got...<br />
The tunnels and rooms are on seperate timers. The fish and imps in tunnels have nothing to do with the named. Big rooms are different. Once the fish are cleared out, smaller mobs will spawn. At this time nothing will spawn, at least for some time, until they're dead. Once they are, either a named will spawn, or the whole room will respawn. <br />
That's how it SEEMS it works...is this correct? If not, what's the trick to getting the named stuff(swordfang etc) to spawn?</div></div><hr />

We weren't clearing any rooms and we weren't going out of our way for it. Once one popped, of course, we pulled it ASAP. I've seen a named spawn in the first or second spot in the right tunnel of the first room there as well. As far as I can tell, it's just like any other random named... Kill until they pop, it's random when they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well so far i've been camping that place to the right from the zonein in the tunnels between Egg keeper room, swordfang room, and that room with lots of frogs...damn frogs! anyway, we've had one plankton sword drop, ranger got it...1 in LOTS of camping, many times. Seen maybe 4 egg keepers and 4 swordfangs. Nothing seems to spawn in the frog room. Any better way to do this? Perhaps go through the tunnels in the whole zone in a circle until something spawns? Or a better place to camp?</div></div><hr />

There is 'an enormous frog' that spawns in the frog room, only dropped a  level 65 rune.<br />
<br />
Just clear the first room on the right where the egg keeper spawns and the hall, i am pretty sure both times I have killed swordfang he was in the long hall leading from the frog room.</div></div><hr />
