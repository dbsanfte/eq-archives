<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure everyone is looking for hard information regarding the procs/proc rates of LDoN augs and I'd like to start a thread with HARD DATA regarding proc rates etc.<br />
<br />
Today I purchased Icicle strike (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4376&amp;source=Live) from Everfrost for my 100 points because I wanted to see how the proc aug's worked, at what rate they procced etc.  I wanted to know before spending the big plats so to speak.  :)<br />
<br />
Fortunately (and what makes this neat) is that since the proc is on the same weapon that means that skill, haste, dex and other information is essentially irrelevant because it's going to be the same for both procs.<br />
<br />
I only log my weapon hits (of which I had 2932)<br />
<br />
---Force Shock (179DD) (original proc)<br />
........................................65 full damage procs<br />
........................................13 resists<br />
........................................ 3 238Dd criticals<br />
<br />
Total procs: 81<br />
<br />
---Icicle blast (75DD) (aug proc)<br />
.......................................86 full damage procs<br />
.......................................4 resists<br />
.......................................2 100hp criticals<br />
<br />
Total procs: 92<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to have folks add further parsing to this with other procs to see if things like the lifetaps and Ykesha procs occur at the same rate.<br />
<br />
PS:  Calcing my total damage, adding this proc on my mainhand upped my DPS by about 2 percent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the parse that people would like to see would be: original weapon proc rate vs. that same proc rate after you add an additional proc to the weapon.  My personal experience is that additional proc doesn't affect the weapon's innate proc rate.  A cleric friend of mine did perform a short test.  He spent a set ammount of time proccing his cleric hammer on a mob (enough for 100 cleric hammer procs or so) before buying an additional proc.  Then, he did the same test after getting the additional proc.  The cleric hammer innate proc was not affected, in fact there were actually a couple more procs after the augmentation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KhalimBloodhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm guessing that if what the above said is true, the augment procs probably work something like this:<br />
<br />
On every swing, the algorithm used to determine whether the weapon procs or not is run on the chance of proccing the inherent proc.  IF the inherent proc does NOT proc, THEN the computer runs a second algorithm to determine if the augmented proc will go off.  Now, since there will be slightly fewer swings when the augment proc actually has a chance to go off, I'll bet that the formula is set for a slightly greater proc percentage than the normal proc formula.  Hence, you get the same or greater number of procs despite the fact that you have fewer swings the augment can proc on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All these extra dd component procs suggests the Ingenuity AA might be less of a toy than before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As near as I can tell the innate proc rate is pretty much exactly what it used to be.  While I don't have the old logs anymore I do remember that it was about 3pct of my hits that proc'ed, and if we take<br />
<br />
81/2932 = 2.76%<br />
<br />
(and yes, I'm aware you can proc on a miss but I don't log misses so I just divided into hits)<br />
<br />
I also had a lower dex this time because focus wore off halfway thru the parsing so I would suggest that the additional proc has no effect on the original.<br />
<br />
What I'm curious about is whether the higher DD procs have a lower proc rate than the lower DD procs.  Although our parse sample here was too small to get a really accurate picture it looks like Force shock procs less than the Aug by about 10-15pct.  <br />
<br />
From an agro standpoint then, it may be argueable that the lower DD version of the Ykesha Aug may produce more agro than the higher version because it would proc more.  Of course, this is all pure conjecture and one of the reasons I was asking for much larger parse samples with a variety of different procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also believe that item procs are configured with a value to determine proc frequency.   These augments clearly have their own proc frequency independant of an existing proc.  It really would be advantageous to parse the proc frequency of the Ykesha line of augs.  It would just figure if they made the cheapest have the highest frequency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some one posted that they double procced....aka main proc and aug proc off same swing.....so i think your theory is off on the aug checking only if the main doesn't</div></div><hr />

What would suggest that this is true?  I can't see any reason to only check the 2nd proc if the first one doesn't go off and then artificially raising the proc rate of the 2nd one.  Would be much simpler just to make them independant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ah.  but no ones ever seen a double proccing weapon go off at the same time yet ever.  its on various message boards, so currently belief is they are not independat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IIRC some one posted on this board saying they double proced and it was on a miss none the less</div></div><hr />

A few quotes from Absor re proc's:<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Yes each proc gets its own proc check. Although only 1 proc may go off per swing. So you won't double proc but you can single proc with either proc.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
so, adding say, a dmg proc to a primal weapon, you'd end up with Effect: Avatar and EFFECT: Vampire Kiss (for example) and, depending on the RNG, you'd get either Avatar OR VK as a proc, but never both. Is that correct?<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Yes thats correct. The primary proc will be the one to go off before the secondary added proc. So if you had a primal / Vampire and primal checked ok it wouldn't even bother checking vampire.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
*** My (Wompem's)  speculation***<br />
<br />
So in theory each proc checks per swing, but there is a hiarchy:<br />
1) Original Proc Check per swing ( if no proc then goto 2 )<br />
2) Augment Proc Check per swing ( if no goto 3 )<br />
3) Buff Proc Check etc etc.<br />
<br />
Some people may post about 2 procs from one swing but I would speculate it was a missed double/triple/fericity or what have you. Most of us have had a 2+ procs on the same combat round but this would be attributed to double/triple atk. Further testing to come, but this seems reliable and has a good background to it.<br />
<br />
We must remember there is no real magic, but instead a cumputer language, and SOE probably wouldn't want to write something too seriously difficult because every extra bit of code is more to process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wymp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Couldn't you just ask a pally or ranger about this?<br />
<br />
They have spells that will add a second proc to their weapons that already have one and surely have enough experience with this scenario to help find out ... assuming their proc spells work the same as the augments do, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Had a second round of parses today while adventuring - this time with shaman buffs (280 dex)<br />
<br />
GBoS:  2251 swings<br />
......................Force shock proc'd 78 times<br />
......................Icicle strike proc'd 83 times<br />
<br />
CHSD 1626 swings (offhand, for interest)<br />
.....................Taunting blow procced 33 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
<br />
LDoN augs are seperate and do not affect normal augs.  Oddly, at least for me, they all seem to proc slightly more than the regular procs do - that's two different parses that the Aug proc has gone off more than the innate proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How long time wise are your logs, it seems like procs are linked more to time than swings.  It looks like your first log was around 50 minutes (guessing from amount of procs) and your 2nd log was somewhere around 30-40 minutes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Both logs are from LDoN adventures - I don't have them anymore so no longer have an exact time but it's usually 60-80 mins depending on the adventure.  I probably ought to be documenting time just to be thorough.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Borix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are still not many questions answered concerning the new agro augmentations. The concensus at the moment is that the Anger and Ykesha lines are the best agro generators.<br />
<br />
Questions that have to be solved are:<br />
<br />
*  Is the stun component of Force of Ykesha better than that of Strike of Ykesha? If not one might think that Strike of Ykesha is the best value for money (760 vs 510). I believe the (magic) resist part of Force of Ykesha is slightly better (-10 modifier according to Allakhazam).<br />
<br />
*  Is Anger II a better agro proc than Strike of Ykesha? If not, is Anger III better than Force of Ykesha?<br />
<br />
*  What is the proc rate of both?<br />
<br />
*  Are there other weird things people noticed about these agro procs?<br />
<br />
I wish i could test it by myself but (unfortunately) I don't play 16 hours a day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lessiter1 was clever enough to reverse engineer the aggro hate value of a stun proc here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=2814) <br />
<br />
He placed the hate value somewhere greater than 200pts of hate just for the stun.  Add in your 150pt dd and do whatever fuzzy math you think dd - hate points equates to and you can make your own decision.</div></div><hr />

Have a link to those Absor quotes?  Wondering if he added more recently to adress buff procs in the scheme of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Scab, having looked up all the threads on stun + dd = hate ratio, I don't think that is right.<br />
<br />
Lesiter's post seemed to indicate that any stun (0.0 to 10.0) generates from between 121 to 149 points of agro.  I don't see anywhere in his parse results where he claims 0.0 stun generates over 200 points of agro. <br />
<br />
In fact, if his results are even close to being accurate, they would prove the Ykesha proc to generate less agro than Anger3.  In effect, at its BEST his parse would permit the highest purchased Ykesha proc to generate 274 points of agro (highest stun agro being 149, and highest DD agro being 125). <br />
<br />
Am I missing something?</div></div><hr />
