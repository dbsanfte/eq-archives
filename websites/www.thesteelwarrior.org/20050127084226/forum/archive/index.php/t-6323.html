<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a gear check mabye a month or two ago, and really only upgraded a little and right now I feel my gear is pretty good for a warrior around my level that isn't RZ or Tribunal.  I need to upgrade my wrist, hands, face, ear, and mabye neck and shoulders.  My goal is to make lvl 60 by the end of the month and I just dinged 59 on Saturday.  O yeah I have a fabled ssoy and Sotbs and I am kinda torn between the 2, so if I could get some ideas about which is better.  I auged the fssoy bc it has a better proc, and AC which the Sotbs lacks.  If I could get more input the aug costs next to nothing.  Thx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrist: Replace the Geode bracelet with either Fine heraldic bracer (unimbued human cultural), Full mithral bracer (unimbued high elf cultural) or a Bracer of benevolence if you don't know a smith of either race or don't have the plat.<br />
<br />
Hands: If you are Claws of Veeshan faction, get skyshrine gauntlets any way you can.  They'll last you a very, very, very long time.  If you aren't, a decent alternative would be kylong darkmail gauntlets from Veksar.<br />
<br />
Face: Your current mask looks pretty decent.  However, if you really, really feel like looking for an upgrade to it, I'd look for Mask of Flurishing Fungus, a Grimling Contraption, or a Mask of Frozen Mana.<br />
<br />
Ear: I'd replace Wretched earring of pain with a Solstice earring, a mosquito leg earring or a bloodmetal earring of engagment, whichever is most do-able for your budget.<br />
<br />
You may want to consider upgrading your sleeves in the future, either skyshrine or one of the LDoN armors (EF or NRO camps).</div></div><hr />

I was also thinking about a Silver Chitin Wristband, bc of the dex, hp and ac.  Any other suggestions would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with above but also you have 2 haste items on the gloves and belt. toss those gloves and get some with some HP on them.<br />
<br />
You may want to take a look at my magelo I believe I have some items that may be a good upgrade for you if you have some cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely toss the gloves now that you have a FFBSS.  Get some Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets or Sandstorm Fragment Gauntlets or Myrmidons.  You can camp or purchase any of those and get a nice AC and HP boost on your gauntlets.</div></div><hr />
