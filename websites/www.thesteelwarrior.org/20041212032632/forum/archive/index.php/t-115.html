The skill do not touch your atk in off hand, but is there any other variable that must be dealed with ? I imagine % to be dodge and some other, but it's pure speculation and i never saw any concrete knowledge about this. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your skill on dual wield determines how frequently you will swing your offhand.<br />
<br />
Your skill on double attack determines how often you will swing again for an additional attack anytime either hand swings.<br />
<br />
Your weapon skill for the attack form you are using determines how frequently you will hit a target and how hard you will hit for.<br />
<br />
At level 60 and beyond all warriors innately have the ability to possibly swing 3 times instead of twice on their primary hand. This &quot;triple attack&quot; skill is not really a skill but is simply an augmentation of our existing double attack skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">warriors piercing ability is lower that our slash and blunt ability.  If you duel weild piercers(bloodpoints for example) then your attack rating will go down.  To check if your attack rating goes down with a piercer equiped in the off hand, equip said piercer in off hand. =D<br />
<br />
I think your attack rating will do down if you have a piercer in your off hand... or it used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The offhand isn't figured into the overall Atk rating other than it's inherent bonuses or minuses.<br />
<br />
Case in point,  I can wield a Blood Point in my offhand with a skill level of... 8 and still have the same overall Atk score. This works nicely when learning a new skill at later levels as long as they are of the 1 handed variety. My 1hb skill is nearing 200 since I put a couple of decent speed/ratio ones in my offhand as an example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how i think the attack system works.<br />
I'm gonna separate the hands.<br />
<br />
Mainhand (or 2H weapon)<br />
    A- Main hand attack (roll to see if missed)<br />
       B- Dual attack check (roll to see if you get a 2nd attack)<br />
       C- Dual attack roll (roll to see if missed with 2nd attack)<br />
          D- Triple attack chek (roll to see if you get a 3rd attack)<br />
          E- Triple attack roll (roll to see if missed with 3rd attack)<br />
<br />
Offhand<br />
    F- Dual wield check (roll to see you swing offhand)<br />
      G- Dual attack check (roll to see if you get a 2nd attack)<br />
      H- Dual attack roll (roll to see if missed with 2nd attack)<br />
        I- Triple attack chek (roll tp see if you get a 3rd attack)<br />
        K- Triple attack roll (roll to see if missed with 3rd attack)<br />
<br />
<br />
(of course if you fail the dual attack check, hense dont get a<br />
second attack, there will be no Triple attack check)<br />
<br />
Ambidexterity = Increase F  percentage (chance for a successfull roll)<br />
<br />
<br />
Flurry = If you get D , then you have 2 more attack rolls<br />
(called E1 and E2, So you will actually roll E E1 E2 to see if they miss or not))<br />
<br />
Ferocity = Increase B and G percentage (chance for a successfull roll)<br />
<br />
Punishing Blade : Increase B and D percentage for 2H only<br />
(chance for a successfull roll)<br />
<br />
<br />
And for your skill question, no your skill wont the number of attacks.<br />
(how many times you swing the weapon)<br />
But it will affect how often you hit , and for how much</div></div><hr />

This was in the original skill description when it was added to the game.  You can test this empirically with EQCompanion and two 1handers of equal delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">btw, the displayed value for atk is taking main hand into account only. if u DW, the atk value used for off hand can be different than the displayed one, used for main hand only. the same thing apply to archery and throwing too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wot Sylvania sed.<br />
<br />
And no, you can't triple attack with your offhand. Other than that, your chart's about bang on.</div></div><hr />
