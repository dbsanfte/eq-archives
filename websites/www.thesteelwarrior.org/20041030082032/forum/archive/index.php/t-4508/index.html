<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marglok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just started back up, dont currently have a guild, and I was wondering if all the great armour and weapons you guys have is obtainable without being in a guild. Chances are its not, but its always worth trying I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nota</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hit the bazaar if you have any cash at all. Now adays you can get stuff dirt cheap. Great stuff by old standards hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Marglok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not inquiring that, I have quite nice equipment,  I just want to know if the various no drop things (Like Sky Shrine Armour) is possible to get without a clan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not since before Kunark has an unguilded player been able to obtain such nice gear.  Check out the Lost Dungeons of Norrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At level 65, the Halls of Testing, where skyshrine armors drop, are quite 1 groupable.  Definitely 2 groupable. <br />
<br />
There are ALSO quite a few upgrade options available in some of the lower tiers of planes of power to smaller forces.<br />
<br />
BUT, as the person above stated, you will find the BEST available no drop items for the small, 1 to 2 groups of friends or forces come from Lost Dungeons of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Either the stuff that drops in the hard adventures. Or the stuff you spend adventure points on.<br />
<br />
It takes time, mind you, but you can get some Vex Thal quality items from LDoN, without the forces needed to raid Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun. And try not to let the fact that you have kill five BAZILLION sand elves to get anywhere discourage you.<br />
