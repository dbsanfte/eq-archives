<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Text for Warriors without Epic 1.0<br />
If you already have Epic 1, you can skip this and proceed to Walkthru for Epiced 1.0 Warriors (http://zix.cc/warepic1done.php)<br />
<br />
Step 1- Starting the Quest.<br />
Go to Dranik’s Scar and Find Korbuk Brimblade. He is an ogre northwest from the port in area.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/korbuk.jpg<br />
<br />
You say, 'I have felt something strange'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Aha, you have sensed it as well. For a while, I believed it was just me dat noticed it. Now dat you've confirmed my suspicions, I'm sure I can move forward with my [work].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'work?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Hmm, I'm not sure if I should go into any more detail. After all, we've just met and I don't know how trustworthy you really are. Listen, if you really want to know what work I'm involved with, I'll need you to run a couple [errands] for me first, just so I know you're da real deal.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'errands?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'You see, I had some things taken from me. I want to get dem back. I'm very partial to my weapons, and had some great [plans] to make a sword dat would be unmatched by any other. I thought it would be nice to start da plans with my brethren by talking to some of dem about da tactics involved in creating a sword.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'plans?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Da sword was going to be made of da finest metal with a hilt dat's handcrafted by someone I'm very close to. It was going to have my family seal engraved into da base of da blade and was to be my finest sword ever. But da plans were stolen by someone -- no doubt someone who oversees everything where I was working -- and I have yet to get them back. You look more than capable of recovering da plans for me. Hurry back when you've found dem.'<br />
<br />
Step 2- Plane of Tactics and Overseer.<br />
Now head to the Plane of Tactics and kill The Overseer. This will take a group, but should not be too difficult. Loot Korbuk’s Weapon Plans.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/overseer.jpg<br />
<br />
He drops <br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/weaplans.jpg<br />
Now head back to Korbuk Brimblade. Give him Korbuk’s Weapon Plans.<br />
<br />
Step 3- Hates Fury in LoY.<br />
Now he sends you to Hate’s Fury to kill Shoqui the Forgotten. Shoqui the Forgotten does spawn in the Ralo the Black room aboard Hates Fury, off of Crypt of Nadox zone. His spawn timer is around 20 minutes in the room, and can spawn at any of the spawn sites in the room. Ralo is not his PH. Just keep the room clear until he spawns.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/shoqui.jpg<br />
Once he spawns, kill him and loot an Elaborate Shank. Turn in the Elaborate Shank to Korbuk.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'You found it?! Did you slay da beast dat had it locked away too? You must have! Good work, you're really proving yourself nicely. There's some more work to be done though, so don't get too excited yet. Dis next errand is actually a favor I owe to a long time family friend. Perhaps you know of da Redblade family? Specifically, I'm talking about Kargek Redblade. He's in need of some help and you're da perfect person to help him. Just tell him I [sent you to help]'<br />
<br />
Step 4- Kargek Redblade in East Freeport.<br />
Kargek Redblade is found in East Freeport.<br />
<br />
Tell him Korbuk sent me.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/kargek.jpg<br />
He then says his precious father’s sword was stolen by a dirty little gnome named Drevlon, who resides in East Karanas.<br />
<br />
Step 5- Drevlon Knacknabber in East Karanas.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/drevlon.jpg<br />
He doesn’t always spawn right away so you may have to wait until its dark. Drevlon Knacknabber spawns in East Karanas on the opposite side of the zone , from the druid port in area, along the river, there are some huts there and some barbarian guards. locs are -2998, -1520. He spawns there (he is a little black gnome) and he wanders towards the gnoll obelisk down the trail (south) he then paths in a large circle, and eventually back to the huts. He was dark blue to 67, and max hits for 658 damage. You will probably want to bring a tracker friend to help since Drevlon wanders around the zone, but if you run along this path you will have a chance at finding him. Kill him and loot Redblade Family Sword.<br />
<br />
Give the blade back to Kargek. He will give you an Emblazoned Champion’s Hilt. Take the hilt and give it you Korbuk Brimblade. He will return it and give you some experience. <br />
<br />
Step 6- Dardek Bladewright in Thurgadin.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/dardek.jpg<br />
He also tells you to go look for a smith by the name of Dardek to combine the 3 items together to forage the sword. Go to Thurgadin and find a blue con dwarf with no name lying down in the back bar (the one with the brew barrel after you go down the ramp near Icewell at loc +122,-435<br />
on map he is marked in red on the right side of map.<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/thurgmap.jpg<br />
Upon hailing him, his name pops up as Dardek Bladewright. He refuses to speak to you any further until you get him some Coldain Coffee. After some more searching, there is a new vendor behind the counter at the other major bar in Thurgadin at loc -47,94<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/epic2/petcas.jpg<br />
This new merchant sells generic coffee beans and talks about a special brew if you hail him. Go through the script, and then give him 350pp for Special Beans. Buy 3 of the generic beans as well and head to a brew barrel. Combine the 3 generic beans to get Generic Coffee Brew, then combine this with the Special Beans to make Coldain Coffee (trivial is around 90). Now take the Coldain Coffee and give it to Dardek. After you give him the Coffee he starts walking toward the forge on the other side of Thurgadin. Once he gets there he asks what you wanted from him. Now hand him the Elaborate Shank, Emblazoned Champion’s Hilt and Korbuk’s Weapon Plans. He returns Dardek’s Forged Blade, No stats and No drop. Now go back to Korbuk and hand him the sword. He will give you Korbuk’s Blade of Mastery, it is warrior only, equipable in primary as a two-hand slash weapon with no stats and it looks like an Ornate Greatblade. After this he says he has more [work] for you to do. Follow the script until he asks for the pages. This now catches all of the warriors without Epic 1.0 up to the warriors with Epic 1.0.<br />
