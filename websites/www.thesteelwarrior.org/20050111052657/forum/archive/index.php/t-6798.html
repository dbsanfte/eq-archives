Wondering if it would be a resonable alternative to EoE offhand, dbotw primary. I seem to remember frostbite as being resonable agro, but I'm curious about the proc rate mostly. Also curious if the additional dps from the JOS would make up for the lower agro proc.</div></div><hr />

My experience has been it has more aggro then Jesus.  But that's just me :)<br />
DBOW/JOS both augged with anger 3 consistantly takes aggro from DBOW/EoE both with anger 3, I have the former, 2 other warriors in guild have the latter, one of the two got a JoS after me and we all say the same.  Between consistant dps aggro and the debuff proc, it's the best offhand aggro weapon in the current game.</div></div><hr />

In your point system i would take EOE if i was you, really not worth JOS beeing more than twice more expensive... JoS seem very over rated by your point system IMO</div></div><hr />

Although I was kinda disappointed to see the proc was a Velious one (it gets resisted alot), but it still generates great aggro. So much in fact that I was overaggroing our MT (but what else is new right guys?! :P). He and I are the only ones with DB's, and he looted the last JOS that dropped. He parsed that it was higher DPS than DB+Ethereal Destroyer (Saryn never coughs up EoE's when warriors want them &gt;&lt;).</div></div><hr />

It's a toss up really, the aggro on both is excellent.  They're both quality offhands, I guess it comes down to desireabilty and price.  If all your monks and bsts are fighting over the JoS, and it costs a bit more then an EoE, you may as well just take an EoE.  If the price difference is negligable, and you have the ability to get a JoS, hell why not~</div></div><hr />

But thats probably the weapon hes referring to.<br />
<br />
On the subject of the JOS.  If i already had an EOE ( which i do ) i wouldnt loot a JOS.  Maybe its because my guilds dkp and its not worth wasting points when my offhand is already a good weapon.  We have gotten 2 of the JOS, a ranger took one and the other rotted or went to someone with so few points it was the same difference.  Hasnt been much desire for it to be honest =/</div></div><hr />

EoEs are soon at rot stage and if rallos is kind ill have a DBoW soon enough so it wont be a lot of problem for me to have all 3.<br />
<br />
The only disadvantage that i thought there may be in using the JoS - as the procs a debuff, doesnt that take up a debuff slot on the mob and if so, wont you be depriving casters of a valuable buff slot as opposed to the eoe's straight stun/dd.<br />
<br />
Admittedly on the looks front, i do prefer the EoE cos these things are important....</div></div><hr />

JoS is much more contested now for dps and aggro etc. plus is usable by more classes, and the 30/26 wep. Both are good weps, Aranini's Rage looks like the ranger weapon 29/23 one thats an elf boot, so much prefer sparkles of the staff to it :) just one opinion. BTW was parsed over 200dps with DB + JoS in LDoN over 4 adventures with no attack buffs if that helps.</div></div><hr />

But the proc on Aranini's Rage is more DPS (150 lifetap resist versus 60 all or nothing cold).</div></div><hr />

granted its not a TRUE hate proc nor as good as a stun probly.<br />
but i would say it is better than any straight DD proc for aggro generation from my experience. i use a cudgel of wrecking and acrilya bladed broadsword both auged with 75 hp life taps for my dps set up. and when not tanking on AE DOT or AE DD bosses. <br />
<br />
undead mobs in particular i feal have a deep hate twords these procs. <br />
<br />
i use them for not tanking , but i have found myself catching alot of unintentional aggro with them verses wars with auged VDD and similiar.<br />
<br />
in line of aggro generations it would probly be something like <br />
<br />
1. pure hate<br />
2. rune<br />
3. stuns<br />
4. lifetaps<br />
5. dd<br />
6. dot<br />

i dont know where AC debuffs fall in line , as i have no first hand experiance.<br />
i feal it would fall somewhere from 3.5-4.5 range</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, JOS is a pretty good aggro weapon, but I'm pretty sure the aggro comes from DPS and not the proc. I bet EoE's proc is much better aggro than JOS's pathetic Velious era proc. When I steal aggro from my tank, more often than not it's unrelated to JOS proc. It's definitely a better off hander than Quarm hammer for warriors though.<br />

<br />
The aggro from the proc is a bit lower than a ykesha proc, but above a straight dd proc. <br />
<br />
I think it easily makes up for that however, in pure ratio especially when you consider offhand which only procs one time a minute without WA or CE, even then I doubt eoe would overcome the difference.<br />
<br />
If I had had an EOE before jos dropped, it would have been a tough choice, Jos is better, there is no question to me, but it's not a case where it's so much better that you might feel compelled to upgrade.  An EOE is more than enough, and a JoS is a little more than that.</div></div><hr />

 I did an 8 hour parse and did not see 3 procs per minute on ykesha with WA5 (I did see 3 on time snap).<br />

So... dunno what to say. Our data conflicts, I'm checking the data set again. Perhaps the parser was ignoring resisted procs.</div></div><hr />

i agree with that, it depends on the amount of rune and DD i think for point 3.<br />

Having used a scimitar of lifestealing during kunark era i can tell you, lifetap is close to 0 aggro, anyone who had a Jaelen Katana would tell you the same.<br />

Thats the only difference in the two I can think of so I am guessig somethign to do with resist checks is what is causing a higher amount of aggro to be aquired from DD's over Taps.</div></div><hr />

Take for example the spell Horror, Scorpion Venom, Blood of Thule etc.  While using them I noticed that I had a large amount of aggro generated from both the initial dd effect and each tick after.  Compared to plague or the shaman disease line which has very little aggro to speak of.<br />
Assuming spell aggro is calculated based on the effects and not stored on a per-spell basis, the difference must be the poison counters. This also holds when comparing resist debuffs - only the Tash line has a poison counter.</div></div><hr />

What about the shaman and beastlord slows - those have disease counters but cause similar amounts of aggro as a tash or poison based DoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a rogue using JTB/EoE and according to her EoE Agro is &quot;minimal&quot;....<br />
So i'm really starting to think &quot;agro quality&quot; is just in everyone's mind.<br />

Warrior with EoE/JoS + 2xA3 comments &quot;Amazing Agro&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Of course it comes down to personal feelings/preferences &amp; offhanders...<br />
But i'm under the impression fine steel would be &quot;good offhand agro&quot;</div></div><hr />

but as it stands , there is no way to test to be sure, its been said that a stun is equivilent to 400 hate,, how was that assertained, some one just took a guess.<br />
also alot of the stuns looked at had an suplemental DD component iirc.<br />

until some one can prove or disprove proc effects or raw dps aggro potential its all just speculation and * feal* , outside of purehate procs of course.</div></div><hr />

Brodda did some tests with the potential dps aggro and had some parses to show this.<br />
<br />
as far as the EoE aggro, at that stage of the game 1.5 ppm in offhand on the EoE on a rogue shouldn't pull aggro off a Time equipped warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have dbotw jos and eoe all anger 3 aug'd, the only time I use eoe is when I'm using JoS primary in xp groups for dps and I wouldnt even use then if darkblade was offhandable. I only got a JoS for the extra dps though, agro seems the same with either in offhand, should just take what you can get of the 2 imo with a preference for staff<br />
<br />
I'm one of the few people that actually like the graphic too though, if thats an issue for you then eoe is still great.</div></div><hr />

Having an EoE already though, i wouldnt take a JOS, its not a big enough upgrade to warrant the dkp cost it would set me back, and there is probably some ridiculous 1 hander for warriors just around the bend, ala Darkglint Blade for rangers.  <br />

Slightly off topic but this is one of the first times I've seen rune put that far down on the hate list.  So does that mean a SeWs with Rune 3 is really not all that good aggro?  I've heard ppl say that the Rune 3 was around 400-600 pts of hate, which would put it above a stun, but if it's really ranked with a DD you're saying it's doing around 100 hate or less?  Thx and sorry for being abit off topic.</div></div><hr />

My hunch is that JoS + EoE would be more dps.</div></div><hr />

Not really around the bend (from Uqua), but it's for warriors and isn't too far out of whack with darkglint blade: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68742<br />

Not sure what ya meant by &quot;ridiculous,&quot; but IMO the only thing ridiculous about the ranger sword is the graphic. =p</div></div><hr />

The reason it gives agro is that rune counts as a buff and gives agro like a small heal would, when it procs you are in effect buffing yourself.</div></div><hr />

I meant ridiculously good =)<br />
<br />
And i know the Fleshbiter exists, its not really the ridiculously good 1 hander people were looking for though.  Maybe if it was offhand usable or something /shrug.</div></div><hr />

However, comparing directly between offhand agro paired with a DBotW, even an unauged JoS noticeably outagroes an anger3 auged EoE (both with WA5/RaexBP/etc.)</div></div><hr />

If we want to get aggro, we can hold it easily, and if we don't want aggro, we can keep it off ourselves easily.  I use EoE primary, Rylaa uses JoS primary, both seem to work just as well.</div></div><hr />
