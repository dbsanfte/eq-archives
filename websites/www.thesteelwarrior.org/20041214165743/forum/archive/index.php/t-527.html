<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sudaka</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen conflicting information about skill-ups with tradeskills, some say Intelligence is what affects your chance at gaining a skill point, others say whichever is higher (INT for casters or WIS for priest classes)...does anyone have any information on this.<br />
As a warrior wanting to start in tradeskills (Brewing, Pottery...) should I invest in Wisdom gear or Intelligence gear?<br />
I have Charisma gear for buying/selling (Max Cha-146) and plan on getting Geerlok devices to increase my chance of a successfull combine.<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been established that the higher of the two, intelligence or wisdom, will be the determing factor for success on skill ups for trade skills.  There is one exception to this and that is for black smithing, where the higher of the three, strength, intelligence, or wisdom will be the determining factor.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if your wisdom and intelligence are about equal purchase the gear that is easiest to aquire for one of the stats.  If one or the other is significantly higher then purchase gear to increase the higher of the two.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I'd link you to a thread on EQtraders that talks about this, except I was banned for telling someone that I'd call them a whiny crack baby, except it went against the posting rules. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The prevailing school of thought on this is a very simple line of understanding, and has been supported at multiple Fan Faire events by Verant themselves.<br />
<br />
All Tradeskills base skillups off of the highest of the applicable stats - wis, int, or in the case of some skills, dex or str (skill dependent). That means if you have a 255 wis and a 106 int, your wisdom will be used for calculating skill ups. If you are smithing, and you have a 280 str, but only 100+ wis/int, your str will be used (str is the secondary stat for Smithing).<br />
<br />
This has been tested thoroughly and proven repeatedly in controlled environments.<br />
<br />
Note that your stat has NO IMPACT on your success rate - skill alone affects how often you succeed / fail. This is where a Geerlock will help you out - having the geerlock equipped will increase your effective skill level for success - but not for trivials. That is to say, you will check for &quot;triviality&quot; of an item (as in, can you still skill up from it?) using your natural skill, but your success rate is checked against your modified skill (your_skill_value + 5%). The advantage here is that use of a geerlock tends to result in fewer failures, overall, which can result in a lower overall cost (due to sell backs, or availability of more inventory to sell to others).<br />
<br />
There is still a school of thought that Wisdom affects your success rate - this is an old rumor, and there is no reproducable evidence supporting this.<br />
<br />
As recommended above, all of this information is available on<br />
EQ Traders (http://eqtraders.com/) , on the forums and in the individual board links. A thorough perusal of that board will answer 95% of your questions. I recommend spending a LOT of time there if you are going to invest any of your gaming experience on tradeskills.<br />
It is widely regarded as the one-stop tradeskill website by tradeskill junkies (like myself).<br />
<br />
Oh, and to address an issue of ambiguity in your original post, your class has no impact on which stats you can use, or which tradeskills you should attempt. Some classes are better suited for certain stats (priests tend to have higher wisdom - thus it makes sense for a priest to max out wisdom if doing tradeskills, but they can use any of the applicable stats they choose) or for certain skills (enchanters tend to represent the larger portion of 250 Jewelcrafters, but such is not always the case).<br />
As a warrior, you may find that using the secondary stat (str for smithing, dex for JC, fletching, MAYBE Tailoring - this is unconfirmed as of yet) may be easier for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what effect skill up : INT or WIS, higher of the 2. In case of fletching or jewelry , it can also be DEX if it is the higher of the 3 stats. For smithing , same thing but with STR : higher of STR, WIS or INT. Nothing else than that effect skillup chances ( besides maybe your current skill level , and of course the fact you can't skillup with trivial combines :) )<br />
<br />
what effect sucess rate : SKILL and ONLY SKILL. +% items are effecting that too, changing your effective skill .... +% items are effecting only that and have no effect on skillup chances ( ie if u are 1 point under trivial and have a +% item , u will still have chance to skillup as the combine will not be considered trivial ( but the chances to sucess are over trivial )<br />
